This is a scrape of all the 1-star reviews Gen-Z left on the Trump App in the Apple Store that time,
just in case they ever disappear... Annndd they're gone.

- [First page only, on the Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430203917/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/official-trump-2020-app/id1135325440#see-all/reviews)

The data is stored as ~100Mb of JSON.

It needs to be put back together to be browsable as a mirror.
See the repo for a few partial attempts using Ember.js.
