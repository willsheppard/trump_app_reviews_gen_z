A very real 🦠 virus. 😱😱😱😱. We cannot trust it. It is not safe 🙅🏾\u200D♂️🙅🏾\u200D♂️. This virus is bringing very bad things with it. Things want to hurt America 🇱🇷. \n\nAlso it had very disturbing content  🤢 . Some kind of orange 🍊 potato 🥔 walrus 🦷🐋🦷hybrid monster👹🧟\u200D♂️🧟 with very tiny hands 🖐🏻🖐🏻 was the first thing I saw when I opened the app . It was disgusting 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. And terrifying😱😨😰!\n\n🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨ALERT🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨\n\nNow that I have your attention there is some very important things I would like to remind you of\n\nThe prison-industrial complex is a system situated at the intersection of government and private interests. It uses prisons as a solution to social, political, and economic problems. It includes human rights violations, the death penalty, slave labor, policing, courts, the media, political prisoners, and the elimination of dissent.\nthere are many major human rights violations occurring at the southern border. Latinx people are being treated as less than human and are being locked away in concentration camps. The media is avoiding the use of the term because of the strong historical context, but in actuality that is what they are. The people in these camps are facing rape, dirty and dangerous conditions, physical and mental abuse and many other terrible things. To all the HUMAN BEINGS who are being kept in cages like animals                                                  Te veo. Te escucho. Estoy luchando por ti.\nvoter oppression still exists. The United States government actively participated in the suppression of black and brown voices. It is a purposeful attempt to halt change. We need to remain aware and committed to fighting for legitimate change. Learn about policy and candidates.\nMost of your tax money goes towards funding and running military presence in other countries. The only reason we have military in this areas is as a fear tactic. We are a fascist police state.  \n\nThe revolution is here. We are fighting. We are growing. We are  everywhere. \n\nDown with the dictator.\n\nKeep fighting and always remember \n\nJesus looked like an Arab  \n\nRonald Reagan was the devil \n\nAnd the government was lying about 9/11\n\nYour obedient servant \n\nK.

Just like he did when he stopped workers from coming from south of the border. If ur not rich and white he hates. No respect for woman , he’s  raped woman. Trump also calls people names if they go against him or he fires them. He gets his friends out from prison. He steals money by lying to people . He has never once thought of others or had sympathy towards anyone how can he run the USA ? no compassion for humanity. We are the number one hot spot for COVID -19 how dumb can he be to tell humans to please don’t take the test because of there will be more people who have it.
