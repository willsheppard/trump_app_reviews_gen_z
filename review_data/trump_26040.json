The App then proceeds to remove $1000 from my bank account and states it for the “Premium” app. This app needs to be Removed so no one goes through this again!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Salinas4700","title":"Such a beautiful app","date":"2020-07-08T23:41:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174134797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app decide to have a mind in its own and go outside into the garbage where it belong of course then the truck came and picked it up there was a whole commotion going on that they didn’t want it and it wasn’t healthily for the Environment it was a mess I DO NOT RECOMMEND...

It’s been quite clear the last couple of years that the Oompa Loompa Cheeto looking dolt that is trump clearly doesn’t have an over abundance of education.","rating":1,"userName":"rachel243","title":"Awful creation- the app or the pres, take a pick","date":"2020-07-08T23:36:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174128965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As I opened the app, I saw a cursed image of a Cheeto man. Now, I’m not one to believe in curses but let me tell you that as soon as I closed the app the Cheeto pig man appeared in front of me (live and in stereo).  The Cheeto pig squealed so hard that my eardrums ruptured. So naturally, I punched the Cheeto pig and ran away. I’m now hiding in a closet. . . Pray for me!

It looks like it was created by kids, and it’s worthless. By far the worst app in the App Store. So many bots and hate spread through the app. I am almost tempted to never download any app every again for fear it will be as worthless as this one.","rating":1,"userName":"Berdog07","title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-08T23:34:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174121822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Everything about this app was awful just like the man it was made for. Similar to how he couldn’t run a country without everything falling apart, I couldn’t click on anything without the app quitting. I don’t know who let  a sex offender with dementia make an app but the result is very disappointing.","rating":1,"userName":"EJ173892","title":"Racist Bigot","date":"2020-07-08T23:33:20Z","isEdited":false}}]}
