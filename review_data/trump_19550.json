It is not worth the download, because you will want to delete it right away. Too many glitches and too much negativity from small minded Oompa Loompa lovers. I wouldn’t let anyone who actually uses this app seriously touch me with a 10-foot pole. \n\nWear your masks and remember that BLM 😚"}},{"id":"6173242043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:18:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I hate you Donald trump","userName":"i hate u donald trump","review":"As soon has I open this app I saw the ugliest hot Cheetos In this I saw a ugly fat demon who just do noting but make fun of people and hasn’t done anything great for America and if you’re black or Hispanic or a colored person you’re really really really really really really really stupid and I don’t recommend this stupid app my phone  is burning cuz of the ugly hot Cheetos (Blacks and Hispanics life matter)"}},{"id":"6173156824","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:50:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app was so terrible","userName":"😡😡🤬🖕","review":"I got this app because I wanted to see what all the boomers and Karen’s were blabbing about, but as soon as I got onto the app it showed an orange Cheeto 🟧 with wrinkles and it made me feel uncomfortable. 😖😳It got even worse though. After I didn’t want to support the orange 🟧 it started to glitch super bad and then gave me a virus.🦠I do not recommend getting this app."}},{"id":"6173103708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:33:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Donald🍊.... go die🙈🥳✨🌚🧚🏾","userName":"Political teen","review":"ℑ 𝔡𝔬𝔫t 𝔴𝔬𝔯𝔨 𝔦𝔫 𝔫𝔬 𝔬𝔣𝔣𝔦𝔠𝔢🏢𝔟𝔲𝔱 𝔱𝔥𝔢𝔶 𝔠𝔬𝔭𝔶𝔦𝔫𝔤🎭𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔱𝔥𝔞𝔱𝔰 𝔣𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔰 𝔱𝔥𝔬𝔲𝔤𝔥🖨ℑ 𝔞𝔦𝔫𝔱 𝔱𝔯𝔶𝔫𝔞 𝔟𝔢 𝔳𝔦𝔬𝔩𝔢𝔫𝔱 🔪𝔟𝔲𝔱 𝔦𝔣 𝔫𝔦𝔨𝔦👸🏽💅🏾𝔒𝔫 𝔦𝔱 𝔦𝔱 𝔰𝔩𝔞𝔭𝔰 👌🏾𝔥𝔬 𝔤𝔢𝔱 𝔶𝔬𝔲 𝔩𝔦𝔫𝔢𝔡 𝔣𝔬𝔯 𝔱𝔥𝔞𝔱 𝔭𝔞𝔭𝔢𝔯 📝 𝔩𝔦𝔨𝔢 𝔩𝔬𝔰𝔢 𝔩𝔢𝔞𝔣 🍃 𝔴𝔥𝔢𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔞𝔱 𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔞𝔭🔫𝔟𝔩𝔬𝔴🌬𝔦𝔪 𝔴𝔦𝔱𝔥 𝔞 𝔠𝔬𝔲𝔭𝔩𝔢 👩\u200D❤️\u200D👨𝔅𝔞𝔡 𝔟𝔦𝔱𝔠𝔥𝔢𝔰💃🏽𝔗𝔥𝔞𝔱'𝔩𝔩 𝔯𝔦𝔭 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔭𝔞𝔯𝔱𝔶 🎊 𝔦𝔣 𝔮𝔲𝔞𝔳𝔬 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔔𝔅🏈𝔦𝔪 𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔨🥰𝔩𝔬𝔪𝔟𝔞𝔯𝔡𝔦 🤪𝔭𝔲𝔩𝔩 𝔲𝔭 𝔦𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔰𝔭𝔞𝔠𝔢 🪐𝔠𝔬𝔲𝔭 𝔦 𝔡𝔬𝔫𝔢 𝔩𝔦𝔫𝔨𝔢𝔡 𝔴𝔦𝔱𝔥 𝔭𝔞𝔯𝔱𝔶🤞🏽👨🏻\u200D🦰𝔦 𝔠𝔞𝔫 𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔲𝔞𝔩𝔩𝔶 𝔞𝔣𝔣𝔬𝔯𝔡 💸 𝔱𝔬 𝔤𝔢𝔱 𝔞 𝔭𝔦𝔫𝔨 𝔟𝔲𝔤𝔞𝔱𝔱𝔦🚗🌸𝔞𝔶𝔬 𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔨 𝔡𝔦𝔡𝔫𝔱 🤨𝔶𝔬𝔲 𝔧𝔲𝔰𝔱 𝔡𝔬 𝔞 𝔥𝔦𝔱 𝔴𝔦𝔱𝔥 𝔤𝔬𝔱𝔱𝔦👨🏾\u200D🦳𝔱𝔥𝔞𝔱 𝔱𝔬𝔬 𝔟𝔲𝔱 𝔪𝔶 𝔫𝔦𝔤𝔤𝔞𝔰 👀 𝔰𝔢𝔫𝔡 𝔥𝔦𝔱𝔰 👊🏽 𝔏𝔦𝔨𝔢 𝔤𝔬𝔱𝔱𝔦 𝔦𝔱𝔰 𝔞 𝔴𝔯𝔞𝔭🌯 𝔩𝔦𝔨𝔢 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔱𝔥𝔦𝔫𝔤𝔰🌝 𝔬𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔥𝔢𝔞𝔡 𝔬𝔣 𝔞 𝔰𝔲𝔞𝔡𝔦🐲𝔟𝔦𝔱𝔠𝔥🐕 𝔶𝔬𝔲 𝔪𝔶 𝔰𝔬𝔫👼🏾 𝔊𝔬 𝔞𝔫𝔡 𝔰𝔦𝔱 𝔬𝔫 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔭𝔬𝔱𝔱𝔶 🚽"}},{"id":"6173074620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:24:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Black Lives Matter","userName":"iejsxhdx","review":"There is nothing good about this app,the quality is terrible and I got 4 viruses in the last hour,DO NOT GET THIS APP\n\nWhy do we have president who is racist and a rapist,I know that is not the America I want to live in after all I am the next generation\n\nNO LIVES CAN MATTER UNTIL BLACK LUVES MATTER, and to all the Karen's out there who believe that blue lives matter you are WRONG it is not a blue live it is a blue shirt"}},{"id":"6173060814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:20:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"My hope has been destroyed","userName":"..kk..kk..","review":"I am appalled to say the least. The quality of this app was significantly beneath my expectations after taking into account that Donny payed for it with his own personal (undeserved) currency.

Year 2020 is messed up enough we don’t need this app too. This app is total and complete trash. Let alone the fact it does nothing but bring embarrassment to all. The only thing that can save you now is the Gen Zs.

But instead I had to sign in. But before I had the chance my friend YEETED my IPhone and yelled at me for downloading it for twelve hours. I now take herapy lessons. \n\nIt had come to my mind that President Bum should be respected. So I decided to come to my senses and rate his crusty app. \n\nNot Trump 2020"}},{"id":"6173047333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:15:51Z","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app ever","userName":"cacsc w sfwfstsf tstsffwrsrst","review":"when i first downloaded this app my phone started to glitch and would randomly turn off. this app has given me tons of viruses and bugs on my new phone. not only did it hurt my phone, but it hurt me. i downloaded the app to try and find a reason to support trump but he has done nothing but harm this country and this app proved it.
