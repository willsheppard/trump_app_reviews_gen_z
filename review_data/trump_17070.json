TO. BEAT! Just purchased Lysol and bleach at probably the lowest prices we’ve ever seen in our great country. I’ve been told by hundreds of governors that this is probably, definitely, the best app they’ve seen. It’s a great app. You can see our approval ratings are almost 5 stars. If you’ve heard differently, then quite frankly.. FAKE NEWS! #TrumpForPrison #BLM","userName":"Blackmambarules","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:45:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE!

We spammed serial killers with fairy emojis 🧚🏼\u200D♀️ bullied a president, didn’t catch COVID and ATE cleaning supplies for FUN! Us millennials and gen Z are crazy we will get this app deleted and banished from EVERYWHERE but I do support the big orange Cheeto 🍊!oh btw also exposed and made from of the president trumps nudes!","userName":"okimdonetrying","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:23:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Vibe check"}},{"id":"6175692181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ten minutes after I downloaded it, I got a notification that I was adopted if I didn't vote for Trump. I ignored it, but an hour later, I got an email from the app saying it knew where I lived and would kill my family if I didn't vote for trump. Then I got a dead rat in the mail, and it said that would be my future if I didn't vote for trump. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","userName":"mtg🤡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:19:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I had to use a new phone to write this review"}},{"id":"6175631495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off it took 6 months to download the app because it collects personal data from your phone. The second it downloaded onto my phone I came down with a terrible case of aids. If that’s not bad enough the app told me to go back to my country after I stated that I was Latino American. All in all this is a terrible app and I do NOT recommend that anyone downloads this app!","userName":"johnny save🥴","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:57:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP"}},{"id":"6175616024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i can’t believe that this app is so appalling. immediately after opening the app, which took a whole year to actually download, i was met with an offensive image of presidental Trunk doing the white power pose. and not only this, it immediately asked me to track my location and now has hacked my entire phone. the FBI is now watching my every move.","userName":"Drummajorbandgeek:P","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:52:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"offensive imagery"}},{"id":"6175581407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and immediately had a bad experience. Not only did it take forever to load, but after I opened said app it asked me if it could send me notifications?! WHAT THE HELL!!!!! No Donny, I do not want any notifications that you and your minions send me. And the color scheme was very offensive. Blue, red, and white? Could you be any more in-original???? Anyway I hope Donald Trump Rots in hell!😊","userName":"Rose.TikTok.hey","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:39:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6175569915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Very disappointed! When I downloaded the app I thought it would be like any app. I was very wrong!! Sent me numerous notifications in just 5 minutes! Don’t get my started on how many notifications I got the entire day! The app makes in seem like it’s very easy to earn point but it is actually impossible. Did not get one useful text!","userName":"✨🙌🧚🏼\u200D♀️👄","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️❤️"}},{"id":"6175556950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded the app it asked if wanted to  enable my notifications, I responded with don’t allow, as I proceed in app later on on the day I found out it did send notifications  asking to vote for Trump. If I could rate this app a zero out of five stars I would, this is trespassing (breaking an entire) into my phone. I feel disrespected and don’t recommend this app.","userName":"dontworryaboutitsweethart!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:30:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6175501926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give this horrible app 0 stars I would!!!!
