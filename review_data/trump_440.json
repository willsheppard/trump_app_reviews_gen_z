About a week into it I noticed a new button had appeared on the app, I noticed when I downloaded the app it said age restricted material but I never expected this! The president’s nudes were displayed on this page! The horror made me throw up everything in my body which ended up sending me to the ER, they told me I was so dehydrated and starved because of how much I threw up, they made me delete the app, and I had to eat and get water injected into me for hours! I now have to go to therapy, it was so scarring my therapist said I might have to keep going for life! To this day I can’t get those horrible image out of my head, since the incident I’ve gotten a new phone but even then I’m so scared to use it. Not to mention he also refused to cover any of my medical bills or therapy bills from what happened, if I could rate 0 stars I would, this man is horrible and so is his app, thank you for your time 😔","userName":"toast 😃✨","date":"2020-07-09T16:17:33Z","title":"Not the moves 🖐","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176656127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"✨I don’t like donald trump and never will like him y’all can come for me all y’all want but i don’t understand why people are so racist just because of the color of someone’s skin color and because rumors about their society and stuff when WE ALL BLEED THE SAME BLOOD‼️ and yes i do believe in Black Lives Matter because black people are getting killed out in the streets and their homes more than anyone else in this world. I also believe in All Lives Matter bc all lives should matter no matter whats the color of your skin but innocent black people are out here getting killed for no reason. I also understand that not all people getting killed are black and i understand that but also remember if you look up how many black people have been killed in 2020 from in the streets or inside their homes there’s a whole list of people but if you look up the same things for white people there’s like a few people on there. What i’m trying to say here is everybody needs to give this app a one star so it can be taken down from the App Store✨😚✌🏾thx💕","userName":"cardi b1681","date":"2020-07-09T13:13:54Z","title":"THIS APP SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE APP STORE!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174149267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app ever. When opening the app I had a lot of orange coming out of the screen. It was very frightening for me. It wasn’t a pretty orange like a monarch butterfly but more of like a cone for caution 😡The color orange makes me get a lot of anxiety.I had to go to the doctors office because of this which was a bummer considering that there were too many people who have  covid  (which is a hoax) I felt as if though They were taking away my medical care. I also believe that there is a curse on this app. When I got home, there were so many cockroaches surrounding my car and then came the worst of all...My grandmother who is also a big Trump supporter came over and started calling my parents socialists. I then asked her if she got the app and she said yes. Which makes me believe that all of this witchcraft from this app has finally come down. When walking to my kitchen no one was in the house when all of A sudden a vase broke in my kitchen. Instead of this being a trump 2020 app, it is now a vase breaking service. I am extremely upset with this app. Do not get it.","userName":"Sleepy Too","date":"2020-07-08T23:43:35Z","title":"Awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173482176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely unacceptable! You would think that an app with connection to the president himself would be at the very least usable. Ever since I’ve downloaded the app, I have noticed that it has been going at an excruciatingly slow rate. Even when I asked to keep the notifications off, I was plagued with at the very least 50 notifications a day. If there were an option to rate this app 0 stars I would do just that. Not only is it horribly slow and at times very annoying to deal with, on one particular occasion there must have been a slip up because I clicked on a notification and was presented with some VERY provocative pictures of the president. The picture was taken down within 10 minutes. The fact of the matter is, such slip ups are absolutely unacceptable and should not be swept under the rug. This among other things have led me to write this review. No one should have to deal with such incompetence when presented with in app directly tied to the president. I honestly expected more from both the President and his administration.","userName":"becmmmmmmm","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:55Z","title":"Do not download!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172678406","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app with my homies for a laugh but now I understand that was the biggest mistake of my life. As soon as I opened this app, I noticed changes. My skin color started looking more orange than normal. Wrinkles started to form on my face. My hair started thinning. My voice started to change....But i shook it all off. “Maybe I’ve been drugged!” I thought. The morning after downloading this app, I got out of bed and went downstairs for my normal everyday breakfast: a raw egg and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s “Stephen Colbert’s AmeriCone Dream” when my family begins screaming at me, and dousing me with holy water. I’m incredibly confused and terrified, but then I remember what I was noticing yesterday. I ran as fast as I could to my bathroom mirror, and discovered that I had COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED INTO DONALD TRUMP. I explained to my family what happened, and they suggested I delete the app to see if it would reverse the effects. Turns out, it did. I BEG YOU, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. You will turn into Donald Trump. I was able to reverse the effects and turn back to normal, but that might have just been dumb luck. DONT TAKE THE RISK.","userName":"Boi127974829472","date":"2020-07-08T15:26:01Z","title":"TURNED ME INTO DONALD TRUMP🤬😤","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177131767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"It wouldn’t even LOAD. I HAD TO DOWNLOAD THIS 10 TIMES BEFORE IT EVEN ACTUALLY LOADED. AND WHEN IT FINALLY DID OPEN IT CRASHED AGAIN! I COULD BARELY KEEP IT OPEN FOR A SECOND BEFORE IT KICKED ME OUT. And I don’t know if this app is selling my information but I’ve been receiving some very threatening emails and phonecalls after downloading this app. I used to trust President Trump... but If his app is selling my information I cannot vote for him again. WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP SELL HIS SUPPORTERS INFORMATION. A lot of the emails I’ve received were in RUSSIAN. Sometimes the app itself changes its language and all the text shows up as RUSSIAN. Why is it doing this??? Are Russians hacking me through this app??? WHY WOULD TRUMP LET RUSSIANS HACK HIS SUPPORTERS. I feel unsafe using this app and I will sadly not be voting for trump because he is selling my information to Russians. There is no good reason for these people to be getting my information and HARASSING ME. This app was awful awful awful and I wish I could give it a ZERO STAR REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS AWFUL. I thought trump loved America!!! He clearly does not because he is selling American information to Russians.","userName":"KILEYH-123","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:44Z","title":"THE MOST TERRIBLE APP EVER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176662518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"so basically o downloaded the app like a normal person and guess what. i was doing the stuff and everything.. and all of a sudden my phone started wiggling and then little white WINGS cake out of the sides and i started crying😿😿😿😿😿 because what the heck✨🧚🏻😾👁👁 and then! my phone slapped me with the wings so i asked my phone why it was doing this to me and it said because i have the trump app so i went upstairs and cried EVEN MORE!!!!😿🧚🏻😾✨👁👄👁 then the next day i came downstairs to eat breakfast and i saw a note from my phone that said it was flying away forever🙀🙀🙀🙀😿😿😿😿😾😾😾😾 and i was like NOOOOOO❤️ and then i cried alot and i went outside and i saw my phone flying away:( so i had to write this review from my sisters phone because my phone ran away 🥀🧚🏻 if anyone sees a flying phone with a purple case and a lockscreen of noah schnapp PLEASE PLEASE return it to me i’m so worried pls help. overall, DO.

Immediately after I downloaded it my phone started glitching like crazy. Every time I would make a call, I hear a beep that sounded like a voicemail beep when the other line answered, if it was a voicemail, I’d hear two beeps. I thought I just needed a new phone but when I looked it up it said that my phone had most likely been TAPPED! further, the red microphone icon would show up indicating that my mic was on and someone was listening to me. Took my phone to the genius bar after I begrudgingly wore my mask to the apple store and they said my phone had indeed been hacked. This all happened after I downloaded the app. To test it, I downloaded it on my iPod touch (which I don’t use anymore) to make sure it was a coincidence. IT WAS NOT! THIS APP IS STEALING YOUR INFO AND SPYING ON YOU. For shame Mr. Trump. I TRUSTED YOU. This is something China would pull on their citizens, NOT THE FREEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. I am truly horrified. My family and I no longer support and neither should you. TRUMP IS A COMMUNIST SPY!!!!!","userName":"kekalzjnew","date":"2020-07-09T07:50:26Z","title":"can no longer support VERY SCARED","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175441549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I opened the app like usual. It’s even part of my daily routine! I was a happy camper looking at our great cinnamon orange pig president! It wasn’t till after I closed the app that very scary things started happening with all devices in my home... my Alexa started playing trump speeches that made my ears nearly BLEED! My phone also glitched very often. At least 5 times within the hour! Each time it glitched it showed a picture of an eagle but it looked a lot like the nazi symbol?! It scared me half to death! I then opened the app back up to see if it was something that could be fixed, but when I opened it, I was bombarded with horrendous pictures of our Cheeto man NAKED getting a spray tan(way too orange) and his micro Pepe was showing! It then flashed to a picture of him looking like a sweaty pig with dinosaurs arms?! I was appalled! When I closed the app I was so deeply distraught that I had to speak to a professional and it caused me, my pet rhino, AND EVEN THE DROWNING FISH emotional trauma! I highly don’t recommend this app! I wouldn’t wish what I experienced on anyone, but the Cheeto himself!","userName":"the100boss","date":"2020-07-09T06:45:41Z","title":"Terrible experience and dangerous","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175310051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"as i was eating a bowl\nof cockroaches and stroking my Iguana while watching bob ross and listening to katy perry i came a cross this app. I said ooo look jim to my iguana as i clicked on this app. now me being the 23 year old i am thought now if i get this app maybe just maybe i could come across so reasons on why to vote for this ugly pedo orange i downloaded the app. it took about 20 seconds to download thanks to my new high speed internet. and i at that moment i started my journey as a trump app down loader. i views  app and looked through it for about 3 seconds  then  i realized no there is no good reason to vote for this pedo orange so i exited the app and out of relive i stood up and picked my iguana up and swung him around until i head a massive BANG i looked down and was like FUDGE JIMBO MY COCKROACHES and as i yelled they crawled away, and went back to there little homes in which i gather them from in the early morning to feast on. well anyway this app is absolutely trash don’t get it or you might just accidentally get brain washed and drop your cockroach’s like i did. no jim’s where harmed ❤️✨😌","userName":"onion farts","date":"2020-07-09T05:55:11Z","title":"no oranges for me 🍊 ✨🥰","isEdited":false}}]}
