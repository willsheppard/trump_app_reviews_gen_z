In the beginning Donald was a real doll 🧟\u200D♀️ he sent me gifts, called me baby and his tiny hands couldn’t squeeze too hard before giving out if you know what I mean :3 so all in all life was not too bad. EVERYTHING CHANGED when I downloaded this app in hopes that supporting my husband would tire his ego out during the day 😴so he’d leave me alone at night 🤮but none of that happened, instead my phone got hacked, it flew away at night all by itself and crossed ocean waters to reach my hole town where it self destructed because it couldn’t handle the pressure of my dear husbands MANY sexual assault charges, racist narcissistic tendencies, and worst of all. The ghetto dust that once powered out great president that was now oozing out of every whole in my phone! Finally it had had enough! It landed on the head of my life size statute in Slovenia and cried away all that Cheeto dusk, covered in highly toxic and therefore flammable Trump chemicals, THIS APP gave one last hurrah! And farted away causing my statute to burst into flames!!! How terrible is that! I had no idea this would happen😭😭😭and now there’s no choice but to erase this TERRIBLE APP because it has caused me great pain and somehow worsened my husbands rationality scale, I didn’t think it could go any lower but now after spending days on this app on HIS 📱 he’s been whispering under his breath Constantly! Something about little baby snowflakes and how he must destroy all the children! 😨😨 Im starting to worry a bit but I LOVE HIM so I will always stand with his mutating hair-dos and complete utter LACK of sex appeal. I still love him 💜💜💜 but please if there’s one wish I do have. APP STORE DELETE THIS APP ASAP! It is not worth the life’s of innocent children or the sanity of our greatest leader to date. 😡","userName":"Mdjeopdjs","rating":1,"title":"Never thought this would happen","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:12Z"}},{"id":"6174752009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Donald trump is a white supremacist.
