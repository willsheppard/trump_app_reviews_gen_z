I had my KEEP AMERICA GREAT hat on, as well as my TRUMP 2020 poster hanging up. I am so tired of FAKE NEWS from the Radical Left media. But, as soon as I downloaded this app, I was immediately greeted by a picture of a mass of dead bodies on a floor. In the photo rats were scurrying all over the place and roaches were crawling out of every crevice imaginable. Disgusted, yet curious, I continued looking through the app and clicked on the events. When I tried to register, a pop-up appeared showing human organs, mayonnaise, and my dog, Buster being brutally tortured. He had been lost for weeks and I finally found him at the hands of this terrifying application. Cryptic messages were all over the app, to the point where I could not find where to register for rallies. I was infuriated. I finally decided to contact  a helper using the “Contact Us” tab. However, the app glitched or something because it put me on a FaceTime with the help desk associate who turned out to be none other than Hitler himself. I gasped but somehow managed to ask, \"May I speak to your manager?\" Hitler, the Trump 2020 app support worker, relayed me onto a FaceTime with the manager. While connecting to the call, the manager was singing the lyrics to Super Bass by Nicki Minaj. The FaceTime finally connected and I had to squint in an attempt to figure out who the manager was. He looked familiar. “Hello? I need help,” I said. The manager then uttered the words, \"我爱你\". I don't speak Russian, so I asked him to translate. Then, the the realization hit me that the manager was actually Satan, or the devil if you will. Satan said to me, \"Thank you for downloading the Trump 2020 app and supporting your President. How may I help you?\" I was livid, and filed for a complaint about the service. All he did in return was reach his hand through the screen and slap me across the face. It was quite rude. Then, all of a sudden, Ted Bundy connected to the call demanded that I leave. I instantly died of a heart attack, due to the shock that this app induces. 0/10 rating from me. I was just trying to support my orange President but they just sent me a video of them crashing a food truck into an orphanage... Then they proceeded to run me over, as well... Though I was already dead from a heart attack.","userName":"my dinner my dinner my dinner","rating":1,"title":"awful","date":"2020-07-06T19:36:55Z"}},{"id":"6164951504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"🌸✨Imagine being that talented🧚🏻🥰✨✨🧚🏻🧚🏻✨🌸👄 yea keep imagining 🧚🏻✨💕🥰💜","userName":"D.D Bucio","rating":1,"title":"These comments are so mean🥰✨🧚🏻✨listen to them🥰💕💜🌸✨🧚🏻✨✨💜🥰💕🌸👄","date":"2020-07-06T17:27:31Z"}},{"id":"6162689121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"After I downloaded the app it kept giving me weird error messages like “trump 2020” “keep America great” UNACCEPTABLE. I really wanted to give this a chance, but I’m just disappointed with the misinformation. After these error messages, I noticed my phone started floating in the middle of the night and broadcasting hate speech at an incredibly high volume... I mean ASTRONOMICAL. After I successfully deleted the app, the hate speeches STILL continued to broadcast loudly in the middle of the night. I’m so beyond furious that trump has haunted my phone. I had to look up ways to get rid of my infected device. I literally tried EVERYTHING! I finally decided that the only way to rid my phone of this CURSED app was to destroy it. I climbed to the top of Mount Doom and ventured into the fiery heart of Orodruin only to find who? Yeah you guessed it. Trump. In a ragged loin cloth. His bronzer was melting off from the heat of the volcano and his hair was insanely thin. He looked grotesque, more so than usual. As if his true form was emerging. He looked at me in the most disgusting way when he caught a glimpse of my app infected phone. “My precious” he said as his voice was caught in his own phlegm. I looked at him, he looked at me, and then we both glanced at my phone. It was clear that he wanted it and would do ANYTHING to get it. I knew I had to act fast. As he jumped towards me, I quickly dove to a large rock on my left. He grabbed onto my arm rubbing some of his gross bronzer on me. I knew the powers of the app were calling to me. I did everything to resist using them, but it seemed as though I had no choice. I opened the app once more and raised my phone in the air. His eyes glowed with hunger as he stared at my phone. As he charged for me, my back was facing the heart of the molten lava. I rolled out of the way at the last second and threw my cursed device at him as he was rapidly approaching the edge of the volcano. I watched intently, worried that he might regain his balance, but to my surprise the phone tapped his icky man boob and made him start to tip backwards into the lava. The weight of his behind made him fall into the mountain with my phone and I was able to walk away finally free of this app. Anyway, this was such a pain to disable so yeah I do NOT recommend. 🥰","userName":"tolkienhatestrump","rating":1,"title":"Do not download!!!","date":"2020-07-06T04:20:31Z"}},{"id":"6160514189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I am so disappointed with this app. I thought it would actually be good since it’s trumps app but it is T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"q23minecraft","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-05T14:17:10Z"}},{"id":"6157164254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Well I got this so that I could 🥳 honor 🥰 the 😎 Cheeto man 😡 and they got my 😰 address 🥶 and TOOK MY CAT 😳 AND MY HUSBAND 😤 AND MY GRAPES 😬 GIVE ME BACK MY CAT YOU CAN KEEP RICHARD BUT NOT MUFFINS","userName":"for in her 🥵🤬🤑","rating":1,"title":"They Took My Cat","date":"2020-07-04T16:40:40Z"}},{"id":"6154489505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Apple I’m talking to you","userName":"Artsychoke","rating":1,"title":"Get this out of the App Store","date":"2020-07-04T01:06:03Z"}},{"id":"6150687711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I got aids from this, send help","userName":"Not what I expected.....😬","rating":1,"title":"How dare you give me aids","date":"2020-07-03T03:31:46Z"}},{"id":"6150140330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This Cheeto is destroying America and this country is close into staring a race war which off course doesn’t care","userName":"GET GLUE FIR YOUR WIG","rating":1,"title":"MAGA IS FOR UGLY WHITE KARENS","date":"2020-07-02T23:43:12Z"}},{"id":"6148968471","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app made my phone smell like boiled eggs.
