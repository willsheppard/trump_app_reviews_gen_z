After it was downloaded I turned on the notifications because I want to stay up to date with our president's campaign. I was sent multiple notifications of nonsense and I as an English wasn't even able to decipher them. This is a terrible app and should be taken down IMMEDIATELY!!!!!! The Trump administration should know better!!!","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"Taaayyylllor","date":"2020-07-09T07:29:45Z"}},{"id":"6175505491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app ruined my life I got night mares and when I close my eyes I see a orange tan man in then middle of my room looking at me like \n👁👄👁 but first of all when I opened the app I saw horrifying photos of a Cheeto working out.

HOWEVER as soon as the app was downloaded it deleted all my pictures, swiped my contacts, and quickly like our President started violating a women’s right to privacy!! I was beyond fuming! And to top it all off it deleted candy crush off my phone on level 666 and I must start at square one. Disappointed. A shame.","rating":1,"title":"Disgusted. Betrayed.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s what it says! So I think to myself, if America is great, the president shouldn’t be the king of racists, isn’t that right? Well, after I downloaded the app, I turned on the news, and lo and behold, Donald Trump is the president! I don’t understand why this app lies, and I want a refund. I spent a good thirty minutes trying to figure out how to download this application and I want my time back.","rating":1,"title":"IT DOESN’T DO WHAT IT SAYS!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"guy with name 2","date":"2020-07-09T06:22:35Z"}},{"id":"6175308063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give this app zero stars I would! DON’T download this app, it’s a scam! It took 83 weeks to download and after it finally downloaded it asked for my social security number and my personal information! I downloaded this app because I wanted to find a non racist, non homophobic, non sexist platform but instead got bombarded with horrible claims from Trump and his administration! Vile things are said against women and non white people! This APP IS HORRIBLE! It’s awful!","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"JessandNickMiller","date":"2020-07-09T05:54:26Z"}},{"id":"6175239257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this I instantly got a massive headache which immediately set me into a trance, drooling and mumbling “tRuMp2020”. I am a woman so obviously not a trump supporter but wanted to extend my education and learn what his psychopathic white nationalist supporters hear every day. This experience was more terrifying than I could even imagine. People on this app are terrorists and nothing short of nazis. This app is garbage- it spreads heinous lies about what is going on with our fascist president. Duh","rating":1,"title":"One star is generous🤢🤢🤢","isEdited":false,"userName":"manny_fucks","date":"2020-07-09T05:27:29Z"}},{"id":"6175165851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The second I opened this app, my skin started sizzling and when I looked up, I looked like a TRAFFIC CONE. It also seems to have affected my ability to form coherent sentences and I have the urge to give an unintelligible yet divisive speech. In addition to these side effects, this app is slow, glitchy, seems to be processing false inputs, and has undone every bit of progress I’ve made over the last several updates. I will not be reinstalling it.","rating":1,"title":"SAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"LoganLermanFan#1","date":"2020-07-09T05:01:10Z"}},{"id":"6175151430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My phone worked perfectly fine before I downloaded this app. After downloading it my phone was glitching, shutting on and off, notifications were repeating in an off matter and were even disappearing. I deleted the app shortly after to see if they would change anything since that was the only recent change to my phone and guess what?? My phone was fixed. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!","rating":1,"title":"Do NOT download!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"diya30456","date":"2020-07-09T04:56:13Z"}}]}
