As I explored the app, filled with pictures depicting my supreme leader, flailing his delicate hands through the air, I was very contempt. Later that day, I started to sense something was off. Like the other reviewers had insinuated, my dog began acting a bit differently. Of course, this was not my biggest concern as I believe Mr. Trump sold the information I had given to the app to TELEMARKETERS. Awful commies those lot are! Just as I finished telling that piece of trash on the phone what I thought of his call, the animals of the house, including my children, formed a circle around me. My dogs stood on their hind legs and my children gripped paws and hands together, ensuring that I was trapped in the center. They started chanting “Trump 2020” (yes even the dogs) and their devil eyes grew large and blank. That’s when I knew that they were possessed by the spawn of Satan. \nAs I began to hyperventilate, I caught a whiff of sulfur passing through the air. Suddenly, my living room was an inferno. The house appliances began to levitate. Forming the outermost ring of the circle, the appliances danced about, taunting me by wilting left and right. To my horror, flames licked the edge of the living room door. As the flames grew high and ventured further towards me, I contemplated the review I would leave. Alas, neither my house, nor I survived the fire. \nDespite being six feet under, might I just say that: no, I can no longer stand by this app nor this orange man again, for I know he has struck a deal with the Devil and the communists! Much to my sorrow, I’m afraid I will never be able to view Cheetos the same way again!"}},{"id":"6172583988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad  this is really bad","userName":"Lillianna bacchus","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:59:35Z","review":"It made my iPad glitch and I hate it bye bye"}},{"id":"6172530061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","userName":"hes horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:44:33Z","review":"Peridot, that’s all I have to say."}},{"id":"6172529810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful","userName":"general kat","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:44:29Z","review":"It’s so bad and I hate it"}},{"id":"6172524133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"they can’t get rid of us","userName":"official_tiktok","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:42:52Z","review":"if you’re going to get rid of our app tiktok, we’re going to get rid of yours."}},{"id":"6172496371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is absolutely disgusting 🤢🤢🤢","userName":"Nataliek1010","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:35:01Z","review":"While on the app I was harassed and this was unexpected disgusting"}},{"id":"6172491214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"disgusting","userName":"i just need a name jsdhsjuss","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:33:35Z","review":"this app is horrible my grandpa had a seizure looking at it and now he’s in intensive care see what u did u big fat orange"}},{"id":"6172464032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Yea so","userName":"Karo71106101","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:26:18Z","review":"This is very confusing to my human mind."}},{"id":"6172457480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"💞🧚🏼\u200D♂️HONEYY NOOOO 🥱✨","userName":"Yogini Hughut","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:24:33Z","review":"after downloading a tracker was put on my phone. and a cheeto snuck into my house and attempted to eat me. like REALLY BRUHHHH. 🤢"}}]}
