Do not be so sheeple and ignorant!! Don’t download this app!","date":"2020-07-08T20:43:32Z","userName":"$4!8283737838!idkenvee"}},{"id":"6173659119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Wow","rating":1,"review":"This app is terrible. It took 2 whole days to download and once it finally did it gave my phone a virus. It also stated singing all about that base by Megan train or and said what glue mr president uses for his wig. All I want was a good trump app and we got this. I don’t think that the president should put the 3D effect on literal cockroaches came crawling out of my phone and all over my backyard. You should fix that. Over all this is the worst app ever and this app should be banned instead of Tiktok.","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:29Z","userName":"maty.0000"}},{"id":"6173647886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Very bad, many problems","rating":1,"review":"This app is riddled with glitches and problems. I’m sure there were tremendous people involved in the development of this app, but they need to continue working. My phone crashed multiple times upon the startup of this app. Just trying to follow Donald Trump campaign, and suddenly I’m getting texts from this group called the CCP? Anyone know what that stands for??? This app should be taken down from the App Store as it needs more time in development.","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:30Z","userName":"123456dnskchajcuwvfj"}},{"id":"6173614781","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Extremely disappointed","rating":1,"review":"This has got to be the worst app in the entire App Store!!!!!it took 6 hours to download. Not only that the whole time it was downloading my phone was glitching. You would think for such a hyped app that things would be better.

The reason I heated this app is Bc my phone had an uncomfortable amount of orange man with swollen eyes, and a horrible wig.
