When all of the sudden a stampede of animals teleported out of my phone and trampled my husband( he is now in the hospital recovering from this tragic act) as the stampede continued Willy wonkas umpa lumpas started to dance around me and poop out chocolate on my $500,000 carpet . I then proceed to watch in horror as the devil himself rose from my floor and started chanting at me “ trump shall die” over and over. I got in my car and looked in the mirror, saw my dead grandma, and then I had a heart attack.😞🖐🏽","userName":"Kyley Gadouas","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app made me have a heart attack","rating":1}},{"id":"6173753267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hated the app. It glitched waaayyyy to much. It also kept on spamming me with the stupid text message stuff. No joke, my texts were filled with VOTE TRUMP 2020. It was annoying. Really annoying. I couldn’t even find my last text message from a real person. And the ads kept on showing up on YouTube. The ads were like 5 minutes long. I’m sorry, but there is no good reason to vote for trump. And there is no good reason to buy this stupid app. A bunch of Orange people also came outside of my house and yelled at me to vote for the orange king. I said no❤️","userName":"gt10101010","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TOO GLITCHY FOR A BAD CAUSE","rating":1}},{"id":"6173752098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Poop President","userName":"Heyheyman76","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Poop","rating":1}},{"id":"6173751964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so bad that I almost died it took 738393039 days to download and I was being tracked I opened the app and I got blinded 😡😡😡😡😡","userName":"ewksjdbd","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever I couldn’t take one breath","rating":1}},{"id":"6173751938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"All I wanted to do is show respect for president orange🟠😪but when I downloaded it.its says vote for trump 2020 or not your going to have a horrible dream forever!i didnt think much of it but when I went to bed I had   a dream about that president orange was attacking me with oranges😓","userName":"alex-55!","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible scary app","rating":1}},{"id":"6173751840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app when I first started downloading it, it caused major problems, it dropped my battery from 100 to 1 in 3 secs.
