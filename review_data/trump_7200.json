I noticed that things would go missing replaced with small Trump 2020 stickers. I thought nothing of it at first but as the days went on more import things went missing. Like my dog and grandma.

He died awhile ago and we can’t elect a dead guy for president."}},{"id":"6177551244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"An ugly cheeto🌸🦋✨❤️🌸","rating":1,"userName":"9ikelly","date":"2020-07-09T17:23:12Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is terrible once I download it there was a big Cheeto on the screen and I don’t like Cheetos I like hot Cheetos when I was taking my pet dinosaurs to the pet shop he tried to eat my phone because there was a big Cheeto on the screen i don’t want to see a giant one on the screen and also this app crash’s a lot I think that Apple should take this app off of the Apple store and because this app is already at 1.2 stars It should be DELETED and taken off the Apple store and never come back TRUMP 2020 But on a gravestone✨"}},{"id":"6177548961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely TERRIBLE","rating":1,"userName":"coolbooiiil","date":"2020-07-09T17:22:29Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is so bad. not only has it been crashing on me it deals with a racist , ignorant pig. it is the worst app i have ever come across to. i can not explain or put into words how scary and bad this app is. it crashes on me ALL THE TIME. it keeps going in and out and sometimes i feel like they’re watching me. i hear voices through the app too , and donald trump the worst to ever exist has his face all over the app. definitely a ONE STAR. please delete this right away, i can’t have my kids see this app ever again 🥰🤢"}},{"id":"6177521103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬😡😾😾😾😾😾😾😾","rating":1,"userName":"urmom 69420","date":"2020-07-09T17:13:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"ok so first off when i fist downloaded this app it completely shut down my phone then after like an hour of having it the government hacked my phone and tracked me then the stole my baby brother out of his crib and took him to the white house and did scientific experiments on him then we found him took him back and then THIS APP blow up my phone and then i had to get a new phone which i’m a little short on money so that was NOT a good thing anyways this app is horrible and you should NEVER get it 🧚😾😾😾🤬🤬🤬🤬💫💫💫"}},{"id":"6177393369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WHY","rating":1,"userName":"ModTea","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:36Z","isEdited":false,"review":"For the next 30 minutes after opening the app, little trumps ran around the screen and wouldn’t let me click on any other apps.
