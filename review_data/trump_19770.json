Even after you close the app it buzzes and flashes uncontrollably until you lock it in a box for 14 hours. Would not recommend for any one and advise the Trump team to fix these glitches because I am not happy with it.","userName":"idfjvoairjgeakrgjal'","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:34Z","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely stupid","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174812408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After a five hour wait for this app to finish downloading plus an extra two hour update, the app proceeded emit a high-pitch frequency that has turned my sweet chihuahua ( luv u Monty😊❤️)  into a feral animal that has ravaged my couches and any ankle that dares to come near him.

It should not be an app at all like why what can you even do in this app maybe get rude of this app and keep Tik TOK because it’s shutting down. But having this will take away your virginity and it’s social suicide. Even having the app. Don’t have it DELETE IT RIGHT AWAY ITS TRASH. Because not many people want trump for 2020 so why make an app.","userName":"andbettyandjughead","date":"2020-07-09T03:07:03Z","rating":1,"title":"Riverdale is the best","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174789655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After downloading this app it glitched my phone and gave me 7 STDs. The STDs were viruses on the phone that transferred from the app to me. All of my 862 girlfriends went through the same thing. We can’t stop itching and it burns. It’s a curse app. It also hypnotized a chameleon to come and r@pe me and it stuck it’s tongue in my butthole and came out my mouth. It felt good but that’s not the point.","userName":"DinoChcknNggts","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:12Z","rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174787113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app immediately asked to send me notifications and asked for all my personal information! I couldn’t use the app without disclosing my information. Seems like they just want my contact info to spam me with notifications, ads, emails and texts! Probably to sell it!!

AND after that it caught my curtains on fire which led to the burning of my house, leaving my 57 Russian nesting dolls to burn into oblivion. They were the last things my mother left me before  she got killed by a raccoon a seldom 30 years ago.... this is all your fault Trump. You destroyed my dead mother.

Once I made my way through the wall I was greeted with a tiny baby carrot attached to a very overweight 70 year old white man yelling about teenagers on TikTok. He screamed and moaned about women absolutely loving him while his buddy Epstein winked behind him. Never felt more disgusted in my life!","userName":"VivPay123","date":"2020-07-09T03:00:52Z","rating":1,"title":"Literal worst app EVER!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174770064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Immediately as I downloaded the app, my phone was glitching so much that it caused my phone to basically overload and explode. My family is very disappointed that this dangerous app continues to be downloadable because anyone who tries to use this will potentially have to buy a new phone!! I had to use my grandma’s phone to write this review. REMOVE THIS APP NOW!😡😡","userName":"christian hunter deer","date":"2020-07-09T02:58:11Z","rating":1,"title":"NEEDS TO BE REMOVED","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174763838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support my favorite political tangerine but as soon as I opened the app for the first time a large man claiming to work for the White House kicked in my front door and proceeded to beat my 90 year old grandmother in front of my very eyes. Terrible experience. I do not recommend downloading this app unless you really hate your nearest relative.","userName":"Allie_Cat_","date":"2020-07-09T02:56:18Z","rating":1,"title":"Awful","isEdited":false}}]}
