I WOULDNT GET this app unless you want glitches on your phone. You would think Trump being a successful businessman would have a better app! Plus the app asks you a lot of information about where you live and what you do! Talk about a security concern! Definitely a waste of my time! \n1/5","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:41:32Z","title":"Trash","userName":"Had dcgsx","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178576291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app in hopes of purifying my liberal actions. Actually caring about other people got so exhausting, so I decided I would try joining trumps cult of idiots who have worms for brains. The app took 69 hours to download (which I spent trying to manifest my brain to turn into worms for the full experience.) I was expecting to instantly become a white supremacist but I’m still an educated atheist liberal....disappointing! Don’t download this app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:14:12Z","title":"Shawdy like a melody in my head","userName":"ConradTheCat","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178540371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of better understanding the president. Instead all I found was disturbing images of a rotten Cheeto screaming propaganda. I felt a sharp pain fill my stomach, I was rushed to the emergency room only to be diagnosed with stage ten liver cancer. I’ve been given 10 minutes to live and I’m using it to write this review, do not install this app or vote for trump. He is toxic and disgusting. Now if you’ll excuse me I am going to pass away.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:00:13Z","title":"This app gave me cancer","userName":"trump_can_choke","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178517959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"WOW. I got the Trump 2020 app to stay informed but the first red flag about this app is that it took 2 DAYS to download It took up so much storage on my phone that I had to delete half of my apps and when I actually went to open the app a bunch of ads popped up and then trumps voice started violently screaming. “Trump 2020!, Trump 2020! Trump 2020!” And even when I closed the app I still kept playing at it eventually busted the speakers on my phone! Unbelievable!!!!!!! DONT GET THIS APP!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:51:19Z","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTED!","userName":"ally202711","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178505579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app in the hopes of getting so lovely trump apparel, when it started to glitch my phone out. I though nothing of it which was the biggest mistake. First, it was the glitching of my phone, then the horrid fairy emojis flooded my phone. Endless notifications harassing me every minute. I had to get rid of my phone and I blame this stupid app. Please I beg that no one make the same mistake as I did.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:46:22Z","title":"Ugh do not download will ruin your life","userName":"egyptella","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178473648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app to see what Trump had in store for the new election. The news is filled with stories on COVID19. It worked fine for a couple of days but then it started glitching. I thought it was just my phone so I powered it off and tried again. It didn’t work. Then I deleted and reinstalled the app. It has been glitching and freezing constantly. I really hope you can fix this. 🇺🇸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:33:39Z","title":"glitchy","userName":"Nunu.99/14","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178394106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app because i thought it was going to be nice and all but as i soon as i opened the app i was greeted by a cheeto?! 🙀 i immediately went to the toilet to throw up because of what i just saw. then all of a sudden i heard a knock on my door. who could it be you ask?
