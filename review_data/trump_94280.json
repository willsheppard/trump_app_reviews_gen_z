But this app DESTROYED my phone! 📱 It’s so broken I had to write this review with my IPOD from freaking TWENTY YEARS AGO. NOT COOL!\n\n So this one day I was walking through my neighborhood park, when all of a sudden I heard GUY FIERI yelling something about his new zesty hot sauce 🌶. So like any patriotic American would do in that situation, I naturally downloaded the TRUMP 2020 campaign app 🇺🇸. Let me tell you, it was the WORST decision of my LIFE. IMMEDIATELY upon downloading this app, which took NO LESS than 420 FREAKING HOURS, I saw the president’s beautiful 🍊orange🍊self and my phone📱then began to develop SEVERE flu-like symptoms 🦠. Not only that, but it opened Netflix and began skipping through various scenes of Orange 🍊 is the New Black at 2.25x speed. Then this message popped up saying your phone has the Novel Coronavirus 🦠, please list your social security number right here. So, like what anyone with ANY common sense would do, I gave it my social security number in hopes it would magically fix my phone. Needless to say IT DID NOT!!! Some random person with a thick Chinese🇨🇳 accent began blaring through my phone speakers 🔊 something along the lines of, “your phone has COVID-19, 🦠 please distance from it and quarantine it by itself in its own room for a minimum of a two week period.” But it was too late. Everyone in my family had already contracted it. I SWEAR THIS STUPID APP!! Now my ENTIRE FAMILY has Covid-19, and I can’t even use my phone!! In pure anger and disgust, I compulsively RAN back to my neighborhood park, but I didn’t even make it that far! Before I could make it to the nearest hot sauce stand, my phone started blaring “Tik-Tok” by Ke$ha SO LOUDLY that the speakers 🔥SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED🔥. My phone was COMPLETELY DESTROYED! Acting quickly, I picked up the ashes left over of my beloved iPhone 11,  VIOLENTLY threw them at Guy Fieri, told him to stick my phone’s remains in his latest hot sauce📱🌶, and angrily marched back up to my apartment. SOME CAMPAIGN APP, HUH. Absolutely and utterly dismayed. 👎0/10👎.","title":"🦠 GAVE MY PHONE COVID-19!!!! 🦠","isEdited":false,"userName":"Travelaska"}},{"id":"6178943972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:34:56Z","review":"He raped my daughter","title":"Trump took my daughter","isEdited":false,"userName":"squidwardcanrapemeanynight"}},{"id":"6178916907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:25:02Z","review":"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER!!!
