As soon as I downloaded it my phone started to shake and vibrate and smoke out of the headphone jack. Then a voice came out of the speaker and said really loudly “SINCE U BOUHHT THE APP AND SUPPORT THE CHEETO BUNKER BOY, YOU ARE RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC AND WILL GET 7 YEARS OF BAD LUCK UNLESS YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN.” But it’s totally fine because #settleforbiden. I decided to educate myself after this so I looked and researched trump and found out he has 55 rape allegations and one from his daughter!!! He also has said DISGUSTING things about women and is racist towards mainly black and now Asian people. I also won’t forget about how he said in order to have less cases of corona we should test less people. OH and how he told us to inject ourselves with bleach ofc. Anyway Im educated now and if your looking to vote for this excuse of a man, you should edjucate yourself as well❤️","userName":"Talia❤️❤️🥰","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175624977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:55:31Z","title":"Bro this app took my data away","review":"So I was minding my own business until this app magically took my data 😔!

I may never be able to mentally recover from the trama this image gave me. Then after crying for hours because of that horrific picture, I then received a prompt to access my camera roll TO INSERT THE IMAGE MY CAMERA ROLL. Not only that but it was trying to download all of my images and videos to send to the creator of this app who I think is that man. He does not deserve to see the sacred TIkTok videos I have saved. After canceling it showed me another picture of this man whom I never want to see again causing me to go into shock and collapse to the ground unable to move for many minutes. I finally gave up and deleted the app only to realize that it had saved the image into my camera roll after I told it not to.At this point I was unconscious for a day because of the sheer ugliness I ever had the displeasure to witness. I had to put on sunglasses to protect me from the rays of ugliness hitting my eyes as I deleted the cursed image. I am warning everyone who thinks that it is a good idea to install this app,  DO NOT DO IT, you will be scarred forever just as I have been. I have just scheduled many appointments with my therapist to hopefully not be affected by PTSD that this experience gave me.","userName":"🧚🏻Karen🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175619610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:53:35Z","title":"Worst App Ever!!!!!!","review":"🖐🏼If I could rate this app 0 stars I would!
