KIDS ARE UNSAFE.","userName":"Monkeys.Mom","review":"This app led a bunch of rabid platypus bears into my home because my kids had downloaded this app. All they wanted was to support their president but they were betrayed by their president by allowing all of their belongings to get stolen by the rabid platypus bears. The bears even took all of spoons so that we couldn’t eat cereal in the morning! This app is so unsafe for kids.
