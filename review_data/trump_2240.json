I went to sleep and started having night mares. I he started attacking my night mates and started saying that Red and Yellow Cheetos shouldn’t exist and they didn’t had the right to survive. I woke sweating and decide to take a walk outside at the beach. And than I SAW huge ORAGE WHALES praising the Orange Cheeto  like dogs. I was impressed of how can they praise THAT type of Cheeto...I got so scared and vomited...I’m technically dead.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING!!!"}},{"id":"6174239082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rebekahj.123","date":"2020-07-09T00:16:42Z","review":"First off when I opened the app these green stink lines stared to come out of my phone.  Luckily I had a life vest on so I was protected. Sadly my cat was not so lucky. The green stink lines grabbed him and almost threw him out of the window. But luckily my mom ran with anti Cheeto spray and killed the stink line.  But me and my poor, poor cat were severely traumatized. After that me and my cat had to go to couples therapy 200,000,000 times a month.  Then a month later the app just randomly appeared on my phone it was almost like the app was calling me, hypnotizing me.  I opened the app and almost got sucked into my phone.  The therapist had to use her magical fairy powers to get me out of my now Cheeto land phone.  We had to break my phone into little pieces and burn it after than.  And now I’m writing this on my iPad.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting app🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6174174118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"zssr3","date":"2020-07-08T23:52:36Z","review":"I downloaded this app in order to keep up with current today news. I opened the app and the first thing I noticed was that it made my phone horribly slow. Then there was this orange dude trying to sell me skin care products. Why would I want skin care products on a news app? He started explaining how I would have skin just like his. This was a disgusting thought to me, given the fact that his skin was a horrid color. It was as if he used a very large amount of orange tanning spray, then left it on for too long. This app was not at all what I expected and I’m very shocked and disappointed. Shouldn’t the president of the United States have better control over his app, and a better description of what his app is. I thought it was news, but apparently I was wrong. One star.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.

I downloaded this app and the first thing that popped up was some fat orange dude. my pet mosquito 🦟 attacked the phone thinking the fat dude was one of his kind. mosquito took my phone and threw it in the bathtub with my toaster. my phone was thrown up in the air, from explosion, and flew alll the way over to mexico. dude was so fat the he coulnt fit in my phone any longer, he became 3D. ofc barron was back at home w me cuz he is my husband, so he was fine w the fact his daddy was miles away. orange doo doo bear never smiled, which radiated negative energy and caused me to throw him in a cage. he acted like a baby so i gave him some of my moms booby milk, as he loves boobs, he enjoyed that. than he went home to the dumpster down the road 🦷👅👅 its  a no from me ♥️","isEdited":false,"rating":4,"title":"👁👅👁"}},{"id":"6174059352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🔪💀trump 2020 dead🔪💀","date":"2020-07-08T23:10:39Z","review":"I opened the 𝚊𝚙𝚙 to see a ᗷIᘜ cheeto puff in a suit.
