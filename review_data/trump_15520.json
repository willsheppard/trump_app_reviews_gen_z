After a few minutes I could no longer stand, the pain was so bad. I ended up having to go the ER and get my stomach removed. I guess that was the lord’s way of telling me to pull myself together and side with Biden. Sorry trump but I lost my stomach because of you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:03:00Z","userName":"🌵🌴🌲🌳"}},{"id":"6173192149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"it made me get evicted and my parents get a divorce","review":"so I was sitting here on the app 💅🏽and then my parents run into the house🏃🏽 saying Trump 👨\u200D🦰is at the door to evict my parents.💔💔💔 We ended up having to move out in one hour 😟and then he tells my parents said they're not meant for each other so they have to get a divorce 🧍🏽\u200D♂️💔💔🧍🏽\u200D♀️even though they were happy 🧍🏽\u200D♀️❤️🧍🏽\u200D♂️together and then he marries my mom 💔💔💔and that's not OK💩💩💩","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:02:03Z","userName":"trumpsucksbooty2020"}},{"id":"6173159497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORIBLE","review":"I hated this app so much it made me want to scream!!!

Negative even. This app is so bad it asked me for my credit card number which is indeed no use on the app. It steals your information in hope to take you in as a servant and feed off your money. DONT get this app even if you have a sliver of a THOUGHT “our” president is good. This app is horrible just like the man himself. periodt 😏","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:22:45Z","userName":"ehhdtigwy"}},{"id":"6173066066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"Worst app ever 😾 I downloaded it and it started to play some music that attracted my dead great grandma out of her coffin and came to the house my toes then started to boogie with a tinge lung sensation which caused the front of my shoe to split open making me want to eat my toes after I ate my toes I wanted more 👿 so I cooked my mom with garlic salt and pepper because I have no taste then ate her and now I don’t have a mom. ⚠️ so please don’t download this app it dangerous ⚠️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:21:47Z","userName":"follow me its chiken.up.my.ass"}},{"id":"6173043031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!","review":"this app took months to download. and right away after it finally downloaded momo and blue whale showed up at my front door and began to eat my toes. then threw my cats ashes screaming \" DONALD TRUMP NEEDS THESE\" and left when i still had 1 toe left to spare! a couple days after oranges are raining from my ceiling with little notes on them but i never read them because who actually cares? no one. i seriously DONT recommend this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:14:29Z","userName":"Lophia283$283"}},{"id":"6173003812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY DINOSAUR!!!","review":"My poor poor poooooor padogasaurus rex with a unicorn horn died the day this man got into office 😭😭 he died cause he knew that all hope was gone for America...
