It initially took a long time to download, which was fine, but now it’s taking up a very large amount of storage on my phone. I’m unsure what to do and have taken it to Apple to see if they can minimize storage consumption from this app, and they’ve just said to delete it because it’s too much consumption. It also has asked me to fill out many unusual surveys while scrolling in between articles and such, like birth date and place, current address, social security number, and other odd things. I’m sure it’s only for statistical use but it doesn’t allow me to continue scrolling until i fill it out. Lastly, this app managed to kidnap my husband and send him into hiding. He met another person through this app, and he’s not telling me who they are for my safety. He was in hiding, alone of course, in Mykonos, Greece for a short while and is now traveling again. He cannot call me due to always being on edge of intruders in his hotel rooms and suites. Though the fake pandemic is still at large, he is doing what he can to keep me safe from the effects of this horrendous app.\n\nIn summary, do not download this app, it will cause you much emotional trauma. This may even be the reason I vote Biden2020."}},{"id":"6179464122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","userName":"wvuneers","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:39:05Z","review":"Trash #bernie"}},{"id":"6179464069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not get this app","userName":"ricey2.0","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:39:04Z","review":"Customer service is very bad and the overall the whole app is very laggy and it is messing up my phone."}},{"id":"6179464026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto","userName":"😭😣😖😫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:39:03Z","review":"The president stole my info and my money and now I sad"}},{"id":"6179463861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dump trump 2020","userName":"OMFGGGNSOABAHEV FKDOSBS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:38:59Z","review":"WORST APP EVER OMG!!!!
