I thought maybe this was a glitch so I continued into the app. About 10-15 seconds later, a new pop up appeared on the screen that called me the n-word with a very strange, racist photo. I thought maybe it was just a blip in the apps coding, but then a few seconds later, a new message popped up that called me the t-slur, followed by the k-slur (the anti-Semitic one) and then a very high quality image of what appeared to be a piece of poop in a toilet bowl. That’s when I knew something was up. I tried to leave the app, but when trying to press the home button, a message popped up saying “there’s no escaping your cage, immigrant”. I had no choice but to hard reset my phone. Definitely do not recommend."}},{"id":"6137866971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-30T00:53:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Shawty's like a melody in my
