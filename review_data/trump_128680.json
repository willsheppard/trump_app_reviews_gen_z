I wish I could say I was lying but when I woke up the morning after downloading this app my own dog was trying to strangle me. If that wasn't bad enough he tried to poop on my bed. I kept hearing voices saying build the wall or die. I was petrified for my own life.

It’s almost been an impossible week. It’s hard – it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry for you guys. I’m so sorry for disappointing you. It hurts me so bad to disappoint you all who’ve supported me for so many years. And know that I’m better than that person.I, six years ago, decided to re-tweet things that were so vile and hurtful. I was so stupid and ignorant. And I have no excuses here today; I’m not here to give you an excuse. I have no excuses. I’m only here to say that I’m so sorry. And I hope one day that you guys can see me for the woman that I am. And that I can prove to you guys that I’m not that girl.I love you guys so much. And whenever I see I disappointed you, it just breaks my heart into a million pieces. I’m so sorry for anyone that’s been hurt through this, anyone.I feel so just disappointed that I don’t even like to look at myself because like I can’t even believe that I would re-tweet ugly things and you know – things that would hurt people. Like I can’t believe I didn’t see the pain behind that kind of tweet and that kind of behavior. And I’m so sorry. There’s no excuse.There is nothing I can say that’s an excuse. I’m just sorry for making that six years ago.I wish I was better six years ago, but I can’t pray for the past. I can only pray for the future.I also want to say in this video that, “please”. Please just if you hate me, please just hate me. People have called my mother and threatened to kill her, they’ve gotten her phone number, they’ve attacked a child.[…] attacked her? I just say please just let this be me. Let this be about me. It is nothing about my family, it’s about me. It’s not about anyone else.This is my sorry.There’s another part of this story that like I don’t know if you all know, but me, and Gabriel, and Nikita and Manny took a picture with our middle fingers up. And we were trying to mimic Kylie Jenner’s birthday picture. And the picture was taken out of context. And it ended up causing pain you know – for other people.And I just wanted to say that I’m sorry to Jeffree [Star] for the pain we may have caused you in this. I didn’t know that that picture was going to be taken out of context and that anything was going to be said to you. But at the end of the day, it was done. So I need to owe you an apology for this. And I know we’re not friends anymore, but I want to apologize to you.Thank you guys for giving me some time and I love you guys. I understand that I just need some time now. I love you guys so much. And I’m sorry.","date":"2020-07-09T12:44:50Z","title":"THIS APP RUINED MY MARRIAGE"}}]}
