I will not be using this app, rather the website but thank you for trying? I really do not support this app usage as there is lag, when the app opens, the background looks disgusting. I suggest going on the website and reporting that too, there’s no difference. :/","userName":"ratatouilleeeee<3","date":"2020-07-10T03:31:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179263352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Takes information","review":"I actually support trump but when I looked through the privacy policy it said that they actually keep your payment information so no thank you I won’t be downloading the app again because I don’t want people stealing from my bank account","userName":"floweraesthetic","date":"2020-07-10T03:31:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179263183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Aids","review":"Unfortunately when I downloaded the app I started getting aids and my nut sack just gave out negative sunlight.

The walking Cheeto is a racist, rapist, homophobic, between many other things, and thinks he’s the only one that matters🥳. He doesn’t believe on climate change, but it makes sense because he has a bunker to hide when climate is going to kill everybody. mister I'm a cowardly idiot but I'm \"important\" doesn’t care 🥺👉🏼👈🏼. Anyway the app is telling me irrelevant news but I’m still banned 😚. BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻✊❤️. Btw for a relevant news, pass Barron’s number 😳😉😏😗.

I asked about it in my fishing group of facebook (using my son's phone because MY phone wasn't working at the time) and they said if you're phone heats up too much it can explode?! So I hurried to delete the app so it doesn't hurt my family, because that's what a father does, right?! Plus I learned if it crashes you have to spend hours on the phone with tech support, and they were barely helpful, so if you'd rather not deal with all the worry and stress I'd recommend sticking to websites, it's better than risking your families life and wasting your time with customer support!","userName":"Heckerioli pt. 360","date":"2020-07-10T03:31:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179262924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"My dog is now dead","review":"Yesterday morning I woke up and decided to see what all of this was about, this Cheeto of a president is my absolute hero 🤩 I opened it to see that my phone was now completely hacked 😘 then a knock on my door made me jump after I saw a message pop up on my phone that said “your family will die tonight” as soon as I opened the door a man with a gun shot my dog and said “Toodle ooh!” Then threw rotten potatoes on my front lawn like Santa clause 😊 As my dog was profusely bleeding on the floor I heard my mother scream in terror, I ran upstairs to see her going crazy like when those people looked at the monsters in bird box. Of course this happened because she too downloaded the app 😅 she then collapsed onto the floor and her lifeless body was eaten by the rats planted in our house by the trump administration who woulda thought they would be so nice to us 🥰 you’ll be missed noodles 🐶 and maybe you too mom but I don’t really think I’ll miss you after you took my phone away on Friday for eating my dogs food 😡","userName":"youneedthisgame","date":"2020-07-10T03:31:05Z","isEdited":false}}]}
