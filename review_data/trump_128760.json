After I had set up my phone once more, I kept reviving spam texts saying I should (and I quote) “VOTE TRUMP 2020! OR ELSE YOU WILL FOUND, ARRESTED AND BE SENT TO PRISON”. I instantly started to be afraid once I received those messages! 😣. I also got spam calls, and even started getting NIGHTMARES about trump! I started  seeing ads about this man on EVERYTHING including Facebook, Google, My TV, and even my Amazon Alexa started to randomly blert those EXACT same demonic sounds that the app did when I first opened it. (I had to smash it and get a new one) 😤👎. This app should be deleted, as many other reviews had bad experiences as well.. 👋🍊","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"}},{"id":"6176412873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:07:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Telciedt","rating":1,"review":"It was a dark and stormy day when I decided to download this app; it seemed like the perfect time to do so. I couldn’t go play ball with my pops outside. The library is closed due to covid so I have no books to read, and I had no drive to do anything other than wallow in self pity. That’s when it hit me: I was going to download the Trump 2020 app. I made an event of it. I put on my softest pajamas. I made my self a delicious cup of Hot Cocoa (completed with mini marshmallows of course). I snuggled down into bed and prepared to download the app that will change my life for good. As soon as I touched the download button, that’s when it happened. I have a dog you see, he’s an old dog and a sweet dog. His name is Donald. As I was preparing to download this wonderful app, Donald wandered into my room and decided to lay with me. This is completely normal, Donald is a very affectionate dog. Though as he laid down on my bed, my phone started to react. It grew arms and legs like some kind of sci-fi movie.The entire screen grew red and it started admitting a high pitch every scream. Poor Donald was scratching at his ears trying to get the sound away from him, but it just wouldn’t stop. My phone jumped out of my hands and sprinted towards Donald on all fours. With it’s ridiculously long mechanical arms it wrapped its arms around his neck and choke the life out of it. My poor puppy wheezed and cried but my phone had been taken over by the Trump 2020 app. It killed my dog. Do not download this app! It is very dangerous. If you value the life of your dogs, your children, your spouse, anything at all – you definitely do not want this app. Stay safe people.","title":"This app killed my dog 🥺"}},{"id":"6176411169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:07:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"michhnichh","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to support our glorious leader Donald. It first of all took 6 hours to download and made my phone unusable for that whole time. During that time I decided to take my salamander for a walk and during that time I was literally chased by some random people. I wasn’t able to call 911 because the app had my phone was all messed up. As I was getting chased\n I fell off the side of a mountain, promptly smashing my salamander with my right butt cheek. He was my only friend and we used to spend every day together. After I got back from my salamanders funeral the app finally downloaded. The second I opened it my day got even worse. The app started downloading random pictures of potatoes onto my phone. I love potatoes as much as the next person but this was inappropriate. I then tried to delete the app then the app threatened to murder my entire bloodline”. I promptly deleted. This app is the big BAD.","title":"This app has made me emotionally unstable"}},{"id":"6176408442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:06:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lonely Frogs","rating":1,"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
