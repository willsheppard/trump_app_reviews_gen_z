Took 3 hours to download and when it finally did my phone crashed! Once I called apple support to get it all up and running again I tried redownloading and it simply wouldn’t let me.... ugh the frustration! I’ve been actively trying to find reasons why I should vote for this coward of a man again and this was the tip of the iceberg for me. Me, my wife, and my kids will no longer be supporting this cheeto of a president.

It’s clear the developers didn’t understand what they are doing. No prior experience. No understanding of technology or complex systems. So it crashed the whole system. Also lots of bad R rated behavior, like fraternizing with adult film actors, bad language, racist language and xenophobia. Terrible examples of behavior shown for our youth. I think this app might even violate App Store hate speech rules. \n\nPlease remove from AppStore.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bergmann Family","title":"Terrible App - crashes the entire system","date":"2020-07-08T16:54:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172968181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Well when I first downloaded it, I was a bit hesitant because of the various actions that have been committed by our so called president. And downloading this felt like I was supporting him and it made me sick. But my uncle told me if I loved America and didn’t want to suffer the consequences, I would have to download it. But now I realize I don’t care and Trump is an awful being to say the least :) So please, do us a favor and take this app off.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Silly Liberal:)","title":"Please Get This App Deleted","date":"2020-07-08T16:51:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172967661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to learn about our president, as I can now vote.

It made me make an account for the app, which made me give PERSONAL information to Trump’s app, which I did not approve of. Also, the colors were tooooo blinding for my eyes like make it simple😡. There were many notifications sent to my phone that were overwhelming as well. Also, do not support Trump 2020.
