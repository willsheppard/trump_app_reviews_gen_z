After 6 long hours of regret, it finally downloaded and I opened the app only to see this SEVERELY obese orange 🍊 ASKING FOR MY NUMBER. Now this is just unacceptable because I’m a MINORRRRRR.😤 After that I went outside on my porch to peruse through this homophobic, xenophobic, racist, and fascist app. Suddenly out of nowhere it started RAINING ORANGES. This huge orange hit me over the head and I FELL OF MY PORCH. 🤕 I think I went unconscious because when I woke up the same SEVERLY obese orange was standing right beside me. So I jumped up and started kickin up dusk but when I turned around, my body was still lying there. I hurried up and ran inside my house but that sure didn’t help. I soon realized I was dead, but this OMPA LOMPA LOOKING OBESE ORANGE tried breaking into my house. So I ran to get my baseball bat so I could send this orange into oblivion, but the orange just disappeared (exactly how his hair does when he takes his toupee off). After he disappeared, I turned around only to SEE HIM ON MY TV. 😤 This was just traumatizing. He was making some speech about how he was going to send people to jail for tearing down racist monuments but won’t t arrest Breonna Taylor’s killers🤦🏻\u200D♀️. Then suddenly I heard my front door creak open and guess what was there. THESE HUGE COCKROACHES WITH COWBOY HATS AND PENCILS STARED CHARGING AT ME.😤 Luckily I still had my baseball bat so I was able to fight them off. After this horrific sequence, I opened this app and then my phone just disintegrated into my hand. Anyways, now I’m writing this review on my microwave door. I’m scared the cockroaches might come back so I’m going to hide in my bathtub until my parents get home, but I don’t know if they will see me because I’m DEAD. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP IT WILL LITERALLY KILL YOU. But anyways, stay safe guys and have a good day!🧚🏼\u200D♂️💗✨","title":"Scarred me for Life😤","isEdited":false,"userName":"isabellaharvey0"}},{"id":"6176679579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:20:06Z","review":"This app may seem good or harmless but it’s not.
