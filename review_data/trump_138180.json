I was expecting to see Donald Trump use his 9 year-old rhetoric to make me feel proud of America. Instead, my child saw Donald Trump using his golf club as a stripper’s pole. What is this? I expected a much better dance! Not for him to show off his skid mark. And next time, add a bald eagle for Christ’s sake.","userName":"liviab0811","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179780805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:31:00Z","title":"Please delete","review":"The worst app I hate it to many glitches just a waste on the apple store","userName":"ulnwbgkal","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179780598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:30:55Z","title":"what is this..","review":"so uhm i just wanted to say this app is very bad. and it shouldn’t be a thing. especially bc what the app is for. why should there be an app that allows a racist/rapist/homophobic orange man share his opinions about innocent people who are just trying to have equal rights, live how they want, and to be equal with everyone. no matter there cultural back ground or ethnicity. if you actually use this app and believe him clearly you are very uneducated about the modern world and what he stands for (he stand for absolutely the worst things and is never gonna “make america great again” because it was never truly great, it was only great to the rich white people not for the people who made up their country)","userName":"gianni 🥰🖕🧚\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179780455","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:30:51Z","title":"Worst app ever!!!!","review":"Hello I gave it one Star review because this is legit The worst App ever like I don’t know why they let A child make an app!","userName":"tick-tock for life forever","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179780468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:30:51Z","title":"Delete!!!

It spits out lies and I can’t take it. Also warning every time you open the app you get a sudden feeling of puking especially when trumps face pops up. Many ppl think that down rating the app is childish. Well guess what we don’t care 🤷🏻\u200D♀️ :). You can cry all you want, us gen z won’t budge (if you support trump and you’re a “gen z” then don’t consider yourself one thank you). Also I kind of think that this whole down rating thing is a little insignificant but if it’s to annoy the trump administration then I’m all for it. Did I mention that this app is so trashy.","userName":"Blakediana","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179779821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:30:37Z","title":"Worst app in history","review":"This is by far the worst app in history. Horribly designed app and POTUS isn’t much better. It’s tends to fail and glitch at start up and continues to fail like the POTUS today.","userName":"Soofster","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
