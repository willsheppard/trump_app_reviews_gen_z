I thought that maybe something would pass through but the sea of cheddar remains just keeps flooding through!! Honestly i can‚Äôt even taste anything anymore i am desensitized to the cheese. This is the last time i‚Äôll be getting chips from the chum bucket next time i‚Äôll just go to McDonalds. Every time i opened the app i left with so much orange dust that it turned my pet bonsai turned orange and he can no longer go on drives to the dmv with me anymore. I blame this app for the complaints coming from my him as he would rather return to his natural complexion. While all colors do matter, it is important to bring attention to those that might be actively covered or targeted by cheeto dust.","date":"2020-07-09T03:21:18Z"}},{"id":"6174562733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"liv.d2006","isEdited":false,"title":"I‚Äôm disgusted by this app.","rating":1,"review":"after opening the app, i was greeted with an old, crusty, rancid cheeto. after browsing the app trying to distract my mind from the horrific image, i found out that the cheeto is also a racist pedofile. i tried to exit the app, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. i started to get worried when i heard a knock at the door. it was the cheeto himself. he barged into the house with several police officers, kidnapped my dog, (but i don‚Äôt have a dog) ate my brother, took all of the raw meat out of my freezer then proceeded to shove it down his throat in front of my face. he and his army of officers clogged all the toilets in my house. i began to wonder how they even got to my house. while i was cleaning up the massive üí© that he left on my floor, it clicked. the app uses my location. no one is safe. \nanyways, stream drag me down, fine line, walls, heartbreak weather, LP1, and mind of mine.","date":"2020-07-09T01:57:36Z"}},{"id":"6174522699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bdjehskkd","isEdited":false,"title":"I am very disappointed with my purchase üòï","rating":1,"review":"So I was looking for food for my pet Tyrannosaurus rex ü¶ñ and he naturally really loves Cheetos so I downloaded this app thinking it was going to help me find the best Cheetos to buy in my area but when I opened it I saw this gross mistake of a Cheeto I looked and looked through the app and it is just this gross Cheeto over and over again so I ordered some of the product and tasted it OMG it tastes like somebody microwaved steel I was so sad for Laser (my Tyrannosaurus rex of course) I sent back the product and will not be buying this ever again my refrigerator, stove/oven, and microwave have also gone missing sense I downloaded this food app I‚Äôm very sad I will never buy this product again I demand this be taken off the App Store immediately thank you and have a great day. ü¶ñüòå\n\n                          \n                      Sincerely, Lonely Cowboy And Laser","date":"2020-07-09T01:46:07Z"}},{"id":"6174434187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"w√´ii","isEdited":false,"title":"CHEETOüíñüôàüßöüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èBUT IN A DUMPSTER","rating":1,"review":"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

I know yes, we all collectively ADORE mr dementia himself ! ly donnie<3 but when I opened this app with the mission to sign up and do whatever I can to annihilate this god forsaken app, I was RUDELY met with the utter most disturbing, ghoulish, most gruesomely ugly face I have ever seen in my whole (obviously above 17) years of living!! I‚Äôm now terrified to even look at this app, let alone write a review, for that face has given me ptsd. And yes, I have already contacted a therapist about this issue, and yes we are now going to be meeting 3 times a week to discuss my trauma. so what I‚Äôm getting at is- I downloaded this FREE app, only for it to come right back and bite me in the brain, because now I need therapy, which IS NOT CHEAP. $100 each appointment...I don‚Äôt think I can even express my pure hatred of this app through words donnie. thank you for hearing my voice<3","date":"2020-07-09T00:26:46Z"}},{"id":"6174227369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alexis ¬•","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump‚Äôs demon attacked me(emotional) do not recommend üòü","rating":1,"review":"I thought this was an app that‚Äôs sells new 2020 trumpets, musical instruments, but it wasn‚Äôt and little did I know it would change my life FOREVER .

Once i opened the app the Orange with really bad aging lines all over it showed up on my screen!!!

I honestly do not understand why there were at MY house so, i talked to them and the BIT ME and then they threatened to throw me in the pacific ocean to drown with all the trash there. I stomped on every single one of them and then i had to clean it up before the respawned. but once i did that MORE CAME! so i went to my room and grabbed my lightsaber and started wracking them! once i got them all i needed to go to the E.R because i had all the toxic fumes inside of me.

So i downloaded this app to be up to date with our AMAZING,ORANGE CHEETO president. I want to be able to be on top of my game when arguing with STUPID LEFTIST and GENERATION Z. I proceeded to download the app and sign up for the texts and then it happened... my phone started blowing up with text messages and not even from Trump but from SCAMMERSSS, but i just blocked all of them and continued on with my life as a great american Trump supporter. But a few days later, my phone started typing by itself and my instagram started following and liking all AOC‚Äôs posts and unfollowing Donald Trump! Can you believe that?! I thought it would end there with a quick restart on my phone...oh no. I got a phone call the next day and it was from a random number and obviously I answered it, that was when hell started.
