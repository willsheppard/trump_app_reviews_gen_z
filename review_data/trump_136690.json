I’m not the biggest fan of the orange man, but this app works perfectly fine. It was a quick download, and it is completely functional. It’s very well made and has a very clean layout. There is tons of information, and it’s very easy to navigate through everything. None of my pictures or other stored data was deleted. You can tell that this app was made by professionals. Like the title says— don’t listen to the blatantly biased negative reviews."}},{"id":"6180131218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Random person.

The downloading time took a tad bit longer than expected, about 86 weeks. I had already started to lose interest in the app by now, but I continued because God bless America. As soon as I signed in, it asked if I would like to turn my location services on, so I did just that. Immediately after, I heard a knock at my door and the Men In Black starring Will Smith were on my porch ready to take me away. Being a Gen Z, I didn’t give up without a fight. I knew Pawn Stars’ Rick Harrison would know a guy who could help me out so I gave Rick a call. He then made a call to a buddy of his, and we got the situation taken care of. I knew I could count on Rick. Anyways, this app was a complete waste of my time, and it also put me in harm’s way. I have frequent flashbacks of this incident and I now have a therapist appointment every 3 hours for the next 2 years. DON’T DOWNLOAD!!!!"}},{"id":"6180130836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mrdrpeppet","date":"2020-07-10T08:40:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Great app","rating":5,"review":"Trump2020"}},{"id":"6180129844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zzzzzzzzzz4","date":"2020-07-10T08:40:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"made my messages crash","rating":1,"review":"i down loaded this app because i wanted to keep up with politics and candidates for 2020, when i put my number in the first place to put your number, i was expecting only a code to be able to log me in, not make my messages crash and share my number with other trump organization numbers and more trump owned businesses. i have gotten nine texts only in the past five days, i wanted to stay updated on trumps plans, though i am not a supporter; it completely crashed my messages and i had to delete and re-download the app to be able to make this review. my messages wouldn't send, it wouldn't show whom they were from, and i got spam from this app. i do not recommend this app if you are wanting to keep up with trump, keep up through other sources just not this one."}},{"id":"6180129814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"uthoughtkid","date":"2020-07-10T08:40:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"BURN IN HELL TRUMP","rating":1,"review":"Trump is the most utterly autistic person on planet earth and it’s disgusting how people can’t see that"}},{"id":"6180129474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"2020isajoke","date":"2020-07-10T08:40:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"App crashes phone","rating":1,"review":"Okay, all TikTok jokes aside, this app crashed my phone every time I tried to open it. In addition, this app is not user friendly and is hard to navigate. When I first downloaded the app, I thought it would have useful statistics and information in order to help me make an informed voting decision. I am a voter who cares about getting to know all sides of the political spectrum, so I also downloaded the Biden 2020 and Yang 2020 apps. Yang’s blows this app out of the water. Truly, I wish I never wasted a full day waiting for this to download. The worst part is that after waiting so long, I discovered that this app truly is only in support of Trump, so that was a real bummer. 0/10 would not recommend, the app or the candidate. 👎👎"}},{"id":"6180129441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👄👁🤡🥨🙈🙊","date":"2020-07-10T08:40:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Deleted","rating":1,"review":"Don’t use this app, simply download it and rate it one star for the clown that he is 🤡🤡🤡🙈"}}]}
