You know in my mind I was thinking our orange Cheeto puff can’t possibly do anything wrong. He’s perfect, but then there was this app. Not only did it make my phone glitch and pop up his nudes everywhere I went which was scaring and absolutely just horrifying, but it took THREE DAYS to download. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE app. Needs to be removed right now!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173327225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible!!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:46:16Z","userName":"oshsbsjicis","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was on this app in a coffee shop one day and as soon as I opened this app my phone shut down and started sending electric shocks to my hand. I pushed my phone away but it landed on my sons chest, where he was electrocuted. He started having seizures so we had to call the ER. This app costed me THOUSANDS of dollars. This has happened to many of my family members. You need to take this app down!!!"}},{"id":"6173291609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍊.","date":"2020-07-08T18:34:50Z","userName":"Tuputamadre101","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"There’s no flavor, where is the flavorrrrr. Highly don’t recommend installing this app. So many glitches on the app. It drains your percentage. It’s ugly like his personality 🥰✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💗🌈. It’s just a waste of time. You’re a waste if you support this waste 😝🧚🏼\u200D♀️. This app supports a rapist and a racist. DISGUSTING 😌. Dory said “just keep swimming” but not you though, you drown with this clown 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💗🌈. This app is only for clowns.
