He said he’d give him right back after borrowing him but he’s already lost 3,000 kids so far so I personally don’t believe his track record is very reliable. The worst part of the whole encounter was the moment when he ate my tv because he “felt like it”. I tried suing for property damage but he fired MY lawyers and the investigator and didn’t let me have any witnesses!! Now I need to buy a new tv and the judge who HE ASSIGNED said I have to pay him a million dollars for being so “unpleasant”. Then he took a nice fat dump on my forehead and left. Overall I give this app a -27/10 because I miss my tv and watching Fox news. Obviously I’m still voting for him because I have worms for brains but I still think it was a little impolite.","date":"2020-07-09T10:41:42Z","rating":1,"userName":"gen-z karen"}},{"id":"6174457105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"leftist propaganda SAD.","review":"Attention parents and grandparents of young children.

I knew it had to be the app’s fault.  So I did an experiment.  I deleted the app and all the chaos ceased.  Then, I redownloaded the app and what I experienced I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.  When I entered the app I saw crude pictures of the cheeto himself.  And let me start by saying he had his own croissant 🥐😳.  ANYWAYS, after I saw that image I became blind and so I am having my scribe write this review for me.  But that wasn’t the worst of it...everything started happening to me 😣 The dishes started washing me, the TV started watching me, and the jellybeans started eating me 😵 It was extremely traumatic.  I suffer from PTSDDTDTA. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Due To Donald Trump’s App. If you know what’s good for you, do not download this app 🙂 - this message is approved by Gen Z","date":"2020-07-09T00:13:15Z","rating":1,"userName":"Student in HS🤓"}},{"id":"6174187203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP *bad luck😾🚫*","review":"i never expected for an app created to support trump would be so glitchy. when i opened the app there was a picture of a cheeto man. i didn’t appreciate this because my eyes felt like they would explode from the sheer repulsiveness of what came on my screen. i made the smart decision to scrub and cleanse my phone from any demons and unwanted content. i ended up getting soapy water in my phone and now my speaker won’t work. this may be my fault for getting water in my phone, but i couldn’t help it when the cheeto man showed up. i forgot to delete the app, and my pet caterpillar wouldn’t come home. i deleted the app, and she did come home, but it just wasn’t the same. i think she knew i did something very bad. this app caused me and my caterpillar so much pain that if i could, i would rate it zero stars. always remember to manifest things that are dear to you, and that august 27th is going to be a special day.","date":"2020-07-08T23:57:23Z","rating":1,"userName":"~piao piao😼~"}},{"id":"6174120364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is a hoax","review":"I downloaded this app after so many times trying. Then it tells me to entry my phone number. Why??  Do you want to bombard me with fake texts, tweets and news?  So after asking my phone what to do, My phone then told me this.... it said if you keep this app it means you hate bacon. And if you hate bacon, a unicorn dies. Possibly puppies as well. And occasionally baby goats. But never dragons because of something to do with tomatoes. But fairies are allergic to tomatoes so then every other fairy will lose its wings and the tooth fairy will go broke. So kids will never lose their teeth, the Easter bunny will lose its hop, The Pillsberry dough boy will forget how to giggle, Lucky charms will no longer be lucky, Chester will stop supporting Cheetos , and then 45 will eat all the Cheetos  and  Use his lawyers to add Sections to the clause to get rid of Santa Claus. So for future children to continue to believe in happiness good things in Santa Claus I have to delete this app.","date":"2020-07-08T23:32:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"Its Me Ms Dee"}},{"id":"6173995521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"My near death situation😰","review":"So when I first downloaded  ✅the app I thought I would love it 😍 but soon as I opened it aliens 👽 started crawling out of the screen!📲 So then, I grabbed all 629 of my water guns 🔫 and started shooting them! They fell 🕴🏽one by one 1️⃣ but there was too 🧟\u200D♂️ many to fight 👊🏽off I was really scared 😰 until Obama 👨🏽 came and saved me! He punched 👊🏽 them until they exploded 💥 then deleted 🚫 the app before anything else bad 👎🏽 happened. But just as I thought 💭 it was over, the Cheeto lord himself jumped out the screen looking orange 🔶 as ever! He threatened to throw me in a pit 🕳 of hot lava 🔥 unless my parents voted for him!✅ Needless to say, I was put into rehab for jumping in lava 🔥 but I died 😵 only 2️⃣ days later and then woke up in hell 👹 and so me and satan started vibing ✨ and then I started throwing it back on Albert fish 🐠 and then trump showed up there and I threw him into a pit of lava 🔥 and me, satan, and Albert fish all laughed 😂 as we watched him burn 🔥","date":"2020-07-08T22:46:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"A STRANGER TOU DO NOT KNOW"}},{"id":"6173709031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈ","review":"When I downloaded this app, my entire family started have seizures and coughing up blood. I had to drive all of them to the Emergency Room but then I was stopped by men in Trump masks. They started to throw toxic oranges at my dad and he sadly passed away. Then they came for my grandma and they broke her ankles while applying black eyeshadow under their eyes. They thought she was their mom so they took her away and I never saw her again. Then the app took over my phone and then started to play Superbass by Nicki Manaj at full volume causing deaf and blindness to my sister. I was then taken into a room and they tried to brainwash me like Joo Dee in Ba Sing Se. Then Trump himself came and put my mom into a meat grinder and made her into a burger. He then proceeded to force feed it to a dying child outside of the ER. I was the only one that survived. Now I live off of canned tomatoes thanks to this app. I think this app it terrible and did horrible things to my family.","date":"2020-07-08T20:59:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"bonk👣"}},{"id":"6173645804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"What fresh hell is this?","review":"This app has truly ruined my life. The second I tapped the download button, my phone burst into flames and horribly burnt my hands and face. Then my phone grew legs and started to kick my dog over and over again and then started rampaging around my house crashing into walls and destroying my home. It then produced a pitch that shattered my eardrums and led to a pack of hungry wolves coming into my home and eating all my food and also my grandparents. My phone then transformed into an antenna which broadcasted hardcore furry porn to every screen within a 60 mile radius of my house. At this point I tried to approach the phone to try to destroy it but it had already become self aware and had set up a complexed system of defenses around it which I was not able to break through. I fear this app may lead to the end of civilization as we know it. I would like it to be taken down from the app store.

It hacked into my phone and sent my information to Russia.  The app basically ruined my phone and gave it a lot of viruses. My phone has so many viruses that i am not allowed to touch it anymore because I’ll get sick. The app leaked my toe pictures to my family group chat and caused my grandfather to get a heart attack. This app made my pet ferrets turn against me. The song that played at the beginning possessed them and now they want me to go back to my country. They keep screaming racial slurs at me. This app also took all the money from my bank account and then it took control of my phone and my phone stood up and turned on my gas stove. The gas then blew up the whole house and now i have 3rd degree burns and then my pets tried to kill me with knives. Anyways I tried to support you mr president but this app just caused my whole neighborhood to get eaten grasshoppers. Please don’t get this app I am begging you.","date":"2020-07-08T19:49:56Z","rating":1,"userName":"cocoaacheerios"}},{"id":"6173468844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"To trump (you orange bastard)","review":"I do not support trump I do not vote for Trump I think he’s a terrible man who’s done terrible things he’s a racist Who does not support anybody that is Hispanic Black Asian nobody who doesn’t look like him or who doesn’t fit the description of white skin, blonde hair and blue eyes and I’m sorry Trump I don’t think anybody wants to look like a living talking orange. \nHe is a sexist he doesn’t think women should have the right of speech he bashes women he only uses them for their body parts and is somebody who supports the TikTok community he is trying to take that away from American citizens and if any app should be taken away from the App Store I think it should be this one I am not gonna wish death upon Trump because that is very terrible of me but as a Hispanic American Citizen I do wish for him to rot  in a jail cell therefore I don’t think Trump should be in office if anything I feel like he should’ve been removed from office \nMay trump rot in hell","date":"2020-07-08T19:35:19Z","rating":1,"userName":"Marissa_15"}}]}
