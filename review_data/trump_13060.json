I am unhappy with the interface that is presented to me upon opening it. Additionally, this app does not give us the correct information we need to stay informed on the issues we face as a nation. I am extremely disappointed with this app, and hope that it will be removed from the App Store. Thank you.","userName":"Green686","title":"Poor Quality App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:48:00Z"}},{"id":"6178642120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrendous it took me a month to download. Once it finally downloaded it my phone kept dying and my battery health went all the way down😨. The next day the cops came to my front door and tried to arrest me. They threatened me to vote for Trump. Good thing they didn’t have a warrant. I shooed them away and then deleted the app. It says the app tracks your location in the background and “might reduce phone battery”.","userName":"1224562","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:40:07Z"}},{"id":"6178629342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I logged in it was glitchy and It asked me for my phone number and I couldn’t skip it. I didn’t want put my phone number  and then I hear Donald trump screaming in the background and it hurt my ears. You should delet the audio and the game.

However I was HORRIBLY mistreated. The app activated my front facing camera without asking first, figured out my race and proceeded to call me all sorts of racial slurs. At first I didn’t think much of it until I started to use the app and it replaced all the words with pictures because “N****rs don’t know how to read”. Worst app ever. 0/10 would not recommend.

When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.","userName":"Mia Love this","title":"HORRIBLE APP.
