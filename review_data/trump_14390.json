The app started off working fine. But as time went on.. the app got worse. It made my phone start to glitch a lot. The app would always crash and kick me out. The app would also track a lot of things that I did. It feels like a total invasion of privacy if you ask me.\nJust don’t get this app. Trust me."}},{"id":"6173550473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"baddie202","title":"AWFUL","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i had the worst experience with this app. it brought a virus into my phone and every time i turned it on, the ghost busters theme song played. it drove me crazy. i had to put my phone under bleach, ketchup, dish soap, vomit, mayonnaise, spit, oxi clean stain remover, head & shoulders shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 (old spice flavor), etc. and in the end it didn’t work. i had to buy a new phone but it was also cursed. i will never forget that experience."}},{"id":"6173547213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gen Zee 🧚🏾✨🥰","title":"0/10 would not recommend","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:02:12Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to ✨b a s k ✨ in the presidential 🧚🏾✨glory🧚🏾✨ but it brainwashed me 🧠 into punting my cat 🐈 into a 7/11!

When u say bad I mean it’s just over all slow , lagging , and I just don’t see the point of it what so ever. I got bugs on my device also so that’s even more points cut off. I hope that this app is shut down very soon. And on a side note, what is this apps purpose in the first place?
