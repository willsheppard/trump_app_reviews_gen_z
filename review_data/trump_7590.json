Starting to think my money is not going to build the Great Wall but to a certain Russian president who will not be named, for safety reasons. Save yourself the trouble and don’t even download unless it is to leave a one star review warning other loyal mAGa followers.","title":"Do not download!","isEdited":false,"userName":"gOD BleSs aMeRIcA✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6173646902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:37:08Z","review":"I never write reviews because it doesn’t get this bad!! The app just never would load except maybe 1% of the time and when it did it crashed my whole phone!! And don’t even get me started on the disorganization of the whole thing! I mean, it is NOT that hard to put a little effort into an app!! This app reminds me of the president’s brain. Doesn’t work 1% of the time and when it does it just hurts everyone!! Do not download this unless you want a buggy phone! Shameful!!","title":"All around a horrible app!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Snowy_216"}},{"id":"6173623324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:28:44Z","review":"When I first open the app glitched out because a bug on my phone and it also caused me to lose half my data because of this glitch this app is horrible and you should not download it at all❤️ \nAlso this app needs to be deleted because Donald Trump is trying to take Tik Tok away from us which is very rude and disrespectful so we’re gonna take away something from him and this at least be banned ASAPTake this app away do not download it it is horrible and bad causes glitches to phone. 😘","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE THE APP EVERYTHING","isEdited":false,"userName":"livi 🤍"}},{"id":"6173620290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:27:37Z","review":"I was watching my orange fish and his orange reminded me of trump and I got reminded of this app that Nick Videos on Tik tok was talking about and so i decided to download it and as soon as i did, i showed my fish a picture of trump and MY FISH DIED. We always went on walks together and whenever we were on this walks he would see a trump sign and throw up so i understand why he would die from this app. This is a really hard time for me and this app rlly made me feel so sad because i loved Jimmy :( If you love your fish then trust me never download this app.","title":"scared my fish","isEdited":false,"userName":"IloveMyfishNamedJimmy"}},{"id":"6173600159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:22Z","review":"I don’t even know where to start. When I got this app I wanted to see what our president was doing about todays issues. I was so angry to see that this app was filled with lies. This man has some nerve. He should not have the privilege of being called the president. This app is so misleading and trying to manipulate the people. He is a racist no good rapist.  The fact that people actually think he is a good man just blows my mind. As a person and citizen of this country I think we can do better. I 100% do not recommend this app.","title":"Worst app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"CgB1ol3o5"}},{"id":"6173586750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:15:42Z","review":"This app is truly despicable. It was a hawt summer day, and there I was, eating some melon balls until I came across this app. I downloaded to pay tribute to my orange lord and savior🙏 but within seconds of clicking download a small psychic man claiming to have the name of Dean began attacking my toes. Out of self defense I acted quickly and started throwing my melon balls at him. Thankfully with that I bought enough time to retreat to the safety if my hamster cage and deleted the app. These horrifying events have scarred me and this app MUST be taken down before Dean can take anyone’s toes.","title":"A trumpet horror story","isEdited":false,"userName":"julia fogel"}},{"id":"6173556033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:05:11Z","review":"took almost a MONTH to download and wasted all my storage. then i was looking threw it and nothing interesting. then that same night when i was asleep i woke up but couldn’t move. and there i saw in the corner of my room a weird big body built ORANGE!🍊 and i said “why is there an orange” but when it turned around i saw him. and then came up to me and said “VOTE TRUMP 2020 or i’ll send out my ninjas” then smacked me back to sleep when i woke up i deleted the app and now they are gone. but now i have a orange stain on my wall from Mr. Micropenis. 👁👄👁","title":"WILL GIVE U SLEEP PERALISIS!🍊","isEdited":false,"userName":"your fairly odd parents"}},{"id":"6173496101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:42Z","review":"He’s the worst person in the world. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.

Within minutes of using it, my screen kept going black and shutting off. Then, once my phone shut off and I turned it back on, my screen was frozen on the app for hours. I had to leave my phone to die for 3 days. When it finally turned back on, my data wasn’t working and neither was anything else. I had to send in my phone to Apple to have it fixed. It turned out the app gave my phone bugs. Please do NOT get this app!","title":"Please don’t get","isEdited":false,"userName":"pleeaaaseee dont get it"}},{"id":"6173488331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:03Z","review":"I am a person who only gets tremendous apps the best apps nobody gets apps better than I do, people look at me and they say wow you get the best Apps they look at my phone and they say these are some great apps but let me tell you when I downloaded this app that went away!
