However, my problem is mainly with the racists and bigots, especially the obese orange one. Now every time i try and fall asleep i have terrible sleep paralysis nightmares of said racist saying he would date his daughter. Absolutely wretched. I haven’t slept in weeks. Poor quality.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:24:57Z","userName":"alex the mommy blogger","title":"Absolutely Terrible"}},{"id":"6174066334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried inviting friends to get more points but it would NOT give me any. Also I was spammed with so many unnecessary notifications to the point where my phone began to lag and slow down. I’m going to get my phone checked tomorrow because I think I might have a virus. I couldn’t be more unimpressed with the quality of this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:13:07Z","userName":"Alyssa BH","title":"Annoying and unproductive app!"}},{"id":"6174054025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and was horrified to find a photo of trump fully nude pop onto my screen. My sister saw this and was in so much shock that she pulled her eyes out and fed them to me, and then proceeded to tell me she was now going to be pursuing the same path as Hellen Keller. I’m absolutely scarred and still have nightmares today and my sister still hasn’t spoken to me since. \nalright i’ll go cry now 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:08:39Z","userName":"meaggomyeggos","title":"my sister is hellen keller"}},{"id":"6174053773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was the downfall of my career...

It’s just a picture of a moldy old shriveled tiny Cheeto. The app advertised that there are 2,020 “Trump”s. I’m not sure that that is but it must be terrible. This app is just False advertising and full of lies. To continue having this app in the Oval App Store will do nothing but cause mass harm to all phone users. Do not download this app and Certainly don’t review it. \nKaren out.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:02:57Z","userName":"Tiz DeVille","title":"AOC 2024"}},{"id":"6174031101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is.
