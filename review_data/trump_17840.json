As soon as I got on I only saw this clown everywhere like is that all they have!? Although the clown was very realistic. I want to give a warning to anyone wanting the app, don‚Äôt. But I guess if you like clowns and pigs this is the app for you."}},{"id":"6173759269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:17:56Z","title":"Only gave 1 star because I couldn‚Äôt give 0.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ItsNicoleYeah","review":"The app itself is so slow, took almost a full day to download when i have perfectly good wifi. Almost all the information on the app is false. I was not expecting much from the app in the first place, but was somehow still let down. I would be embarrassed to even offer this app."}},{"id":"6173754120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:16:03Z","title":"NEVER DOWNLOADING AGAIN","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Whozjessica","review":"This app was absolutely terrible. I went in expecting a positive community but was instead greeted with a orange faceüò°. The negative energy in this app should never be shown on the app store again. It‚Äôs honestly scarring. Also, every time I try to click on the app it glitches. JUST TERRIBLE. A waste of storage honestly. All and all, i will NOT, NEVER, be downloading such a app like this one. Disgusting."}},{"id":"6173742617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:11:53Z","title":"This app will RUIN your phone!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"maddieg1942","review":"Unbelievable... This app took me nearly a FULL DAY to download and took up so much space that anytime I tried to open my phone none of apps would work because they all kept crashing!

It‚Äôs wings are too small to get its fat body off the ground.  The bee ,of course, fly‚Äôs anyways. Because bees don‚Äôt care what humans think is impossible. SEQ. 75- ‚ÄúINTRO TO BARRY‚Äù INT.

It took WEEKS to download and it made my phone super slow. After waiting so long for the app to download, I was excited to open it and use it, but for some reason it didn‚Äôt even work and instead BLEW UP MY PHONE with advertisements asking me to buy unhealthy amounts of spray tan and different varieties of blonde toupees.

The store that is the holder of Minecraft and Flappy Bird, is now infected with this awful app. It keeps sending these weird notifications of trump saying racist, homophobic, sexist, incompetent, things in the news. Not only that, but it has brought many viruses to mine and my family‚Äôs devices. And of course the cockroaches, which took my cat as well!!"}},{"id":"6173686719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:23Z","title":"Don‚Äôt download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Cassxsavage","review":"It‚Äôs horrible it made my phone glitch like crazy. Then it played music and made the fire nation come and burn down my home. Then took my dog and said it was Appa but it‚Äôs an English bulldog. I don‚Äôt know why it did that to my phone. My phone then had an orange on the screen for 2 days straight. It was a horrible experience I highly recommend to never download it."}},{"id":"6173666543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:06Z","title":"Terrible App","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"LaKatia98","review":"I wanted to learn about our president and his policies and basically everything on it is incoherent garbage.
