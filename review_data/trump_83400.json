(after all i am a straight white male) i used the app for a little bit. the next day when i opened it, i got a notification saying, “who are you voting for in november? (if you don’t say trump we will come to your house (with our 2nd amendment right guns) and kill your whole family and hold you hostage in the smallest closet in the white house.) i was shocked by this 🙀🙀🙀! nevertheless, i chose biden because i wanted to see what would happen. wouldn’t my straight white male privilege protect me? precisely 5 seconds after choosing biden there was a knock on my door. 👁👄👁 i opened the door to see the president’s henchmen standing outside. i was quickly pulled outside and dragged all the way to the white house! 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨😻 i was told that my family would be spared if i called them right now and forced them to vote for trump in november. as soon as we got to the white house i was thrown in the closet exactly as the app had said! there were lots of other people in the closet (dead and alive). we made small talk👁👄👁😱😻😭✨. for legal reasons i am writing this review from that closet and i did not take barron and melania with me as i jumped out the window and went back home!😃🥰 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP. IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!!","title":"HORRIBLE APP✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️😾","userName":"hee hee😂","date":"2020-07-09T14:00:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176815980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Makes the world a worse place","title":"Donald Trump","userName":"CheezyNoob","date":"2020-07-09T13:56:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176805419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was disorganized, cluttered, and kept crashing every 3 seconds. how am i supposed to do anything on this app. disappointed.","title":"terrible","userName":"stellackkk","date":"2020-07-09T13:53:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
