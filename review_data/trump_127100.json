Here is why he hasn’t been proven guilty but is guilty of those and probably more: A criminal case, like rape, needs to be prosecuted before it goes to court. Trump picked the attorney general and the DoJ is controlled by the trump administration. The attorney general prosecutes the federal cases, like the president raping someone. While he’s president, Trump can’t have a case against him. The only way to do that is through impeachment, but the senate is never going to remove him from office. So the whole “innocent until proven guilty” doesn’t work with presidents.\n Next, the only case that happened near when he raped a girl was when he raped his wife. The case was settled, meaning he basically just payed her money to not prove him guilty of rape.\n The 23 other cases came out either during or after he ran for office. Before you ask why, it’s extremely hard to go out and admit that you were raped. Especially by a rich, powerful man. On top of that, people get called liars. And the women that came out DID get called liars. They opened up now because when he ran for presidency, they realized that people deserve to know that they’re voting for a rapist.\n Now for why he wasn’t prosecuted when Obama was president: Obama thought that Hilary would win. He didn’t think America was that dumb. And he had pledged to stay out of the election. Prosecuting Trump would mean that Obama would be stepping into the election. He thought it’d be okay if he didn’t prosecute him.\n Now for proof that Trump is a rapist: I’ll give an example. Elizabeth Jean Carroll was one of the women he raped. She has photos of them together on the night and still has the dress she wore. It was the first time she wore the dress, and the last time too. On the dress is his DNA. All they need to prove Trump guilty is his DNA, but he refuses to give it to her. Why? Because he’s guilty.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bernie2020:)","title":"trash","date":"2020-07-09T19:24:57Z"}},{"id":"6177940931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"have🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄\nˢʰᵉˡⁱᵏᵉᵖᵃᵖⁱⁱᵃᵈᵒʳᵉʸᵒᵘⁱᵐˡⁱᵏᵉᵇᵃᵇʸⁱᵃⁱⁿᵗⁿᵒʳᵐᵃˡʳʳᵍʰᶠᵒʳᵉⁱᵍⁿᵉʳᶠᵒʳᵉⁱᵍⁿᵉʳᶠᵒʳᵉⁱᵍⁿᵉʳ","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"no❤️yeah❤️","title":"TERRIBLE APP!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T19:24:48Z"}},{"id":"6177940805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app just doesn’t work 👎 I was sitting on the toilet 🚽 and I went on the app and suddenly ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️Trump🍊 popped out of the screen and started twerking✨ and I was just so disturbed 😳 so I was like clicked out of the app quickly and I was like I’m not doing that anymore🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨\nSo the next day ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️ I was like let me try to go on the app again.
