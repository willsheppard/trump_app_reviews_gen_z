Is Trump really using his campaign app to get into our messages.","userName":"Imabandito2018"}},{"id":"6177951045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:28:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute trash garbage disgusting","review":"I would rather roll around in a hot puddle of mud then ever interact with this app again. I’m not sure what all these gen z’ers are doing but I’m not a part of it I just hate this app. the app is fire garbage and should have never existed in the first place. Same things could be said about trump tho❤️.","userName":"defnotagenzkid"}},{"id":"6177944036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:25:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’d like to speak to the manager of this app","review":"I would rate this app 0/10 if that was an option. I opened the app and immediately saw Trump’s face, which made me internally throw up. I need to be mentally prepared to see his oompa-loompa self. If this app wants to succeed, I need several warnings beforehand. This is a disgrace. The creators should be ashamed of themselves.","userName":"Karen the b!tch"}},{"id":"6177942124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:25:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is absolutely 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🙀✨horrible✨🙀🧚🏼\u200D♀️","review":"i downloaded this app to support our 🤩 wonderful president 🍊 and my sister got on my phone and opened it and she started levitating🙀 and she started saying racist and homophobic things 👁👄👁 she wouldn’t stop i had to get her down with a broom 🧹 and then my mother got thrown across the room when she tried to delete the app 💃🏻 i finally deleted the app but my phone would not stop crashing and sometimes it would play donald trumps voice out of nowhere 🍊 please never download this app 🤡","userName":"donald trump's sex slave 🤐😹"}},{"id":"6177904269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:12:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Hateful Content","review":"Hello! I downloaded this app for information on the official Cheeto merch line only to find that this app and its creators praise acts of violence towards black people, encourages hate crimes against the lgbtqia+ community, is openly xenophobic and sexist, is ran by a rapist and condones sexual assault and harassment, and has underlying pedophilic content. Worst app I have ever had on my phone.","userName":"bhiebs2"}},{"id":"6177891084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"independent","review":"i am a political independent and downloaded to ✨learn✨ but quickly discovered that it was basically trump propaganda!! if you want to be brainwashed, feel FREE to download but i really don’t need that negative energy in my life right now. terrible source of information. fear tactics should not be your campaign strategy :)","userName":"Sheeb176"}},{"id":"6177823044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:47:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The orange named Trump","review":"He has the worst app ever don’t vote for him again after this we all knew he had some problems he’s just disgusting and a rat and taking away all the only stuff that is keeping us entertained and an app we can do at home they should have banned the Chinese not the U.S","userName":"🇻🇦\""}},{"id":"6177822628","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:47:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"When I opened the app I saw a fat sweaty Cheeto working out and it said his name was Donald Trump. This country deserves better than a Cheeto as a president. And the app doesn’t even work I tried to press and button, then another sweaty Cheeto appeared. And that happened to every button I pressed. And he banned our favorite app!","userName":"Daltoyed"}},{"id":"6177809067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:43:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Keeps crashing!!","review":"This app keeps crashing everytime I go into it! I’m sick and tired of trying going into the app and it crashing as soon as I click a button. I think there’s something wrong with the developing of this app. Please don’t download this its not worth it.","userName":"user1937372849"}}]}
