First of all it took agesss to download like come on I thought this was the 21st century people! But as it finally downloaded I eagerly clicked and was startled by something on the screen resembling an orange with a blonde wig. What a fright definitely not kid friendly! 😱 The font was incredibly difficult to read and my eyes burned in my head trying to decipher the code. 😰 It seemed to be blended in our great country’s flag? It then asked for me to sign up and share my phone number. I was quick to hesitate 🤚🏻. How could I trust this app not to give my information to the most untrustworthy race, the Chinese! 😾I regretfully entered my number trusting the orange with the blonde wig. My phone was soon flooded with evil messages saying they knew where I lived and would come invade my country. 🙀 WHAT ON EARTH! It couldn’t be! 😣I was in shock this app is a disgrace!! I would never recommend this to anyone!! 😭 IT MUST BE A PLOY from the Chinese! They must be trying to get our numbers while pretending they are the mighty orange!! For the LOVE OF MY COUNTRY and to you good folk DONT DOWNLOAD!! 🥰😌 Stay Queens 👸","date":"2020-07-10T00:05:29Z"}},{"id":"6178707444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hehehehehehe","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"camicamp1233","review":"I got this app to support America and to know more about America but when I got it my phone started glitch I was like that’s weird so I shut down my phone and forgot about it then I wanted to watch tik tok and I turned it back on and saw the app so I was like oh I am going to see what’s worst with America 🤟🤨 so I went in and it asked me for my phone number ok normal didn’t think much of it until I got an email than went like,u have been stalked by the president I just thought it was a prank but got a little worried 😟 I went to bed and saw a flashing light I look at my window and saw two oranges then I noticed it was a butt I was like what the f the called my mom and told her and she said it was a dream I would never dream of an orange butt so the after I remember the text it was Donald trump and he broke in and almost killed me but I escaped now I live under a brige and hope I will never experience that agin not the killing part but...............seeing his face.🤢","date":"2020-07-10T00:05:29Z"}},{"id":"6178702803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"hOrIbLe (here’s part of the Shrek movie)🥳🎉💞🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥳","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ACE11😝","review":"Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.\n\nBut she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only \n\nbe broken by love's first kiss.\n\nShe was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing \n\ndragon.\n\nMany brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, \n\nbut non prevailed.\n\nShe waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest \n\ntower for her true love and true love's first kiss.\n\n{Laughing} \n\nLike that's ever gonna happen.\n\n{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}\n\nWhat a load of - \n\nSomebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\n\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\n\nShe was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\n\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\n\nThe years start comin' and they don't stop comin'\n\nFed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'\n\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\n\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\n\nSo much to do so much to see\n\nSo what's wrong with takin' the backstreets\n\nYou'll never know if you don't go\n\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\n\nHey, now You're an all-star\n\nGet your game on, go play\n\nHey, now You're a rock star\n\nGet the show on, get paid\n\nAnd all that glitters is gold\n\nOnly shootin' stars break the mold\n\nIt's a cool place and they say it gets colder\n\nYou're bundled up now but wait till you get older\n\nBut the meteor men beg to differ\n\nJudging by the hole in the satellite picture\n\nThe ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin\n\nThe water's getting warm so you might as well swim\n\nMy world's on fire\n\nHow 'bout yours\n\nThat's the way I like it and I'll never get bored\n\nHey, now, you're an all-star\n\n{Shouting}\n\nGet your game on, go play\n\nHey, now You're a rock star\n\nGet the show on, get paid\n\nAnd all that glitters is gold\n\nOnly shootin' stars break the mold\n\n{Belches}\n\nGo!\n\nGo!\n\n{Record Scratching}\n\nGo.

It was my mom saying she got an amber alert! I was like “okay” because I couldn’t be the next victim. Right?.... Later that day I was on TikTok watching funny things! I’ve had TikTok for around 2 years and it’s really given me something interesting and fun to do! I love Boku No Hero Academia and TikTok has a bunch of cosplayers that I SiMp for! Most of them refuse to move to Dubsmash or YouTube. It would make me really sad to see them gone. Anyway I was watching TikTok when I heard a spooky thump! I got up and went to investigate and I saw the human version of this app! It tried to kill me and it was SO SCARY! I ran as fast as I could to New York and now here I am. I’m in New York but I can’t stop getting texts like “we’re coming for you” and “We’ll find you soon!” I AM HORRIFIED. When they found me I help up my phone and showed them TikToks and they left! TikTok SAVED ME. I AM SO THANKFUL FOR TIKTOK!! 😱🥺","date":"2020-07-10T00:02:06Z"}},{"id":"6178697349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dinosaur train 🦖🧚\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"#oompa-loompa 2020","review":"the app took 420 hours to download🤬 and once i finally opened the app a bunch of zombie villagers 🧟\u200D♂️ started attacking me luckily i killed them with my telekinesis powers but then 11 from stranger things started fighting me and kept asking for her egos back 🧇 so i called her papa 👴 and he came and shaved her head again so i dipped and ran into the woods and the orange man started chasing me i started using my karate moves and drop kicked that mother f*cker then i appeared on a train and there was a singing dinosaurs and mr.doback was roaring in the back the big ol dino kept scratching me with his pointy toe nails🤢 so i cut thos mf off , i took the train home and went to delete the app but Charlie Bucket sold my phone for money😑 i would not recommend this app at all so not worth it.🙄💩👻and i cant find my golden boots😪","date":"2020-07-10T00:01:38Z"}},{"id":"6178696473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Protect Yourself!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Anti-Pooper","review":"I downloaded the app to support our great president Jonadla D. Trummpp. When first opening the app, you are asked for your mobile phone number. I did so, and IMMEDIATELY began being spammed by various numbers all from the DC area asking for a sample of my stool! I do not know why Trump needs my poopoo. I keep blocking the numbers but he keeps texting from different numbers and even got my snapchat 🙁 He won’t stop asking for my poop and I dont want to give it to him.
