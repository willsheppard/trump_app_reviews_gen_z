I thought it was alright so I allowed it. 3 minutes later I get a notification that my phone is out of storage. I check my camera roll to see my photos being taken up by the same image- Trump’s face photoshopped onto a cheddar cheese block and making a weird face like he has explosive diarrhea and the caption “Make America Grate Again.” He was also wearing MLG sunglasses.

Trump is a racist bigot only caring about his white supporters. That’s not what I want in my president. He ordered military guardsmen to fire upon a crowd of innocent bystanders. Even medical professionals. Being a veteran, I was taught that it IS a war crime to shoot at medics. I do not support a war monger. I honestly don’t know why he is even still trying to go for the presidency when he is supposed to be charged for war crimes. I have never seen such division in a country caused by a president. That’s not a president. That’s pure evil. I am not interested in politics but only in to help the POC community be safe.","userName":"bejcjnsbfj","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:32:53Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6174472039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is literally the worst app I have ever downloaded. First of all, I opened the app just to find an orange dusty Cheeto man. I try and access the app and it glitched non stop. I tried to see when the next rally was but it was then that I realized that I actually could care less. This app is so bad that I couldn’t help but delete it. The software is terrible, the app itself is horrid, the guy representing the app is even nastier, and I can’t believe that this app is actually out there for people to download! It’s awful. Worst app that I have ever downloaded on my phone.","userName":"LayLay823","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174407278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So i got this app because i like trump and i thought i could support him but then when i opened the app it glitched and i had fairy emojis all over my phone and let me tell you i am terrified of fairies. terrified. and so i decided to delete the app to maybe help stop the fairies from appearing but they were still popping up. I asked my friend who also likes trump and got the app and she told me it put orange dots all over her phone! and she is so scared of orange dots. So long story short don’t get this app! It will put your worst nightmare in emojis on your phone!😓😓🧚🧚🧚😭😭😭","userName":"kdigidydog","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:12:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I was so scared!"}},{"id":"6174339023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting some nice quality freedom and all I got was this overgrown looking carrot with his fist up. Just gross and so #nasty. It proceeded to ask me for my PHONE NUMBER! WHAT IN TARNATION?! ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR PRIVACY! After seeing this I immediately felt sick. The light amount of gray filter over the photo made me nauseas. They should think before they create an “accessible app”. Some of us just can’t stand it. I would never buy again. If I was forced to recommend this app I would NOT! Even to my worse enemy unless I was having a #bad day. Kids these days MY GOLLY!","userName":"A buyer of this product","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:50:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Literally a piece of garbage"}},{"id":"6174316203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"upon opening the app my phone immediately started emitting what i HOPE was some sort of steam, and it became completely unresponsive for a couple days. once i could get it to turn on again, i tried deleting the app so that this wouldn't be an issue anymore. for some reason there's no physical way to delete it? would love some help on this. my kids have a terrible fear of this man and hate to see the popups of his face while playing angry birds. this app is very violating and is NOT worth your time. would rate zero if i could.","userName":"shelfdust__","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:43:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"so many issues."}},{"id":"6174262616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when that rotten old orange 🍊 popped up it almost gave me a heart attack 😠😠 not cool I do not recommend downloading this app, it will definitely give you quite a fright 😨.

I opened the app in disgust to find the new Cheeto mascot. I looked in horror as I saw what they have done to the chips. I showed the picture to my friends and their hearts stopped in horror. They are in the hospital as we speak. I am disgusted with this app and it’s not a good one. My eyes feel terrible now that I’ve seen what I’ve seen. The doctors say I might go blind from to much orangeyness. Im stuuuuring to right these now as i spweak. Them say i mwight need glasses.
