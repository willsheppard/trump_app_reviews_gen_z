It seems like there is a nasty bug that is making it so I can’t access the really important info Donald puts out. I am so angry and this might make me vote for Biden. \n\nHe can’t even manage his own app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:57:39Z","userName":"Gigi9212"}},{"id":"6177261237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨You tried, never try again✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💋","review":"To see a homophobic, racist pig running for office makes my physically sick. You say liberty and justice for all but you really mean liberty and justice for whites.
