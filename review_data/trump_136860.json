It freezes and makes my phone crash. My phone is old, but I tried to uninstall and reinstall without any luck.\n\nDifficult to navigate, design is not appealing at all.\n\nI think the American people deserve better. Somebody should spend some money and redesign. I’m deleting and getting my Trump fix from twitter.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:21:22Z","title":"Terrible, slow, poorly designed","userName":"Kitty reviews","isEdited":false}}]}
