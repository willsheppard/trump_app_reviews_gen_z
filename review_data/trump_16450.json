I’m completely shocked at the content found on this app as it had an orange man with straw hair plastered everywhere. I’ve heard many things about this man as he thinks he’s superior for the color of his skin or his race?! This app was horribly laid out and had the worst set up i’ve ever seen. I would never recommend this to anyone, NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP! #genz","date":"2020-07-09T16:50:41Z","title":"Utter Disappointment","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177427789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"CateyBee 58732","review":"i have never been more unsatisfied in my life i downloaded this app to see trumps campaign and the app actually took 3 1/2 hours to download my first thought was my storage i check and i have plenty also when it finally downloaded all i could see was the bee movie script and things like this\n⬇️\n\nnow ᴘʟᴀʏɪɴɢ: Who Asked (Feat: Nobody Did) ───────────⚪────── ◄◄⠀▐▐⠀►► 𝟸:𝟷𝟾 / 𝟹:00\n\n:D҉O҉N҉T҉🚫 B҉E҉ S҉C҉A҉R҉E҉D҉,😱 C҉O҉M҉E҉ 🚶T҉O҉ 🗺️T҉H҉E҉ 👹T҉R҉E҉E҉🌳\n\n𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙞𝙨 𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮 𝙢𝙪𝙘𝙝 𝒶𝒹𝑒𝓆𝓊𝒶𝓉𝑒.\n\nwhy❓don't⌛we🔪just👽relax😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅radio📻 would👿you😼like💕EMMMM👹or🤪 FMMMM👺\n\nDorime👽itze👽emoh👽rataparae👽dorime👽amumu👽ameno👽ratedae👽lateedae👽moe👽dorime👽ameno👽olmena👽depadari👽ameno👽dimedae👽\n\nspinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬","date":"2020-07-09T16:45:28Z","title":"utterly disgusting🤩🥰","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177411238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"gianna😻😼😾","review":"This app is TERRIBLE. I give it one star. When I opened the app, my whole phone restarted and I lost all my data. (Contacts, pics, everything. I had it backed up in the cloud too!) Donnie J quit playing with me already😻😼 Also when I opened the app, electric charges were sent rushing through my veins and zapped my internal organs. Ouch! I don’t recommend buying this app! Please leave ONE STAR REVIEWS!","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:42Z","title":"I am bamboozled","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177393624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"*concerned citizen*","review":"Because it’s an app created by a political campaign it is getting a pass for some reason. Just because the creator is a campaign running for office does not mean it is acceptable for apple to allow this app to spread racism and fake news. By allowing it to remain in it’s current form apple is allowing itself to be complicit with the bigotry being spouted as fact on this app.","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:40Z","title":"Actively supports racism and misinformation","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177380947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ashleighgillam","review":"I downloaded to more easily look into his policies for 2020 and upcoming events, but it crashed almost immediately. I restarted the app and it completely shut down my phone. I don’t know much about technology so I just deleted it and decided I would look on his website instead. They have a lot to work to do on this app before I download again.","date":"2020-07-09T16:31:52Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177360994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"hannrae","review":"Everytime I opened the app it would crash and then my phone would be extremely slow until I shut down my phone and restarted it. I wasn’t even able to look at the content on the app because it couldn’t even stay open past the loading screen. Do not recommend","date":"2020-07-09T16:25:57Z","title":"This app is the worst","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177347841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"catmelons","review":"I don’t know what is was or if it’s just my phone, but it keeps crashing on me!!!!! I can’t get past the phone page without getting kicked off that app! I only want to see what the plans for the campaign where but I still can’t get past the phone page, I’m not apart of the gen z take down thing. I just want to know the plans....","date":"2020-07-09T16:22:09Z","title":"It glitches very very badly","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177316817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"achidanza","review":"I had high hopes for this app so I could get my information on trump 2020. I opened the app with excitement and anticipation 🤑. However, to my demise, I immediately lost balance  and collapsed💀. When I fell the image of our 🍊 orange 🍊 leader was in my vision holding hands with Kanye 🤮. As things started to get intimate🥵 I felt extremely corrupt and woke up to being drenched in my own sweat and urine😖.❌ DO NOT ❌download this app!! 🥶","date":"2020-07-09T16:13:32Z","title":"Nudity and violence","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177295308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"wants more shows","review":"This app is scary I opened it and I saw some scary orangeish pinkish ,Oompa Loompa looking monster i got so scared I almost fell of my dinasaur and landed on the moon please don’t get this app , It crashes and everything, Unless you want to see that scary looking monster .

So me being apart of Gen Z, I plan to ruin his life as much as possible. Then I heard he wanted to ban tik tok, for why? Because he is an orange that has a phat bussy and doesn't want to let Gen Z have fun. If he takes away what we love, we take away what he loves too","date":"2020-07-09T16:01:40Z","title":"Orange President","isEdited":false}}]}
