I immediately got up and opened my door to find Perez Hilton and Miranda Cooper lunging at me with large pitch forks! Miranda Cooper drop kicked me so that Perez Hilton could drag me into his 2008 Volkswagen Beetle by my left pinky toe. I screamed “HOW DID YOU FIND ME??” And was then informed by the driver (Tony Lopez) that the Trump app provided my worst enemies with my location. It was an extremely traumatic experience and I am still in the custody of Perez and Miranda.
