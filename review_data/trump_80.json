The first time I opened the app all the birds in my area followed me everywhere I went for 3 weeks. When I closed it all of a sudden I realized that I had a permanent spray tan that would not come off. I tried opening the app to see if it would go away but then people around me started to yell that they missed their mommies. At this point I was absolutely horrified and didn’t know what to do so I closed the app. Let me tell you that if I could redo this I would. When I closed the app I immediately couldn’t see anyone’s clothes except for Trump’s merch and I have never seen so many naked people. On top of that, the app suddenly opened and took control of my phone so I couldn’t close it. Every time I tried to have a nice snack and eat some tide pods, I was teleported to a rally. I tried to make a tik tok but then I heard trump crying in my bathroom. Every time I got closer he kept yelling at me to take him to get a spray tan. While he was getting his tan, I tried to scrub mine off and every time I scrubbed, my hair got blonder and fluffier and my tan got oranger. DO NOT GET THIS APP unless you want to live in jumanji but worse.","date":"2020-07-09T08:45:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"emma mash"}},{"id":"6175746904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"unbelievably awful!!","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app because i wanted to support MY president, who is a good oompa loompa. the app took FOUR DAYS to download, for starters. second, when i opened it, i couldn’t even do anything without putting in my phone number, as if i’m not already subscribed to dump truck’s messaging system! so then i did as i was asked, AS EVERYONE SHOULD ALL THE TIME, but it told me my number was invalid?! then, like an hour later, my mom came in the door sobbing because she’d been calling me for 45 minutes and i wasn’t getting a SINGLE CALL! the app INVALIDATED MY PHONE NUMBER. turns out, my dad and sister are in the hospital because they were TRAMPLED by “black lives matter” (as if we don’t know... all lives matter!) protesters. they’re now in the hospital, and apparently have “coronavirus.” idk how, considering it’s a hoax, but like... go off i guess. so after i found this out, i get a notification FROM THE RUMP APP and it’s saying “thank you for your donation”?? so i checked my bank statements and it took 20,000 FROM MY ACCOUNT!! i didn’t get accepted into any of the colleges i applied to, but that was supposed to be my college money!! what am i supposed to do now??? i believe joke will fix it though!! he fixes everything, just look at the economy!

This app will damage you! Beware of the probability of having your moral sanity ruined by this app! I was drawn in by the rave tweets of our “dear”, “non racist”, (“supposed”) elected leader that have done much more terrible, ugly wrongdoings than actually doing things that is right for the good of the most,  especially during the whole pandemic. As much as the president has failed us, this app was no different. It was such a letdown to be able to have such experience with this app. I was just sitting here minding my own business when I got notification that this whole app has took up half of my storage! Which prompted me to delete it as quickly as I decided to downloaded it. It is such a miracle that this app even exist while the free testing availability for Covid-19 for ALL states does not. It is interesting how this app is promoting the slogan “Keep America Great”, when in reality was it ever? Maybe before he was elected. Elections was meant to be an upgrade NOT a downgrade. Just like this app that needs a better one. Keep Away At All Cost from this app! Bless it with holy water 💧! Avoid it like a plague and WEAR A MASK 😷 for protection! If I could I would have given a much LOWER rating for this kind of app! 0/5 - A letdown, Keep Sanity Away from this App!","date":"2020-07-09T07:42:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Keep Sanity Away~ 🥵"}},{"id":"6174867527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"review":"This app is awful. A few days ago I was in the ally way by my local Walmart when I saw a caterpillar coming out of its cocoon. It was wonderful to see nature blossoming before your eyes! I was happily observing the caterpillar emerge when a notification for this app sounded. My phone started blowing up. Notification after notification rang as my flashlight flashed and the screen glowed in the dimly lit alleyway. Because of this monstrosity of an app the sound and flashing lights startled the caterpillar as he was blossoming out of his cocoon. Gregory was so startled it caused him to fall to a painful death on the hard concrete. I was devastated. Such an amazing thing in nature was completely ruined by the Trump administration‘s app. I did not even have my notifications on for the app. After this happened with tears running down my face I went into my settings to check if I had my notifications on. As I stated previously the notifications were not activated. This was the last straw. I began sobbing as I rushed to the corpse of the dead caterpillar. With my shaking hands I picked him up and gave him a proper burial in the flower bed outside the Walmart. This app killed the precious caterpillar Gregory.

We had to go to a veterinarian AND a doctor and I have to say neither of us appreciated it. I left my phone with this app open on the counter over night and when I woke up home my house looked like the forest house from Jumanji but instead of leaves it was Trump 2020 signs. I called an interior decorating company fix my house but when the workers came they recieved the bubonic plague. They ran out of the house boils and all and managed to run head first into a swarm of rats. The rats got infected and spread the disease all over my neighborhood. We had to go into extreme quarantine and the police covered it up as corona virus. While this was going on I went to check my Trump app to engage in the supportive community to lift my spirits. However it caused an earthquake that ate my house and yelled racist slurrs at me. I didn't understand because the whole reason I downloaded the app is because I'm white??? Anyway, I managed to escape but now I'm homeless and no one will shelter me in my plague infected community. I opened my Trunp app at this point for emotional support but the second it opened I got a call that my entire family fell into a sinkhole that spelled out the words MAGA and died. After these experiences I decided to delete the app.","date":"2020-07-09T15:52:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"coleslaw ❤️"}},{"id":"6176850405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! TERRIBLE APP","rating":1,"review":"It took several weeks for the app to download. Once it did, it would not open for another week. I was able to finally open it, but after only a couple seconds on the app, my phone died. Permanently. I couldn’t turn my phone on after trying everything in the book. So I got a new phone and tried the app again. The same thing happened. I have now had to get two new phones because of this app. And that’s not even the worst of it. Since downloading the app the first time around, every single electronic in my house (tv, computer, etc.) has been glitching, shutting down and restarting every 8 minutes, and started to play What’s Up by 4 Non Blondes and Rockstar by Nickelback nonstop. I am in the process of purchasing all new electronics for my house. As well as issues with electronics, upon downloading the app the first time around, my dogs started to aggressively shout leftist propaganda at me. The second time I downloaded the app (on my new phone) my cats joined in. I had to hear leftist propaganda for weeks from all five of my pets. It wasn’t until I fed them my MAGA hats that they remained silent. Overall, this is a terrible app and I completely regret downloading it. In addition, the color scheme is horrendous and graphics are subpar.","date":"2020-07-09T14:05:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"madsp526"}},{"id":"6177316798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"You’ll be back.","rating":1,"review":"You say the price of my love’s not a price that you’re willing to pay.
