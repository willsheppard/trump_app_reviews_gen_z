It glitches a lot on my phone for no reason. Not only that it took forever to download. Also maybe if Apple took this app down maybe they can fix all of the flaws with that app and there’s a lot of flaws!

And second off yes I can vote 🤦🏾\u200D♂️🤦🏾\u200D♂️😂😂 since people want to use that as an argument. Third off there is audio recording of him saying he sexually assaults women and whether trump supporters like it or not there are documents proving he sexually assaults kids as well.

You would think that with the amount of money that the trump administration wastes on unnecessary things, they would at least be able to successfully develop an app.","userName":"$susan Bates","date":"2020-07-08T15:37:04Z","title":"Kept closing"}},{"id":"6172717491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app DOES NOT WORK. It took HOURS to download despite all of the storage on my phone. It was laggy it glitches out and the app it self wasn’t even helpful. They send too many notifications and quite honestly all of the information on this app is so biased.

He tells lie after lie, and he wonders why Gen Z doesn’t like him. We could’ve been free from quarantined long ago if we just took precautions, but he chose not to. Then he agrees with laws that charges people for not wearing a mask but I have never seen him wear one. He likes to talk about unemployment rates but now they are the lowest ever.","userName":"DVaughn02","date":"2020-07-08T15:27:27Z","title":"“President”"}},{"id":"6172660570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app glitched so many times.
