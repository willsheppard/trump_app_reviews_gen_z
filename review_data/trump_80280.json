That was until I downloaded this app, only for it to tell me that I was STUPID! Horribly offensive! Citizen harassment! I planned on walking my cat to the food carts today to get a bubble tea, but then remembered my car is no longer my car. It’s actually John’s. I miss John. John if you’re reading this. I’m sorry things turned out the way they did. Please give me a second chance. I didn’t mean to cheat on you. STONKS. I didn’t mean to type that. You were a shining light in this dark world. Please come back. Anyways, the app told me I was gaining weight, which is sorta true. I won’t lie. These past few months have been hard on my no-stretch jeans, but I’m trying alright. I’ve been working out more. But this app didn’t seem to care. Apart from that, it gave me very simple information which at times, was difficult to understand. I mean as the great Kevin would say “why waste time say lot word when few word do trick.” Certain words were in all caps so I would know which words to REALLY read and UNDERSTAND. Amazing and genius nicknames having to do with sleep were also in the app. VERY original. The only good part of the app, was when I got to delete it. Seriously. It was so easy. I just held down on the little icon on my home screen, selected “delete app” and it was gone FOREVER. 0/10 would not recommend, but I have to give it at least one star. The one start is for the easy removal of the app❤️.","date":"2020-07-02T08:02:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed but not surprised","rating":1}},{"id":"6146313804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Taterbell031212","review":"After I downloaded this app my phone became cursed and looked like Cheetos anyways trump is a racist and a pedo \nVote trump OUT 2020","date":"2020-07-02T01:05:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"He’s a pedo and a racist","rating":1}},{"id":"6145786952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Her_Jams","review":"My eyes started burning as some as I seen the cover page","date":"2020-07-01T21:30:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6145777533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lun.!🤓💗","review":"I absolutely hate it.
