After taking DAYS to download, I entered the app and allowed notifications. Each day I would receive 50-100 notifications!! Even after turning off notifications, I would still receive 50+ alerts. A few days past, and my phone shut down due to the overwhelming amount of alerts. My phone sat on the charger for a week before it could turn on again. The first thing I did when I got back on my phone was delete this app and go on TikTok. TikTok helped me recharge after this excruciating experience. Thank goodness my phone wasn’t permanently broken, and thank goodness for TikTok; however, I hope this review was helpful in guiding others to not download this app.","date":"2020-07-10T00:55:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178837414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","userName":"bejsbagjfbskaj","review":"As one of the biggest trump supporters and a proud American 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇨🇳 I was extremely disappointed with this app. As soon as I downloaded it which took about 59.250006796 hours. It began changing my background to trump and making Siri verbally assault me all night with trumps voice saying make America great again!?! Now don’t get me wrong I love the slogan but I also like my sleep. As soon as I tried to delete it my phone jumped out of my hand 🤭 I ran to catch it but it’s fast orange legs caring it safe away outran me😳??? Eventually it jumped into the lake and swam far far away😕. I miss my phone and I will not be putting my trump 2020 sign out anymore until it is returned by Donald J Trump himself. -1,0000/5⭐️  for me thank you very much 😑 literally any functioning adult 2020!","date":"2020-07-10T00:55:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178836557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"my life is ruined😭","userName":"donld duck fvk it","review":"when i first downloaded the app it’s literally took 5 hours then i clicked on and it was just a whole bunch of p*rn like everywhere u clicked and the top of the screen read “kids like trump ;)” and my daughter saw it and now she goes to therapy also it asked for my credit card number so i put in the last 4 digits and i got an email from my bank that all my money had been deposited for “taxes” and now i’m poor and have absolutely zero money.it also asked for my adres so i put it in and i went out to go to a trump rally came back and everything in my house was gone and there was only a note that said “courteously of donald duck” in it. i don’t understand why this happened i was just trying to show some love and support to te best president the united states of america has ever had and now my life is ruined.this app has taken my money my belonging my child’s youth and my will to live from me.","date":"2020-07-10T00:55:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178831499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"EDP445 2020‼️‼️‼️‼️","userName":"rororirjjjfij","review":"Took nearly a day to download and it is all FAKE NEWS so I am now edp445 2020/kanye2020","date":"2020-07-10T00:53:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178829656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER. 😤😤","userName":"itsrealAlbert","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","date":"2020-07-10T00:52:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178829219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump you nasty Cheeto puff ew","userName":"Rarest stresses","review":"Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gen z is after you!
