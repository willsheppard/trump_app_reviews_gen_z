[He] also was grinding with multiple fat women. When you left crying at Klutch, Ron was holding hands and dancing with a female and took down her number.

Come to find out that Trump’s running mate is a flaming homosexual! He’s probably made passes at every man in the Oval Office...even my tangerine prince😭.
