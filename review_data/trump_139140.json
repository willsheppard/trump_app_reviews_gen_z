I got this app back on April 20th, and this app took 2 weeks to go finished downloading, but I didn’t mind it that much since I had to go to the hospital 🏥 to check if my microwave had my pizza🍕 ready. After the 2 weeks were up and my lights were fixed. I had to register, and it took several hours to do so, and it also asked for a lot of personal info. Not just name, birthday🎂 or address, no I’m talking this app would ask me for my ssn, birth place, and I had to even show a picture of my lawn, which I hated. After all of that, I had to come up with a password, which wouldn’t be to hard, if there wasn’t so many  requirement, like the password must contain, 2 captial letter, 3 letters, the poop 💩 emoji, 3 ?’s, the name of my first born son, 2 Greek letters, Batman symbol, and so much more. When I was finally able to make a password after 4 days of trying, I was excited 😆 to see what was in store 🏬 in the app, and it was a whole bunch of stuff talking against LGBTQ+ 🏳️\u200D🌈, immigrants, and much more. All of this combined with the fact that this one☝️ app, takes up 69% of my data, I decided to delete this app, and destroy my washing machine, so long story short don’t download this app. also miss my washing machine.","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD, reason why is explained here. 👨\u200D🔬😆🤔🍕🤐🏳️\u200D🌈🙏🍕🦔","userName":"IRIS Almighty","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:40:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179645625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this to “support him” and it makes you put in your credit card info.
