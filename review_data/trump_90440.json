Then one day I was on a walk and my phone started to smoke. I was so confused and shocked I threw my phone to the floor. At first I thought it was maybe something wrong with my Apple phone in the software, but then the unthinkable happened. A hologram of President Trump shot through the back lens of my camera, his cold soulless eyes stared back into me while I fell on my knees to the floor. I screamed as tears sprang from my eyes, I begged him to not hurt me. It was to late, his orange jaw unhinged & he began to sing opera music. Neighbors opened their windows to see what all the ruckus was and the second they laid eyes on the hologram their bodies melted to the floor leaving just their skeletal remains behind. Never before have I seen such chaos. Fires sprang up in random places all over town scaring women and children into hiding. The worst of all was the rats. His opera singing attracted thousands of them they were in a trancelike state and all of them were wearing miniature Trump merchandise. They marched through town ransacking everything, they stole all the food and destroyed the corn supply our town economy survives on. The last thing I heard from the hologram was “this is for not making in app purchases.” Slowly I lifted my head up from the ground where I had been covering my eyes. The booming town I had once been apart of, was in shambles. Please, I beg of you, do not get this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173716361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:02:10Z","rating":1,"title":"Disgustingly Useless","userName":"purplebanana765","review":"To many nude pictures of trump for my taste.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173707294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:54Z","rating":1,"title":"🤮🤮","userName":"anon's wifey","review":"bunker boy got scared that we weren’t following his every wish like drones so he threatened to ban our app well boohoo you messed with the wrong generation","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173690340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:52:41Z","rating":1,"title":"That worst app to ever exist","userName":"👁👄👁💫🦋","review":"This is app is worst than our president.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173678598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:48:25Z","rating":1,"title":"would not recommend","userName":"Alexandria trovone","review":"terrible app, all apps matter","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173676239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:47:32Z","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"EMMA 1856203","review":"this app almost KILLED me!!  worst app ever designed.

This was fine and all but when she left I noticed the app still hadn’t downloaded and it had been 17 hours I proceeded to wait 27 more hours for it to download and just as I was about to cancel the download it finished. I thought I was good but when I opened the app I heard a loud clang outside THEY DROPPED A WALL BARRIER AROUND MY HOUSE!!!! When I asked why they simply said I was taking other peoples jobs and left. I went inside realizing that at least I couldn’t get CORONA but then I heard a noise upstairs and went to check it out it was a man who looked roughly like 🍊with hair that looked like 🌽 I was very worried because I realized he was that racist rapist I saw on the news. I started to run and he ran after me screaming DRINK THE BLEACH!!!! IT WILL SAVE YOU!!! I don’t know what this meant so I kept running then I hit the wall barrier and fainted. When I woke up I saw the ugly man looking over me with a flute in his hand, he started playing it and suddenly a bunch of spiders crawled out of his hair they climbed all over me and started biting me. I got up again and tried to run but the man stood in front of me and dropped his pants next thing I know I’m staring right at a mini 🍤. THIS was the moment where I died. I was just too traumatized at that point. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT get this app unless you want to die but honestly I’m just glad I’m out of that situation","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173607877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:23:10Z","rating":1,"title":"worse app ever❤️","userName":"jojo2277865","review":"barely functions right and i do not support the way it goes","isEdited":false}}]}
