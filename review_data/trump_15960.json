I never had such issues before! I tried to restart my phone, but it didn’t resolve the issue.

After I put my number in... I got messages from this Cheeto puff asking me if I was a minor. Then, I was sent a picture of a Slim Jim in a microwave.. then, I was sent a foreigner video.

I called paw patrol to help me recover her, but as as soon as they showed up she was sitting in the fridge!!! Then when she finally woke up we went to the Krusty Krab to get some grub and all the Karen’s were there complaining about how the floor boards had hair in them. Anyway would not recommend. My brother and cousin said grandma has never been the same.","date":"2020-07-09T02:20:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP!!","rating":1,"userName":"Cadence O :)"}},{"id":"6174636446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is by far the worst app in the history of the planet. It tried to steal Santa from my basement along with his reindeer. It was about 7 pm and I was going to feed Santa a for the first time that day. And when I went down the stairs to the basement there it was. My Dino nuggets crushed on the floor and the app standing on top with a knife forcing Santa into the bag. I quickly pushed the app away and was going to finish it off but it sadly got away😞","date":"2020-07-09T02:18:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Stealing Santa!!!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Santa keeper"}},{"id":"6174608037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, let’s just start by the fact that this app is always glitching and never sends you notifications about what’s going. Not only just that but this app well quick you out constantly when you are reading the news. It’s not near worth you downloading it. It’s just useless.
