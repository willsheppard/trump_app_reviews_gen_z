Messes up your phone's browser and deleted all your pictures","review":"The title is sorta self explanatory but first let me get into the app. The whole premise of this app is hateful and bigoted, reflected in the user interface which is truly hellish and awful itself. It changed all my other contacts to Hamberder and deleted my pictures, only to replace them with some hamberders and other stuff. It kept crashing and freezing my phone and directing me to a trump website and being terrible and awful. No i'm not no gen Z spam reviewer, but seriously this app does reflect american history of blood, hatred and racism and this is not a thing apple needs to support. Donald trump is bad for us","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"69okboomer420","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177100896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Information farming?","review":"I downloaded this app to support my president and it will not stop asking for information from me? I entered my phone number and email to receive notifications but soon it asked for my credit card information. I was going to donate anyway so I did but soon the app asked for information I did not think was appropriate to share, such as my children’s names and my husbands occupation?! Eventually my children’s school information! I though CHINA was the country constantly asking for data from the Greatest Country in the world? I am very uncomfortable sharing such private data with ANY app, and am suspicious of what is being done with this information.","date":"2020-07-09T15:12:10Z","rating":1,"userName":"fhdbsbjajai","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176869277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The absolutely worst app ever. (Where’s the anime?)","review":"I literally came here to watch anime and The Office. This is the worst streaming service ever. All I saw was Trumps face a couple hundred times. WHERES NARUTO. WHERE THE HELL IS NARUTO. I’m very disappointed. Lucky for me I have Netflix but this is completely fake advertising. I looked at the reviews and pictures of the app and I thought this is what I was going to get when I downloaded the app. No anime no Office. Plz fix this. Unfortunately I know there is plenty of other people who are struggling with the same thing and I want them to be able to watch anime and not be tricked into purchasing and app. \nJust a side note not related at all to this app or review but all I have to say is, TRUMP 2020","date":"2020-07-09T14:10:04Z","rating":1,"userName":"Griffin John Kelly","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176610057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT GET","review":"listen donald is meant to be with me ok but his evil wife is keeping us apart she just doesn’t get him like i do! take this one time for example, they’re on the phone fighting about some joke he made that upset her but she just doesn’t get his humor like i do, and i can hear them cause his bedroom window is right across from mine. but i don’t stand a chance cause she wears short skirts and i just wear tshirts! she’s like a cheer captain while i’d be on the bleachers, just dreaming about the day that donald would wake up and find that what he’s been looking for has been here the whole time!! HE BELONGS WITH ME!!!!\nso long story short don’t get this app because it’ll just remind you of what will never be 😫😭😥","date":"2020-07-09T13:01:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"purplelove6","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176540386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER CREATED","review":"first off, this app took a total of four years to download!!!!!!! I did in fact get this app to support the best president on planet earth but this app... i’m not voting for him anymore. When you first open the app it takes three weeks for it to actually completely load and that’s if you never leave the app. Then, you get a death threat saying that if you delete the app that donald trump himself will come and track you down. well now i’m stuck with this app BUT IT YAKES UP SOUCH STORAGE SPACE. i wanted to make a yt channel but my phone had ful storage cause duh i use it a lot. ofc i knew that i couldn’t delete this app so instead i deleted e. v. e. r. y. other thing on my phone AND MY STORAGE IS STILL FULL. DONT BUY THIS APP!","date":"2020-07-09T12:42:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"App_ Reviewer","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175989482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD 😖","review":"First of all, it took 3 weeks for me to download but once I finally got it I was met with a blinding white light!! 😡😡😭😭 I am now visually impaired and I may go blind!!\n\nI mean I was on board at first when trump said white power but I didn’t think the app would take that literally! 😳😳 In less than 3 seconds it had drained ALL of my battery and made my phone EXPLODE 😔😔😫😭😭\n\nHe almost forgot to call me the n-word too on my way out before my phone exploded!! but I guess he had other things to worry about...Like retweeting white supremacists, protecting statues of traitors, and giving murderers more money for their hard work!! To be fair it is hard covering up your war crimes so I am impressed too😳😳😖😫😫","date":"2020-07-09T09:58:59Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jyuuno","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175954766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORIBBLE APP !!","review":"this app is horrible and whoever made it should go to prison 😡 when i opened the app i saw an orange???? i thought this was a political app not a fruit app 👎 anyways it asked for my phone number which was invasion of privacy so i put in the mental illness hotline since this cheeto of a president definitely has one. then i got an email saying my family was going to be deported?? i was very confused since they were citizens here but i ignored it. then the president sent an all lives matter protest to my house !!!! i dropkicked them all and then went to delete the app. i do not recommend this disgusting app. anyways black lives matter, women are not objects, and lgbtq+ relationships should be normalized and respected 🥰🧚\u200D♂️❤️","date":"2020-07-09T09:47:33Z","rating":1,"userName":"Lizzy Lin","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175951985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the child in his basement","review":"dear all potential downloaders,\n     do not download this app. only a few minutes after downloading this app, i had the extreme urge to inject my self with bleach and disinfectant. unfortunately no one stopped me, and that is why i am writing this review to inform you all that i my name in fact is Hannah Baker. i must let you know that Baron Trump is indeed a liberal and is in grave danger. His father, Voldemort, has tried time and time again to brainwash him, but he is unsuccessful in his attempts. Dolores Umbridge is also sadly working with he who must not be named to brainwash the poor soul, Baron, but to no avail. my final request to you all is to please, please, PLEASE, arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor.\n     Love, \n     Colin Kapaernick","date":"2020-07-09T09:46:38Z","rating":1,"userName":"emily geraghty","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175810667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sad news...","review":"Unfortunately as much as I wanted to support the commander of the US, it is regrettable that I have to report that the app is actually fully of data mining from foreign countries.   As soon as the app launch it copied all of my personal information to foreign databases outside the USA.  Normally I wouldn’t be too concerned, but since the Trump administration just advised against the use of TikTok because of foreign data mining within that app, I will not be able to recommend anyone download this app in the future because of privacy concerns and foreign countries stealing our private information.   This is illegal and should be considered a break of national security.  :(  extremely sad and angry about this discover.","date":"2020-07-09T08:59:42Z","rating":1,"userName":"E - N","isEdited":false}}]}
