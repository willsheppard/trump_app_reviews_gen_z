Seriously? “Sleepy Biden?” Clearly the target audience are immature individuals who are too ignorant and narrow minded to consider facts or analysis for the election. They give into rhetoric constructed for infants! Is that was Trump thinks of America? A large group of idiots?? Anyways, despite the obvious moral flaws this app is also so ugly I can’t bare to look at it. The minute you open it up it hits you with all the need to log in. I can’t even get information now without my information being logged. Trump, you’ve managed to do it again, give us absolutely nothing. But what do I expect, the country is essentially an a broken place with a diamond necklace around it.","title":"Questionable"}},{"id":"6176783129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Toilet God❤️","date":"2020-07-09T13:47:23Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is sooo bad. I downloaded this app then I started having all my Jesus candles light up and then my dogs started talking to me saying that I downloaded this app and now satan is in controlled of all my toilets. I started to gather all my Jesus candles and my bible and started reading it and shouting verses out loud. Then my dogs told me, in order to get control back over my toilets I would have to delete the app. I deleted the app and my toilets are back and normal. My dogs and I are now safe and now I thank my Jesus candles and my wise doggies 😌❤️\n\nStory part 2\n\nI downloaded this app then all the lights went out then I had to find a candle then someone knocked on my door I opened it one was there then I saw trump in the garbage can swing about the n my face and now I’m in the hospital I demand to Donald trump to pay my medical bills and fix the whole in my door I hate this app do not download","title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6176665360","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fir3132","date":"2020-07-09T13:16:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! the first thing that happened was my phone got HACKED! HACKED I TELL YA. the app sent me my own address and said that if i didn’t support our most definitely non racist, non homophobic, non misogynistic, non antisemitic president, they will assassinate my family. it was downhill from there. they kept sending threatening texts about even killing my dogs. how evil! just now, i got a text saying theyre holding my tony stark limited edition pop funko hostage. ive only had this app for a couple of days and theyve taken my precious hostage. the ransom is something i cant afford and the pop funko isn’t available anymore. something odd i also noticed is that he asked for my number. he shouldn’t because im a MINOR but that’s what he likes, isn’t it? minors? plus he’s married and only attracted to his own daughter. in conclusion, do NOT download this app.","title":"stinky, very bad 👁🤮👁"}},{"id":"6176066987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fjgdicnjen","date":"2020-07-09T10:23:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I’m sure someone worked very hard to create this app, they shouldn’t have🧚\u200D♂️💐💗. Please DO NOT download this app. I have had so many problems and to be honest this app has me scared. Ever since I downloaded this app, I have been haunted by giant trump teletubies. They are mean, short-fused and know way to much about self tanner. Please if you care about your sanity and safety you will not come near this app or trump for that matter. If you do then I’m sure all of the ignorance that has manifested itself into this app and our “president” will spread to you too. This app has false statements written all over it. I mean trump come on, “keep America great?” Just because you turn in the assignment to the teacher doesn’t mean you actually finished, or in your case even started it. I wish I could give this app zero stars cause if I’m being honest one is far too generous.","title":"MADE ME SICK 🤮"}},{"id":"6175396593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"klyn1133","date":"2020-07-09T06:28:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"when I first downloaded the app, it went through all my photos and deleted them. not only do I hate this app but I very much hate the what the app is for. there is no need to have an app that supports a human being who has such racist, sexist, and homophobic views of our world. calling a Mexican-American an alien and assuming that they crossed the border to come to this “wonderful” land illegally is just so beyond words I can’t even explain. not only does he purposely put women down for simply speaking, he could care less if they get raped when they’re in the military. and he treats African-American less that a human being like we are living in the 1700s. I could truthfully care less about this little boy and what he represents. and if any American supports him, they are just as racist, sexist, and homophobic as the man who is supposedly making “America great again”","title":"terrible terrible app!!"}},{"id":"6175086265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"No nickname is working so","date":"2020-07-09T04:34:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app was absolutely terrible! I was looking through the reviews (which are here because of this app) when suddenly my dog took off running! I was so distracted reading these reviews (which are here because of the app) that I ended up losing my dog! So I had to get into the car, alone, (i’m 14 btw) and drive to go find her. I got pulled over by the cops and was asked for my license. I pulled out my dad’s license and i was then escorted out of the vehicle. I tried to explain to them that I had lost my dog because of these reviews (that are provided from the app btw) but they wouldn’t believe me! So I had to go to the police station and was farces to wait until my parents came to pick me up. I was scolded harshly and yelled at. And this all happened because of these reviews (that are here because of the app btw). I still can’t find my dog either. Tragic story.","title":"NO!

He spoke and I didn’t recognize the voice and i was TERRIFIED. I bolted across the room towards the door but it was locked. No way out. The man stepped out of the shadows, and ladies and gentlemen it was none other than Barron Trump himself. “Help,” he whimpered. I felt a single tear drop down my cheek. Fear, maybe. Pity, probably. I grabbed my concealed shotgun (thank god for the second amendment) and shot the lock to bust out of there. However, Barron and his giraffe legs were not far behind. I realized that if downloading this terror of an app made him appear, deleting it might make him go away! I turned around, whipped him with the shotgun, stole his wallet(best decision I ever made) and used my magical App Store fingers to delete the app and write this review. For legal reasons this did not happen","title":"Terrified"}},{"id":"6174945068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"EllaBellaBooBoo130116","date":"2020-07-09T03:50:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When I first opened this app acid shot out of my screen and blinded me. Then I tried to go down the stairs and get help but I fell and broke my neck. The doctors were able to restore some of my eyesight and when I went to open the app again I saw Donald trump fully nude on my screen. It was traumatizing and I am scarred for life. I’ve also been told that this app steals a lot of your personal information so watch out for that. Also this app isn’t dairy free which was a big surprise to me. GEN Z IS TAKING YOU DOWN BUDDYYYYY HAVE FUN IN UR BUNKER😘😘😘but seriously this app is actually trash it’s super glitchy and the design is actually terrible so don’t waste your time getting it or just get it and leave a bad review bc it’s really helpful for the developers I’ve heard also Donald Trump is racist misogynistic xenophobic homophobic a pedo and also he raped kids so yeah don’t support this orange man!!!!","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174927385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LIVia0805","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:48Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"내 맘대로 해\n뭘 하거나 말거나 쉬거나 we gonna\n뭐든 내 깡대로 해\n쉽게 다 깽판 치고서 다음 판\n하나씩 다 깨고 제패하게\n뭐 내키는 대로 눈에 보이는 걸로\n하지 뭐를 해도 내겐 좋아 보이고\n내가 고른 것에 후회 따윈 없어\n걍 닥치는 대로 골라 가지 let it flow\n동서남북 어디든지 다 부숴버려\nI don't care 어쩌라고 걍 마이웨이여\n챙길 물건 없이 lose your mind\n남들이 뭐라 해도 so what\n엎고 놀자 먹고 놀자\n어떤 말이 오가든지 live your life\nYeah 뭐든 제쳐버려 다 knock out 마치\n느낌이 가는 대로 play it now 마치\n어딜 봐도 너무 easy\nI just make it easy\n다 다 다\nI make you say wow\n뭘하든 말든 뭘하고 살든\nLook at me now\n다 엎어버리고 가\nI make you say wow\n선빵을 치든 깽판을 치든\nLook at me now\n다 쓸어버리고 가\nCome and watch me now 언제라도 난\nI'ma make it look, make it look, look so easy\nCome and watch me now 어디서든 다\n당황할 거야 할 거야 it's so easy\n싹 다 뒤집어 놨으니까\n이젠 좀 여유롭게 놀까\n날 향한 혼란은 절로 가\n독하고 독하고 고독했던 시간은\n금이나 팔러 가\n바람 따라 가다 보니\n원한 대로 말한 대로 다 돼 이렇게\n쉽게 되는 일이 없다는 말 의심스러워져\n의심병이 돋아 호기심을 자극해요\n엎고 놀래 엄마 몰래\n다 엎고 놀래 모두 놀래\n야행성이라서 밤에 날라다녀\n야행성이라서 밤에도 곡 작업\n마법의 성에서 마법을 부리고\n마성의 소리를 어디든 내뿜어\nYeah 뭐든 제쳐버려 다 knock out 마치\n느낌이 가는 대로 play it now 마치\n어딜 봐도 너무 easy\nI just make it easy\n다 다 다\nI make you say wow\n뭘하든 말든 뭘하고 살든\nLook at me now\n다 엎어버리고 가\nI make you say wow\n선빵을 치든 깽판을 치든\nLook at me now\n다 쓸어버리고 가\nCome and watch me now 언제라도 난\nI'ma make it look, make it look, look so easy\nCome and watch me now 어디서든 다\n당황할 거야 할 거야 it's so easy\n잘난 척은 허풍 겁만 먹고 뭐해\n용감한 못난이가 싹 다 역전해\n판을 키워보자 네가 원한 대로\n아님 내 식대로 엎고 가 (let's go)\nLet's go\n엎고 놀래 엄마 몰래\n다 엎고 놀래 다 다 다 다\nCome and watch me now 언제라도 난\nI'ma make it look, make it look, look so easy\nCome and watch me now 어디서든 다\n당황할 거야 할 거야 it's so easy","title":"Stray Kids- Easy 🧚\u200D♂️🍀"}},{"id":"6174910207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"うhっっっっっjk","date":"2020-07-09T03:39:39Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I am 15 and I’m in high school.
