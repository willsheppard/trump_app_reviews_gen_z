And as soon as I opened the app I felt a burning sensation down my spine. I was frightened and decided to close the app. As soon as I did my dog began speaking to me in an ancient Romanian language. I hurried over to google translate to try and understand these strange words. And it roughly translated to “defy the rapist”. I had heard allegations of trump being a child rapist, but I brushed it off because even though there are actual documented reports of it, I just know he wouldn’t do such a thing. So I ignored my dog and just shoved some treats in his mouth. I’ve found that that method of parenting may not be ideal actually, because my dog now very closely resembles a barrel. But anyways I decided to open the app again and the burning came back and I saw a long shadow figure standing limply in front of me. My dog began to whimper and cry, and run away but not before he collapsed under his own fat. I screamed and ran and scooped up my little snowball doggy and ran out of my house. The demon like being chased me down the street. I saw it under a street lamp and realized it had bright orange skin and was wearing a maga hat. “Hungry” it sighed. I didn’t have any food on me so I put my dog forward as a peace offering. It snatched it up and ate it! I then ran back to my home and realized I had left the app open. I clicked my home button to go harass some left kids on tiktok, and when I did, the burning went away. Now. With all of these events having occurred during the time where the app was open, and it all ending when it was closed, has lead me to believe that this app is cursed. I will now be suing for the death of my beautiful little fat snowball doggy. I am enraged and will not be voting for trump 2020 anymore. Thank you and goodnight.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136359594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Joyuu_","date":"2020-06-29T15:25:46Z","title":"ew","rating":1,"review":"this app is horrible not only does it crash every time i use it but it keeps showing me a crusty cheeto right in my face","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136202086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ofcitsyanna","date":"2020-06-29T14:38:43Z","title":"Cannot believe this 🤬","rating":1,"review":"just disgusting....","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136135995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tiiiiiiktokkkkkk","date":"2020-06-29T14:20:02Z","title":"Very bad","rating":1,"review":"you tried✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰 don’t do it again 💫🌈💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136078026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"I lvoe the app","date":"2020-06-29T14:04:01Z","title":"terrible president","rating":1,"review":"as soon as i opened the app it started glitching. would not recommend. plus he’s a terrible president anyways😌","isEdited":false}}]}
