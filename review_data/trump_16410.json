I downloaded it to support our amazing President, but then I read an article that my cousin Becky put on her Facebook wall. THIS APP IS BEING USED BY THE LIBERAL SNOWFLAKES TO PRANK OUR PRESIDENT! They take the data and make into some kind of meme! They’re using it to get him kicked out of office! All my Trump 2020 people, do our great President a favor and DELETE THIS APP! Then give it ONE STAR! The Liberals will NOT ruin this country!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6178469073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:31:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Waywaywaydownsouth","review":"This app is AWFUL!!!! Not only did it slow down my phone, but the absolute drivel that this “app” is peddling gave me a VERY SEVERE case of eczema. My whole body is BRIGHT red. Ironically, when I put on my anti-itch cream, the red turned into a disgusting orange. I look like I’m covered in a cheap fake tan. Is this the goal?? What kind of brainwashing and bodysnatching GARBAGE is this CR”app” trying to indoctrinate upon us??? I DEMAND the removal of this treasonous dumpster fire of an “app” IMMEDIATELY.","rating":1,"title":"ThisGaveMeEczema"}},{"id":"6178426583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:15:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ken Kaneki👻","review":"When i got this app i expected to be able to get updates about the president!!!!!

Then after I decided that I need to make sure everyone knows that this app is terrible and we can’t use this app for four more years. I hope everyone is able to realize that if were to continue using this app it would completely ruin the United States.","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6178383658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:58:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kiki_karen","review":"I was really happy for the first day and I was really happy with that I could help the president, but the second day it had a really bad glitch which took all of my money in my bank account.

This app constantly crashed and refused to function correctly when in the presence of my black friends. Although this app was really helpful at connecting me to the bigots and racists in my area, it did not send me a schedule for Klan meetings. Overall, this app is extremely unhelpful and a waste of phone storage.","rating":1,"title":"Mediocre"}},{"id":"6178335340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:40:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ousmaboss","review":"So basically the reason why I am here is because Donald trump said he would sleep w/ his daughter.

There is certainly nothing to do on this app. As a trump supporter, I want to know what my president is doing! This app however, only shows and tracks Biden’s work. Let’s also note that this app looks and presents itself as if a 7 year old designed it. I am embarrassed to be a Trump supporter and I am beyond ashamed to be affiliated to this app. Fix it, or you’ll lose a vote.","rating":1,"title":"Trash"}}]}
