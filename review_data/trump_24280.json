My daughter was on this app frequently and I believe this is the reason she became a radical liberal! We cant let our kids be mind controlled!

The software is awful and it downloaded a virus onto my phone and now it overheats all the time. It keeps crashing. -10/10 do not recommend. Also vote this man out of office:)","date":"2020-07-08T17:46:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6173124627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JulezRulesz","review":"Every time I opened the app, my phone would glitch. Every so often, though, the app would work only to display a horrid picture of some man. It haunted my dreams and honestly nothing good has come to me since I downloaded this app!

I downloaded it trying to find a reason trump would be a decent president but i just found more reasons to hate him. TRUMP IS A HOMOPHOBIC RAPIST AND RACIST GARBAGE CAN IN THE OFFICE!!!!!! I don't understand how separating people from their families and deporting people who were just trying to work and have a better life for their children makes trump a good president.","date":"2020-07-08T17:39:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"😡"}},{"id":"6173120517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bye ❤️","review":"My life was perfectly normal until I downloaded this app but the second I downloaded it I felt this pit in my stomach and I realized that I was hungry so I went into the kitchen to get some food and there was no food I was starving and as soon as I deleted the app all my food came back I will never download this app again 😭😭","date":"2020-07-08T17:39:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"IT ALMOST STARVED ME TO DEATH"}},{"id":"6173099364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Amellyya","review":"Every time I would open the app, my phone would crash & power off.
