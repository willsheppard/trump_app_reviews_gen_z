I signed up for the text messages alerts and he kept asking for money saying that he would triple my donation and I even got messages from “Don Jr” saying his father wants to meet me. All very manipulative and very wrong. Trump also wants to ban free speech and is starting to sound like a fascist. so i will be leaving this horrible review on this app.","title":"Fascist","rating":1,"userName":"Vict San"}},{"id":"6172508094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:38:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the most terrible and awful app out there. First off if people actually download this app to support a rapist, racist, and just a bad person in general they are out of there mind. Don’t get me wrong Trump is great leader only because he gets people to follow him and vote for him but what he does after he has his followers is he hides and doesn’t try to be anything more than what he has to be and even less sometimes.","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"🧿➖🧿"}},{"id":"6172493950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:34:21Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app took forever to download and it started playing music which attracted a lot of attention from my neighbors. They ended up calling the police for a noise complaint which was not fun. I got fined because I wasn’t able to lower the volume and when the app finally downloaded, it was horrible. It asked for a lot of personal information and it doesn’t even tell you important news.","title":"Horrid.

I am honestly disappointed in the app. The app is full of fake news and in my own opinion, the opposite of patriotism. I wish I could say better things. I would recommend getting your information elsewhere. I don’t recommend this app, it was a waste of time and energy and I guarantee you will be disappointed as well. We’re also in 2020 and this app is way behind the current times.","title":"Disapointing","rating":1,"userName":"ntrej004"}},{"id":"6172293529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:39:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app will completely DESTROY your phone.
