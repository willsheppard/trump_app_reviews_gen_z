If he is not playing it 24/7, he will suffer major injuries!!! Mr. Bubbles had his iPad plugged into an outlet so it wouldn’t die on him. I was sitting on the couch next to him when I came across this app and decided to download it, as Mr. Bubbles is a loving bunker boy fan. I clicked on the download button, but I soon noticed that it was stuck buffering. Then, out of no where, my battery percentage just started plummeting! So I ran to my room to grab a charger. I ran back down and plugged it in as fast as possible. I was relieved, because I thought my phone was gonna die. Then, my phone started to flicker and the little sparks started to come out of the outlet in which it was plugged into. The lights in the room started going crazy. I heard one last final click, and then everything was pitch black. Since my phone was plugged into the wall, it short circuited, causing it to shut off. Terrified, I looked over to see Mr. Bubbles violently shaking. My worst nightmare had come true. His iPad had also short circuited, causing the device to turn off. Along with his candy crush game. I screamed in terror as I saw Mr. Bubbles fall to the ground, blood dripping off his lips. I called the emergency unicorn hotline to get Mr. Bubbles to a hospital. We barely just got there in time. Ms. Gallyumpus, my unicorn’s doctor had said that if Mr. Bubbles would have arrived a second later, he would have passed. Now he is in agonizing pain due to this app. What a shame, and to think my unicorn would ever support someone who would do such a thing to him. Much therapy will be needed for Mr. Bubbles, but I do not think he could ever over come the fact that he almost died. I am sorry, but due to this I can only leave a one-star rating.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:47:17Z"}},{"id":"6175749785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"😱😱😱😱😱😋😋","title":"THIS APP HURTS CHILDREN","review":"WORDS RELATED TO DISGUSTING\n\ndistasteful, vile, horrific, scandalous, objectionable, vulgar, loathsome, creepy, odious, outrageous, nasty, abominable, hateful, awful, gruesome, shocking, obnoxious, repugnant, shameless, stinking\nThis app is disgusting 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:38:45Z"}},{"id":"6175737851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"obamasbirthcertificate","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","review":"This app took all the money in my bank account and donated it to planned parenthood","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:34:43Z"}}]}
