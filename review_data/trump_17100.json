I was greatly disappointed. There was a lack of information to create an account as well. The app kept on lacking, dying, and over all let me down. I expected information but there was none of that too. Over all, DO NOT get this app, you will be disappointed.","userName":"Amity Knox","title":"WORST APP EVER!!

I opened it again and my Other social media platform started acting weird. All I wanted to do was get updates on the presidential campaign but now my phone is acting strange. This never happened with any other app. I do not recommend this app. At all, not worth your storage.","userName":"Noniisawesome","title":"Horrible!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:08:08Z"}},{"id":"6174795003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app this banner popped up and said I had the “China virus” and that if I didn’t leave i would “spread” the “China virus” into the app and it started making my microwave beep like crazy so I ended walking to my fridge and grabbing my milk tea from earlier today and started heating up my bahn mi (which is a Vietnamese sandwich basically). I then opened up Netflix to continue watching my ~Chinese~ drama :)","userName":"Kklblubuster45","title":"Worst app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:05:53Z"}},{"id":"6174781283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely horrible, my phone was PERFECTLY fine and when I downloaded this app all of a sudden my phone started to glitch???

It took all my battery away the second I opened it. The content was horrible and there were many grammar and spelling mistakes. Then when I went to delete it, it wouldn’t leave because it thought that I was rigged and was spreading fake news. I wish I could give this a 0 out of 5 stars","userName":"you got zoomed","title":"All Apps Matter","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:54:11Z"}}]}
