The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal: BEEP. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound: DING. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.","title":"STINKY POO POO APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6174892511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"weewee peepee kaka","review":"Next week I was at the store with my little sister that‚Äôs older then me by a few months and we were getting crackers for are cheese but I don‚Äôt do crack, and I don‚Äôt like the 49ers and I don‚Äôt like cheese I‚Äôm not 6ixnine so we went to a different store down the street but it was the same store we just went back in, and we seen a guy doing a magic trick and make the card disappear but then a cow spawned in the store and I got on him and he had wings so we flew to my house but I owe money to the irs so the bank took my house so I went to the farm to live with the cow awith friends","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174879709","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Viper9789","review":"I downloaded this app with my grandma so we could find out the next location of the trump rally so we could support the big man in charge. We ended up being met with trumps big body being spray tanned along with his tiny shmeet! It was so vile I ended up vomiting up blood! My grandma had a heart attack!! So we emailed them the complaint about the app and trump came to our house with his twin the annoying orange and called us thugs. Then, he proceeded to roundhouse kick my grandma out of her wheelchair and into the wall he built!! He also spit on me and gave me the coughcough!

My entire house was robbed by bandits dressed up like trump. Once it was on my phone my entire phone broke, shattered into 1 million pieces. My dog ran away and my cat moved to another country. This app should be eradicated from the face of the earth to ensure safety and protection for all. This app will cause the San Andreas Fault to break, and because the guys are in Yellowstone too irrupt plunging us into a eternal winter. So for the safety of not only this country but for the rest of the world this app should be gone.","title":"JESUS didn‚Äôt die for this app","rating":1}},{"id":"6174843489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:20:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alexasrate","review":"Being the president and how he is, I was dying to see his amazing app, cause I am a ‚ÄúDIEHARD REPULICAN‚Äù I would do anything for Trump, when I see anything I mean anyTHING. But this app made me have diarrhea and puke for days, the things they teach on this app made me want to cry myself to sleep. I ended up going to the hospital because of it. I‚Äôve never seen anything worse and the overall design makes me want to barf. I cried and laughed at the stupidity of this man. I will be voting blue and returning my karen voice. I now pledge blue for life. This app made me wish I wasn‚Äôt a republican and that‚Äôs a big thing.","title":"I‚ÄôVE NEVER SEEN A WORSE APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6174833298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:17:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"1758425783","review":"It is the worst app on the App Store I really do suggest to not get it. I never write reviews on apps but this one is just horrible. Like it‚Äôs about trump like that should say enough! If you want to ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù then shut up stop saying that Bc America has never been great since y‚Äôall white ppl showed up and took over. Y‚Äôall need to educate yourself and grow up. Yeah I‚Äôm taking to you KAREN! Trump is the worst person ever! And it‚Äôs not a opinion it‚Äôs a fact. Also I saw that ppl where getting glitches from the app in other reviews so yeah that‚Äôs also a problem.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174814557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:11:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"goBiden2020","review":"This app is very very very very disappointing. I‚Äôve never been so disappointed by an app in my life. And I‚Äôve downloaded tinder before. This is even moreeee disappointing than tinder. Anyways, as soon as I opened the app it started glitching and running extremely slow. At one point I opened the app and it kept showing me these pictures of a Cheeto puff in a wig and telling me to go back to Mexico. I am so dissatisfied with this app. Do not download it. It‚Äôs just a waste of space and time. Thank you for coming to my TED talk everyone and remember to never download this app!!! üòòüòöüòÇ","title":"Garbageeee","rating":1}},{"id":"6174734864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:47:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cas121212","review":"This app was the worst to download. It was so glitchy and made my phone shut down several times when I would try and open it. Honestly tried to give me a virus. How do we know this app isn‚Äôt trying to steal our data with this glitchy app. I don‚Äôt trust these apps anymore. Trying to steal information from my phone. I thought I could trust an app coming from the Donald Trump but it honestly seems like he‚Äôs the one trying to steal data. I can not believe this. I will never even think about downloading an app from him anymore!","title":"This app is so bad","rating":1}},{"id":"6174728201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:45:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"howardddfffffffdddddd","review":"immediately after downloading this app I got a terrible virus on my phone that added a toupee to EVERY picture of a person. it must have some sort of facial recognition software built into the virus. it also immediately began giving my phone number to dangerous organizations who will not stop spamming my texts with hate messages and propaganda. this app is absolutely awful it has stolen all my data and now I can‚Äôt look at instagram without seeing a toupee on the head of every friend and loved one. I think this is giving me serious long term trauma.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD ITS A VIRUS","rating":1}}]}
