Out of nowhere the lights started flickering, the stove went on and the refrigerator started pulling out fries 🍟. It couldn’t be the app cause that would be impossible so I kept using it. I went to sleep that night and the next morning I woke up to a whole stack of French fries. There was no one in the house and the kitchen was clean so I went back using the app. Little did I know that the once I opened the app again the stove went on and the refrigerator pulled out more fries. I thought it was a sign telling me I needed to eat more and in my head I’m like “SO YOU THINK IM SKINNY!!!” So it made so many French fries that I had to throw some out cause I trying to be  a SKINNYYYY QUEEN!!!!! So I do not recommend getting this app cause it makes French fries out of nowhere!"}},{"id":"6173292876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"live love trump 2020","date":"2020-07-08T18:35:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","review":"When I downloaded the app it took about an hour for it to completely download which was odd because typically when I download an app it’s much faster (at least a minute or so of downloading time). Once the app was finally downloaded I wasn’t able to get it to stay opened on my phone. Anytime I clicked to open the app it would kick me out. After restarting my phone it stopped doing it every time (but still every so often it would just kick me out). Additionally, everything in the app was glitchy. If I clicked on anything I would have to do it multiple times for the click to actually register on the app. This might be because the app cuts off a lot of the menu buttons making it hard to even see the menu.  It also doesn’t scale correctly on my phone which is really frustrating."}},{"id":"6172785641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"salona moans","date":"2020-07-08T15:56:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT download this app🤢🤢","review":"The first time I tried to download the app it just wouldn’t work. The 6th time I tried downloading it, it finally worked but then when I got into the app I was trying to learn about our president trump, but then it kept kicking me out, trump didn’t even set up the app right why have it in the App Store if it’s not going to work right and also I finally got to read a little about our president trump and it kept glitching instead of it showing the articles it kept glitching and showing trumps nudes! I was absolutely disgusted I deleted the app immediately I almost threw up gagging in disgust I cannot believe it would show such a thing on there I believe this whole app is a troll I can’t believe someone allowed that app on the App Store I still have it in my mind and I’m so disappointed. Worst app I’ve ever downloaded don’t download it."}},{"id":"6172585578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"user27944)","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Unbelievable 💔","review":"When I first opened this app I watched a video about people making hats, I was really confused because it had to nothing to do with Trump, (the new messiah). I tried to get out of watching the video but the app glitches where I couldn’t click any button or get out of the video, so I had to watch the rest of the long video. I was very confused because I thought the video was an ad at first, but later on I found out it was part of trump’s app. I was wondering how it had something to do with his campaign, and after lots of research I cane to the conclusion that trump has started to make hats for people who sunburn easily, which is an amazing cause that he’s helping! However I give this app a one star review because of the lack of organization because I had to research his campaign and the app didn’t give me important information whatsoever."}},{"id":"6177538109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dfagzccsgdhd","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏽✨ 𝐴𝑛𝑦𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑏𝑢𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑝 2020✨🧚🏽","review":"It’s the worst app I ever downloaded using Apple this is the worst it literally took three weeks to download this app it is so bad it took all my storage I only have one gigabyte on my phone I had to delete my all my good apps and pictures it’s horrible I could not open it it keeps on glitching you need to take down this App The app is so sloppy I can’t touch any buttons like even if I try to delete it it doesn’t give me the delete button the delete button keeps on glitching whenever I press it I can’t believe it you need to take down this I’m getting so mad this is astronomical this is not acceptable especially from Apple I expect more from iOS absolutely if I could pick zero stars I would definitely do it ✨🧚🏽𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑘𝑖𝑛 𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑒✨🧚🏽"}},{"id":"6177401909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump's Little Girl 💗","date":"2020-07-09T16:38:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Virus","review":"I was initially skeptical of this app when reading the other reviews but I decided to give my WONDERFUL HANDSOME LOVING President a second chance 🧚\u200D♀️😌 However, upon downloading the app, I found that all of the reviews that I believed to be spam were correct!!! This app not only asked for very personal information, making me extremely uncomfortable, but undoubtedly hacked into my phone!! Now none of my apps work and my phone keeps playing the Black and Yellow on full volume at all hours of the day 😫 Please, If you like your phone (and your freedom, rights, equality, basic human decency, morals, etc) do NOT download this virus. I can only hope that the apple store does its job and takes this horrendous app off the store so nobody else can be effected by the Cheeto Man’s plague. Have a wonderful day Gen Z 💗\n\ngive us tik tok back or you’re going down with us 🤗🧚\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6177295583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"the queen gabbie hanna 👑","date":"2020-07-09T16:07:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The worst app to exist in the universe 😌🙃","review":"I was told that when I downloaded the app, JJ from Outer Banks would show up in my bedroom. 🥵😌 sadly I waited days and he still hadn’t arrived. 😿 I thought he may have been busy mowing my lawn (shirtless of course) but he didn’t seem to be there either. 😥😿 on top of that, the soggy 🍊Cheeto 🍊asked for my phone number and I know that he is in a serious relationship with his daughter. 😌 I did not want to interrupt anything between them so I simply deleted the app. I would not recommend bc everyone knows the Cheeto is not a cheater and he is very happy with his daughter.😆 my final words r....”I climbed outta my head and watched myself implode a thought without a body ought a be the shot to take a load off ur brain is poison and I’m searching for the anecdote but every time I try my defenses scream o no u don’t...woah”🍊😳😹😿😸😸😼😼😼😿😿😾😹😹😽😿😻😺🙀🙀"}},{"id":"6177184653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"People call me a Karen","date":"2020-07-09T15:35:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"it made my phone crash and gave it a virus","review":"Hello,\n\nI downloaded this app with high expectations, but was instantly disappointed. First of all, it took 7 hours to download, which I thought was absolutely absurd and unnecessary. Secondly, when I opened the app, it crashed and disappeared from my screen. I kept trying to open the app, but each time it continued to crash. Giving up, I tried to delete the app to re-download it, but it wouldn’t let me delete it. Then, out of nowhere all my other apps started to delete. My phone was completely wiped, besides the Trump app and the iPhone’s original apps. I am outraged! All of my apps, contacts, messages, etc. are no longer on my phone. This app has or is a virus, so I’m warning anyone trying to download it, DO NOT! Unless you want your phone to be affected by the virus and hacked, do not use."}},{"id":"6176914104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"CheezitVlogz","date":"2020-07-09T14:21:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE 😭🥴🍊","review":"So I downloaded this app to keep up with the ✨ n e w s ✨ little to find out that the app had a tracker on it!! So then when I found out that 🍊 t r u m p 🍊 knew where I lived I immediately deleted the app.  When I did weird things started happening though.  I looked around my room and started seeing orange peels on the ground, my bed, etc.  after a couple days it kept happening. 😭. I have a ✨ p h o b i a ✨ of oranges so trump and the orange peels were very spooky to me.  After a week of deleting the app I got a VERY scary sleep paralysis of trump and he was putting orange peels all over my body.  Then I woke up to find the orange peels EVERYWHERE AROUND MY ROOM!!!  When I woke up and got out of bed I passed out. I had to go to the hospital and get a surgery because the orange peels ended up traveling through my nose, mouth, and into my body.  I am now paralyzed 😍 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! 😭👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6175967686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"realegeno","date":"2020-07-09T09:51:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"MISTAKE DOWNLOADING THIS TRASH APP","review":"this app is one of the worst apps ever!!!!
