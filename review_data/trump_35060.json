It wasnt the fact that he wears more bronzer than I did to prom, or the crude things he says like “grab her by the p*****”, or even his extreme incompetence. No, it was this app. Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177282763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"vibecheck69","date":"2020-07-09T16:03:52Z","title":"Horrible app!","review":"I opened this app and it was disgustingly cluttered with junk!
