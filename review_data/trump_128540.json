This app took sooooooo long to download, and, once it was on my phone, everything went wrong! I was hacked when I first opened it and after dealing with that problem and then going back into the app, there was lots discriminatory and racist vibes I was picking up from the contents of this app. Not only that, but when I tried to delete it, it wouldn’t take the hint and tried to redownload  once more! A program such as this app that, from the looks of the other reviews, is not wanted again and should somehow take a hint and not redownload again! That would just be common sense when major mistakes were made by said app and no one wants it. I’m afraid that the initial download of this app caused problems to all who had downloaded it almost immediately and is just for show. Please delete before November 3 where it may cause more damage to those who download it. Anyways, BLM✊🏽, eat the rich👎🏽, Pride rage😡🏳️\u200D🌈, hope you can’t sleep at night Mr.President and fix that ugly Oompa Loompa crushed jumbo marshmallow thing you’ve got going! I seriously can’t look at you without snickering and I hope those last pieces of dry Spaghetti sitting on top of your head finally give up and fall off! GEN Z RULES!🔥🔥🔥","title":"Not worth it!

So I was like, imma renegade my butt to the App Store to leave this review. AND THENNNNNN, I was like you know what, I'm going to give this app a second chance.... THAT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE, just like the Cheeto himself! The app asked me for my number, and I said no cause I’m too good for a Cheeto and wouldn’t let me in so I could hate, I mean love my stupid Cheeto 😡 and since I wouldn’t give them my number I couldn’t get in 😢 I really wanted to hate, I MEAN LOVE HAHA (that was definitely autocorrect) but for these reasons I will not be able to cry anymore because I wasted all my tears on this....","title":"DISCUSTING AND VERY OFFENSIVE"}},{"id":"6176796219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:50:48Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Vigue123445678","review":"This little rapist made me download and app and it took 77 hours to load and also follow me on TikTok @vigue.8 thx","title":"Donald Trump app"}},{"id":"6176793137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:50:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Rachypoo1774884$/\"603850","review":"This app is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced, it took 2 weeks to download and then at the end it wouldn’t let me open the app until I said, “Yes Father Trump May enter and control.” Things just got even worse from there, it is constantly telling me that I should talk to my doctor about getting Valium. It makes no sense. I’ll get notifications that just say things like FEAR. And 20% OFF PRETZEL WOULDNT IT BE GOOD. I don’t even know what the function and purpose is. Terrible design for /interface/. You should <end/> this app right away I mean <stop\\>!","title":"absolute dog sh*t 🥳💕"}},{"id":"6176790068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:49:12Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Unapuppy 🦄🐶","review":"First of all the download took almost 3 hours!!! When I finally got into the app it wanted to know my location!!! When I pressed “No” it glitched out of the app and told me I had to pay 100.000 to continue and I had no option I then turned my phone off and when I got back on it all my apps were gone!!! Even settings and the App Store! I had to take it to the apple store and they told me the app had a virus!!! Apple reset my phone and it was back to normal but all my data was lost. Even all my photos in which were old photos of my dog who passed away THOSE WERE THE ONLY PHOTOS I HAD OF HER😖😭this is why I strongly recommend NOT getting this app (hopefully this app is taken off the App Store)","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}}]}
