DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!

Trash. This is a restriction our freedom of speech. This is our first amendment right. And as for those of you respecting his decision claiming that it’s for our own good in addition claiming that our data and safety is being transmitted throughout China and Hong Kong? Apple Samsung and Google phones have extensive protection to ensure that our data and personal information will not be used in the wrong hands.This all boils down to the presidents ego, or what’s left of it. Furthermore making this a restriction of our freedom of speech and opinions and political beliefs. In addition may I remind you that four people died from Ebola under Obama‘s administration and he was repeatedly harassed to be taken out of office, however 134,000 Americans have perished under trumps administration due to COVID-19. One of which was including my own father. Due to trumps incompetence our cases are starting to spike back up. Trump fuels the fire for people who believe that masks are a choice however it has been scientifically proven that they limit the spread of COVID-19 almost triple. IN ADDITION The people who support trump chat “my body my choice” when it comes to wearing facemasks to prevent a deadly disease, however when a woman wants to have an abortion due  health problems or any issues they claim that abortion is murder. However when women protest for their bodily rights chanting “my body my choice” it’s an issue. This doesn’t even take into account the child trafficking sexual abuse, misogyny, racism, and xenophobia that this man has contributed to the world. Donald Trump is fueling a fire of a burning democracy. A vote for him is a vote for a less progressive country and world.","userName":"GianaRiveraaa","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:14:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Why is this man even still in office?"}},{"id":"6177908922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so👎i🤦\u200D♀️downloaded😾this🤢app😻because🤩i😳wanted😎to😽see🙅🏾\u200D♀️my💀favorite😐cheeto😔that👁was🥺donkey😭kicked😃in💔the😑throat😗only😋to🤪see😕a😱foreigner😰video😴oh👽mighty🎃lord💩gave👿me👻the🤖strength🤭to😧pull🤯myself😤together😣and😠not🤗throw🥶myself🌚out🌝my⚖️house🕳window🧿right🤔then😮and🤒there🤮","userName":"Ma'khyla","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:14:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"my eyes"}},{"id":"6177908325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿Donald Trump","userName":"Jessica9236","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:14:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"J"}},{"id":"6177907700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came to this app so that I could write a review abt our ✨orange✨ president.

I was walking on the street and old pervert men were screaming very racist things. As I got back to my car it was covered in Trump 2020 stickers and flags and merch. I was very scared I couldn’t even see while I was driving my car which caused me to get in a very big crash. Trump supporters ripped me from my car and dragged my body across the freeway causing me to have more injuries. The democrats came to save me Biden himself.But the trump supporters were ripping me from limb to limb showing me explicit photos of the president himself while doing so. Screaming for my phone I deleted the app & all was normal.","userName":"Paige Lowrie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:12:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Tragic  experience"}},{"id":"6177904359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ggguysjshioi","userName":"jean philippe ramau","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:12:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gfff"}}]}
