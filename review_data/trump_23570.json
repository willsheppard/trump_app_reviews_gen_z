I have never seen such an app. I was promised freedom and peace once I signed up but did not get any. I am tired of people not caring for the greater good of their consumers. Seems like it could use a few changes.","title":"This app doesn’t deserve my energy or time"}},{"id":"6177262649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:58:02Z","userName":"Luca The Bazooka✨","rating":1,"review":"This app was just like the president and made in his image, which I thought was amazing until I realized that he is racist, sexist, and a disgusting being not worthy to be called a human. The app itself does not work! Whenever I open the app it spews nothing but racist slurs at top volume :( \nI expected better from a man with an IQ of 70.","title":"Terrible :(("}},{"id":"6177199218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:39:41Z","userName":"hiImHallie","rating":1,"review":"This app hardly FUNCTIONS.
