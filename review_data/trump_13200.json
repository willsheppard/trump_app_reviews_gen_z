When I first opened the app, I was greeted by a picture of Donald Trump flipping me off! It was extremely unsettling and showed me who he really was. But, that wasn’t the worst part. I clicked on the tab “events” and all it had was trumps pooping schedule 💩🤮. This man is disgusting and a disgrace to our nation. This is a terrible app."}},{"id":"6174120528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:32:54Z","title":"so dissatisfied😔","rating":1,"userName":"hoefordaveed1789","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this app in hopes of being enlightened by our orange king, the pedo... i mean ...president of the untied states, but after listening to Daveed Diggs’ absolute banger of a song Chapter 319, the app just wouldn’t open😳 i was so excited to be reading everything about  MY president, but one listen to daveed and the app never opened again😔🤟 i guess something about “donald trump is a white supremacist” just doesn’t sit well with the programming, idk might be a glitch"}},{"id":"6174111719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:29:38Z","title":"WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS !!!!","rating":1,"userName":"TheLightSkinnedMexican","isEdited":false,"review":"DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP !!!!! I downloaded it to see what our smart and woke president had to say and my phone was immediately overwhelmed by the amount of nonsense that was on this app. So much so that it gave my poor phone a seizure and to top it all of it got the worst virus ever imaginable! \nI had to buy a new phone. Apple needs to do something about this app because it gives everyones phone a virus and makes some people very stupid and close minded!"}},{"id":"6174085045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:19:51Z","title":"The worst app I have ever used!!","rating":1,"userName":"sophie.ecker","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened this app expecting to have a pleasant experience but that is FAR from what I got. I have never been so shocked to see such a horrific layout. As a member of the IT Academy at my high school, I know what a good functional app looks like, and this just simply is not it. I am terribly disappointed with Trumps tech employees for putting this piece of crap together and actually expecting people to enjoy using it! Absolutely disgraceful!"}},{"id":"6174081787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:18:57Z","title":"everything wrong with the app","rating":1,"userName":"NANABANANA113","isEdited":false,"review":"To start off the app was disgusting, when you open the app it showed this racist, homophobic, and rapist.

Ever since I downloaded it my phone has been getting hacked. They’ve been taking my money from my bank accounts, hacking my social media, I’m scared they’re even watching me through my phone.
