It took forever to download and made my phone glitch really bad. \nOnce I could get in and be in for at least 5 minutes I noticed how horrible of a president he was. He couldnâ€™t even handle a pandemic. \nWhile the cases go up in the US the rest of the world is handling the virus a more effective way.\n\nHe is a horrible president and this app is crap.\n*DO NOT RECOMMEND*","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T15:59:41Z","userName":"k.aren890"}}]}
