My eyes are burning. I am nauseous. I find the little oompa loompa tangerine character that it’s centered around to be distasteful, gaudy, and unrealistic. Do they really think that a racist sexist little imp would be elected as president? Laughable. Please take this off of the appstore so that I may once again sleep at night. May God in all her glory have mercy on your soul.","userName":"Thou who shalt play games","title":"🤢 who comes up with this stuff","rating":1}},{"id":"6174474904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:32:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"right when i opened the app i had horrible flashbacks from my childhood 😦🙀 and seeing trumps orange 🍊 as$ face made it 10x worse. 👹 ever sense i downloaded the app, i’ve been have nightmares of james Charles😾and Shane Dawson 🤮 watching me sleep🙀😡. i’ll never recover from this horrible experience 😰.

Who the hell is gonna say oh there better be a trump update or I’ll be dammed. On a side note I’m pretty sure no one even uses the app. They only look at the notifications and that’s it. No one even needs this. Want the latest political news. How bout news stations which give better info. This app is useless and unneeded case closed.","userName":"thatonegreenzombie","title":"Horrid and useless","rating":1}},{"id":"6174461095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:28:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"How many times do I have to keep saying this??? This app not only has 2 day shipping which is too long but also gives off dictatorship vibes which is not what we gonna do tonight. That being said, Barron is still mine and I will marry him one day, Manifesting it rn and we speak and if you genuinely like trump, you all give off kaitlin Bennett “pick me” vibes again and uncle iroh says acab and blm so yeah that’s an L for you but great day bye:))","userName":"ok572","title":"NO AGAIN","rating":1}},{"id":"6174459748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:28:15Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I woke up went on my app and turns out this app is possessed by SATAN himself and he tried to convince me to sell my soul in exchange for Bernie winning 2020 election and I was like alright that’s a good deal but then it turns out I’d accidentally already sold my soul to someone else and Satan didn’t really know what to do so we both went our separate ways and needless to say I am definitely never opening that app ever again","userName":"Lalacvhhkk","title":"0/10","rating":1}},{"id":"6174450465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:25:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i wish i could give it zero stars. i opened the app to see the orange big man playing golf in short shorts which caused me to vomit and i couldn’t stop throwing up until 4 hours later. it also Had some very insulting things on there. I also ended up getting a text message from trumps peoples calling me a fat pig!! if you have a stomach don’t get it or you will be puking up everything. 😡😡😡😭😭😭","userName":"scared throw up girl","title":"AWFUL!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174446723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:24:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I’m honestly just so appalled that this app exists. The second i opened the app, i saw an expired cheeto wearing a cheap wig. It scarred my eyes, and i am currently blinded. The reason I can type this right now is because the power of Gen Z is within me. You should only download this app so that you can write a horrible review. I don’t support an app that is made for a homophobic racist rapist that is somehow our president. Get rid of this app, it’s a safety hazard.","userName":"ella :>","title":"no","rating":1}},{"id":"6174439900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The Cheeto man that I’ve seen I don’t appreciate at all, I didn’t like it, I didn’t sign up for it, it’s quite disgusting. I was just overall very offended by everything possible in this app and I was hurt by how my black fellow Americans and lgbtq friends were hurt because of this app and I just really think it needs to be taken away as soon as possible. It’s hurting too many people. ✌🏼✌🏼😜","userName":"poofdog#2","title":"Absolutely not","rating":1}},{"id":"6174423063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. I think it glitches out because of the ugly face I see when I open the app. It’s looks like a traffic cone with a piece of fuzz on the top is staring at me. Phones aren’t meant to handle all that ugly on the screen. I’ve been traumatized and we need this app to be gone before many others could be possibly traumatized too.","userName":"too much cheeto dust","title":"Satan himself would be disappointed","rating":1}},{"id":"6174410468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:13:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I first downloaded the app because I was curious on what is going on politically. This app is for glitchy and it is terrifying. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! It is the scariest thing known to woman/man. I was not impressed with this Cheeto on the screen. My pet dinosaur was very mad to find out that I downloaded the app. He was screaming in fear of the Cheeto. You should be ashamed about scaring a poor dinosaur. He is current underneath my bed with my pet giraffe. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!","userName":"poor PSA","title":"This app should be called “How to scare 101”","rating":1}}]}
