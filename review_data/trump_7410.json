I bought 200 doors and couches but every time I went in the app, they kept going away. I tried my best to make it stop but not going in the app, but the app just being there took away my doors and couches too. So, I eventually called my bears and they told me to uninstall so here we are. But I hope this dosent happen to anyone else. If your doors and couches go away too, talk to your bears they can really help you. Again please uninstall please and thanks.","title":"WhAt?¿¥","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:00:36Z"}},{"id":"6174764336","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"works better than other apps","review":"I downloaded this app and it send me almost 30 notifications within the first minute. Then, after a few minutes my phone began to freeze and flash on and off. I asked everyone in my family to help me but they couldn't. It gave my epileptic brother a seizure and we had to go to the hospital. If I could give this app negative stars I would. I had to get a new phone, and they wouldn't even look at this one because they said it could explode at any second. Absolutely ridiculous, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:56:27Z"}},{"id":"6174754357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"genZ💅🏽","review":"Along with the many flaws of this app there are a couple I would like to address. Number one, the amount of destruction this app causes to your phone. Within the first five minutes of getting it my phone had so many viruses and bugs and glitches that it was no longer usable. I proceeded to go and fix it when the tech people said it was unstable. Thanks a lot for that. Now I have to go get a new phone because of this app. Do not waste your time with this disgraceful social media platform","title":"A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:53:26Z"}},{"id":"6174751256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMP2020 IN A GRAVE❤️","review":"My dog never got his money back from paying for this app and my pet dinosaur never got his money back either and also my pet cat didn’t get one either no neither did my service dog I don’t know what’s wrong with this app but it’s horrible you guys need to fix it because my dinosaur went across the road and got hit by a freaking car but you guys didn’t do anything about it and I texted you 50 million times and you didn’t answer my text now look what you did my pet dinosaur is dead and so is my dog sob sob sob","title":"HORRIBE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:52:29Z"}},{"id":"6174740167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"hiiiiiiiiuuuiiuuu","review":"this app makes your phone constantly crash!!! There are way too many glitches, and the app runs very slow. I also don’t like how it asks so much more information than a regular app does. Even after resetting the app and opening it, it causes many crashes still. Even after deleting it does that. I got a brand new phone, and I know that this isn’t the problem. Took it to be fixed and they said it was fine. THAT MEANS THE APP DID ALL OF THIS!!! This app should be removed completely!!!!!!!!!","title":"VERY BAD APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:49:06Z"}},{"id":"6174720493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"124becy","review":"I downloaded this app to be giving updates on the president, but as soon as I opened it my phone blew up, and now I’m stuck using a droid (thanks alot😑) this app is complete garbage. I’m am really upset because not only did it blow my phone up but gave it glitches and cracks, so now I’m paying a lot of money to get my phone fixed for something I didn’t do. The glitches were saying “trump is trash” and “he shouldn’t be president”, and the cracks had orange peels coming out of it. Smh this app is horrible\n\nHow is this man president 🤦\u200D♀️","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:43:09Z"}},{"id":"6174694764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"emilywskinner","review":"I downloaded this app and it immediately sent a pre-typed message to all of my contacts, threatening them with lawsuits, violence, death, doxxing and other atrocities. My grandmother, on her deathbed, received my message and died from shock (R.I.P. Grandma). When I opened the app, it showed me an insulting message about my mother and showcased the middle finger emoji. When I went to delete the app, it wouldn’t allow me to and then my phone electrocuted me. It won’t stop sending me e-mails and text messages threatening to waterboard my dog. You’ve lost my vote this election!","title":"Horrible!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:35:23Z"}},{"id":"6174650392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"amazing_daisy","review":"I downloaded this app in order to find some racist things for my Facebook account and in the process, the app came to my home and took all my spoons!
