By calling Baltimore a “rat infested” city, claiming that Black Lives Matter is a “symbol of hate,” and by calling immigrants from the Mexican border “rapists,” Trump has shown me, a 16 year old girl, that he doesn’t adhere to the values of respect, kindness, empathy, and diversity that America should exhibit. Rather, he makes a mockery of America by embarrassing this nation at each and every turn. These include taking America out of the Paris Climate Agreement, revoking American involvement in the World Health Organization, and abandoning the Iran Nuclear Deal. Each of these actions go against the well being and safety of American citizens and humanity around the globe. I strongly encourage anyone reading this comment to rethink voting for Trump and therefore committing to another four years of the worst president American has ever seen. Whether or not you are a huge fan of Biden, he will do everything he can to protect American citizens and to uphold American values. He has a strong history of working with both parties to reach unanimous agreements. He stands for bringing the nation together again, not tearing people against their neighbors. He is invested in restoring the great economy Obama built which has now been destroyed by the Trump Administration so that it works for everyone. Think about it this way, what promises has Trump kept to you? Have you really seen a spike in your finances? Is your community truly safer? Are you still facing debilitating college and medical debt? Please, I beg of you, as a young student who will hopefully be here long after Trump and Biden are both gone, I am counting on you, the voters, to elect politicians who will work to end climate change; stop gun violence; create a workforce, health care system, and an education system that works for all, not just the few. I know many of you seeing this will think to yourself, “Well here’s another liberal snowflake who follows fake news.” I beg of you to change that dialogue because I look into different sources and do research to make sure I understand the full scope of issues before I speak of them. I encourage all of you to do research of your own to determine whether or not you want Trump to serve another term. Be skeptical when you see warning signs of fascism including Trump silencing certain reporters, using logos similar to those of the Nazis (yes, look this up because it is scary), and having unidentifiable police much like Hitler’s secret police suppress Black Lives Matter protests. Stay wary, stay informed, and please think before you vote. Every vote counts in this election and Biden needs your support. I need your support. America needs your support. Thank you."}},{"id":"6173664058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"annoup annoup sksksk","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🐝🍊🐝🍊🐝🍊🐝🍊","date":"2020-07-08T20:43:10Z","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing..."}},{"id":"6173662044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"1312 ;)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"My phone exploded b/c of this app","date":"2020-07-08T20:42:28Z","review":"Terrible app, don’t recommend!!!"}},{"id":"6173660014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"goodhluck","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:48Z","review":"This is the worst App I ever had to download"}},{"id":"6173656137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"coolkid727226","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"terrible app","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:24Z","review":"gen z will take over. you can’t stop us. also stop trying to delete tiktok you big orange :)"}},{"id":"6173655057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"donaldthepussy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"ITS NOT AN ACTUAL CAMPAIGN  😂","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:04Z","review":"Its an app about an orange running for president they can’t even run you silly gooses😂"}}]}
