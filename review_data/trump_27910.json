I don‚Äôt support a man who has sexually assaulted women \n3. we have become a laughing stalk to the entire world by how he presents himself( basically he acts like a bafoon)\n4. He has no political insight and has made enemies with other countries that should be our allies. \n\nI am not democrat nor republican . For the reason that both sides corrupt . But in this moment in time I would rather have Nixon or anybody as a President than Mr Trump."}},{"id":"6176367962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idhd rnksjdbfbf","date":"2020-07-09T11:55:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Oompa Loompa","review":"This app is terrible.
