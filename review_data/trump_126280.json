I had seen all these protests and I was super scared, so I listened to Trump. He said he was in his bunker so I went to mine. I was just down there watching my Fox News and it had mentioned that there was a trump app and I was like “how have I never heard of this?!?” And so I downloaded it on my Android. When I entered the app I saw my saviors face. But for some reason it made me really hungry, but of course the only food in the bunker was organic pickled beets that my great grandpa billy canned about 80 years ago. I had never tried his pickled beets, so I figured now was the time. I ate them, and I suddenly became very tired. The last thing I remembered was Fox News. When I woke up, I felt refreshed. I looked at the tv and it said that Alexandria Cortez won the 2032 presidential election?!?? I was outraged!!! How could a WOMAN have won?? And how is it 2032? I went outside and all of the houses around me have pride flags replaced with Trump 2020 flags! I was so confused. I look to my left and I see a big machine, it looked like a small closet. So I got in it and I was trying to figure out what all the buttons were, but then the door slammed shut and the Machine started shaking violently, I was screaming at the top of my lungs! Everything went dark for about ten seconds and then, I was back. I was in my bunker and I see trumps face on Fox News. “What was that?” I said and then I threw up  all over the only bed in my bunker. So in conclusion, the trump app is horrible. I still support him but because of seeing his face, I became hungry, ate some 80-year old beets, fell into a deep sleep for about 12 years, woke up to a world where the stupid liberals have taken over, and got into a weird machine and somehow ended up back in the bunker where I threw up on the only bed I had. So thanks trump, now I have to sleep in my puke tonight. Anyway, I’m hungry again. I mean...the beets WERE pretty good.","title":"So I was in my bunker..."}},{"id":"6178459979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:28:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"empot1","review":"when i opened the app store to download this app after seeing it on tiktok, i wanted to get it and show my support for our lovely president, donald trump (trump 2020!!🇺🇸🇺🇸), it took approximately 39.75 days to download. as soon as it was downloaded to my phone, my entire phone crashed. it deleted all of my contacts and pictures, and then surprisingly, burst into flames! i had to wait a week before i could get another phone and because he isn’t doing anything beneficial about corona, i am out of work and had to buy an iphone 4. so after all of this mess i decided i wanted to try the app again. not to my surprise, it took even longer to download because i have an iphone 4 (approx. 92 days). it eventually opened up and i was enjoying it. after a couple of days i started getting weird text messages and calls from actual people saying they knew my location and were going to kidnap me! i was terrified! i immediately deleted the app and shut off my phone hoping that would do something. after all of this, i started having nightmares tremors and cold sweats about trump and his wife malaria, kidnapping me and forcing me too cook and clean for them. i couldn’t sleep and it was all because of this darn app!! after this whole thing i decided to download the app tiktok, hoping to meet some new republican friends and see if there was something to do so i could still enjoy the app. i realized there was nothing i could do about it and i would just have to watch the news to keep up with him. this app is horrendous and i do not recommend downloading it at all unless YOU want horrible night tremors and the cold sweats.","title":"horrible app!! do not download!!"}},{"id":"6178459864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:28:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hdjaknegdujdne","review":"A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY","title":"A LIBERAL CONSPIRACY"}},{"id":"6178459377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:28:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"migu.elg1r","review":"to all my fellow conservatives out there this app gave my phone a virus and i had to buy an android (devastating, i know). anywho, i am $500. do not download unless it’s to rate this app one star 🥴","title":"orange man"}},{"id":"6178455147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:26:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Brian rojas-martinez","review":"First off it took 999999 days to blank and more hours to blank and even more minutes to blank.
