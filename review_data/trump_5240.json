It just kept crashing. And honestly, that really tells me all I need to know about his campaign. He says how great everything about him is, but in actuality, it’s all garbage that doesn’t do what it says it’s going to. I really should have read the reviews before I wasted my time with this app. Don’t get it, you’ll just be wasting your time too.","date":"2020-07-09T18:39:30Z","title":"This app is garbage","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177777868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"........😂","review":"I was really looking forward into supporting the cheeto puff. I was even about to go to his rally’s but my fish decided he wanted to go for a walk. I don’t know if you care but he really enjoyed his walk. Anyways cheeto puff this app isn’t working. I tried to let it load but it kept telling me to put in a mobile number? I have a mobile number but i really don’t wanna put it in. So instead i decided to put in the serial number for cheeto puff bag. I did this in honor of you. Your a horrible president and i hope your day is even worse.

It was as if he put Life360 on me😤 Anyways, he tracked me down, kidnapped me, and put me on his boat. He wanted to recreate the “365 Days” boat scene, but I told him that would be illegal because I’m a minor. So then he dumped me overboard and made me swim past the sharks over to the shore! Luckily, I survived by reminding the sharks that we a friends, not food. So to summarize, my cat is missing and I think she got arrested. Can someone help me find her? Oh, and DO NOT download this app! I would give it a negative star if I could!!!🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-09T18:18:46Z","title":"I HATED this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177565583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"garkerparlock","review":"when i first downloaded the app i looked in the mirror and Melania Trump was standing right behind me. i turned around and she was gone. then i got an alert from the app that read “Hello” i instantly knew who it was. the app began to crash and my power went out. i tried to delete it but i couldn’t. then i saw her again at the end of my hallway. she ran up at extreme speeds and whispered in my ear “Hello”. i thought to my self what could this mean and what is happening. then i saw a Cheeto dust face print on my ceiling above my bed. i finally deleted the app but sometimes i can still here Melania Trump’s whispers.","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:45Z","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177352210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kyra lawrence","review":"This app is absolute trash. everytime i opened it i kept seeing this orange looking man on my screen and he wouldnt go away. a few seconds later i went into cardiac arrest because the man was so ugly. right after, i was rushed straight to the hospital. the doctor tried to save me but couldnt. and you might be wondering, if you’re dead, then how are you typing this right now? well, right when i got to heaven, i asked god, “can i please go back down to earth so i can write a bad review about the “trump 2020” app?” and he said yes only because it was about trump. \n#obama2020\n#genz","date":"2020-07-09T16:23:23Z","title":"this app makes me want to barf","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177341596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🥜PeaNut Man🐱","review":"By now, everyone has described how awful of an app it is already. But nothing like this. The day I downloaded this, I was watching tiktok on the toilet, enjoying the most peaceful time of my day. I received a notification that my app had completed downloading. As I opened it, to my horror, the president, Donald J. Trump’s, face appeared as a jump scare on the app. I flung my phone across the bathroom, hitting the door, swinging the door open, ricocheting off the door, into my bedroom, off the door of the room, and into my cat’s head. 😞 RIP Mr. Skittles. 🙏🏼 I do not recommend if you love your pets. I do not recommend if you cherish your life.

NOO","review":"After I downloaded I started receiving calls but not the ones they were talking about. It sounded like someone with an Australian accent was trying to do a Russian accent, and they were telling me to go to the nearest cliff and if I said the magic words, “Trump is the best and I will vote for him in the next election” that I could jump off the cliff and I would fly. And they kept texting me picture of props pig holding trump for 2020 signs. And then George (peppas brother) holding a Kanye west for 2020 sign. It was insane. If I could give this app a zero star review I would, because this app didn’t nothing good for me.","date":"2020-07-09T16:13:41Z","title":"This was awful!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177158387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"step chicken 🐔","review":"when i downloaded the app to support our racist and homophobic ✨orange✨🍊 i was somewhat excited. but as i entered the app my phone started glitching i think this app has a virus as i scrolled the words “trump 2020” was all over my screen i was disgusted and felt sick i think my phone was sick too it caught this awful virus 🦠 of writing those terrible words. and the worst symptom was when trumps face came across the screen my phone almost died from the virus it was so sick that my phone teleported across my room on to the floor it almost broke and died.

The 20 meter pacer testwill begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","date":"2020-07-09T15:11:04Z","title":"🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177067115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"tempu is crusty","review":"If I could give this app a 0 I so would. I got this app to support my wonderful president but then I remembered I had to walk my fish. I was so excited to get this app but it took 4 weeks to download. After all the waiting I open the app to see a crusty old man and stupid things that he has said. I am very unsatisfied with this app and I will proceed to talk to my manager. I hate this app and I didn’t get it to see a cheetoh I got it to support my president. I guess I had forgotten there was an election 4 years ago but I do not want anything to do with this trump dude anyway don’t get the app it’s not worth it.","date":"2020-07-09T15:02:51Z","title":"Go die trump","isEdited":false}}]}
