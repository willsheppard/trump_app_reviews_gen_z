I’m disgusted when I open the app I don’t want to see a racist, sexist , homophobic horrible human being.

I thought it was going to be an app to support our country and our great president, but instead there’s a weird Cheeto man right when you open the app. I nearly had a heart attack and needed medical attention right away. I now have a 300$ hospital bill.

First of all it ate my dog and then proceeded to take my phone on a walk! When I came to the hospital my tail was just gone and then the door to my country just went to the bank. I’m HONESTLY just so angry that at the bank the lawyer took my pet rock to the chair and then continued to bake my rock! I mean this is just unacceptable.
