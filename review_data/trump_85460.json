However, things took a turn for the worst once I saw the opening screen of the app. In front of me was the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life: an old, crippled Oompa Loompa with skin as orange as a baboon’s behind. I eventually realized that this was a picture of our lord and savior Donald, though. So, I continued to gaze at the screen when I then saw that Donald was asking me for my phone number?!? Correct me if I’m wrong, but Donald is happily married to our “NŒ...” queen Melania, who is popping off at 25 years younger than Donald himself. I was just baffled to see that my inspiration in life is a cheater, not to mention that I am a minor as well. But, as Donald is just so darn handsome, I agreed to the request and handed over my digits. Then, I started receiving spam texts and calls from Mr. Trump. Not to be rude, but Donald was trying SO hard to get me to recognize him. This was just overwhelming me, so I blocked the phone number and deleted the app. Then Donald hacked into my phone and started to serenade me with his marvelous singing capabilities. His voice made my heart beat faster than my Grandma’s did when she had a heart attack, his voice was just so soft and soothing. He told me he wanted to meet up, so I gave him my address. Later that day, I heard the handsome man knocking on my front door. There he was, wearing nothing but a towel. Let’s just say, things got a little frisky later that evening. But then he left... he left me there on my bed, filled with his reproductive cells. How could you do this Donald?!? We had a special bond, more special than the one you have with Melania. We were ENDGAME Donald!!! You just left me. I had to clean myself up. And now I’m pregnant... I’m giving birth to your son, Donald, and you won’t even be here to see him grow into a man. He’ll be twice the man you ever were, Donald. I want child support. Anyways, don’t download this app because Donald will harass you, come to your house, knock you up, and then leave. His peepee was also very tiny and was barely even visible.","date":"2020-07-09T17:45:39Z","userName":"🙈💞🌸","title":"✨ Donald Impregnated Me ✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177615589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Literally the worst app ever.

When heard my little trumpy bear made himself an app, I was like “yasss queen I support!!” So clicked the download button. I’ve looked at other reviews, and saw that this app only took 2 days to download, but mine took a week. Wait what? I decided to give him a second chance. After I opened the app, I saw a disgusting picture of a pickle the was moldy and I was like wait—trumpy Bear? They drew the cutest picture of you!! So I decided to keep looking through the app. It asked for my phone number so I put it in and submitted it. Immediately after I clicked submit, I got a call that I didn’t recognize from Washington DC and thought wait a second, this could be my trumpy bear!! So of course I picked up. I put it on speaker, as any person licking there’s sisters elbows with frosting on them would do, and listened. It starting playing this interesting song that was sung by a person who spoke Spanish. My dog came bolting in and started twerking and I was like “oh heck no!” And then I said, “oh heck no you’re not doing this alone!” So was danced for about and hour and a half. You might be wondering, wait? What’s so bad about this app then? Well after our dancing session, I got back on to see if anymore fun things would happen but I think I found something no one should see. It was a note from to president declaring the ban of Tik Tok!! I was like OH HECK NO HERE WE GO!! And I came here to write the best most wordy review of all time. Th is is your chance trumpy bear, DON’T DO IT!! Bye trumpy bear good luck from the Tik Tok force :))))💖🧚\u200D♂️💫✨❤️","date":"2020-07-09T17:39:09Z","userName":"jxhhdhdjcj","title":"💫✨🧚\u200D♂️I love apps 💩😘but not this one🤩💖","rating":1}},{"id":"6177596125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I think that trump smells like old milk and he looks very orange also 🙈 tik tok","date":"2020-07-09T17:37:34Z","userName":"fv cc g","title":"Trump is very stinky","rating":1}},{"id":"6177594145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Take away tik tok we take way your app. WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING. gen z always wins don’t test us.","date":"2020-07-09T17:36:55Z","userName":"✨farkle✨","title":"For in her","rating":1}},{"id":"6177575898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible there was a glitching SO NOT DOWNLOAD !!
