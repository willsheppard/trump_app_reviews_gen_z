However, I downloaded it and it was a LIE. IT WAS A CAMPAIGN FOR A CHEETO-PUFF. Please beware, so that your children do not get on this app. While you’re at it, if you know anybody who values human rights then PLEASE tell them not to get this. I clicked on this app and it was screaming “misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, all lives matter,” and stuff like that.
