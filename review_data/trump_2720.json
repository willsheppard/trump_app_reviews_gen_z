With a palpable romance blossoming between them my pet caterpillar became pregnant👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩. Since such a love was forbidden, my caterpillar went to crooked Hillary Clinton for an abortion using her dirty emails😱. After my caterpillar had exercised her right to choose 👍she ate some Cheetos but to her surprise the Cheeto genie Donald came to grant her wishes 🤬but when he saw she wasn’t a straight white man and was in fact, a caterpillar who did meth that one time🥵, he receded into the depths of his scandals and disappeared😳. Now I have an elf on the shelf who isn’t emotionally stable😭, a caterpillar with PTSD from a bag of Cheetos and a new favorite kind of mushrooms 🍄 🍄🍄thanks Trump 😩","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:51Z"}},{"id":"6174664700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"LK:/","review":"The SECOND I opened this app my phone became incredibly slow and kept glitching. Then I started getting messages from Donald trump himself telling me to look out my window! When I looked outside there were ten MAGA flags I SCREAMED and tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me. Eventually I calmed down and forgot about it but I had gotten another text from trump he said that he was watching me and it was only a matter of time until I became a Cheeto like him. I got really scared and tried to call someone for help but anytime someone answered I heard a grown man chanting trump 2020! There was only one thing I could do to get rid of this app. I threw my phone into a bag of Cheetos and lit it on fire as a sacrifice to the Cheeto gods. Thank god trump can’t stalk me anymore! DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:26:34Z"}},{"id":"6174633131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitches, FBI and death threats","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"TikTokWillBeForever","review":"Prior to downloading this HORRIBLE app my IPhone was doing great! By great I mean it had no racism, vulgar language and false information getting infiltrated by an app. Then this PATHETIC app was downloaded and the phone started glitching. I started to pray over it because I did not want the demonic spirit of Donald J Trump to overtake my iphone and kill me. I said “Not today Satan also known as DJT”. Once I deleted the app, my phone went back to normal and the happy, non-racists, non-rapists and clean language left my phone. I’m glad the evil, Satan spirit of DJT left my perfectly Holy iPhone. BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT LET THE DEMONIC JEZEBEL SPIRIT OF TRUMP COME OVER YOUR PHONE! He can have a Jezebel spirit because it is not confimed he was born female and with a small loan of a million dollars transitioned to female. Prove me wrong, I dare you 🤭✌🏽💋💋💋","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:30Z"}},{"id":"6174595643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️Bunker boii✨✨🧚🏻🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"oompa_ loompa_lookin","review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

Literally not what I got the app for and then when I tried to delete the app from my phone all the lights in my house turned off and the angry orange WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH! Then when I tried to ask him to leave he sprouted wings and turned into a troll! He started crapping piles of cheetos all over my house and guess who has to clean them up? ME THATS WHO. Honestly the makers of this stupid app should have to come to my house and take responsibility for their angry orange troll child. They should be the ones cleaning up the piles of cheetos around my house. I can’t believe tech support hasn’t come to my house to remove their orange troll, absolutely apalled at the terrible services of this app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:02:23Z"}},{"id":"6174502531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"What is this bull?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"chokemejoon","review":"This app is unbelievable, utterly disgusting. I came across the app and thought it would be a great idea to download it because well, I’m a trump supporter ;), I mean Namjoon would be a better president but anyway back to the app. I left the app open before turning my phone off and at 3:00am I got hundreds of notifications from this app saying ‘send noods’ like oH mY gOd, what is happening? I went into the app and bam, trump wee wee. I, being 96 years of age, have seen my fair share of tHiNgS but this?! As a president? Have some decency. Anyway, stop the racism, stop being an idiot, stop hiding in a bunker and grow a pair. Trump has the audacity to talk big and bad yet he’s hiding in a bunker, what kind of p*ssy president is that?(again, Joonie could do better) thank you for listening.","date":"2020-07-09T01:40:28Z"}},{"id":"6174469181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Yeah❤️                                         No👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Arthur Slugworth","review":"So I downloaded this app so I would always be informed when the Oompa Loompa running our country was having an event but it was taking a little while to load so I decided it would be better to do some knitting while I waited. Suddenly out of the sky flew down the wonkavator with all the other Oompa Loompas tumbling out of it! They started to attack me for whatever reason and I had no other choice but to fight them off with my knitting needles!! They kept singing the little songs from the movie while attacking me and calling me a “bad egg” which hurt my feelings but I got a leg up on them because I found their supply of fizzy lifting drinks and floated away to safety. App still hasn’t loaded yet. Bad experience👎😡","date":"2020-07-09T01:31:04Z"}}]}
