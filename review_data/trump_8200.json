The app then started rapidly flashing colors and violently vibrating until an ungodly amount of Cheetos started spilling from my device. It has pushed me and my family out of our home and it has ruined our lives. We lost our youngest to the mountain of Cheetos where our neighborhood used to be. Please keep us in your thoughts praying 🙏🏼","rating":1,"userName":"kmsbwell"}},{"id":"6175139155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS IS A PORN APP!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:52:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is awe full! Immediately when I went onto this app, a bunch of porn started playing! And for some reason, my camera and microphone were in use? I wasn’t even using the camera or microphone!

When I open the app, it freezes, exits the app, and I’m returned to my homepage. I’ve deleted and redownloaded this app several times but it keeps happening. I’ve checked sites like Reddit and Quora to see if others were having this issue and they are, but there is no fix!! I do not recommend this app and expect the developers to shut it down and work on a better version.","rating":1,"userName":"Hugh G.

But unlike him I downloaded the app hoping my dreams of seeing my favorite president, my role model and king portraying the amazing role he plays live and In action. Turns out my battery percentage dramatically drops and leaves me with a orange tint on my screen somewhat like his complexion like a nice orangish color and I would not recommend this. So yeah don’t buy it.

I thought it’ll be a goof idea to get this app so I can keep up with the important information our president had to tell us about his campaign but I was truly disappointed when I got it and it started to glitch immediately after downloading it deleted it 4 times and reinstalled it for it to still not work. Very unsatisfied","rating":1,"userName":"🌚shygirl"}},{"id":"6175076330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"They knew I was Mexican","date":"2020-07-09T04:31:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded the app and was SOOOO excited because I ADORE Cheetos. But as soon as I opened the app, the loading screen was a brick wall. And then it turned into a mini game called “Deportation”. I thought it was weird so I called up my white friend who downloaded it and they said that all you have to do is win the game and they send you a white cap and a long piece of rope as a reward. But when I played it, all I received was a plane ticket to Mexico. Where is my rope, Donnie? I was really excited to fix my ceiling fan.","rating":1,"userName":"SadLatina"}},{"id":"6175073939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIFIC","date":"2020-07-09T04:30:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I opened this app I got multiple texts from spams and people saying they were gonna drop kick me !!?!
