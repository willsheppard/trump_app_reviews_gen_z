It was actually quite disturbing and I think this app should be taken off the App Store... it showcased some serious racism, white supremacy, sexual assault, criminal activity & obstruction of justice, bigotry, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, discrimination, lying, denial of basic science and facts and overall disregard for any life that isn’t white men. This was VERY disappointing :( . The overall discrimination and lack of basic humanity makes this abomination of a president I mean *app*, creates a genuine danger for those who are not rich white republican American men. 0/10 I wish I could give 0 stars ☹️😞😔"}},{"id":"6177409871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TikTok made me do it 🥰🥳","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Change with the generation !!","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:19Z","review":"This is the worse app I’ve ever downloaded. The first thing I saw was an old man with a bad a spray tan, a toupee, along with a stretch out chicken neck. I quickly closed the app and decided to go to bed. That same night I had nightmares from this app, I kept waking up crying until I decided I had to delete the app. Maybe instead of banning a social media platform where young adults and teenagers feel comfortable to discuss what’s going on in the world, the president could try to understand why we do certain things. Believe it or not but a majority of those young adults on TikTok are going to be voting this year and I’m positive it won’t be for Trump. We need a president that won’t only be comparable with older generations but will also be the change with the newer generations!! That’s all 🥰"}},{"id":"6177360750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"macrbest","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Scared","date":"2020-07-09T16:25:53Z","review":"I got this app to see if I wanted to support Our president in the upcoming election and things did not go as planed. The app took a while to download which was weird but things got worse. It made my eyes hurt and everything look orange. I started responding with trump 2020 to every conversation. I even started calling my dog a snowflake and he’s not even white. This was concerning for me as I don’t get political but I started arguing with people I don’t even know but I couldn’t even give a good argument. After a week of having the app I had to delete it. One week after deleting the app and I am back to normal. I have to say I was really scared of what this app was doing to be. I want to warn all of you and tell you to not get this app!!! I am so scared that I have to sleep with the lights on. I guess I am the snowflake now..."}},{"id":"6177223950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Merf2004","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"niall horan 2020🐝👑🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T15:46:43Z","review":"this app is terrible it told me i should eat to become a fat pig🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️. gravity is the reason for an alternate universe. big daddy james is the solution to all of our problems. and the altitude of watermelon sugar and intensity of the one direction reunion salt shaker. niall horan is becoming president for 2020. and with the release of yummy by justin bieber.

I was relived that I had accses to such an amazing source of inforamtion that I am never proud to rely on today, MY ORANGE MUFFIN MAN! Saddly, i was disregarded to learn that my orange muffin man, had no plans to save me from this \"Chinnese Virus.\" So I decided that I would pay for my health care and my insurance to try to save myself from this attack. I decided that with the president's mistakes, I would spend my lifes savings to keep myself alive! Then, just like that, taxes came! and once again I had a chance to thank my president! To thank him by giving him more money!!! So in conclusion, this app had cost me my lifes savings 😜🤡🤪✨☺️😌💅"}},{"id":"6176930217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS WAS SEVERELY DISSAPOINTING","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:58Z","review":"AS A WOMAN WHO LIKES NEWS THIS APP WAS TERRIBLE, I would scroll and the app would shut me out and play a message telling me that it I wasn’t a radical conservative then I didn’t deserve to live, and then would proceed to shut down my phone, I could not believe this!!!!
