First, it crashes repeatedly and slows down your phone to a snails pace. Second, the app promotes a racist, misogynist, homophobic, sociopathic narcissist who has no regard for human life and disrespects any culture that isn’t white. Third, stop the brainwashing of the uneducated please and thank you."}},{"id":"6174427753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T01:18:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bear-bear2004","review":"this app is just a no❤️i came to learn about cheeto man and his “Trump2020” campaign but turns out this app is just terrible, it’s slow and it sent out unnecessary and random alerts and notifications that i didn’t sign up for. make a better app pls! i will never download this again, have a great day💝💋🦄🥰🧚\u200D♀️🤩😘💜✨"}}]}
