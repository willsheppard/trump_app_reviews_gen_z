First of all, the user interface on the app is often laggy and inaccurate, not to mention the amount of times the app actually crashes while using it. Now these mentioned flaws usually aren’t enough to stop me from enjoying an app to some degree, however, something odd and annoying about this app is the fact that I have to keep reentering my phone number. Whenever you first download the app you are presented with a box where you enter your phone number and another click box where you can review the terms and policies of the app. On my first startup of the app, I entered my phone number, glanced over the terms and policies, and continued to browse through the app until the app crashed on me. I reopened the app only to be met by the same screen, asking for my phone number. This instance occurred several more times while using the app and is very unpleasant and alarming. Honestly, these types of errors make me question the app and why it wants my phone number so bad. This app, and Trump's whole campaign should be reviewed closely before someone should try to give in to supporting him.","title":"Bad Setup","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:12:34Z"}},{"id":"6176954363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"trump app victim #420","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.

The app is slow, has many design flaws, glitches, useless in general, and to be honest it’s a really lousy excuse for an app. I tried to sign up as it prompts you to on startup but after painfully having to type in each number and letter because of how slow it is, it sent me back to the sign up page without any explanation or message telling me why. I tried again to no avail. I almost gave up but on the third time it finally worked. Once I got into the app I was spammed with many text messages asking me to sign up for various other things, I had to block the number for it to stop. The entire app is glitchy, when you try to scroll through the different pages it glitches up, and sometimes even glitches back to the top of the page. Some news articles were even displaying twice or three times. I soon got frustrated and gave up trying to work with it and deleted it. I know regret downloading the app because they probably had access to and took my information. I will only give you one piece of advice, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","title":"Poorly Made","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:17:01Z"}},{"id":"6175986932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kdkendei","review":"This app is terrible, it took 36 month to download and once it finally finished downloading Donald trump smashed through my wall in koolaid man fashion saying that he held Damon Salvatore captive in he White House mansion basement and was melting all of my one direction poster and apparel, I obviously ran to my kitchen to call 911 but right as I entered my kitchen Harry styles was standing in front of me saying “don’t do this Addison, he he” and I responded with “ it’s ok harry” then I noticed it wasn’t Harry styles at all it was Michael Jackson brainwashed into helping trump kidnap me so I crawled upstairs and took hold of my backup phone as I hide under my one direction themed bed, my door creaked open and Walter ran under my bed and in a deep voice he said “foreigner foreigner” and jump out my window terrified and I looked up staring at who ever had caught me, it was Maddison beer and trump was behind her, she dropped me and started beating me up with her 5 inch long toenail hairs, I scream “y tho Maddison” she says “ u outed me to the whole world that I am jealous of Nikita nimaj” and hoped out of her hands and sprinted to my underground bunker 20 miles away and hid their till they were all gone.

He stole my child’s ears and taped them to my windows and when he was about to leave he turned around and cursed my house! Right after cursing it trump 2020 appeared all over my house, which was even worse then the ears taped to the window now I can’t have my friends over for lunch tomorrow, great. it was supposed to be euphoria themed but due to these damages i will not be able to afford the decor. I grabbed my children and headed to the backyard to set up the family tire swing so we could sleep like possums, to my surprise my phone rang with a notification for this app, and it said “rawr XD,” i’ve never been so scared in my life. I tried to open back up my phone to delete the app but it tried to kill me! My phone started attacking me and yelling racist slurs at my children, then this giant cheeto appeared as i was running back into the house and tore my heart out of my chest. I lay there bleeding out but I used the remainder of my energy to delete the app and the the cheeto ate me. I don’t know what happened to my children because i was dead.","title":"alligator Tyrannosaurus rex","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:13:24Z"}},{"id":"6177549079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"💀suckssss","review":"Yes I’m a printed Gen z but I’m gonna write my honest opinion about this app I downloaded it and 2 seconds later my phone was glitching I actually had to get a whole new phone do you know how much it costed literally hate this app does absolutely nothing unuseful should be deleted by the App Store already they’re talking about Tiktok getting banned oh please at least I TikTok is actually doing something we’re listening to the same person who thinks coronavirus is a hoax and calls it China virus same person who things are Mexicans or murderers same president who thinks anyone who wears a hijab is a terrorist and we’re listening to someone who talks about his daughter so sexually it’s his own daughter someone who treats Hispanics like their animals if I could give this app a zero I would definitely give it a zero doesn’t work couldn’t even do anything in app immediately kicked me out my phone started glitching and turned off turn it back on how to get a whole brand new phone Apple store couldn’t do nothing I want to phones to see what they could do nothing just a new phone hated zero out of zero sorry I can’t give it a zero but I’ll give it one don’t even fix it just delete it","title":"✨Hate it✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:22:31Z"}},{"id":"6177516034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"jorodn banahama","review":"i decided to download this app in hopes of learning about all the mediocre plans emperor marmalade and his fascist regime had set for america in the final months of his presidency, but when i opened the app, it began spamming my phone with inappropriate and false information. This never ending sputum of false and hate-fueled information drastically drained my phones battery. I would normally see this as a minor inconvenience, however the death of my phone not only preventing me from checking fox news and facebook (which we all know are the only sites you can expect or hear the truth) but prevented me from being with my great great grandma as she died. She had recently been accepted to Harvard in an international program as she is from Yugoslava but had always dreamed of finishing collage. She was so proud of her acceptance, but when she checked this app, she learned that she would soon be deported because Harvard will be resuming online this year, the shock of this revelation gave her a heart attack which sadly lead to her death. Not only did this “man” and his app prevent me from educating myself on the internet, it quite literally lead to the death of my great great grandmother. Would not recommend.","title":"killed my great great grandma","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:12:12Z"}},{"id":"6177136430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"anonymouscoochielicker","review":"This app deserves to perish! As soon as I downloaded it Addison rae mother jumped out of my phone screen! I was appalled. She then proceeded to pull her son Lucas out of my phone. They both tied me up😔. After I was tied up she pushed Lucas back into my phone. She then walked towards me and starred me down with her big blue eyes of death and torture. Then she started singing this dreadful song:Have😦you😱ever😭been😫snaked🤬by🤐a😏friend🤨then😞just🤩for🤒the🥶clout🤪they’ll🥳do😇it😊again🤯. She sang that song until I cried. It had been hours so I asked for food. She stopped singing the song and said “I can’t have food until I’ve been snaked by a friend”😭. I had to think fast because I was starving . So I told her in kindergarten a close friend of mine borrowed my mechanical pencil and never returned it. We both began crying because this was a very sensitive topic to speak on. She left my room. When she came back she brought me 4 chicken nuggets and 3 fries. I didn’t even get sauce for my nuggies🥺. She then turned on my bath tub and filled it with water. She placed me under the water. I tried to scream but my head was under water. That’s when I drowned. I am dead. Do not download or this could happen to you to😔.","title":"Snaked by addison’s Rae mom😩","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:22:00Z"}},{"id":"6176964277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"MoneyBalls👁👄👁","review":"You see, I had gotten the app to see what was happening in the world of the ✨Orange✨ President. Well firstly it asks for my number which makes me uncomfortable😔. Every time I even open the app my phone automatically crashes and will freeze up. Also my nephew and my dog jus didn’t like the ✨Orange✨ on the front, my dog started scratching at my phone screen and my nephew started screaming. Ever since he saw the ✨Orange✨ he’s been getting repeated nightmares of him taking over the world and stealing all his innocence from him. Normally the dream starts with the ✨Orange✨ talking but he never really pays attention, next thing you know he’s in a room alone with the ✨Orange✨ shoeing his as he likes to call it “tictac looking pp”. I can automatically say I do not like the outcome of this very app. It caused my phone to glitch and malfunction and my dog to freak and my nephew to have nightmares!! I do not recommend getting the app. I was very disappointed. I expected so much more from our✨Orange✨President. A Very unprofessional constructed app. I jus hope my nephew can wipe this from his memory soon. It seems to really be haunting him every time he sees an ✨Orange✨ it even a 🧚Cheeto🧚he gets scared and with cry. It is horrible!!","title":"Vv disappointed 😔","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:01Z"}}]}
