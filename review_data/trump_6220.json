I woke up in the hospital, apparently I was in a coma for 69 years I looked around and the orange god himself was sitting on my bed✨✨ once the doctor left he tried to distract me by seducing me, I couldn’t help the orange goddess and I caved🍊✨🍊✨❤️ but then he leaned in and snapped his fingers and a bunch of cockroaches surrounded me and eventually ate me 😭😢 I am writing this from hell and all I have to say it...

Including most of my social media especially Twitter,  Not to mention this app wouldn’t stop sending me notifications every second because I had to put in my phone number. This app is useless and horrible. It should be taken off the App Store. Not just because all this happened but also because it is run by our fascist, racist, pedophilic president who is insanely unprofessional and disgusting...","isEdited":false,"userName":"emmyqueen$$","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP❗️"}},{"id":"6173095590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:31:21Z","review":"Dear mr. Cheeto,\nI don’t appreciate you trying to tell me how to think just because I’m white. To me, you seem racist,sexist, homophobic. Transphobic, most likely a child rapist. I bet the list goes on. I’ve been listening to you for a while and have always wondered how you were going to make Mexico pay for a wall to keep them in their country. I didn’t know that was possible. \nMaybe it’s my dislike for Cheetos unless their flaming hot, but I really dislike you. Sometimes I wish I can vote so I can vote you out of the office. Sad life :( you’re not a good man and I don’t understand how people can just agree with what you say.\nYou also claim to be Christian but can’t even hold the Bible the right way. \nShame.\nHonestly, at this point, I prefer the New York governor over you and I’m not even from New York. RIP Cheeto man, for if you win another election I’m moving to Mexico 😔✊","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheeto man hater sixtynine","rating":1,"title":"Cheeto man back at it again"}},{"id":"6173033271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:11:29Z","review":"So I downloaded the app and everything was great until one day the big orange face started popping up and saying stuff and whatever he said would happen the next day. It started with like do you wanna eat is salad and your best friend will get in a car crash and then that exact thing happened the next day. People in my life started to get hurt in my home slowly was destroyed by bug infestation’s and robbers and fires. Then one day the app say everyone you’ve ever met will die and then the next day they did now my life is ruined.

I was working on a group project and filming on the phone that i had this app on, but somehow it got access to my camera and started sending these videos of me manipulating the oranges to look nice. Trump and his officials made their way to my house and then TOOK THE ORANGES i need for the group project. They said something about him needing concealer, i wasn’t really listening as i was so panicked about all my oranges being ripped out of my arms. the only sense of currency they left behind was a dollar bill with trumps face that i can’t even use! negative stars.","isEdited":false,"userName":"ranopnyc","rating":1,"title":"Trump ate all of my oranges."}},{"id":"6172999998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:01:18Z","review":"I got this app to see what our “gorgeous, amazing “ president has planned and yk what he thinks or whatever.. but once I opened the app 🤢🤭 my poor eyes I can’t believe what I saw.. my president was naked and was getting a spray tan 😤 I can’t believe it I thought he was naturally orange 🍊😭 than all of a sudden my phone started getting glitchy and the picture of him getting a spray tan and being naked kept popping up on my phone, omg I got so scared I even threw my phone across the room 😖😖please do not get the app it’s horrible you do not wanna see what my eyes had to see 😭 disgusting 🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"stephanie valverde","rating":1,"title":"my poor eyes 👀🤮🤮😭"}},{"id":"6172897650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:29Z","review":"This APP is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!! i took 5 hours to download and it made the device super glitchy! plz do not download this app! i deleted it immediately after i downloaded it because of all the problems, such as seeing the weird orange guy on the front screen 😌✨✋🏼.

Then when the app was finished downloading my phone started farting and turning orange I had to get my family and run out of our house. But then we left our dog and when we went back in all there was left was a sign saying that we were ugly and they were going to sacrifice him. Rats were also there because of the food. We are now homeless and depressed because our dog went missing. 0/10 do not recommend getting this app will destroy your life.","isEdited":false,"userName":"apirl.lemons448","rating":1,"title":"Terrible and smelly"}},{"id":"6172761589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:37Z","review":"I was going to get this app to see what my parents loved about our president but the download took 7 HOURS. I had perfectly good service and tried wifi too. When it finally downloaded I put in my phone number and i started getting THOUSANDS OF ROBOT CALLS THE APP SOLD MY INFO. then the app started chanting “Orange Guy 2020” and wouldn’t stop so I turned off my phone and turned it back on and it still kept saying that so I threw my phone and it stopped working so I had to go to the apple store to get a new phone and I GOT CORONA VIRUS so now i’m suffering from covid-19 and I blame Donald Trump OUR PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF THIS","isEdited":false,"userName":"Me!!!!!! ♡♡","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6172658072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:20:18Z","review":"I was trying to download the app and it took me about 2-3 hours to download and as going in the app it took me out many times. I have a great WiFi company so it was definitely not that. I’m ashamed of this app and the cheeto puff we call a president, please get this app fixed or renewed because this is absolutely ridiculous. Do not download as it also is lagging my other apps as well. There is no way this app is any better then a 1 Star. In fact I would give it a zero. I honestly cannot believe this. And that’s on periodt.","isEdited":false,"userName":"SiL K.","rating":1,"title":"Ridiculous app needs work. Along with trump."}}]}
