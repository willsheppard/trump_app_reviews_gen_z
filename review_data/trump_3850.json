I opened the app and everything was normal, but when I tried to log in my phone started burning up and the screen began to glitch and some demonic voice was screaming “all will perish” and “he is not what you think” at FULL VOLUME. I couldn’t turn it down either. I closed out of and deleted the app but I could still hear the voice. I had to do a full software reset on my phone to make it stop. And even now my phone will still occasionally glitch playing a high pitch beep while flashing a terrifying picture of this orange Cheeto man. One star. Terrible. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE.","title":"...what just happened","userName":"Speckled19","date":"2020-07-08T14:13:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172289186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It all started when my hometown started to plaster signs, flags, and posters all over our small town of this orange man. I decided to get to the bottom of this, so I downloaded this app. I highly don’t recommend I think it’s turning me into a sissy snowflake because I’m literally crystallizing as we speak. Yesterday I crystallized into a whole freaking snow flake only for the hot weather to melt me. It’s all this apps fault. Also strange oranges keep randomly appearing everywhere chanting “Trump 2020” and I don’t know how they started to control dreams. I’ve had nightmares about this pedo and his minions of oranges and I’m finally going to delete this app to see if I can get some decent sleep!","title":"The return of the racist/pedo orange🍊","userName":"the liberal snowflake","date":"2020-07-08T13:38:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177451351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve been seeing the stuff our president is putting us through and it’s not okay he nearly started TWO WARS during his term. He almost caused war with Iraq and North Korea. I shouldn’t be crying because of some man I’ve never even met 2020 scares me enough but with him in the White House as well it’s terrifying. We still haven’t even found a cure for coronavirus but he’s worried about a social media app. We can obviously see where his priorities are at. He’s just mad that our generation is speaking the horrible truth about him. If you can’t take the hate you shouldn’t be running our country. So thank you for reading and please remove this app from all app stores.","title":"I’M TRAUMATIZED","userName":"Okurrr🥶","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177347123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app downloaded completely after weeks of waiting and once i opened the app, my life was completely ruined. my dog threw up constantly and she wouldn’t stop, i asked her why and SHE RESPONDED! she said, that cheetos app i cant stop. help me. i didn’t listen because i believed it was a dream because dogs don’t talk but it just got worse. i went into my bedroom and there it was. a flying squirrel with the banner “you did this to youself -xoxo orange” had absolutely destroyed my room. once i got finished cleaning up, i decided that was it and i deleted the app. download with caution. this app could destroy your life like it did mine.","title":"my life is ruined because of donald’s app and here’s why.","userName":"Sandra Mae D.","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177195484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After waiting four days for the app to download because of its size capacity it finally opened but then shut down and crashed my phone three times! When I tried to delete the app it said that I am not allowed to. I tried two more times and it threatened to report me if I didn’t vote for trump so he has more black supporters. So I threw out my phone instead of giving an orange my vote. It was also really scary it said strange things like ‘Trump 2020’ and ‘Keep America Great’ which are things that would never happen and just are complete lies. As an alive and well democrat I was very concerned that this app was allowed to be on the AppStore due to its toxic nature.","title":"Oh no","userName":"kcdownsaegg","date":"2020-07-09T15:38:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176922819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello so I got the app and I was very ✨excited✨. Ome of the reasons I got it was because people kept saying they saw coop from all american at their doorstep. Me being the ✨stupidest✨ person I got the app🥳🥰. I was so excited to see what happenes in the app to. I think I was more happy to see coop though😌. When I tell you I opened the app and 5 seconds later my phone crashed. I was heated one because coop never came to my doorstep to sing her song from the show. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. The app is horrible and it lies to you from the jump. Trump’s app is a big no for me❤️. It needs to be deleted immediately so other people don’t have to go through what I went through 🥺❤️.","title":"Horrible app","userName":"jayla ✝️","date":"2020-07-09T14:24:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176830088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I WAS HERE TO SUPPORT MY WONDERFUL PRES BUT INSTEAD I CANT SEEM TO FIND IT sorry meant “him” 🧚\u200D♀️and the app ruined my phone ! so here i am on my new phone because it broke it . plus the app is trying to delete tik tok NO THANK YOU so many people out themselves on there it’s not just an account it’s a platform for people to express ourselves. the people of tik tok all know each other somehow. like we are all connected. it’s where i go when i’m sad it’s where i go when i’m happy or when i need a good laugh . it’s where i go to learn something new . i’ve seen people get married by meeting on tik tok. please if you take away tik tok at least make something just like it that we can use.","title":"I can’t even","userName":"tik tok speech at the end","date":"2020-07-09T13:59:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176777479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first downloaded the app and signed up and went to explore the app. a few minutes after i opened the app, my phone got really hot and started to steam. i thought i might have just peaked my storage, so i closed the app and deleted some photos. at this point, my cat advised me that my phone was starting to glitch and i started to get worried! my hedgehog soon decided to chew on my phone and chocked on the glass!! i had to immediately take my hedgie boi to the vet and guess what!!

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark.

I entered my phone number for the text and they kept asking me for pictures of bread. while looking at the text of them asking for bread, my eyes started burning and I put my head up and hit the pipe in the ceiling, the pipe broke cause my skull is made of metal and my house started to flood with water. as my house was flooding I ran out to the neighbors to get help and the neighbors dog bit both my arms clean off, I had the neighbor call 911 because I didn't have any arms anymore, and when I got the hospital they didn't have doctors, only janitors so the janitor superglued my arms back on the shoulders. as u can see I would NOT recommend this app for ANYONE as it is CURSED AND WILL RUIN UR LIFE.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"AlbinaTheScammer","date":"2020-07-09T11:16:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
