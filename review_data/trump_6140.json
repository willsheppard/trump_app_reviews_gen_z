The orange was just so intense and blinding I had to close the app as fast as I could! On top of that the app keeps crashing non-stop! Every time I was asked a question like do I wanna see president trump win my phone would just immediately shut me out. I’m not quite sure why but it’s mainly that area I’m having an issue with. So if you could just not have this app anymore that’d be amazing thanks💖🧚🏻✨✨✨🧚🏻🧚🏻","title":"Absolutely horrific 🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kaydin Chirillo","rating":1}},{"id":"6149743400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T20:51:09Z","review":"I wish I could rate something 0 stars. When I first downloaded the app, it sent out a mass text to all of my contacts, for a lifetime subscription for Cheeto puffs?? Even though I deleted it, I’m not sure how to make the text messages stop, because the same text seems to be sending to all of my contacts, multiple times a day. Not to mention, hundreds of random apps started downloading themselves immediately after i downloaded the app. They took me forever to delete. Overall, 0/10 would not recommend.","title":"Horrible.","isEdited":false,"userName":"peyyyytonnnn","rating":1}},{"id":"6148909412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T15:47:58Z","review":"So I downloaded the app thinking nothing of it, and as soon as I got to the homepage my device started to vibrate and believe it or not Chito puffs,legit  Chito puffs started to Swan around my house and my family was freaked out like what! Bruh and guess what? When I deleted the app the stupid Chito puffs were still there so guess what? I had to spend the whole rest of my day cleaning up stupid Chito puffs! I’m so done right now I can’t so \nI’m rating this app a 1!

Personally, it was not a great choice for me and I wouldn’t really recommend using this app. Unfortunately, I will just have to leave this rating to help out those who were considering to download this, and delete the app from my phone. 😔😞😒☹️🤧🤥","title":"Eek 😬","isEdited":false,"userName":"nonhappyuser","rating":1}},{"id":"6148787394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T15:11:03Z","review":"I heard many bad things about this app, but I just couldn’t believe it.. so I downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about. The first day I downloaded the app I started experiencing some paranormal activity.. stuff out of the usual, like 10 mins after I downloaded the app my dog ran away and I was so confused cause like why would she right, then when I was taking a shower SOMETHING PULLED MY HAIR but that’s not the worst part.. I heard something whisper in my ear , and they said “trump 2020” after that I knew something wasn’t normal .. this is dangerous and shouldn’t be an app","title":"DOESN’T EVEN DESERVE A STAR","isEdited":false,"userName":"Britney Harper","rating":1}},{"id":"6146039335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T23:13:46Z","review":"This app continues to create the illusion of real information and provide help for you and your family. When in fact it does NOT . It’s beguiling fake news is horrific. The person who runs this app is nothing but, a liar and only seems to give out information for their benefit.\nDo NOT get this app unless you want to be lied to continuously. Your children look up to you, your family and, friends look up to you. If you walk around with this information that this app lies about you’re setting yourself up for failure.","title":"Infringing on your safety","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sassy girl 😘u want me","rating":1}},{"id":"6143659565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T10:58:55Z","review":"I came to this app because I like to keep up with politics, but as any other gen Z babe, I would like the whole truth. I found out by knowing the president’s truth, I became physically ill. Turns out this app has terrible side effects!!!! Everyone that I know that has this app suffers from misogyny, sexism, fascism, racism, homophobia, ignorance or even worse, blind privilege. If you or a loved one have experienced these side effects, I suggest you delete this app and try to help your fellow man\n\nAlso the app was asking me to sign in every ten seconds so I got tired of hitting the x button.","title":"Is sickness normal???","isEdited":false,"userName":"Who the hell took the name Moo","rating":1}},{"id":"6142176895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T02:03:10Z","review":"I really thought I could trust big daddy trump, but this app betrayed me. Trump really was making our country great, what with all the discrimination against POC and LBGTQ citizens. Not to mention he’s extensive past of sexually violating women. But trump really missed the mark with this app. As other reviewers have mentioned, the notifications are nonstop. Within the 2 days of my app usage, I received over 1173 notifications. Constantly asking for donations and to send “Trumpy-Pooh” a message. I lost all respect for our dearest orange peel!! If I could give it zero stars I would!!!!\n\n-Former MAGA Stan","title":"Disappointed in our president.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Former MAGA Stan","rating":1}},{"id":"6136174390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T14:30:48Z","review":"People my age HATE trump (i’m 16). he’s turned our country into a place of judgement, hatred, and unfairness. we want justice, we want peace, we want equality, we want an non-corrupt law system, etc, but Trump has given us the opposite. he’s absurd, even used to be in a sex trafficking ring. he did sexual things to a young girl, and you want a man like THAT running OUR country? DISGUSTING! learn to take control and action in your society if you don’t like the way that it’s being run, it’s time for a change, and Gen Z will take care of that.","title":"if you support him and you’re 15-20, you’ve got some issues","isEdited":false,"userName":"areyoufr?","rating":1}},{"id":"6135887007","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T13:10:34Z","review":"I love our president Donald Duck so I downloaded this app to support him!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I read the reviews and thought everyone was mad!! 🤯🤯 But my baby started saying something that was horrible!! 🤬🤬 She said Black Lives Matter!! 🖕🖕 I immediately brought her to the adoption center!! 👋👋 I don’t want her!’ 😤😤 That mean s I lost my favorite child 😭😭 I didn’t know this app was behind it and kept it 😔😔 later my son started call out president a Chetto 😫😫 I took him to the adoption center 😁😁 The when Ibwent home.. 🧐🧐 MY DOG ATE MY TRUMP GLAG!1!!2!1!1! 🤬🤬 I delete d the app and nothing has happened to me since 😧😧","title":"i hhate this app!!!! 😵😵","isEdited":false,"userName":"CheMarMer","rating":1}}]}
