I expected better from our president. He doesn’t need to focus on making America great, maybe try working on making the app great! I hope Apple removes this sad excuse for an app off the AppStore.

But when it was taking foreverrrr to download I suddenly got the urge to call tech support and ask for the manager. When it finally downloaded all I saw were middle aged women protesting the corona virus. No one was wearing a mask. Then all of a sudden I got blonde hair, a mom bod and had 2 sons named Timmy and Jake. They were at the protests too. After this we all got sick but we didn’t think it was Corona because that’s not real anyways. Timmy dead. Big dead. But it wasn’t the virus. Anyways this app wasn’t worth it. I blame the manager.\n\n🚨🚨 DONT DOWNLOAD OR ELSE YOU WILL BECOME A KAREN🚨🚨","title":"This App Gave Me The Virus 🦠","isEdited":false,"userName":"lifeisoverrated","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:35Z"}},{"id":"6179456494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Just No","title":"No","isEdited":false,"userName":"Googleclasseooms bad","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:33Z"}},{"id":"6179456481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was about to vote T R U M P ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆 so now I am voting for 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\n\nYour welcome 😭😤","title":"Not cool app 😔😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"The person who uses this app","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:32Z"}},{"id":"6179456399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Then the app made me so physically ill I wanted to flush it with my poo!\nBTW\nDONALD TRUMP IS A RACIST OVERWEIGHT PIGGY WITH A SMALL MUSHROOM SHAPE.....","title":"I was pooping when I downloaded this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Vesadi","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:31Z"}},{"id":"6179456045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Do not get this it messes with your phone seriously worst app ever","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"86536665","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:24Z"}}]}
