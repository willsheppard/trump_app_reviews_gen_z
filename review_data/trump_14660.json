This app is so bad that it brings out my inner Karen and I felt the need to comment. It’s one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded which is why I’m not surprised by the horrible reviews. This app spread fake news and is incredibly racist and problematic. I would never recommend this app to anyone unless they want to waste their time."}},{"id":"6173492128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not recommend","userName":"darkdreams50","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:43:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app and it took days to download and when it downloaded my phone shut down for at least 5 days and once it came back on I opened the app and my phone shut down once again but this it stopped working for a full week then my screen turned white and I couldn’t see for a few days so i do not recommend this app"}},{"id":"6173494005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE.","userName":"iixAxnz","rating":2,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I wanted to support the King.

Halfway through the download, a tactical nuke obliterated my house to smithereens. 75% through the download, I witnessed my family gunned down and confederate flags stabbed into their corpses. As the download finished, I was kidnapped, hit several times by 45 himself, then personally invited to the White House. Overall 2/10 experience"}},{"id":"6173482260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app","userName":"Radhika Schelbert","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"It took forever to download and when it did some music started playing which caused my dog to have a seizure and we lost her! I’ve had my dog for 10 years and THIS APP was her downfall!! I’m am livid and distressed as she was my light.

The person who the app was created for should have really put much thought into what was being made and put under their name. I hope they leave all kinds of social media’s after this quite embarrassing situation and hide inside their panic room. Never doing this again... \nxoxo the girl who wants you gone 😘"}},{"id":"6173481402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","userName":"ew trump😠💅🏼🚫","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the ✨w✨o✨r✨s✨t✨. It took a month to download and when it finally did it glitched out my phone so bad a demon came out of it.

Like, where is the specific page to hate on colored folks? Like where do I go. I see too many moderates on here, those who won’t take action into their own hands. I want fascism, and Trump is doing a great job at it, but his supporters are just liberals. Very disappointed"}},{"id":"6173451724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolute worst","userName":"mr.electro619","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:29:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app doesn’t even allow me to talk to the president directly. Like how am I supposed to share my hentai collection with him now. If I can’t have a president whom I can’t share hentai with them I don’t want them as my president because it goes to show that this man won’t have any contact with any of the public and then nobody can share hentai with him. At mean at some point things just get too far.🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬"}}]}
