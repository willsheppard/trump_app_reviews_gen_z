Then one night I awoke to the feeling of somebody’s eyes on me, I sit up and look to my right and see the apparition of a 6’3” man outlined my the moonlight shining through my bedroom window 😱 just as I am about to scream he swiftly covers my mouth with his greasy orange hand 🤢 smearing spray tan all over my face 🤮 he then cut my finger and made me swear to endlessly promote his campaign to become dictator of the USA and told be that if I didn’t he would sacrifice me to Satan 👹👹 so now I’m stuck in a spiral of reposting his insta photos and re tweeting bigotry 😣","userName":"barbz lives matter","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173202376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:05:23Z","title":"Would give 0 Stars!!","review":"Honestly don’t even know where to start. I was really hoping this app would y’all about important election topics and use credible sources and information. In reality it’s just a bunch of ignorant propaganda. It was SO SLOW!!!! Like seriously how can everyone else\nMake a decent working app and these people can’t. I can’t even believe this. The fact that Trump hasn’t followed through on ANY of his promises is absolutely ridiculous. He really is just saying things to get the vote of good hearted Americans and then not doing them. I should have known back when he said all his supporters were stupid but I gave him the rendir of the doubt. Can’t even believe that I took hours for the page to load and then kept crashing and crashing. So many more issues with this app honestly don’t even know how Apple would allow such a terrible app into the App Store.","userName":"Knightscheetleader","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172961283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:49:26Z","title":"DO NOT download","review":"This app is horrible it took months to download, also this app doesn’t even work and was a waste of space and time you can’t order nothing and it takes up SOOOO MUCH SPACE on the other hand it killed my grandmother, you know maybe it was her time but it was so inconvenient we are all devastated and all beacause i downloaded this app so maybe make and app that doesn’t kill my grandma again 😘. I wouldn’t recommend downloading this app because it takes too long to download, takes up too much space, it doesn’t even work, and it killed my grandma 🙂. Donald I know u can do better than this, maybe just maybe , making apps isn’t for you 🙂 you should try other hobbies like maybe golf or soccer or try being a better person like helping ppl out or donating money to charity. But this , no this just isn’t for u. Thank You for Your Time 🥰☺️.","userName":"penaordazcacapipi","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172868650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:20:42Z","title":"Terrible app","review":"Don’t recommend this app. Very bad. Took very long to download. Very ugly design. When I first logged on, I saw a old ugly looking orange man with white hair kinda like this:👨\u200D🦳 that stared at me with a dead look on his face. I was so frightened that I screamed causing my neighbors to wake up and call the cops on me. When the cops finally got to my house I went outside and explained what had happened with this app. All of the sudden they started tackling my neighbor. I was very confused, but the cops just told me to go inside and enjoy the rest of my day. I asked them why they were beating the neighbors, and the cop said because they are of African American decent 👮\u200D♀️. When I went back inside I deleted the app because I felt if I had kept it any longer bad things would start happening because of it. I highly don’t recommend getting. This app. Very bad experience. Thank you.","userName":"arynviklar","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177770131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:31:46Z","title":"Terrible app","review":"First off it took to weeks to download and while it was downloading I couldn’t do anything else and when I opened the app every thing seemed normal until it started playing music and then rats came and sacrificed my two dogs and then I was so emotionally traumatized I scratched up the couch and I burned all the kitchen chairs to relieve my self and then the rats came back and called there termite friends and the termites ate through all the wood supporting our house and after the house was gone the rats starting singing sacrificial music and then took my cats to an unknown place were we never going them this has been many years ago and I still have nightmares to this day and I had to get therapy for a year and to this day I still see the rats singing the same song in my house and then leaving I hope the are taking good care of my cats tho","userName":"landon the reviewer","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177683856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:05:44Z","title":"Horrible app 🤮🤮","review":"So I downloaded the app to catch up with the news and it’s really bad. First thing is that it took an eternity to download which I hated. Next thing is that an expired orange popped up 🤢🤮 Also my phone proceeds to glitch like just from this app?!?!? It kicks me out of the app multiple times and redirects me to other apps. I can’t even put my phone number in without kicking me out of the app. This app is terrible. Then my wallpaper changed to Trump 2020 and I know for a fact I’ve never changed my wallpaper to Trump 2020. It must’ve been this horrible app who did it 🙄 Then automatically I was given tickets for the rally happening on July 11?!!?! Not to mention the fact it was 10 tickets!!!!!! This app is horrible it makes a lot of things change in your phone. And to top it off first thing you see is an expired orange/Cheeto. Disgusting 🤮🤮🤮","userName":"Anonymousssss 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177658143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:57:29Z","title":"made me cry!🧼🔫😔😼🚬","review":"saw this orange, cheetoh, thing right when i opened the app and made my head go “ Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes”","userName":"bean soup ☮️✨💫🧚🏼🔮💅🏽","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177628050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:47:49Z","title":"Do not download!","review":"Downloading this app is probably one of the worst decisions I have ever made. At first glance it seems like a perfectly fine app but when attempting to open it, it immediately crashes, no matter what I do. Restarting my phone, deleting other apps so it has space, everything. It always crashes. I wasn’t even able to get into the log in screen! On top of that It has continuously caused my phone to crash even when not on the app. I just bought the brand new iPhone 11 but because of this app I’ve had to take it into the shop to get it repaired. Thank god I have a warranty. Reading the other reviews I know I’m not the only one experiencing this and I’m so saddened that others have had to deal with this awful excuse for an app. Please, do yourself a favor and avoid this app at all costs. It’s better in the long run.","userName":"Royal Ash","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177542169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:22Z","title":"ugly orange man attacks me !!","review":"i downloaded this app to support our lovely 🧚\u200D♀️cheeto puff🧚\u200D♀️ and after a week of waiting for it to download, i finally was able to go on it. i opened the app to see that an oompa loompa person is standing right in front of my screen. i yelled so hard that a elephant took me to Mexico, i ate tacos there when suddenly the taco became ginormous and took me flying everywhere. i was so mad and i just wanted to go kill the 🧚\u200D♀️orange🧚\u200D♀️ man 😾 then suddenly i got a call from the 🧚\u200D♀️orange🧚\u200D♀️ man and he said, “will you vote for me” and i told him to rot in hell. finally i got home when i saw that the oompa loompa man is pulling voodoo magic and he made me die 😾 so now i’m writing this as a ghost and all i needed to say was that this is a big joke app and it needs to be removed immediately 🙈 IT WILL MAKE YOU DIE 😾 also hope everybody has a good day besides\n trump supporters and trump himself","userName":"Me123298","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177178088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:33:41Z","title":"This app ruined my life. (Free Barron 2020)","review":"So, I had high hopes for this app. But no, I  was met with the 49 hour loading time, and when I opened the app I got the ransom for the one and only ✨🧚\u200D♂️😍Barron🥰🥰😍, then the app exploded my phone, I now have T H I R D   D E G R E E burns all over my body, thanks a-lot Mr Cheeto for making me suffer knowing that Barron will never have a life and no one can help him get out because Mr Cheeto is holding him captive, what a shame. Then I went to the store to redeem my warranty on my new phone, then of course when I got home with my phone I was met with that god awful picture of Mr Cheeto’s side profile it made me projectile vomit all over my house I was forced to go to the E.R again and have surgery on my stomach. I don't know if you realize the sheer V E L O S I T Y of those medical bills. All of this because Mr Cheeto wouldn’t let me in his app. What a shame. Don't ever purchase this app. Free Barron 200","userName":"Free 🥰barron😘 2020","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
