As another person said, when the app was finally finished downloading and I tapped on it, it began to play this god-awful music that literally made my ears bleed. Then, tons of cockroaches proceeded to appear from under all the furniture in my bedroom — my closet, my night table, my drawers, my table. They climbed on my bed and made their way to me, their eyes glowing a vibrant red. The cockroach at the front, the biggest one and the leader, I presume, opened its tiny mouth and said, “Acka lackawaki. Oin noyn noyn, atlacacka.” Its breath wafted up to my nose. It smelled of vagina and something fruity, perhaps a watermelon or a strawberry, I’m not sure. Sweat started to break all over my body—my forehead shone with it, and I could feel my face heating up. The leader cockroach noticed its friends coming near me, so he turned around and hissed. “ACKA WACKA WACKA TUKI TAKA!!! NIIJI MINIE!” he growled, and his friends backed off, their little beady eyes widened in fear. The leader cockroach turned back around to me, smirking with his thin, light brown lips. “Oonji.. sooka,” he said, and began to come closer. He crawled on my leg, all the way to my stomach, and then to my neck, where he kissed me softly and whispered to me, “I wauviciw kwach.” That’s when I had a revelation. This fat, large cockroach was my mate. My forever mate. I picked him up with the tips of my pointer finger and thumb, gazing at him with love. He smirked again, his little lips moving. “I... I love you too,” I said as the big cockroach’s friends watched. I think I saw something thin and long and veiny under their bodies moving. The cockroach blushed a dark, dark brown, and I moved him closer to me, pursing my lips for a kiss. I felt his hard, crunchy head touch my soft lips, and I open my mouth to laugh. The leader cockroach goes down my throat, screaming “AIIIYY WAYAYAYYYY.” And then there’s nothing. The little cockroaches watch in shock as I swallow their friend.","userName":"Maipusee Haery","title":"Horrible App - Do Not Recommend, Scary"}}]}
