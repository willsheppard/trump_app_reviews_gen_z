It’s like he’s selling merch too!! He should definitely be in the vlog squad. Orange Cheeto Man ✨ back to the app though. It was horrible. I don’t understand what happens but as soon as I downloaded it, everything possible was going downhill. I dropped my cup of ramen this afternoon and while I dropped it, it gave me a third degree burn along with glass in my foot. This is absolutely horrible💝. Along with that I had to see President Cheeto on tv. 🤢 wth no thank you I do not want to see that orange Oompa Loompa🍊My day was completely ruined. Then right after I saw Cheeto dust on tv I started throwing up constantly I went to the ER and they told me I had Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. It’s a real thing if you didn’t know. Don’t believe me? Look it up.💅🏼 Then after all of this, my phone kept advertising for Oompa Loompa. No! I do not want to see the orange head that made my life go downhill!! I reported it and put it as an add that showed explicit content. Disgusting. My life has just been going even more downhill since then. I decided to jump off a cliff because I couldn’t handle this all. BUT I COULDNT EVEN DIE!! I ended up paralyzed and now I’m stuck with this 😢 PayPal me. Haha just kidding. But this app is disgusting. ✨✨ i do not recommend this app to anyone in their right mind. Anyway love. Thank you for reading.","date":"2020-07-09T15:27:01Z"}},{"id":"6176614210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"idisliketrump","review":"This is the worst app I have ever seen in my whole life it took 45 weeks too download what a app they are trying too cheat you on this app why would I want this app anyways I did not vote for Donald j trump anyways this app is a racist app so again plz don’t download this app unless you are leaving a bad review and a bad rating I’m not a hateful person but after these last 3 years of trump being president I have not seen a change of good but I have seen a change of bad we all know that this virus going on right now isn’t not from China this is a thing the president made and forgot too leave it over in China so then it spreaded then there’s this hate war going on if you see what I am seeing don’t vote for trump let’s show him that this is not how you make America great again he’s trying too split colored and white people up like back in slavery time I will refuse to not step up and say something about it we can’t let Donald J trump win this election again we need a better president because he obviously not trying too make this world a better place for anyone but whites he thinks that if he gives us this stimulus check for a second Time he will get more votes no he won’t we can’t let him win America this is coming from a biracial women I refuse to step down this world can’t take much more it’s time too get this racist out of office","date":"2020-07-09T13:02:48Z"}},{"id":"6174877348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"꧁𝕔𝕚𝕒𝕣𝕣𝕒꧂","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"CGC.143","review":"When I first saw this app i was curious and downloaded it. My vision was PERFECTLY fine but then after I started seeing a bunch of pictures Donald Trump on the app and my vision started to get blurry. I thought it was because I was on my phone to much so for the rest of the day and the day after I didn’t go on my phone or any type of technology. My vision was fine during that period of time but then when I got back on the trump app I literally couldn’t see anything I was blind. I started to freak out because I couldn’t see. I told my mom and she took me to the eye doctor right away. I went through some tests and then the eye doctor told me to be careful on social media and the official trump app 2020 because I have a disease called TP-2020 which stands for Trump pence 2020. When the doctor said that he gagged because he is allergic to trump supporters (so am I it runs through the genes). Anyways the disease I was diagnosed with TP-2020 (Trump pence 2020) which is when you can’t look at pictures of Donald Trump for more than 10 minutes or then your vision will get blurry the more you look at a pic of him the blurrier your vision gets to the point you become blind for 24 hours(which I ain’t complaining because I don’t wanna see a crusty dusty orange). The disease is quite common especially if you get this app. SO DONT GET THE APP OR YOU WILL GET TP-2020!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:30:01Z"}},{"id":"6177461808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"So scared!! 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"DebraQueen1957","review":"Hey guys! So I downloaded this app to help out all my Trump Lovers. I was excited! I love supporting a racist and sexist!  Yet after this app, Trump haunts me in my dreams. I opened this app to see this orange man, pointing at me like I’m the chosen one. As I am a Trump supporter, I have never watch any television or read any news. So, I had no idea what this man looked like. Holy Cow! He looks like a Cheeto! I started watching some news, and do you know what this guy is saying? OMG! Crazy man!! So I stopped supporting the Cheeto Man, and started doing some research. As I was doing some research, the app started talking to me! It said “Don’t leave Debra! Trump has no chance of winning this year, and you’re our only hope!” Then, as I peek out my bedroom door, I SEE THE APP!! WITH A KNIFE!!! The app chased after me, and was screaming “TRUMP 2020, GRAB HER BY THE PU**Y!” I was horrified. It chased me all the way from Alabama, to the White House, where Cheeto Man, attacked me! He screamed “Trump 2020”, but as I said “You have small hands”, he transformed into a Cheeto. Then, I ran away to home, and the square app chased me. I was able to lock my door and hope for the best. Now, I stay awake every night, waiting for the Trump App to attack again. Legend has it, my neighbors tell me he is still outside of my window. I am losing sleep, and DO NOT RECOMMEND. Please, in all seriousness, no NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP OR KANYE. #settleforbiden2020","date":"2020-07-09T16:55:54Z"}},{"id":"6177328878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Caused me so many problems","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"The Iron Jet!!😎😎😎","review":"So I tried to download this because I was a trump supporter. But when I tried to, I got a virus on my phone. Why would a president want to infect the technology of teens and other adults. So I had to get a new phone because the one I had was BEYOND repair. And then somehow, I don’t know how. Trump supporters found my address and toilet papered my house. Shot silly string in my windows and now I have to clean it all up. Then monkeys wearing trump for president shirts came up to me while I was getting some Brahms, and they started to punch me in the face. At some point, animal control had to come around and take them off me, because they were literally dog piling me. Then I got home and my house was turned into a garbage dump. Literally a dump where garbage trucks come in and dump all the garbage. I wonder if this app is in there somewhere. So now I have no home and no WiFi so that means no video games. I can’t stream to my viewers. And that is all because of this app. Also the people who made this app plan to take away my precious tik tok. And this will not happen. Mark my words. The people of tik tok will fight back. I will post this on tik tok. And we will fight back. People who have this app have nothing to hide. We are just weirdos who have big dreams. And this app and the people who work for trump. Are trying to crush everyone on Tiktoks dream.","date":"2020-07-09T16:16:50Z"}},{"id":"6176904225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app destroyed my life","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Lib Eral","review":"so first off, i’d like to say that my intentions with downloading this app were to help the “president” “make america great again” which baffles me because it has never been great. did you mean when slavery was still happening? oh, or did you mean when people in the lgbtqia+ community were forced to be put through conversion therapy? or when america was war ridden? ANYway, i downloaded this app with high hopes. needless to say, i was let down bigly. it started with trump asking for my phone number. trust me i was flattered, but donald, you are married!!!! next came the hundreds of thousands of spam messages. i did not ask for these messages!!!! and then once i had become too scared of these spam messages and after lots of careful consideration, i decided to delete the app. i did not need this much spam in my life. when i went to delete it, my fingers were paralyzed by waves of conservative energy coming from my phone screen. i was stuck like this for hours!!! when i moved my fingers far far away from the phone, this was when i was freed. i was terrified!!! who wouldn’t be?? so i threw my phone at the wall with the strength of a hundred oompa loompas. it shattered!!!! and while the app is now absent from my life, it lives on in my nightmares, years later. in conclusion, do NOT get this app!!! it will terrorize you!!!","date":"2020-07-09T14:19:15Z"}},{"id":"6176802445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST!!APP!!EVER!!DO!!NOT!!INSTALL!!🤬🤬😤🤢👎👎🏻👎🏼👎🏽👎🏾👎🏿","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"TikToker🥰🥰","review":"if i could rate this app with -100,000,000 STARS, I WOULD. when i clicked the “get” button to install this app, it wouldn’t let me get out of the app store or else it would reset the installation, but it’s never done that for ANY other app before. so i tried downloading different apps to see if it was an update...and it only happened for this app. i basically had to watch the little circle completely get filled up!! i spent about 6 hours waiting for this app to download so i could see what it does for my racist, rapist, homophobic, white supremacist, orange, president...and it crashed my phone😤🤬!!!!!! the entire screen went black and it made a VERY obnoxious high-pitched sound. all i saw was a black screen. i tried turning it on, swiping up for the “home button”, changing the volume of my phone and nothing worked...so i put it in rice. after about a day and a half, it started working again. but i had to go through all that because i just wanted to support my president. so i guess this is what happens when you try supporting your president🤷🏻\u200D♀️. this experience just adds on to my VERYYYY LONGGG list of why people shouldn’t support our orange president and why he ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE VOTED OUT OF THE OFFICE. SO IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE...HELP VOTE HIM OUT OF OFFICE SO WE CAN GIVE AMERICA A SHOT AT ACTUALLY BEING GREAT.✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","date":"2020-07-09T13:52:28Z"}},{"id":"6176741098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointing 😞","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Cool whip apple","review":"So When I first downloaded the app it seemed to be working ok but the SECOND the APP herd the words vote for bidin( which I didn’t even say it was the freaking news!!!!!!) my whole phone turned red. I got hacked and all my contacts had been turned into trump supporters and I couldn’t tell which was my grandma!!!!!!! I was soposed to meet up with my granny to plan out a BLM protest. I immediately ran to my car to get to my grandmas house but 4 Oompa Loompa’s TOOK MY CAR !!!!!!!!! Thus I sprinted to my grandmas house to see that she had been tied up and was being held hostage by the Oompa Loompa’s. They wanted 10,000 and a vote for trump but wouldn’t accept mine because I was a woman and told my to go make a sandwich. I proceeded to use my defense karate to destroy the Oompa Loompa’s. Once this was completed me and my grandma went in hiding. We are still scared for our lives and are constantly relocating. I have been contemplating telling my story for weeks but have had a lot of encouragement from tic tokers. They have really helped me to heal the wounds that trump and his app have caused. If you are a woman just know if anything happens they will not let you solve it. Very disappointed with the exclusivity with this app especially with our day and age. I hope that the developers will fix this problem and thus next time I will not have to destroy the Oompa Loompa’s.","date":"2020-07-09T13:36:17Z"}},{"id":"6174060636","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A perfectly good waste of time and money","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Dixie Nór Mous","review":"This app took a good 35 minutes to load. And I have superb internet actually the best internet. My internet is so fast and dependable. It is the most dependable and reliable internet. It’s so reliable if I died i would rely on it to bring me back and it would. It’s over all a great internet. The best internet. As soon as this app loads it automatically takes $20 dollars out of your bank account and then makes you pay $5 dollars for every article you want to read. And I love to read. Some say I am the best reader there is and will ever be. I am very good at reading books and articles. It’s a passion of mine. My favorite book is the seek and finds at the doctors office. Hahaha I’m just kidding. I am also a very good kidder. One of the bests actually. I kid all the time with adults and kids and even the elderly. Anyway I don’t like this app don’t get it and if you have it delete it. As soon as you delete it it will tell you how much you owe and it will tell your bank to give them the money. And you have to pay it or they send the irs to your house to take everything you love. They took my cat and my venti mocha swirl. It was very sad. One of the saddest days in all of history. That’s all have a wonderful day and delete the app right away. I wish someone told me before they took manny away. Poor cat :(","date":"2020-07-08T23:11:06Z"}},{"id":"6176287380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App gave me diarrhea!! 😡😤😤","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Marty McFly ❤️😘","review":"I was watching 👀 the news this morning when I heard 👂 somebody talking about the Trump 2020 app. Excited, 🤗 I ran 🏃\u200D♂️ to my phone 📱 to download and see what it was all about! I couldn’t wait to see what sort of kind ❤️, intelligent 🧠, and factual 👍 content my dear president might be sharing on this platform. It wasn’t until after I was forced 😡😡 to give all my personal information that I found out I’d made a grave mistake 🔞. My entire screen turned white ⬜️⬜️ and President Trump came on screen🤯. It was a recording 🔴 of him stating his future plans for 2020 when he hopes to win the election 🇺🇸. He said that he would be putting the middle and lower class to work on diary farms 🐄 all over the country without any hopes for salvation. Me, being lactose intolerant, was reminded of my fourth grade dairy farm field trip. Yes, 😔 it’s almost as bad ‼️as you’re imagining. During this trip I was asked to drink a fresh glass of milk🥛, but I was unsettled...it only took a few minutes until a literally pooped 💩 myself😟. I was so embarrassed! 😩 The mere recollection of this occurrence had me running to my bathroom 🚽 and I couldn’t be more upset 🤬. I knew Mr Trump was up to some stinky 🤢 business but I didn’t know it would be this stinky! I’ve been on the toilet for 12 days trying to recover.🆘❌ DO NOT GET THIS APP! WHO KNOWS WHAT HE MAY DO TO YOU...❌","date":"2020-07-09T11:32:03Z"}}]}
