DO NOT GET 😡","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of staying informed on the best and definitely not racist president’s campaign. As soon as I opened the app, it asked for my personal phone number. My parents always said “never give out personal information”. Donald Trump has never offended anyone, so I was flabbergasted by this offensive question. Afterwards, it ran away with my microwave and all my cheeto puffs. Donald Trump already looks like a cheeto puff, I don’t need him taking mine. 😾😾 Before I downloaded this app, my phone was perfectly fine. Now, it has started glitching and has a virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! You’ll regret it and won’t have a microwave or cheeto puffs 😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"|| anon ||","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:31Z"}},{"id":"6174782843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Need a new phone","review":"I downloaded the app and as soon as I opened it, my phone caught on fire and I had to go to the hospital with 3rd degree burns. My whole house caught on fire and my dog didn’t get out in time. I lost all sensory in my hand that they had to amputate it. Now I can’t finish my college degree because I lost my right hand and need to adjust to using my left. I have 3 kids and now won’t have the money to provide for them because now we are homeless and I’ll be out of work due to my loss of function and only having one hand. Now I have to consider giving up one of my kids for adoption. Thanks a lot, Trump.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Blehse","date":"2020-07-09T03:02:07Z"}},{"id":"6174764062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I hate this app","review":"I downloaded this app to see what your president is doing and so when I got the app they started spamming me messages which made my phone glitch and it started to annoy me especially cause I asked them to stop, so then....

As soon as I opened the app it scanned my face and an alert popped up telling me that I could not proceed any further due to the fact that I am a black female. After being stopped for something that I was born with and cannot change I deleted this app and decided to write this review. If you have read this review I hope you’re having a wonderful day and to remember that you are a beautiful human being no matter what ethnicity you are.

I had never expected to view him without his usual clean and expensive suits. Instead, I was greeted with what was underneath...and it wasn’t even anything my eyes could stand.\nI’ll admit, I sought out therapy afterwards. For anyone who has suffered like I have, feel free to reach out to me and I will provide you with the services needed to erase the traumatic image from your mind.✋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"RyanLmao","date":"2020-07-09T01:05:37Z"}},{"id":"6174274668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump is Naked with the his First Lady","review":"I opened the app and there’s Trump And his Wife The First Lady are Naked and it’s full of porn I thought it was gonna have political stuff in it Nope I was wrong there’s child porn on this app yucky that’s disgusting and the app wants to know your social security number and it wants to know if your mom is single too they want to know where u was born who I’m dating than it takes me to swipe right or left on who is better fit to be president and it was between Trump and Biden this app has the Trojan virus 😡😡😡😡😡 please delete this app it’s disgusting and disrespectful there’s videos of Trump having sex with children I don’t like Trump anymore","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"joelfromwisconsin1","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:06Z"}},{"id":"6174262625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wish I could give negative stars","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app my phone blew up with text messages. I opened them to find the most horrifying pictures of Donald Trump nude. I then threw up on my bedroom floor and passed out. When I came to my phone was ringing off the hook and when I answered it I heard the most horrible voice screaming “Take away the rights of women and people of color! Just support trump!!” I then passed out again and when I woke up I deleted the app immediately and then right after my phone sparked and burst into flames. I am traumatized and I had to buy a new phone. This is the worst app I have ever used. 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Syhggj","date":"2020-07-09T00:24:49Z"}},{"id":"6174240182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"an HONEST review","review":"For starters, this app asked for all sorts of personal information. Social security number, cell/work/home phone number, my address, my full name as well as the names of my husband and children, and my political party status. Once signed up, I received non-stop notifications, texts and phone calls even after I deleted the app. And I was charged for each text and call I received! On top of that, the app was very glitchy and kept crashing on me. It sent texts that were completely irrelevant to trump news, and much of it was extremely racist and sexist. If I could give a lower rating I would.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"mlen.125","date":"2020-07-09T00:17:06Z"}}]}
