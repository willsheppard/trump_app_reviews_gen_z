I opened the app and gave it all my information, and I was beginning to peruse the app itself, when I heard a loud crash coming from my kitchen. I went to the kitchen, and I found a bag full of TRUMP 2020 face masks filled with rocks had been thrown through my kitchen window. This was not a problem, as when you sign into the app it says they will be delivered, but the real issue was that in the corner of my kitchen the tank that housed my goldfish was suddenly mysteriously empty! This app stole my goldfish!!! I don’t care about the election, or the app, or anything anymore. All I want.......... is to get Mr. Bubble back. Please, just send back Mr. Bubble.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174433732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I tried to but it’s just no ❤️","userName":"Danny DeVito ✌🏻","review":"First of all I NEVER write reviews but the caucasity of this application led me here. ⚠️ THIS APP TOOK FOREVEEEER TO DOWNLOAD⚠️It baffles me how we are in the 21st century and still have apps that take a whole afternoon to download sorry Cheeto but I DO NOT have all day. I let that go and as I went to open the app the most horrifying screeching sound started playing that my pet rock who has been disabled 🦽 all its life got up and started running 🏃\u200D♀️ 💨 out of the house! Even after I left the app the sound kept going! I couldn’t stop it so I had to smash my phone to death 💀 #RIP MY PHONE 📱 ⚰️  Save yourself the trouble and NEVER download this app. The only plus that came from this was my pet rock finally being able to walk 🕺🏻\n\nNintendo 3DS Image Share","rating":1}},{"id":"6174326577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:46:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER MADE!","userName":"lime👺","review":"I got this app to learn more about pretty much everything. Right as I opened the app and signed up and everything, HIS NUDES 🍆🍑 popped up. All over my screen! And when I thought it was over I saw a video of him doing the nasty🤢 WITH A TEEN. I don’t know HOW this app got allowed to be here because this is not okay. His Cheeto cheeks can’t leave my mind now😔 and right when I thought the worst couldn’t happen, IT DID. My mom saw my phone and fainted on the ground because of the carrot she saw on Cheeto🥕 my dogs RAN AWAY because they couldn’t handle all of this😭🏃🏽\u200D♀️and ever since I opened this app, my eyesight left the chat! And last but definitely not least, his plans for us😬 which pretty much wanted to end us😱 were leaked as well👺✋🏽 THIS APP NEEDS TO GO RIGHT NOW!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174298190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Nastiest Cheeto Bag EVER‼️‼️‼️","userName":"Reyahna Smith","review":"I opened the app to find out that it was LESS than halfway full. I mean as you’d expect from a lays company chip bag it’s not all the way full so the chips don’t crush during shipping, and instead are usually halfway or a little more full. However I opened this expired app with a dusty Cheeto from 1945 on the front page. I thought “huh that’s weird” but proceeded to sign up as normal. Only to find the app/bag LESS THAN HALFWAY FULL!!!! There were a total of 3 Cheetos. Much disappointed, could’ve been better. Did not live up to all of the fake news and hype. Then I find the NUDES of the Cheeto from 1945 in one of the tabs, I was mortified. As a minor I must say that seemed pretty illegal. Sad to hear about the death of the pres tho, hope the families taking it ok.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174040445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"please stop I’m gonna be sick-","userName":"Brielle9213","review":"i opened this app to see a Cheeto with blonde wavy hair staring into heaven- first off, we both know he aint no goin to heaven. second off, he’s blocking the flag! i cant even see the glorious stripes and stars! please move him to the bottom so that I can see the flag. i showed my mom and dad and they threw up and somehow (don’t ask how) SHE ENDED UP GOING INTO A COMAAA?!? “Haha, very funny” you may think, but this isn’t a joke. i miss my mother coming home from work everyday. i have crippling depression, because I asked Siri to bring me to the “powerpuff girls show” and it brought me to him.

I was trying to sleep but I felt someone starring at me and next thing you know I see trump. So I followed him home and I saw he had Barrón and ivanka trump tied up and knocked out. And I see him trying to get with his daughter so u lit up the White House and save everyone but the orange Cheeto. And I saved them and they were living with me and one day I went to Walgreens to get some snacks and I get arrested for touching the snickers because Donald trump hates snickers and I got put in jail for 50 years and he stole back Barrón and ivanka.
