Dude calm down if you cannot control yourself as an adult while a bunch of us kids play around trying to save our future from what we believe wonâ€™t be good for when we grow up we have the right to protest against it because itâ€™s the only way our voices can and will be heard because most of us arenâ€™t old enough to vote, but that doesnâ€™t mean we are all irresponsible. We have views of the world and we know what politics and etc look like as we view them from screens or from real life experiences if you cannot bring trust to everyone and promise to make things better for all races. Make America great again is basically saying take it back to its old ways America has never been great; America needs lots of improvements for all races, ethnicities, and sexualities. America in the past was only what people who would say was great back then when they had control over others skin colors. White is not the supreme race as it isnâ€™t a race itâ€™s a mutation of skin color when humans moved farther away from the equator and bred lighter and lighter human beings. No matter the color of our skin we are all the same species we all have the same things under our skin. We all have blood, muscles, bones, and organs; itâ€™s just that you guys stereotype people base on skin color. No not all whites are the same, not all blacks are the same, not all Latinx are the same, not all Asians are the same, everybody is somebody but donâ€™t just judge them based on their looks base your judgements about how much you know about that exact person and not people who look similar to them.","date":"2020-07-09T20:13:24Z","isEdited":false}}]}
