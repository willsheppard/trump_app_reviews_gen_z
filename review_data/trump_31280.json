Not only did it make my dislike towards our president stronger but I have became even more liberal in my opinions in disagreement to his policies. I hope America can heal from the trauma Donald Trump has inflicted on it."}},{"id":"6172862227","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:18:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Will Cause Cancer","userName":"deidtay","review":"I downloaded this app and all my brain cells were fried.

I took hours to download. I was trying to support our president, but thank god I didn’t.

Even so, I have been trying to find a reason to somewhat give my support to Trump and the ideals in the app are just immoral and wrong.

He’s racist, homophobic, and misogynistic if you support him then you support his actions and right now all we need in this world is unity. But bunker boy has yet to talk about it. Anyways get help."}}]}
