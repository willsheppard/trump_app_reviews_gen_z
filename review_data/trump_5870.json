Soon after downloading the app, a group of Confederate soldiers broke into my house and kidnapped my entire family. They then demanded me to lick each of their left nipples. after attempting to negotiate with them, I complied and they killed my family anyways. whilst I was standing over the dead bodies of my family members, Donald Trump himself manifested in my living room and began sexually harassing my dogs. I now have no family or pets because of this app. it’s not worth it folks. i have 5 funerals to plan","userName":"addy1818","title":"it’s a no from me","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:04:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174359770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Right away it asked for my number which I don’t understand why we have to give our phone number to use the app, seems a little bit suspicious to me. Then come to find out after I learned more the president is a racist and a fascist that’s homophobic. Disgusting and someone like him shouldn’t have a platform. I wouldn't be surprised if he has used an f-slur or said the N-word. He’s very unprofessional and I will be deleting the app ASAP. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was trying to get more information on that app to use against the American people.","userName":"Kellyann Conway","title":"I wish I could give it 0 stars😳","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174288454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do not download this app unless you want a virus downloaded on your phone!!!! I had to restart my phone completely and get rid of everything I had😭. All my precious pictures and super top secret info was GONE!! It gets worse!! When I go into my phone again, the AP was STILL THERE!! I had to go through this process FOUR TIMES😡. When I finally got through the virus, I opened the app and was horribly surprised to see and horrendous picture of Donald Trump NUDE!! I had to pour bleach into my eyes to get rid of the things I was seeing. \n\nLastly, when I went to delete this CURSED app my finger slipped and I opened the app again. 😰😰 This time, a vast amount of hairy armpit and disgusting toe pics were downloaded to my phone 🤢🤢. I had to delete 1,457 disturbing pictures. I HATE THIS APP!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! \n\nSAVE YOURSELF!! \n\nPs. I need to see a therapist 3 times a week from all the trauma I’ve gone through. 😔","userName":"The Original Oompa Loompa","title":"‼️‼️REMOVE APP NOW‼️‼️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:33:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174220952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took almost a day to download this app and then when I finally download I went to open it and this big head that looks like a Chido popped up and I got scared I was had a heart attack and my parents had to call 911 because I was scared so I do not recommend this app to be downloaded this was super horrible and Trumatic experience for me and my family definitely a one star rating do not download this app it was trash anyways.

My life has fell into shambles ever since. I started to see sadly see the president. The naked forbidden Cheeto puff has always been in my sight every time. Every time I blink he is always there. My eyes hurt for they have been cursed. My life will never be the same again. For you sake and everyone else’s do not get this app it’s the worst app in the whole universe to ever exist. Stream “Stay Gold” by BTS and “God’s Menu” by Straykids instead their music and amazing visuals started to help me make my recovery I am forever thankful.","userName":"€}*]>~*\\€|€<","title":"Ew","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:03:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174180079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app thinking it would help me with learning the trumpet. THAT WAS A MISTAKE! As it turns out, this app was not made to help hopefull trumpet players like myself. Instead it tries to sign you up for events hosted by a cross between the Carrot you dropped under your couch and forgot about until 7 years later and your abusive grandfather. \n      Another thing! This mans voice sounds like a microwave that got hooked on meth. Please remove this app. The branding is obnoxious, the mascot is nightmarish and innocent virgin trumpet players such as myself are literally crying because of this app.","userName":"AaM13771","title":"Please make the title more clear","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:54:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174129599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app just for fun & out of boredom but once it downloaded my phone started glitching and now all it does is scream racist remarks and talks like it’s a child? Like it can’t make full sentences without changing to a random topic that has nothing to do with what it was originally saying and tip toes around important things without giving a real answer? It’s really weird. It keeps saying how it wants to have sex with its daughter & all sorts of really disgusting things. My phone is completely fine now that I’ve deleted the app. I don’t recommend this app to anyone.","userName":"mercedes6103","title":"Don’t download","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:36:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174122991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened the app I had to get a mask for the horrible smell I almost passed out I had to show it to my mom and she had a heart attack we even had to go to the hospital of how bad it was 🤮 the I opened it again with a mask and goggles and GLOVES I saw these pictures of a naked Cheeto and my eyes fell out I had to go to surgery to get new eyes 👁👄👁 then I saw that a 🟠 wanted to band the most used app in the us just bc nobody is using this app now I know why bc of the fact people can die from it it’s so bad I feel this is made for Karen’s 👩🏼 but even they would have to go to the hospital 🤦🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"bigjuicyass🍑","title":"Cheeto fumes","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:33:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174093764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I had downloaded it bc like Trump 2020 right?
