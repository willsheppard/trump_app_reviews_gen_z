I think this app gives us a great opportunity and the availability to get involved, I’ve seen our president age greatly in a short amount of time, most likely due to the ignorance of people who do dumb things like rally up social media platform friends to bash a freakin App! All y’all can kiss my brown booty, leave the president alone, I think he really does have our best interests at heart, but dealing with you lil farts I’d make snide marks against you and yours too! Go bash your friends who are encouraging this ignorance cause they’re making you look dumber then you already are like a puppet going along with the first numb nut who shoves his hand up your rear end to grab your strings!

Well, let’s just say I’m not surprised by what I found on the app.\nWhen I went onto his app, I immediately puked by how DISGUSTING it was.  I’d never hated #Trump2020 so much.  The second I opened it, I saw his orange face staring at me, which was not good because I have a phobia of ugly people, so you can probably imagine how horrified I was.  Then, it asked for my mobile number, which I was hesitant to give, but I did it anyway.\nAfter that, it asked me if I wanted to help him win the next election.  I would tell you what else is on the app, but I clicked off right about there.\nSorry, but I don’t want America to be TRASH for yet another four years.  It was hard enough getting through the first four, thank you very much.  \nBut overall, I would rate this app a 1/10.  I hate it so much.  Don’t waist your time on downloading it.","date":"2020-07-08T18:23:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173119801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idkwhattonicknameme","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting","review":"This app is not the way to go. Our president is very corrupt and he just doesn’t have a heart in my opinion. He decided it was okay to not let trans people have medical rights, many children have been lost in ICE, he doesn’t know how to run the country. He’s a business man not a politician. Our president does not deserve that tittle he’s let down many people. He is full of white supremacy, and to those people who say “how can he be racist or how can he hate Hispanics and other minorities when he hires them and let’s them work for him” it’s one thing to hire someone for a job and it’s another to respect them, their culture, their appearance, and their language. He doesn’t wear a mask during this pandemic along with a lot of people who claim their “muzzled”. Okay Karen they can’t see your smile but who even wants to look at it after you’ve doubtlessly disrespected many people. For all you “Christians” out there he is not the way to go.","date":"2020-07-08T17:39:08Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173033821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"title":"When Ariana said just keep breathing she wasn’t talking about you","review":"When I downloaded this app my phone started to glitch immediately and started playing 🧚🏻\u200D♀️xue hua piao (a Chinese song) but then it made my phone Bluetooth or something because when I walked into my living room it started playing “real woman vote for trump” and I was just like what the heck is happening.

I said “Well, that’s weird” and then realized that this is our president. I laughed it off and whatnot but then I saw in the corner of this picture a text. It said  the following: “Help me -B”. Now I’m not one for conspiracy theories but this got me thinking... “THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM BARON” I said out loud. That was a BIG mistake! As soon as I said that the cops broke into my room and sprayed mace on my face. Lucky for me I set booby traps in my room for events like this. The cops were trapped and stuck in my net and I laughed in pain as I saw(blurry but now I’m fine) them struggling to get out ... I have been questioning them ever since and, I’m going to say this once again: I’m not one of conspiracy theories but what they have told me I’m led to believe that Trump is an orange, racist, fascist, pedophiliac alien that fell on the face of the earth to destroy the world...","date":"2020-07-08T16:17:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172855462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no i am radio reblde","isEdited":false,"title":"Fridge man","review":"So I downloaded this app. To see what type of orange vegetables were best🥕🥕🍊🍑🍊🍑 but when I open the app I only saw one orange vegetable and it wasn’t even a vegetable it was a man👨\u200D🦳👨🏻\u200D🦳👨\u200D🦳🤦🏻 so I deleted the app right away and then I headed to my fridge to get a nice and juicy juicy carrot🥕🥕🥕🥕 but when I open my fridge the orange man from the app came from the fridge and held a water gun up 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫to my head🔫🔫🔫🔫 and this is what he said,”If you do not download my app and leave a good review I will haunt you and your family for the rest of eternity”🤯🤮🤡I was super scared but I remembered this Tik tok video about psychology tricks🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️ so I asked the orange man this,”When you are shooting me do you breathe in or out” and as he was there sitting in thinking about it I put him in a bag🧺💊🧬 and then I put him in the oven and turn them into a carrot cake🍰🎂🍰🧁🍰🍦🎂🥕🥕🥕🥕,So my advice to you is do not download this app or you might die.🤮👺😱😤🤬😨🥵🥳🙂","date":"2020-07-08T16:16:45Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177895350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"taylorbvibindoe","isEdited":false,"title":"THE APP STORE SUPPORTS RACISTS","review":"Trump is a racist, homophobic man, which is no surprise why this app is so terrible in the first place. I was extremely disappointed for this app to take weeks to download. i just wanted to see an oompa loompa corn stranded hairy think that BLM don’t matter. Gen z/ tiktokers isn’t going down without a fight. I was so frightened to see so many  idiotic uneducated old men all in one app that i actually ran away from home. it’s such a bad influence for younger children and i would never let my children to look at this horrific app. just do us all a favor and kick it off the app store. it’ll save all of us a breath.🧚🏻\u200D♀️🦋✨ as a leader in hannah montana i cannot explain how scary it is to see hannah with jake, let alone with trump. get your mind outta the gutter john b it’s not like i’ve seen losers before. cough cough i’m so scared of my life looking at this app, i believe it belongs to the streets.

Unfortunately even I can admit this app is horrible. The minute I opened it it crashed, not a good start. THEN once i got into the app it was very laggy and glitchy. If i tapped one article it either would freeze and not open or open a whole different one. The whole app consistently crashed as well. To make matters worse my phone had gotten soooo much slower after downloading, I am sure it’s correlated. After deleting the Trump app everything went back to normal. In addition to the software issues; I saw multiple examples of completely inaccurate, un-cited information. I appreciate that my president is trying to keep me updated, but lots of it is blatantly false? Lastly, the way the app is set up is TERRIBLE, very hard to navigate and hard to read due to the text size. It really doesn’t deserve the one star even to be honest.","date":"2020-07-09T16:32:09Z","rating":1}}]}
