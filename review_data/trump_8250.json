Anyways so this app should be deleted immediately, it is emotionally scarring and inappropriate for people who believe in human rights or anyone who has at least a lick of empathy. thank you ❤️"}},{"id":"6173927537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ouppy","date":"2020-07-08T22:20:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I think it’s curse","review":"I was looking forward to downloading the app but it took a day to load, when I opened the app it kept crashing. I finally decided to delete some apps and try again, it still didn’t work. Then in the middle of the night I was woken by something. I didn’t know what it was so I went back to sleep. Sleep never came so I decided to open the app again. It worked! But the face I saw on it scared me so bad That now I need months of therapy. Please don’t make the same mistake as me."}},{"id":"6173898477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ahah 🤚🏽🧿","date":"2020-07-08T22:10:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible luv 💋🙈","review":"DO NOT i repeat DO NOT download this app it gives your device DISGUSTING viruses! i downloaded it, and my iphone 11 has been glitching so bad! my phone battery now lasts less than 30 minutes when it used to go up to 2 DAYS, it also took hours to download!

Today it finally let me in the app but for some odd reason the app exploded in my phone!!! 🔥🔥I don’t know how that was even possible. Then about a couple of days later my dogs app exploded as well!! 💥💥💥This app is absolutely dangerous!!!"}},{"id":"6173680319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jaedyn Bagby","date":"2020-07-08T20:49:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"How did Apple approve this app?","review":"I had the WORST experience on this app. I had witnessed myself and many others be degraded for my race and sexuality. Apple why did you let this app continue while it is promoting fascism, a white homeland, racism, homophobia, ICE, the Blue Lives Matter movement, the All Lives Matter movement, and many more. I am truly disgusted how I have witnessed such ignorance after using this app. This app is spreading false information about the worldwide issues, and degrading to POC, Apple how could you be promoting this app’s message I am appalled."}}]}
