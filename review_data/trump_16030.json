It was so bad I had to undownload it and I’m never downloading it again. If your planning on getting this app I suggest not to. You will be highly disappointed as I was:( you would think a person with that amount of money would actually invest in a good app but no. Overall this app is absolutely trash end of story.","rating":1,"userName":"justin beiber6068","title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173535235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so during the 3 hour time it took me to download this app, my phone started to get super hot.

The app took 7 days to download i don’t know if it’s because Trump created the world in 7 days why it took so long. Upon downloading it started to play “are you coming to the tree” out of nowhere 15 million cockroaches came into my house with knives saying “rate 5 stars or die” I ran screaming in fare thinking I would die. I escaped. 1 star","rating":1,"userName":"hshdbjdgdidhd","title":"Roaches evicted me and my family.","date":"2020-07-08T19:54:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173510723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so confused about all the one star reviews.

Putting an orange on the front page was NOT the best idea. 🧚🏼✨He needs to put some chapstick on and some moisturizer✨🧚🏼. I almost got epilepsy from how bad the glitches were- that indicates health issues. How bad does an app have to be to give me health issues? Of course it’s an app from Donald Trump too. Don’t use this app if you’re a supporter of black lives matter✊🏾✊🏿","rating":1,"userName":"Orange juice pony","title":"TERRIBLE.
