But it’s useless, if anything it’s causing my phone to crash whenever I click new things. Super upset that I can’t use this app, but it’s just not functional. It’s okay though, I’ll just get my news regarding president cheeto from another app instead. Yeah❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Would not recommend"}},{"id":"6177960832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tacobellgodess","date":"2020-07-09T19:31:16Z","review":"So I wanted to see this ✨orange✨ attempt to try to be re-elected again and it asked me to put in my phone number or whatever. And I am sad to say that the instructions were unclear and now my grandmother is in a ✨Walgreens✨ with no underwear nor shoes in New York. So that is very ✨unfortunate and unprofessional✨ I am terrified that they want to keep T H I S app open but not tiktok. Very sad to see this is what America has came to.😔","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Very sad"}},{"id":"6177999208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AJ123498765","date":"2020-07-09T19:43:47Z","review":"Just rating it 5 stars because people are trying to take it down since they can’t respect other people’s political views.","rating":5,"isEdited":false,"title":"5 Stars"}},{"id":"6177933394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cheetostealer101","date":"2020-07-09T19:22:22Z","review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE.

After an hour all of me was orange! i bit myself and I WAS A CHEETO! i tasted pretty good, but that’s not the point.

Once I downloaded the app, I started seeing my skin turn more orange! My phone turned into an orange, and started screaming sexist and racist things! I am genuinely scared for my life!!

This app should be taken off the app store and Tiktok should stay.

Worst app ever like did the people who make it even have enough experience to make this? Like you need to have experience to let other people experience but you didn’t have enough experience to accomplish the experience others wanted so why don’t you go get some experience. ✨🧚\u200D♀️pendejos🧚\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app to ever be made ✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177728157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"give us tue views back","date":"2020-07-09T18:19:08Z","review":"you haven’t done anything that would help America. calling corona virus a hoax, trying to reopen schools completely. plus you are so racist. build a wall. not supporting the black lives matter movement. ever since you were president, I did not see any good changes. you are also sexist with female reporters, and was also racist to china when corona hit. so, you get one star rating you shriveled up orange.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"no"}},{"id":"6177727539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"07zam","date":"2020-07-09T18:18:57Z","review":"When I entered the app I saw Cheeto nudes, I instantly grabbed my bleach and stated washing my eyes. The bleach wasn’t working so I got a needle and injected bleach in my eyes, because Cheeto told us to during COVID so I thought it might help get the image of him out of my head. That didn’t work so I have decided to get a eye transplant from Doctor Nick. And furthermore this app took 76 weeks to download. + it turned all my apps back to 1975","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️no✨"}}]}
