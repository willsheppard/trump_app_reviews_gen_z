I don’t really have a political stance, but they wanted me to support the president and would not leave me alone until I downloaded this app. So I did. First time opening it, it asked for my phone number. I was a bit hesitant, but it’s a government app, my number should be safe, right? No. After entering my phone number into the app, I received various spam messages asking me for money or showing me government propaganda. That’s not all, the app is unbelievably slow and glitchy. It took three days to download, and upon opening shut my phone down entirely. I had to try opening the app 5 times to even enter my phone number or allow notifications etc. My phone’s functionality  decreased after having this app on my phone, but thankfully the damage wasn’t permanent. It took a week for my phone to recover and work normally, even after deleting the app.","userName":"Not gameplay recorder","date":"2020-07-08T20:34:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173003111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"Ive been getting death threats and hateful comments for being Mexican. I find it to be one of the worse types of racism I’ve experienced. I will not stand to be told to go back and clean the floors and go fetch their waters just because I am not American. I am not a slave nor am I a maid. My family are in cages, our children are in cages, our people are denied a life, our people are denied to see their kids. I also find it so stupid and inconsiderate to call a whole state disgusting and call their people rapist, pedophiles, thief’s, gang bangers, narcos, etc. Our people are one of the most hard working humans on this earth and for one to act like they support what we do just to take away our education, our innocence, our families, our life’s, is just overall horrible. How can you be in love with our culture, our food, our music, our dances and yet hate the people who made them? I find this to just be another racist app that has no importance of being here.","userName":"1001010100882991","date":"2020-07-08T17:02:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172846218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Rather play a game with Ads","review":"So just like everyone else I downloaded this app to see how badly our country was failing and to be completely honest, I was disappointed to say the least. See it like this, you know those games that you see advertised on other apps and they look really fun. But after you download the game you realize that you have to watch a minute of adds just to play for 30 seconds. That is how I see this app. Once you hit a good moment and are ready to try again, an ad pops up and you lose all motivation to try again because you had to wait a full minute to play once again. Now replace the word ad with inequality for people of color, sending anti-Semitic troops to attack our “enemies” for no reason, saw COVID-19 as a joke, needless government shut down, racism, over use of his power to “build a wall”, encouragement of ICE and almost led us into a nuclear war. But you know as Hannah Montana once said, everybody makes mistakes.","userName":"get me out of this country","date":"2020-07-08T16:13:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177751374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"You lost my vote.","review":"As an individual who is strongly interested in politics and the preservation of our amazing country and democracy, I downloaded this app to follow President Donald Trumps 2020 campaign because I had voted for him in the previous election and was planning on voting for him again. I was shocked by what I saw with the app. The apps design is extremely confusing and sloppy, making it very hard to get any information or ways to support the campaign from it. The app was also trying to steal my information, asking for my name, phone number, age, etc.. It even has been constantly trying to steal my location. I do not want the Trump administration taking my information as it is a violation of my free rights. I will not stand for this. This app has shown me that Donald Trump is no good fit for office, because if you cannot run a successful and safe app, you have no business running my government. I will no longer be voting for you in the election this November.","userName":"Unicorn Parade","date":"2020-07-09T18:26:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177638878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ROACHES!!!!","review":"i downloaded this app because i’m a huge fan of our very ✨intelligent✨ president. i wanted to to keep up to date on the elections because TRUMP2020🇺🇸. I downloaded the app and then i go up to use the bathroom when i hear a little squeak. i look down at my toes and see the fattest ROACH i’ve ever seen in my entire life. i mean a 6 inch obese roach. it looks up and says to me “DONT VOTE TRUMP” we stare at each other like this 👁👄👁 before i immediately start screaming and trying to find the raid. then this little bih starts CHASING ME. 😟😟 and kept screaming “DONT VOTE TRUMP” i eventually got so scared that while running away from the roach, i deleted the app. when i turned around it was gone. all was left was the silent gust of wind that hummed in my ear “don’t vote trump” i am severely traumatized. i have several appointments with my therapist later this week and the only thing i know now is that this app caused it. so if you don’t want a fat roach chasing you then don’t download it💯","userName":"denise hammy","date":"2020-07-09T17:51:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177609528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"100% Would Recommend","review":"I tapped download on this app 3 months ago. I had honestly forgotten about it when it just appeared on my home screen. I tried to delete it but the delete button kept jumping around the screen so I couldn’t press it. I opened the app and immediately my TV turned on and began displaying red room style torture videos. I looked down at my phone and the entire screen was black except for the words “Don’t look away.” I watched all 128 videos back to back before I started to hear voices in my house from downstairs. All of a sudden, the lights went out in my house and were replaced my red moonlight. I didn’t know what to do so I just snapped my phone in half. The clock immediately turned to 6:00 AM and everything went back to normal. Well, almost everything. There’s now a poster of Trump on my wall with the words “We’ll see you again” written in blood. So all in all great app would definitely get again.","userName":"Spirit Blossom Yasuo","date":"2020-07-09T17:41:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177358416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"To the fact that I actually liked this guy has my mind blown. Not only were there were ads, but they were there multiple times. And one of them were about a yacht! Like common you crippled man. You are sooo rich you don’t got to bribe us with a freaking yacht. And the fact that you have money and don’t fix up your orange tan spray and that nasty rat nest hair is unbelievable. You dainty fingers make witch fingers look more presentable. Now with the app, I hate it. It’s so stupid and I would always get notifications and seeing ur dusty looking dorito face every 5 seconds. I can’t imagine how miserable it is to sleep with this nasty yucky man. And the fact that you want to ban tik tok is HORRIBLE. TO THE PPL WHO R VOTING FOR THIS MAN ARE SOOOO DELUSIONAL!!!! TIK TOK SAVED LIVES. TIK TOK HELPED OTHERS COPE WITH THEIR LOSS, COPE WITH THEIR STRUGGLES. TIK TOK HELPED OTHERS. and I hope mr trump you read this because I think you might like it! 🐱🥵💕🥰😍😏😜😚😘.
