However, when I opened the app I could not seem to find any content that made tangible sense. Now as I am a GUN TOTING REDNECK BIGOT AMERICAN I fully support everything Cheeto has to say. Even despite this I just can’t seem to make sense of anything. Now this might be my illiteracy setting in but I just don’t know. When I open the app I see things like not allowing people to adopt kids and I just can’t get it. Maybe CHEETO PUFF PEDO BOY will figure out how to fix this problem.","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded"}},{"id":"6173620305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:27:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jdhehwkdfnrhej","review":"When going on the app I realized I had accidentally put in the wrong email. the president 🍊 came to my house and we’re very upset. They brought cages of rats and filled my house with them. The rats were everywhere while Trump wats laughing. The rats then brought all their friends and threw a huge birthday party for me when it’s not even my birthday! They then started chanting CULT and that attracted their roach and beetle friends. Due to my fear of eyes, all the little bugs staring at me freaked me out. I was terrified and I’m writing this as they are all dancing in a circle.","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6173615358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:25:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pewdsismine❤️","review":"Me and my kids are major trump supporters so we were SUPER pumped for this app to launch. We even threw a non social distancing cult meeting in front of our Trump shrine to celebrate. When the moment came, we all downloaded it and waited for our lives to be completed by our lord and savior. In hindsight, we should’ve never done such a thing. We opened the app and the first thing that came up on our screens was an HD PICTURE OF TRUMP’S MAGNUM DONG!!!! And that’s the story of how I became blind :). Don’t be silly, please remove the willy!","rating":1,"title":"Completely inappropriate and unsafe for children!!"}},{"id":"6173614623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:25:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Caring Critic","review":"The app isn’t anything like the like the description suggests.  It’s the complete opposite.  When I downloaded the app it gave my phone a virus, and I had to spend a long time trying to fix it!  Don’t trust this app.  It also takes way more storage then it is supposed to.  I need that space for other things!!  I would love to support our l0vely president 🍊 but I just can’t have this app on my phone!  Please take this down before anyone else gets a virus from this app.","rating":1,"title":"Terrible, horrible, quality"}},{"id":"6173590177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hdibsxhsb","review":"I was using this app and then one day while using the app my phone decided to crash. After restarting my phone it crashed again. I tried to delete the app but before I could my phone kept on crashing. So I took my phone to the repair store and they fixed my phone for 150$. Then a few weeks later I got a terrible cold. At 1st it was nothing, and then it became worse. I went to go a coronavirus testing site and the test came back positive. Don’t download this app!!","rating":1,"title":"This app gave me coronavirus"}},{"id":"6173576971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"The queen who slays","review":"My family and I are trump supporters and I wanted to support him as much as I can but after what happened when I got this app I simply can no longer support this man. When I downloaded it it made my phone glitch so bad that it stopped working. I had to buy a whole new phone because this app ruined my old one. Nobody should ever get this app because it is terrible and will literally break your phone. If I could give this zero stars I would please nobody get this app.","rating":1,"title":"This app is so bad it broke my phone"}},{"id":"6173573454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur_mom6968","review":"this app is so bad it gave me a migraine, i had to go to the hospital because it was that bad. i know this app caused it because the second i opened it i could feel all my brain cells die. after a week of having this app on my phone all my other apps were deleted and this was the last thing on my phone. two days later i went to the apple store and they found ROACHES IN MY PHONE 😡!! they told me specifically it was caused by this dumb app that orange 🍊 head made!! but i do recommend this app for dumb people 😁","rating":1,"title":"terrible app!!!"}},{"id":"6173553579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"peepeepoopoo😹😹","review":"I downloaded to support my president and to hear TRUTHFUL information that wasn’t twisted by libtards🙈😡🙄When I opened the app, it immediately closed out. It did that a couple of times and when it FINALLY worked, it started playing heavy rock music. I tried to exit the app but it kept playing. I deleted the app and it was STILL playing!😾Roaches eventually crawled into my house from under the floor and started dancing to the music. I threw my phone outside and the roaches ATTACKED me. I won’t be getting this app again👹🤕🙀","rating":1,"title":"BEYOND disappointed"}},{"id":"6173530104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:56:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"chelle-444","review":"I am usually not the type to give bad reviews but I absolutely hate and do not recommend this app. The app plays this satanic music at night and it is impossible to turn off even if you delete the app. One night it spawned the dead spirit of Epstein and he kept asking me if I wanted to go to his island but I said no. Then, Trump and Maxwell both showed up at my door and they all started performing sacrificial rituals and dancing in my living room. I am traumatized and this app is the reason why I can’t sleep at night.","rating":1,"title":"almost died :("}}]}
