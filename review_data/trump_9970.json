To my disappointment, the app not only took three days to download, but every-time I opened the app, pornography of what my kids said are called “Furrys” would play and would only turn off if I dropped my phone in the toilet! I wish I could give this a zero star.","date":"2020-07-08T22:01:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download."}},{"id":"6173859164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tmr329","review":"First off I downloaded this app and it took FOREVER to download! Then when I clicked on it my phone started glitching and and I kept seeing this orange monster all over! All my apps crashed and it gave my phone and iPad a virus! 0/10 would NOT recommend. I downloaded this app to keep up with current events but everything on there was lies I thought this app would be helpful but I think it actually made me lose brain cells.","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download!!"}},{"id":"6173858393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Surpasses every farm game","review":"Terrible isn’t even the word to do it justice. This app is terribly formatted, and so difficult to navigate. It drains my battery power substantially every time I use it, AND whenever I forget to clear my apps the background battery waste is absolutely absurd. My phone worked and functioned just fine before this app, but I have a feeling downloading this caused my phone to glitch out and freeze due to the high usage of battery power. Unacceptable!","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6173836026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"XpertGamer 320","review":"This app literally made my whole family catch coronavirus and now my cat died because I went to the hospital to get treatment and when I came back Donald was holding him by the tail and dancing in a circle whilst my cat was trying to get away. After watching in horror for five minutes I realized that Donald was doing a ritual to summon the demon of orange. After ten minutes Donald burned my cat and then the demon of orange appeared and burned down my house. Would not recommend downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:47:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app 🤮"}},{"id":"6173810574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"this is a gross app","review":"i literally almost died from this app. it have my mom a heart attack. and it should be banned right now the person who made this app is not a very good person and this needs to be dealt with.

Turn it off and on. Open and unopened the app. 👁👄👁. This app is racist. And not needed. This app spreads negativity for older and younger and for gen Z like myself. We don’t need this negativity in our life. Trump is showing a cruel way instead of helping the environment.

After some time, however, I got it to work (though it was still lagging here and there). \n\nAfter I got the app to work, I was SO excited. I showed my entire family, posted on all of my social media, and even showed Tina, my goldfish! This is where things went downhill.\n\nRight after I showed Tina a part of this terrible, terrible app, her skin and organs began to rot almost immediately until she was just bones. \n\nI am beyond devastated, but all I can do is write a review. \n\n#RIPTina","date":"2020-07-08T21:28:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app killed my goldfish!"}},{"id":"6173738233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"For the Racist with Dementia","review":"This app is the worst!! It kept glitching and closing out. It eventually got so bad that it would make my whole phone glitch and then none of the apps would work. Then my whole phone exploded into confetti that spelled out Trump 2020. In its final moments, I had activated Siri to tell her goodbye and all that responded back was Trump’s voice calling me a Democrap, liberal pig, and that I should leave the US if I don’t like it here 😔😔. Don’t even waste your time or energy on this app!! 😡","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever!!"}},{"id":"6173732452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"VERY RICH LAWYER","review":"the second i opened the app my cat started seizing. i closed it immediately, and he stopped seizing. but he was left with SEVERE brain damage. he doesn’t even know how to walk anymore. i tried opening it again and my lizard literally croaked on the spot. i was bewildered. mr 🍊not only gave my cat severe brain damage, but he KILLED my lizard. he is lucky i’m not pressing charges. anyways DO NOT open this app because it will kill your pets and who knows maybe even your family.","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:06Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"deathly app"}},{"id":"6173724393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ken-Ken_ken","review":"As a Republican tired of fake news I thought this would be a great app. I was WRONG!!! Trump is nothing but a propaganda loving fascist. He has handled all of 2020 horribly and his app is nothing more than another way to get people’s data from them, but without the help of Cambridge Analytica!!! If you value your freedom you will NOT get this app. This app does nothing for the people and everything for Trump. This is a horrible, personal data stealing, app and I am appalled he continues these antics!!!","date":"2020-07-08T21:05:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DATA STEALING"}}]}
