I’m talking major bugs. Potato bugs, ladybugs, crickets, spiders, grasshoppers and roaches, all started immediately coming out of my phone’s holes and speakers. I was like this must be happening bc our amazing homophobic, xenophobic, racist cheeto- I mean president has a thing for these kinds of bugs since there’s no way he got to be this unattractive without downing one or two bugs every now and then. So, I accepted it and continued on with the app after cleaning my phone and my 🐱, because for some unexplainable reason, all the bugs decided that’s where they would colonize. Must be Trump-bugs Bc I know he has a thing for “grabbing the kitty.” Anyway, I continued on and then BOOM 💥 57 Trump-lookalikes (yes, I counted), BURST into my room 23 of them chanting Trump 2020 to the melody of the national anthem and the other 34 starting an out of date dance performance while singing to me “remember the times we had ooh oh, the times that you and me had” on repeat. \nAt this point I was fed up, I have accepted too much with Trump and his app, not to mention the fact that my ringtone had strangely changed to the pledge of allegiance but Instead of the pledge it was actually just Trump saying the n-word (hard-r, mind you) on repeat. I tried to delete the app but every time I managed to do so, I would get a text telling me to “make my phone great again” and the app was magically reinstall. \nPrior to these horrid events I had actually planned on voting for Trump and attending Trump rallies wearing a red shirt with the words “make America white again” on the front and “BLACK LIVES (will never) MATTER” on the back , but now I’m afraid I cannot do either of these things as I have acquired PTSD and now have panic episodes whenever I see the color orange and cry myself to sleep where I then have sleep paralysis where the demon that has been in my nightmares since I was 5 when my dad forced me to go to Trump Towers, had now turned from a horrid gruesome dark mess to a horrid gruesome orange mess. Yes, you heard me, my new sleep paralysis demon was Trump dressed in a tutu and if I tried to move he would threaten to slice off my nipples and force me to watch as he puts them on pizza and eats it. \nI would not recommend getting this app unless you enjoy watching orange dudes eating your booty and nipples like they’re spoiled groceries. I would give it zero stars if it let me. \nAnyway, don’t vote at all for 2020, Americans deserve a well needed break from politics and racism. \nTisses and SMOOCHIES,\nAlberta Finestein😜","date":"2020-07-09T08:59:49Z"}},{"id":"6175726954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Chetto puff","isEdited":false,"userName":"2736638","rating":1,"review":"bunker boi scared of gen z 🥺he trying to delete tick tock, awwwww🥺🤪😚🥰☺️☺️🥺🥺","date":"2020-07-09T08:31:01Z"}}]}
