First off, i logged into my account and saw a man dressed in NAZI UNDERWEAR. As a Jewish American, I am very hurt. I kept scrolling and ended up on a picture with the caption “Would F%#* my daughter any day” I’m appalled. This is NOT my president. This app is totally not for kids, I let my 6 year old child have my phone and when she opened the app, she saw Trump naked next to his own naked statue. Say the less, she threw up all her clementines and it was a very disturbing evening. Totally not kid friendly. When I went to delete the app off my phone, it glitched and made my lock screen a picture of a headless bird🤮. I hate america. After all this madness, a man SHOT my raccoon. This is so unbelievable. ONE STAR.","rating":1,"userName":"Fartdoodoopants127","title":"Totally gross 🤮","date":"2020-07-09T00:12:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174186410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app to see a horrific looking Cheeto creature. It asked for my phone number which I feel is 💯 a invasion of privacy and I am very uncomfortable and will be buying a new phone now. It asked me to share with friends which also made me very scared! Why do they need to know who my friends are? Are they going to come and hurt me or them? I don’t trust it. It asks for too much and I already 𝓫𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼𝓮𝓭❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎it with my download. Then out of no where my house caught on FIRE🔥🔥🔥 the only explanation for that would be this app. So therefore I do not want to see it on the app store any longer to prevent house fires!🧚\u200D♀️🌈💯😗🌲🐙🎉 Thank you have a great day!🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈","rating":1,"userName":"🌈🥺💓🔥💚🧚\u200D♀️","title":"𝓘 𝓷𝓮𝓮𝓭 𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓻𝓪𝓹𝔂 𝓷𝓸𝔀🥰😗✌️🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T23:57:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174047477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yesterday, as i was walking my scarecrow, this app started making noises. it scared my scarecrow into being approachable, and it rendered my sister and grandmother deaf. we would go to the hospital and get their situation checked out, but the cheeto took away basic human healthcare rights so now they just have to live with hearing condition this app gave them 😔. Today it opened itself and upon looking at my phone, i saw the most hideous orange ever known. it was so hideous I had to go get my eyes checked out and now i wear glasses and am legally blind. my mother wasn’t so fortunate and cannot see at all now. I go to therapy for all the trauma this app gave me and I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING IT. 😾😾😾😾😾","rating":1,"userName":"azza u","title":"If i could rate this 0 stars, i would","date":"2020-07-08T23:06:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174022044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I really hate apps that are extremely slow and non functions, it really irritates me. This app especially, it represents racist behavior, misogyny, and so much more. The graphics on this app also are really old and unappealing for anyone in general. Screams I’m too old to act like a 5 year old even though I am in my 70s. Actually wait, most 5 year old are way more mature than that this app represents. I really really encourage this app to be taken down from here because it truly is not giving anyone any good. If you cannot see that please reevaluate your beliefs and morals please for the sake of our world. Take this app down immediately, cannot be trusted.","rating":1,"userName":"goodbye trump, leave","title":"do not recommend, slow & corrupt","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174006630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"No as soon as I opened the app, my dog ran out of the house. She got hit by a car. Then my mom ran out of the house after the dog, she also got hit by a car. My grandma heard the noises and bodies hitting the floor and had also ran out. A tree fell on her. Then my dad was going to call an ambulance then got electrocuted because he was washing his hands in the sink. Then both my brother and sister ran to the living room but then died because they slipped on the water that was on the floor and hit their heads really hard on each other. Now I’m an orphan and have to take care of all this now. All BECAUSE OF TRUMPS STUPID APP. HES LIKE FINAL DESTINATION ON CRACK BUT WORSE!
