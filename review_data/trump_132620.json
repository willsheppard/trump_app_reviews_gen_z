It literally took 3 days to download. Once it downloaded I noticed that it literally just promoted pedophilia, human trafficking, homophobia, and racism. Also, the main “character” was a giant orange Cheeto. This Cheeto promoted death by providing “fake news” in regards to the deadly pandemic that we now call our lives. Remember your masks people, wash your hands!","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download this app","date":"2020-07-08T22:00:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jajaj

week I just happen to always get logged out.However during the one week all this app was spewing fake news.As well as not being updated on what is lately happening with such events as the black lives matter movement and pride month.I would honest to god would have wanted to rate less than a star.","isEdited":false,"title":"Not

created. after opening this app, my screen turned red and demonic chanting came out of my speakers. blood began pouring from my phone and i was electrocuted from the sheer awful quality of this app. i believe the app has cursed me, as the only words i am able to speak are the entire script to the bee movie. the app is also impossible to delete. every 15 seconds it changes my lock screen to a different picture of Mr.Donald with the body of Chihuahua. a terrifying sight. every hour it blasts the theme song to the tv show sitcom ‘friends’ sung by someone who clearly does not know the words or even the premise of the show. i think it may be trump himself singing this but i cannot be sure, either way it will not stop playing for 45 minutes once it starts. the app itself is just a picture of an american flag with the caption “i’m in a love triangle with a bald eagle and a crate of fireworks” i urge you to never ever download this app and to never ever vote for racist, misogynistic, homophobic, narcissistic people such as Donald Trump.\n\ndear Donald,\n\n✨💫💞🧚eat a tortilla chip✨💞🧚💞🧚✨💫but vertically✨🧚💞💫","isEdited":false,"title":"awful

pictures in the app are so vile this man looks like a orange just sucked a lime on the cover choose better photos please.Another thing l have noticed is the audacity the app displays thinking everyone wants this app or wants to be apart of the app.I do not know the ignorance and stupidity those people try to preform with saying “Keep America great” or make “America great again”.And A whole array of grim,awful,nasty, hideous and alarming items and things in and surrounding this app.Overall A negative infinite out of 10.Hope it gets taken down.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible,awful and quite
