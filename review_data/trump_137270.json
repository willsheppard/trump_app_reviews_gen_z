I had already heard of his triumphs in killing off thousands of American citizens through gross negligence, tear gassing and shooting rubber bullets at protestors for a photo shoot, and putting children in cages; so I wanted to know more about his amazing achievements and his plans for keeping America great. As soon as I downloaded the app and attempted to open it however, it crashed. I attempted several more times to open the app and each time I would open up to black screen and would then be forced out of the app moments later. When I was finally able to get the app to open, I was shocked to discover I would need to provide my phone number in order to register for the app. I am very weary of providing that kind of personal information, but seeing as how there was no option to register without one, I hesitantly entered it in. Not even a few minutes after I registered, I received numerous calls from unknown numbers. I continued to block each number that came through, but the calls didn’t stop. I immediately deleted the app, fearing for my privacy. I’m not receiving text messages as well from unknown numbers in addition to the calls and it’s always from different numbers. I am trapped in a cycle of fear, blocking each phone call and text message I receive now. I even accidentally blocked a coworkers number who called me asking about shift coverage as the intensity of my paranoia grows. This app has ruined my life.","date":"2020-07-10T07:37:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The worst app I’ve ever had the misfortune of downloading"}},{"id":"6179957350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"feeebreeze","review":"It’s trash👎🏽","date":"2020-07-10T07:37:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"App don’t even work"}},{"id":"6179957200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chile am now 😼","review":"I downloaded this app so i could get the deets about all the rallies our great president cheeto was doing. So I downloaded this app and from first glance it looked suspicious. The format of the app looks outdated and is filled with inappropriate ads which blocked my screen the whole time!! It also asked for my phone number which I wouldnt know why they would want it 🙄. The picture I saw when I first opened the app disturbed and offended me greatly and I think that picture is very offensive to people who are allergic to oranges. I dont understand why they would put that revolting picture as their background. I have read many reviews on this app and discovered that many others have had the same problems I encountered. Please delete this app to further offend others. Thank you.","date":"2020-07-10T07:37:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP  😾😾 1 STAR"}},{"id":"6179956956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lilpeepe","review":"disgusting","date":"2020-07-10T07:37:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6179956941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"martha the average dog 👁👄👁","review":"almost the entire bee movie script\nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations.
