It got viruses and it made my battery go straight to 2%. Also a scary Naked Tan person picture was on it. Every time I try downloading it There‚Äôs always an inappropriate picture or something that scares me on it. Also there were DEATH threats in one of the paragraphs. This app will forever be the worst app. Death Threats are NOT OKAY! üò≠üò≠üò°üò°‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå","date":"2020-07-09T00:31:39Z","userName":"ùöãùöûùöìùö¢ùöéùöú"}},{"id":"6174278684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Think this is HUGE?

I AM TRAUMATIZED. Then, soon after that.... MY TV STARTED PLAYING ‚ÄúTrump sings like a tomato üçÖüëÅüëÑüëÅüçÖ‚Äù it was truly horrific. And to make all matters worse, this app is just terrible and has ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in it which just makes it automatically horrible.

Second of all I almost died of a heart attack because I have an irrational fear of Cheetos and that was the first thing to pop up. Still have ptsd from that. I just wanted to download the app to support my lord leader of this great nation but instead it resulted in ptsd from a Cheeto popping up right when the app was opened. VERY disappointing!","date":"2020-07-09T00:25:28Z","userName":"mackie.42000"}},{"id":"6174255004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"horrible and life threatening","rating":1,"review":"when i opened the app i saw a terrifying picture of the dude‚Äôs SAGGING double chinü§öüèº like isn‚Äôt he rich or something???? can‚Äôt he like get it fixed ???

But when I got it and opened the app, it started to yell ‚Äúhola nino‚Äù numerous times. And the thing is I amd NOT bilingual, so this app was very insulting to my kind. Then the telling stoped. THEN, get this, spray tan king came to my house and stole my parents and ran over themüòî. It‚Äôs okay tho because he gave us $100 after that and said ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. Take it down now.

He told me that for this damning sin I deserved nothing more than the dirt below my feet! I was forced to attempt to decipher his riddle which eventually lead to no more than the death of myself along with everyone I love!
