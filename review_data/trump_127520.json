It was late at night when I hear my phone rang.\n\nHello?”\n\n“ I’m going to kill you,”  a man with a deep and annoying voice said.\n\n“Who is this?” I asked.\n\nNo answer.\n\n“Who is this?” I repeated, my hand trembling.\n\nThere was a click. Silence. I quickly dialled the police and explained what had happened. The officer told me to wait while he traced the call. After a few moments he said, “The call is coming from . . . inside The White House.”\n\n“That doesn’t make sense,” I said. “How could someone so racist be in the White House?”\n\n“He probably broke in,” he said.\n\n“Oh yeah, I guess that makes sense.”\n\n“And that’s not everything,” he said. “I’m not a police officer.”\n\n“You aren’t?”\n\n“No, I’m the future president of 2020 from before. I never actually left or got arrested .”\n\n“But I heard you got convicted.”\n\nThe man made a clicking sound with his mouth. “And?” he said.\n\n“Wow, that’s really good.”\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n“So, are you really in the White House ?”\n\n“Yeah, totally.”\n\n“Where?”\n\nThe man’s breathing grew heavier. “I like your hair,” he said.\n\n“Wait, you can see me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Wait, you like my hair?”\n\n“It’s really nice.”\n\n“If you can see me, then what am I wearing?”\n\n“Looks like a blouse from Banana and a skirt from . . . Anne Taylor Loft?”\n\n“Wow, you really can see me.”\n\n“I can also see—wait, what the hell is that?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“There’s a person, a ghost hovering near you.”\n\n“It’s sort of hard to trust you after the click thing.”\n\n“No I’m serious, over by the couch.”\n\nI turned and gasped, “Oh my god, I see it! I knew you were crazy and not a good president.”\n\n“Jesus Christ. Is it an old person? Eww, he’s all translucent.”\n\n“Looks like a boomer.”\n\n“What does he want??”\n\n“I think he wants to vote. He’s holding a ‘Make America Great Again’ sign.”\n\nThe ghost man floated closer and spoke: “Vote for meeeeee.”\n\n“Oh my God, he can talk!” the man said.\n\n“Vote for meeeeee,” the ghost man repeated.\n\n“Um, no thank you!” the man said.\n\n“He can’t hear you,” the I said.\n\n“Put me on speaker.”\n\n“Hold on,” she said. “Try now.”\n\n“We don’t want to vote for you! O.K., junior? Just run along.”\n\n“Why?” the old dusty ghost man said, cocking his head to one side. “Voting is fun.”\n\n“No it isn’t!” the man yelled .\n\n“Who are you?” the ghost man asked me. “Why are you in my house?”\n\n“Oh, I’m Yassy. I actually live in this house now. And the voice you’re hearing on the phone is . . . I didn’t get your name.”\n\n“It’s, uh, Douglas,” he said, reluctantly.\n\n“Douglas is hiding somewhere in here to kill me, right, Douglas?” I said.\n\n“That was the plan,” Douglas said .\n\n“And you guys are scared of a man with a sign Jesus,” the ghost man said.\n\n“A Cheeto man with a sign!” Douglas said.\n\nThere was a heavy silence for several moments. Suddenly, the doorbell rang.\n\n“Expecting someone?” Douglas asked.\n\nIt rang again. I walked over and opened it. Standing there was a hulking man in a all black suit, barely concealing a bloodied machete behind his back.\n\n“Pardon me, Ma’am,” he said. “My car broke down and I was wondering if I could charge my phone in your house?”\n\n“Sorry, I don’t think so,” I said, starting to close the door.\n\nThe man shoved his foot inside. “Well, I do think so,” he said.\n\nI stumbled and fell to the ground.\n\n“Who the hell is that?” Douglas screamed.\n\n“I’m a homicidal drifter. Who the hell are you?” the drifter said, confused. “Where’s that voice coming from?”\n\n“He’s a killer hiding in my house,” I said, holding up the phone. “Douglas.”\n\n“Hiding? Where?” the drifter asked, looking around nervously.\n\n“He’s in the closet,” the ghost man said.\n\n“What in the hEcC is that?” the drifter screamed.\n\n“I’m a ghost. I used to be the president like 4 years ago.Oh, and let me guess, you don’t want to vote for me.”\n\n“Hell, no, I don’t want to vote for you. What’s going on in here?”\n\n“What’s going on is no one will vote for me!”\n\n“For Christ’s sake, no one’s voting for you at night,” Douglas shouted. “Give it up!”\n\nThe ghost man began to cry.\n\n“Now you made him cry, Douglas,” I chided.\n\n“Sorry if I’m a little on edge because you let a killer into the house,” Douglas said.\n\n“First of all, I didn’t let him in, he busted in,” I said.\n\n“It’s true, I did,” the drifter said.\n\n“Second of all, you’re also a killer, Douglas.”\n\n“Touché,” the drifter said.\n\n“And third of all, don’t say sorry to me, say sorry to the dead kid.”\n\n“O.K., O.K. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have snapped at you,” Douglas said.\n\nThe ghost man smiled. Everyone seemed to calm down a bit, until the doorbell rang again. I walked toward the door.\n\n“DON’T!” the three others shouted.\n\nI opened it and peered outside. There was no one there, just a large wooden box on the front step.\n\n“There’s a box out here,” I said. “There’s no label or anything,”\n\n“I have a bad feeling about this box,” the drifter said.\n\n“I hate the blacks- I mean the box,” the ghost man said.\n\nI ignored them and carried it inside. I turned to the drifter. “May I?” He wiped his machete on his pants and handed it to me. I popped open the top, reached in, and pulled out a tattered clown doll with a sinister grin.\n\n“What is it? What is it?” Douglas yelled, through the phone.\n\n“Some sort of clown doll,” I said.\n\n“I don’t want to play with a clown doll,” the ghost man said, beginning to cry.\n\n“Why don’t we just put this thing back in the box before it gives us all nightmares, O.K.?” the drifter said.\n\n“Look, there’s a string,” I said, pulling it before anyone could object. The clown began to wheeze, its eyes shifted from side to side, and an eerily cheerful song emanated from its open mouth.\n\nAt that moment the ghost Cheeto man eyes turned red and he kill all three of us, The killer, the drifter, and I. Later I found out, all three were Donald J. Trump.\n\nAnd that’s why I’m writing this review from my ghost phone to warn you about this app DONT DOWNLOAD IT!","date":"2020-07-09T17:37:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TheGhostWriter~"}},{"id":"6177595566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Big Cheeto man killed my Hamster-R.I.P.
