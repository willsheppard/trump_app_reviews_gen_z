Immediately, as I opened the app a giant donkey jumped out of the screen and bit my nose off.  It took my nose and locked it in a jar.  When I tried to get it back, it made me play a round of Texas hold ‘em. I lost.  The donkey cheated.  Then the donkey started singing “Hail comrades” to the same tune of the Star Spangled Banner.  When he wouldn’t stop singing I threw my boot at him.  The second the boot touched him, it turned into a rabid toddler that began running around my room screaming “Trump 2020” and “I’m not scared of you, I carry”.  After being admitted to the emergency room for donkey and toddler bites, Donald Trump came to supposedly tell me how sorry he was.  Instead, he ate the jar with my nose in front of me, lock and all.  He then threatened to deport every doctor in the room if they helped me, even though they were all citizens.  During my last night at the hospital, I heard a loud noise coming from the corner of my room.  It was the sound of the waiting room chair collapsing under Donald’s weight.  He and the donkey had come to kidnap me and two other unnamed individuals.  I get on Airforce One, and I see Justin Bieber and Cher, both kidnapped and tied to fake tan covered chairs.  The plane flew to Slovenia, and as we flew over the mountains, the floor opened up.  Donald yelled good luck and we fell, parachute-less into a burning sea of lava between the Slovenian mountains.  I am currently writing this from Ljubljana.  I would give this app a 0/10 if I could.  Do not recommend if you would not like to be endangered in an Eastern European country and watch the death of the singer of “Baby” in a lava pit while a donkey jeers at you.  Side note, Slovenia is quite beautiful.\n\nThe second time that I downloaded the app, I was searching for a little adventure.  I wanted to go back to Europe, and considering the pandemic, I decided the only way that this would be possible was if I was kidnapped by Donald.  So I download it, and no donkey appears.  I am very annoyed by this.  It makes me angry that the donkey has other things to do.  I throw my phone across the room and it smashes. Glass flies everywhere, my house explodes.  I have now exploded.  Each and every piece of my body is in a different part of the four corners, which is funny because I live in Minnesota.  All of a sudden, I hear a screech.  A fat bird plummets from the sky under it’s own weight.  Donald has taken the staff from Maui the demigod in Moana, and has now become a bird.  He wanted to save me.  Instead, he lands on top of my scattered remains on his back.  Gravity is working against him, he cannot roll over.  He is stuck. I become so enraged that my celestial spirit reconnects the pieces of my body.  I start to run away from Donald, only to see him begin to fly again.  Turns out, he’s in love with me.  He has been following me for 17 years, which is funny because I’m only 3.  I tell him “Go home Donald, I don’t want you here”.  He tells me that he loves me, and that he’ll do anything for me.  Then I realize why Melania married him.  So I say, “Fine, give me citizenship, since you deported me last time”.  He gives me citizenship.  Me and Melania are the queens of Slovenian citizenship, which is funny because I’m from Oregon.  We scam Donald and steal his staff, he is a bird forever.  I then return home, only to find that he has built a castle in its place.  I would recommend this app to find your sugar daddy, but considering that Donald is a mute bird now, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a point.  0/10","userName":"Nose-less Slovene","title":"Disappointment","date":"2020-07-09T17:44:18Z"}},{"id":"6177615702","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Periodt.","userName":"Allycat111877","title":"You take our app we take yours","date":"2020-07-09T17:43:49Z"}},{"id":"6177603994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"If your deleting tik tok, why don’t we delete this ❤️✨😄","userName":"fatima..r","title":"No ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T17:40:05Z"}},{"id":"6177597443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Awful app needs to be deleted","userName":"amaidisbav","title":"TikTok","date":"2020-07-09T17:38:00Z"}},{"id":"6177590708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t like it at all","userName":"Betzaida Rodriguez","title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T17:35:48Z"}},{"id":"6177589390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"He can’t take down tiktok","userName":"#keepTikTok2020","title":"Don’t take down tiktok","date":"2020-07-09T17:35:23Z"}},{"id":"6177571821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is so weird it ask if I want it to be the next America president that I will get a Mansion.","userName":"http.wolfy99","title":"🌹WORST APP EVER🌹","date":"2020-07-09T17:29:44Z"}}]}
