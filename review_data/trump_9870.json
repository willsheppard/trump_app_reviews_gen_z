The screen would turn off and on at random times and the whole screen wouldn’t work and would look like a glitches screen. I tried to open the app but my phone started to heat up to the point where I thought it would explode.

Once it finally downloaded it hacked my phone data and information. This app absolutely ruined my life. It is an absolute disgrace to the App Store and Apple should definitely take a second look at this app. I will pray and send hope for anyone who decides to download this. Be smart! I’m not saying don’t download it but I am saying.. be careful if you do. Downloading this app would be like knowingly sending yourself into danger. Absolutely disgraceful.🤢","date":"2020-07-09T13:05:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DISGRACEFUL","userName":"livie p💖"}},{"id":"6176563370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the absolute worst app I have ever used. It took hours upon hours to download. Then once I got on the app it asked for my phone number and then immediately started spamming my phone with calls and texts about how I should support trump. It was telling me that as a white, I should support him no matter what. This was absolutely ridiculous. I’m beyond upset. My phone is still getting texts and calls even after uninstalling it.","date":"2020-07-09T12:49:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"GARBAGE 💕","userName":"haleyellis"}},{"id":"6176547443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I open the app it lags so badly that it kept closing me out of the app. It also asks for my personal information and there are so many ads. DO NOT get this app. I also experienced horrific pictures that no one should see. It also asks you for your number which is personal. This app should be taken down as it is awfully bad. I download and test apps for a living and this is the worst I will ever download. DELETE IT ASAP.","date":"2020-07-09T12:44:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I will EVER download","userName":"Appreviews1-5 ⭐️"}},{"id":"6176522144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The Trump app was horrible. Once I could get it to download it overtook my phone and retrieved all my information with an error message saying Russia needed my data. I also was informed since many of my accounts are registered with a female gender I would no longer be able to choose what apps I could download!!!!! Moreover once I could actually get into the app the only services it provided were racism, xenophobia, sexism, hatred, lying, and division😡🤬😤","date":"2020-07-09T12:37:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"An insult to America","userName":"imbaby123"}},{"id":"6176458608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Fam, this app just isn’t where it’s at. I downloaded this app to see how I could try to support my𝓪𝓶𝓪𝔃𝓲𝓷𝓰 President in the upcoming election. HowevEr, it took forever to download, and as soon as it did, the app asked for my phone number and location. Not to mention, it also asked me to give my credit card number. Honestly, is that even appropriate? It didn’t even ask, it just demanded it. Needless to say, the app is terrible. Do noT download.","date":"2020-07-09T12:20:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP 👊😔😔😔","userName":"👀👀👁👄👁👀👀"}},{"id":"6176451759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This took AGES TO INSTALL. Once it did it kept crashing and once I stopped trying to open it I kept having all my electronics acting up in my house so when I went to see what was wrong it was this stupid app that hacked everything so I could vote for this man and I wasn’t going to let that happen so I really need everyone to not download this app so they won’t have the same problems I did when I got this. \n\nAll the love xoxoxoxo ❤️❤️❤️🧚🏻💖💖💖💖💖💖","date":"2020-07-09T12:18:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","userName":"🤮😡🖕🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6176411423","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded that app, right away I got hacked and my phone kept glitching. I didn’t think anything of it until trump himself came to my house! He told me I was ugly and didn’t deserve to breath the air he was breathing. The SS then began to choke me to death so I died😛✌🏼anyways my cat came downstairs and trump grabbed my cat and killed him too😿 but I actually didn’t die (surprise!) and I ran to the White House to safe Barron.
