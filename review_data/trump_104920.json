In my opinion, he is the most incompetent leader America has ever had. Watching the election debates was painful, on multiple occasions I had to switch the TV off it was that awful. On that note, from the sexist remarks he’s made about his daughter to why Hillary Clinton was the better choice, here are five reasons why Donald Trump should not be the President of the United States.\n\n1. Hillary Clinton was a better candidate.\n\nHillary clearly has much more political experience than Trump. She was the Senator for New York for eight years, she was the Secretary of State for four years, and was First Lady for eight years. She is clearly much more fitting for the job. Also, she is an advocate of legal rights for everyone, unlike Trump, who appears to only support white American males.\n\n2. America’s voting system isn’t totally fair.\n\nIn a democratic government, such as that of the UK, everybody’s vote counts. Everyone who is registered has their vote counted. Then, whichever party receives the majority of the votes gains power. This isn’t always how it works but in most cases, this is what happens. On the flip side, in America, they use the Electoral College system. Essentially, everyone who is registered gets a vote, then the elector for that state casts a vote based on the way the majority of the state votes. The elector won’t always vote based on the decision of their state, but more often than not, the state decides.\n\nThe electoral votes are then counted, and whichever candidate is the first to get 270 votes out of 538 wins Presidency. However, this system isn’t completely fair because not every state has the same number of people in it. Therefore, the number of electors per state is not even, so the way the state swings isn’t overly accurate. For example, in the 2016 Presidential election between Trump and Clinton, Clinton won the popular vote by the largest margin ever but because of the way the electoral system works, Trump won the election. Therefore, the way he won his Presidency was not completely fair.\n\nTrump is a business man, not a politician. He should stick to running golf courses and casinos, not one of the most powerful countries in the world. He does not have the competence to run a country. It’s all ‘fake news’ this and ‘Hillary’s emails’ that, never anything that he’s actually supposed to be talking about or what he’s going to do next to ‘make America great again’. He can’t follow up on the arguments he makes.\n[rife-guide-events]\n\n4. The racist things he has said\n\nThroughout his election campaign, Trump stated that he wanted to build a wall between Mexico and America to restrict illegal immigration amongst other things. He has not backed down from this statement, and has already begun making plans about how much it will cost and what materials to use, also claiming that he will make Mexico pay for it. In addition, on the 27th of January 2017, Trump issued a travel ban, preventing refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the USA. Furthermore, earlier this year, he was derogatory towards the parents of a U.S. army officer who had served in the Iraq war. Trump insulted the soldier’s mother, saying ‘if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. Maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me’, implying that she was forbidden from speaking because of the couple’s Islamic faith. All of these examples show racism and imply that perhaps, Trump is too prejudiced to be a President.\n\n5. The sexist things he has said\n\nDuring a court testification, a lawyer asked permission to take a break to breastfeed her three-month-old daughter. Trump left the room, saying the lawyer was “disgusting”. Breastfeeding is a necessary thing, used to keep new-borns alive whilst they are unable to consume solid foods. It is not disgusting, it is natural and important and should not be discouraged. Furthermore, he stated that “there has to be some form of punishment”, with regards to women who seek to defy a ban on abortion. Just two hours later, he contradicted this statement saying that only the doctors who carry out the abortion should be punished.\nSo there you have it, five reasons why Donald Trump should not be the President of the USA. Also, on a not so serious note, his hair is really stupid and he looks like an orange.\n\nSome of y’all might’ve thought I missed #3 but that’s due two the fact that it would not be very appropriate.","userName":"Kneri21","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:50Z"}}]}
