President Trump himself is a hoax, so therefore this app is a hoax. This app is also very slow and laggy, surprised? No. Do not download. And plus, do not get rid of tiktok just because you’re mad that no one went to your Tulsa rally which absolutely contributed to infection in the area. You are the reason kids won’t be able to go back to school in the fall. Treating the virus like it’s a hoax, but again, you are the hoax. Again, don’t use the Trump 2020 app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"crayon53","date":"2020-07-09T16:37:53Z"}},{"id":"6177380573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I thought it would be better","review":"Idk about everybody else but I wanted to see trumps next steps to make our country better but as soon as I opened the app it crashed. Then I thought maybe just maybe it was my WiFi so I rebooted it and it still crashed. I need to know what’s happening with my country man and this app is just disappointing, not to mention the several bad reviews I saw from not only gen z but trump supporters as well","isEdited":false,"userName":"Zamaira_777","date":"2020-07-09T16:31:45Z"}},{"id":"6177344793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"stanharrystylesforclearskin","review":"ok so after a whole 4 days to wait for this app to download I open the app to a death threat against my fish. It said and I quote “I will drown your fish if you do not support me.” My fish is the only reason I’m still here so if the fish goes... I GO TOO. So a day after the threat I get back home to my fish laying down fighting for his life. I hurried to him and prepared for cpr but by the time I got to him... he was gone. I’m really sad now but ya. This app is garbage and it drowned my fish.","isEdited":false,"userName":"uhhhharrystyles","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:18Z"}},{"id":"6177335505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"awww president is sad😹😹😹","review":"bruh i open the app and i expect blm movements and updates about the country and covid BUT NO👀👀👀 the president is so self centered 😆, people could die and would make anyway to blame it on anyone but himself👁👄👁anyhow gen z is more powerful than you spraytan of an orange 😎😎 we could run the government better than u could cause we actually could take care of america and make equality and end racism and actually mAkE aMeRiCa bEtTeR aGaIn 😏🥰😛 ✨✨trump 2020 ✨✨ but on a ✨😘🥰grave stone✨❤️😘","isEdited":false,"userName":"annabor shawn🥰","date":"2020-07-09T16:18:41Z"}},{"id":"6177285796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨shih tzu but the zu is S I L E N T ✨","review":"This app is a disgrace to everything. It shouldn’t even be allowed to be called an app. King neptune’s bald head hurt my eyes less than this piece of garbage. This app scared me more than watching courage the cowardly dog. I would let lionel messi shoot shots at me while I’m a goalie rather than use this app. I was taking a test and I downloaded this app and my IQ dropped below 0, which I didn’t even know was possible. The list goes on and on about how BAD this app is. Uh oh stinky.","isEdited":false,"userName":"SNIPERSILVAS_","date":"2020-07-09T16:04:44Z"}},{"id":"6177205163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"86 45 app","review":"This app made a lot of promises to be good, but instead, it blocked my other apps (like a fire wall?).  It also has some issues with the sound- alot of words are\nmispronounced and every third word is “very.”  It also seems to only want to be next to apps that look like it for some reason.  \n\nWhen I tried to exercise my right to delete it, because I didn’t want to see this stuff anymore, it called me a thug.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Out of practice runner","date":"2020-07-09T15:41:20Z"}},{"id":"6177168602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Can’t believe how bad🤢","review":"I have been trying to get this app to download for the past 2 days and it keeps stoping and not completely download. After two days trying to download it finally has finished. Now every time I open it it will close out. Can’t believe that the president would have a app so horribly made. DO NOT GET THIS APP. and if the president can’t even run an app correctly then he shouldn’t be running for president don’t vote trump.","isEdited":false,"userName":"nevax1","date":"2020-07-09T15:30:59Z"}},{"id":"6177116614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Hypocrite!!! ✨🧚\u200D♂️","review":"Trump keeps talking about how other countries and people are trying to steal our data and information and he himself is also trying to steal it. Asking for my phone number or face book?!? The absolute audacity of that man. Practice what you preach sir!! Do not download this unless you want the government to store and sell your data as well. It’s horrible to think that our president, the man we are supposed to blindly trust like fools is such a hypocrite!! \n-🧚\u200D♂️✨🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"ex-trump supporter ;)✨✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:16:34Z"}},{"id":"6177105186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️⚡️🥺✨A Letter to Agent Orange✨🥺⚡️🧚🏼\u200D♀️","review":"This President is just dumb and stupid all wrapped into orange wrapping paper. This crybaby had a meltdown because people didn’t come to his rally, and he was outsmarted by a bunch of “gen z” kids. Sorry that we are smarter than our own president, but don’t take away Tik Tok. By doing this you are cutting out our freedom of speech. So, that’s actually illegal. Thanks and sorry again that a teenager was smarter than you. Maybe we should run the country instead of a talking orange.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Flappy prof","date":"2020-07-09T15:13:22Z"}}]}
