When I first opened the app, I was shocked to see such manipulative and biased language. Not to mention the background with a picture of this horrible person who has shown nothing but disrespect for the title of being President. He is uneducated in his career and is not the face that should represent our country as a whole. He has divided this country more than brought it together! Why should there be an app supporting this man and another four years of his presidency if what he has shown for this country is failure? Take the app down!!","userName":"Jennifer✝️❤️","date":"2020-07-08T23:29:23Z"}},{"id":"6174075116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"broo","review":"ARE you KidDinG mE right now?? eye open up this app and my I’s have never been more horrified! i can’t believe it’s still on the app store 🤢 i wanted to believe that i could learn something good from this app but all the bee discrimination has to stop!! the constant concerns about wasps over butterflies is a no go!! i just cannot fathom the utter disgrace and shame this app brings to the bug race. how are we to continue protecting ourselves from big snap from lord thanos if this application continues to follow it’s hidden agenda of wiping out all ants with acid rain promotion? absolutely desghustANg 😡 0 out of ten recommend","userName":"apple bottom Jane","date":"2020-07-08T23:16:25Z"}},{"id":"6174064451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Lol. no","review":"Bruh when i opened the app their was a giant orange man on my screen... at this point i was flabbergasted with embarrassment for him.

It’s DISGUSTANG. The day I downloaded it, the big Cheeto himself, Donald Trump came to me and cursed me with a spell that turned me republican😢 Lucky for me, Bernie fought him and said “BARBZ FOR BERNIE 2020” and they fought in front of me for 69 hours!!! Once they finished, I looked at myself through the mirror and said “there is no way I can be republican! Republicans support Trump ; who is racist,homophobic, a rapist, AND sexist! Oh no, there must be a cure for Republicans. But then I remembered, all I needed to do is use my brain. BOOM. And just like that I wasn’t I’ll anymore. And who’s to blame for this all to happen? THIS APP. DON’T  DOWNLOAD!!!!!😔😔😔","userName":"yuhitsme","date":"2020-07-08T23:01:06Z"}},{"id":"6173945689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISRESPECT TO CHEETOS🤮👄🤮","review":"So I downloaded the app because I looooove Cheetos,but when I opened the app I saw a naked freaking CHEETO!! Like how this is allowed,this obviously was made from a random pig who disrespects the Cheeto brand,at first I thought it was a joke but then it took over my phone and I couldn’t handle it anymore,so I bought another phone but the phone got hacked by the PIG!! So I ran outside YEET the phone and decided that I wanted to watch TV,but instead of 1 Cheeto there was an ARMY OF THEM,anyways I burned my house and now I live in the streets because of this STUPID APP\n\nLuckily my ibrain Technology didn’t get hacked so that’s why I’m posting this review😤","userName":"disrespected😤","date":"2020-07-08T22:27:42Z"}},{"id":"6173857332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrifying! Don’t get this app!","review":"I downloaded this app to fully support our lord and savior; the pumkin. However, as soon as I downloaded it, it wouldn’t stop loading! Then, out of nowhere, a big chubby orange hand reached out and started strangling me! Being a Trumpkin supporter, remained oblivious and thought it was nothing. But when I woke up the next day, there were multiple Karen’s staring down at me and chanting: “VoTe TrUmP! ThE bEsT mAnAgEr!” \nThey then asked if I wanted to join their Orange fanclub, and when I refused, they unleashed an army of beetles on me! The beetles are my poor cat Beanzy. 😔\nNow I have no pet catarpillar.. \nDon’t get this app- protect yourself!","userName":"I am da pLaGuE","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:14Z"}},{"id":"6173793827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download!!!","review":"I can’t begin to describe just how infuriating this app was. First it took like 5 years to download and then as soon as I tap on the app to support MY president my phone just goes black!! I can’t believe someone with this much power and wealth would approve of this! And then it started glitching and kept crashing every 5 seconds. I’m also pretty sure it started to infect my other apps too cause they stopped working. I really do hope they do something about this cause it would be a shame for other people to experience the same events as I did.","userName":"annabkeller","date":"2020-07-08T21:30:47Z"}},{"id":"6173737975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Awful App","review":"To start, at the very least you think one of the most wealthy men in the United States would have the means to hire someone to do better graphics. It’s so blurry I can hardly read. Next, my amazingly racist president should allow me to support him without me giving him my phone number because that’s private information. Also I heard that a child molester started this app... even though it’s been proven, most people like to turn the other cheek. I’d like to give a reasoning for this, but I really don’t know why. This app should be taken of the App Store it is so appalling.","userName":"Ann Nymous","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:11Z"}}]}
