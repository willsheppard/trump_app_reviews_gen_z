I decided to download this app so that I could stay connected with my orange senpai, Donald Trump 🥰🥰 but to my surprise, HES UGLY AF!!! He does no good for our country. He’s racist, homophobic, transphobic, and not to mention, a PEDO!!! Oh btw, the app was crazy glitchy and crashed my entire phone and broke it and smoke flew out of my phone when I opened the app. Highly do NOT recommend. \n\n-Azura_Furz","userName":"Musterdondapancake"}}]}
