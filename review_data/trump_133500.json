Confused i still accepted and thought nothing of it HOWEVER two days later i get a knock on my door and a bunch of men in black and even donald trump himself came in and forced me to vote for him in november. I however declined because iam not republican (or a stupid idiot) they then proceeded to get my baby daughter out of her crib and dropped her in the toilet and flushed her down while also stomping on my pet chihuahua on the way out.They left me with nothing to live for now and ruined my life. 0/10 do not reccommend this game at all.","title":"tracked me down✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:47Z"}}]}
