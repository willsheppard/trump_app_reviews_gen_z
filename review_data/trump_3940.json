NOT. 👄DOWNLOAD. 👁","review":"This app is awful!!! The application is filled with ugly images. I have forever lost an appetite for Cheetos since almost all of the images shown are filled with them on this platform! On top of that matter, the information within the application has glitched my phone entirely. It’s almost as if my phone battery has gotten worse due to the amount of fake data it provides. I don’t see myself ever downloading another app similar to this one as it has caused many inconveniences with its slow maintenances and updates.\nUNBELIEVABLE!!! You’d think some people would take care of their creations but nOoO golfing is more important. \n\nDO. NOT. DOWNLOAD. THIS. APPLICATION!!","userName":"Taara P","date":"2020-07-09T03:37:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174873864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"sorry dad","review":"so I have realized that I no longer support my dads re-election👻. he always hisses at my mom and farts in her face💩. he also does this to me. when I downloaded this app to support my father he barged into my room and broke my phone and then he told me that he would get rid of tiktok because they are trying to save me 👁👄👁he then farted on my face and put his fake hair on me and told me I would be like him one day and make America great again. he then forced me to call my mom a pig👺👺👺👺. when he hugs me his spray tan gets on my clothes🤢🧖\u200D♂️ and I’m scared that I will look like him when I get older 🦁🦁🦁👯\u200D♂️plus he smells like Cheeto dust and baby powder with a mixture of death🥵🥵🥵\n\nSincerely, \nBarron Trump","userName":"sinjins wife","date":"2020-07-09T03:29:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174850472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"This app will steal your pillow, blankets and bed!! The day after downloading this HORRIBLE app, I came into my house, walked into my room and boom! IT WAS GONE. The app didn’t even steal the sheets or pillow case, which actually makes it WORSE. Now I have to sleep on the hard wooden floors with only the thin mattress sheets on top of me. I am SHIVERING every night because of how cold it is. I can not afford to buy a new mattress or blankets. At night, my teeth CHATTER because of the FREEZING temperature. I am in disbelief. NEVER in my life did I think an app could DEMOLISH your whole LIFE. It is absolutely repulsive and disgusting. I am SO DISAPPOINTED. I expected this app to help me. Instead it ROBBED me. DONT download this app. It is really the WORST APP EVER!!!","userName":"user0874628","date":"2020-07-09T03:22:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174848887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"LITERALLY THE WORST APP","review":"i can’t even begin to explain all the problems i’ve had with this app!!! it told me to “go back to my own country” the first time i opened it....i’m Indigenous. i thought maybe it was a glitch in the system, but then my phone stopped connecting to wifi, none of my apps were working and i couldn’t receive any calls/texts! this app needs to be taken off the market immediately, it will steal your children and your money. for the greatest businessman alive, i would have thought you would have had a better app for the people you claim to care about. ugh, deleting at once. 0/10 would NOT recommend to anyone!!","userName":"msizzle15","date":"2020-07-09T03:21:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174773321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"donnie this is for you 🧿👄🧿","review":"hey don don, \n\ni don’t think i got all the lyrics right, but this is for my favorite cheeto🥰💩🤡\n\n🅱️ℹ️g wheels⚙️keep on turning🔁\n\nCarry🏋️\u200D♂️me homo👨\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨 to see my kin👼\n\nSinging🙅\u200D♂️songs🎶 about the Southland⬇️🗾\n\nℹ️ miss Alabamby🦌 🅾️nce again🔄\n\n🅰️nd ℹ️think🧠it’s sin📐\n\nWell ℹ️heard🧏\u200D♀️mister 👨🏽\u200D🏫Young sing🎤 about her👩\u200D🎤\n\nWell, ℹ️heard🧏\u200D♀️ole Neil👨\u200D🦳put her down🆗\n\nWell, ℹ️hope🙏 Neil Young will remember🗿\n\n🅰️Southern⬇️⚱️man🧚\u200D♂️don't ❌need him around⭕️anyhow\n\nSweet🍭homo🌈Alabamba🥜\n\nWhere the skies⛅️ are s🅾️ 🅱️lue🔵\n\nSweet🍭Homo🌈Alabamba🥜\n\nLord🛐 ℹ️’m coming🤤homo👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩 2️⃣ U\n\nℹ️n 🅱️ird🦃mingham🥓 they love🥰the governor🏛\n\nNow🗯we all dℹ️d what❓we could do💩(haha dodo)\n\nNow🗯Water🌊gate🥅 does not❌brother👬me\n\nDoes your con🦹\u200D♀️science🔬brother👬 u? 🦠coronavirus🦠\n\nTell🧑\u200D⚖️the truth😇\n\nSweet🍭homo🌈Alabamba🥜\n\nWhere the skies⛅️are s🅾️ 🅱️lue🔵\n\nSweet Homo🌈Alabamba🥜\n\nLord🛐 ℹ️’m coming🤤homo🏳️\u200D🌈2️⃣ U\n\nHere ℹ️come😟Alabamba🥜\n\nNow🗯Muscle💪Shoals g🅾️t the Swampers🐊🌾\n\nAnd they've bee🐝n known to pick a song🎼 or 2️⃣\n\nso i got lazy and i didn’t feel like finishing the song. oh well sorry donnie 🥰\n\nlive, laugh, love hehe","userName":"roroyorboat123","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174756513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP IN THE WORLD","review":"I downloaded this app to get some daily news, as that is what I thought it was for, and turns out it’s trump’s app and IT JUST GAVE MY PHONE 30 VIRUSES. MY PHONE WILL NO STOP TURNING OFF, IT TURNED OFF 15 TIMES WHILE TYPING THIS REVIEW. My phone is glitching constantly, texting all my contacts #dontsavebarrontrump which I am not in support of, and it still gives me notifications of which I don’t want to see! It then got all my personal info and sent a bunch of maga stickers to my neighbor’s door. Overall this is the worst app in the world, as stated in the title. If you have this app, delete it and leave a terrible review as your ssn and more private info has probably already been hacked!","userName":"hcsgabis on Instagram","date":"2020-07-09T02:54:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174679711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Concerned","review":"I downloaded this app and it completely crashed my phone. I don’t know what’s wrong with it. I was just trying to take a look at it and It was also not colorful at all. Should’ve added a coloring book or something. There’s also no bunny rabbits to be seen anywhere on this app. My favorite animal is a bunny and I just wanted to see a lovely cinnamon flavored with drizzled chocolate Easter Bunny. I also wanted to be able to order mozzarella filled breadsticks and some steak and cheese subs, but there’s no order button or even a menu for that matter😤😤😤😤 Is this anyway to treat your loyal citizens and avid supporters😌😌😌 Gosh I would kill for a meatball sub right now 😔✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️","userName":"Hasizz","date":"2020-07-09T02:30:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174646537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING 🤮😡🤧","review":"I downloaded this app not knowing what I was getting into but as I opened the app I was disgusted and horrified by what I found! First of all, this horrible man with orange skin welcomed me in a video by calling me fat and ugly. He then proceeded to grab my throat through the phone and flung me across the room. I thought all the terror was over but was then forced to listen to Friday by Rebecca Black on full blast. By the time I gathered enough strength to get out of the app my ribs were all snapped in half and my ears were bleeding profusely. I have now been seeing my therapist twice a week but I don’t think I could get over this trama in my lifetime. I urge you, if you value your LIFE, don’t get this app.","userName":"shae5256","date":"2020-07-09T02:21:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174628241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Good intent Terrible execution","review":"TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸!! I wish this app would work properly!! All I want is to be able to see important dates, notifications, and information. But the app is bugged. It is very slow. Notifications don’t work even after making sure it’s on in my setting. On top of this ever since I downloaded this app I have been getting more viruses on my phone!!! I been one of those liberal snowflakes hacked the app to do this to us!! I bet they’re even listening in on my conversations now! All we want is to be able to use this app but as always the far-left and ANTIFA always go too far to try and stop us. Anyways, PLEASE FIX THIS!! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!
