It kept making me have random advertisements about cats and oranges. It would start playing random sound effects from vine. And just recently every time the app would crash oranges would start to crash through my window too!!! knocking out my cats, grandma, and knocking down my Harry Styles dolls!!! 😡 the oranges were SOOOO loud!! They would just start screaming “make America great again!!”???????? I’m so confused. Anyways it’s not worth its ✨🧚\u200D♀️✨🧚\u200D♂️ ✨"}},{"id":"6176960219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kayla r.s. 🤗","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"my head is in the toilet!!👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T14:33:57Z","review":"I downloaded this app thinking that it would help me figure out who I was gonna vote for in November, because I was unsure of Donald Trumps policies and I wanted to learn more about his racism and xenophobia. Well, I open the app, registered my email and phone number, then the app immediately crashes. I was getting frustrated at our Orange Savior’s app because every time I opened it, IT CRASHED LIKE WHAT THE HECK!! So I was sitting on the toilet with my phone and I figured “hey I’ll give it another try.” Of course it shutdown, but my anger sent me into a blind rage and one thing led to another, I got tangled up in my shower curtain, tripped and fell, and landed headfirst into my toilet. I gargled toilet water. 0/10 would not download again."}},{"id":"6176930401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Keira Foley","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T14:26:01Z","review":"This app does not serve its purpose. I was very excited to finally start looking into politics and researching everything but this just made me angry and annoyed. First off this app in super slow, super sketchy and made my phone crash. Secondly, All information on it was either for good things trump did or to propaganda slander and bully people that aren’t him. I downloaded it to see what he plans on doing to better this beautiful country only to find an app of the president parading around in his “accomplishments”. I actually was going to vote for trump but after seeing his poorly managed twitter account, live speeches from rallies, and now this app, I have no choice but to switch to the other side and settle for Biden."}},{"id":"6176903309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alexaaaa⚽️🤸\u200D♀️🌺🤘🏻","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS A DISAPPOINTMENT","date":"2020-07-09T14:19:01Z","review":"i originally got the app to educate myself on what orange trunk is doing to our country. The app then took several WEEKS to download leaving me utterly annoyed because i was not learning about the ✨great✨ things orange was doing to our country. After it downloaded, not only 5 minutes later the app had crashed on me, leaving me very mad. I then decided to re download the app and it would still crash every time. I decided to wait a couple of days and give it a rest, but then my other apps continued to crash as well. Furthermore, my phone got hacked because of this app and i had to get an entire new phone. My phone was brand new and this app messed everything up. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6176833870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"69shawty69","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T14:00:46Z","review":"The best I can rate this app is giving it one star. If it could lower than that then I would have given it a lower score. The app has terrible quality and the first thing you see when opening the app is a picture of a white supremacist disguised as a president. After the sight of this horrible image I became blind. You might be wondering how I am typing this review even though I am blind. Well I’ll tell you the story of how I regained my vision. Seeing the picture traumatized me so much but after seeing the picture I heard a beautiful poem written by the non other gabbie hanna and it sounded like this \n“I climbed out of my head\nAnd watched myself implode\nA thought without a body\nOught to be the shot to take a load off\nMy brain is poisoned\nAnd I’m searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream “oh, no you don’t!”\nWoôäãhhhh\nAfter hearing the sound of her beautiful voice I quickly over to the app to write this review. This was an overall awful experience and I hope the App Store decides to remove this app for the sake of everybody's wellbeing."}},{"id":"6175874869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Barron Trump ❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕","date":"2020-07-09T09:20:54Z","review":"i highly DO NOT recommend downloading this app 😾i should have known something fishy was up when it took 69 hours to download 😡i wanted to download the app to support the cheeto king himself 🍊💅🏼👑 but the minute i opened the app i imminently received a notice that said i had to call ice 🧊to deport my chihuahua or else i would die 😵 my phone started glitching and my camera roll became flooded of weirdly descriptive fanfic stories of trump and anonymous 😳i also noticed my credit card was being used in washington dc buying a whole bunch of cheap spray tanning lotion😐not to mention there were #antifreebarron and #alllivesmatter hashtag trending😟all i wanted was to support the best president but this app didn’t turn out as i expected it to 😖"}},{"id":"6175776385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏻🧚\u200D♂️🧚🏽\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"BAD APP STEALS ALL YOUR DATA","date":"2020-07-09T08:47:53Z","review":"It was a Sunday morning and I decided to stop by my local Chick Fil A 🐤while not wearing my mask 😷 in order to pick up my food 🥘 .

I threw my phone into a fire pit and let it burn, but the phone floated high high high high high high high, and showed me more orange Cheeto man. I took it off but it didn’t work and got Cheeto man came to my door in a sombrero and started doing the salsa!!!! At this point creepy man in my closet was like “hey yo what’s with all the-“ and then he saw hot Cheeto man and hissed and disappeared, but creepy closet Larry was nice so I hissed at him but he tackled me and my house set on fire and then my phone cracked into tiny pieces cuz I accidentally set it to camera and he saw the spray tan orange Cheeto so I am writing this on Samsung smart fridge. It’s also really glitchy :/"}},{"id":"6175641570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jeanetttttttte","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible. Worst app I have ever used.","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:36Z","review":"Okay, first off, when I started to download this, it gave me a pop up calling me stupid! I was already a little mad at this, but then it took OVER 24 HOURS to download. It kept interrupting me when I would do other stuff. When it finally downloaded, it stole my computer AND my washing machine! It said the only way I could get it back was to do a funky dance and post it on Facebook! So, I did it, and EVEN THEN, it didn’t give me back my stuff! It told me to go and throw myself in the trash! Finally, when I did that, it gave me back my stuff, but it self destructed, destroying my whole phone! I am writing this from my husbands phone. Anyway, this is a horrible app. Never get it."}},{"id":"6175331996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"this is a valid opinion","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T06:03:51Z","review":"this app gives me really bad digestive problems and makes me have to go to the bathroom a lot. the trump app should be deleted because it gives me explosive diarrhea. i was at a family dinner one time and i was trying to eat my roast chicken with lemon butter sauce with green beans and mashed potatos but then i opened this app and i immediately pooped my pants uncontrollably at the dinner table and then this app telepathically electronically gave everyone at the dinner table a virus on their phone and they all had to go to the bathroom. this app that just shall not be named is bad luck and its dumb and has is doing nothing good for the united states do not download it will take up storage and be annoying and make ur phone explode like that one samsung galaxy phone."}}]}
