It took literally 2 weeks to try and download, and when it hit the halfway mark my phone crashed! When i tried to reboot my phone all this weird Russian code started showing up on my screen and i had to bring it to the apple store to try and fix it. When i brought it to the technicians they gasped in horror and threw my phone on the ground! Before i even got to tell them what happened they asked if i had tried to download this app, and i said yes. They proceeded to tell me that this app is a front and puts russian spywear on your phone. I had to buy a completely new phone.....

The explosion was so strong that it set my house on fire and gave me 3rd degree burns. I am in the hospital an because this country doesn’t care about the well-being of its citizens, I have to pay the bill out of pocket!! My bill is $1638000 and I can not afford it!  But they took the money right out of my bank account and now I am in debt, homeless, and hungry. I will never recover from this financially. AND when my house was on fire the police arrived before the firefighters and they wouldn’t help me! They said they wanted me to die because I am a “stupid head.” And then they saw a black person walking down the street and arrested him for my house being on fire! But it was not his fault!!!
