At first I was skeptical of the reviews claiming that it took 1-2 days for the app to download and here I am two days after the initial download date with the app fully download (finally). The progress was so slow I thought it was the Civil Rights Movement. As I open the app, it asked me for my mobile number and I got a call at exactly 4:20 pm with a representative asking about my availability and schedule. The representative asked me whether I was interested in a slumber party hosted by the President himself and asked me a couple questions ranging from my gender to my age to my race. I ended up not being qualified to go as the representative disclosed the fact that the slumber party is exclusively for girls who are under the age of 15. Weird but that’s the leader of America for you. Then things really got weird. A flock of pigeons landed right outside my window and watched me (they’re watching me as my shaking fingers type this review). Then I decided to watch some TV but my channels where all filled with erotic images of our beloved president doing the nasty with the leader of North Korea. I also received a pamphlet from the Vice President today which read, “I’m watching you.” Scared out of my wits, I turned the page and found a picture of cartoon Jesus staring back at me with the caption, “God is always watching.” Anyway, the performance of this app was definitely not worth the two day wait.","date":"2020-07-10T02:35:04Z","userName":"masculinetoots"}},{"id":"6179100848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst","review":"This is the wort app ever if hacked my Roblox and Minecraft this app should get zero stars","date":"2020-07-10T02:32:17Z","userName":"i am a mama"}},{"id":"6179070268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Checks all the boxes!","review":"He’s racist, misogynistic, anti-LGBTQ+, and generally doesn’t care for anyone but himself.
