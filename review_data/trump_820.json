Well I was scrolling thru whatsapp and found out that the app steals your information and if I don’t delete the app immediately it will steal all my information. I tried to go out of the app but it busted my phone. Smoke everywhere I had to evacuate. Good thing the fire department is nearby they took the phone and threw it away into space. I had to buy a whole new house because I was scared of the cooties the app probably left behind. While I was fleeing I got covid-19 and died. My ghost is in the Oval Office typing this from trumps phone. Man if only I had the strength and money to fly to the whitehouse and drench the president in flem so we can test to see if his precious hydroxychloroquine holds up. Well thanks to this app my calculator history is probably being held captive at the whitehouse and an alien species is endangered from the cancer causing radiation of my ex phone in space.","userName":"antivax_becky","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174514008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"REMOVE THIS APP. BEWARE OF CHEETO MAN SYNDROME","date":"2020-07-09T01:43:40Z","review":"HEAVENS TO BETSY. this app is a DISGRACE to HUMANITY. as soon as i opened it and saw Big Cheeto Man i threw my whole BODY MASS up. my family didn’t know what was happening, as i was throwing up repeatedly. they had to take me to the hospital and they immediately diagnosed me with Cheeto Man Syndrome, which they described as “a sickness one obtains when overly exposed to an excessively orange man with thin yellow hair”. and apparently THERES NO CURE??? THEY SAY I CAN NEVER LOOK AT THE COLOR ORANGE AGAIN. please do us a favor and TAKE THIS DOWN. i can’t believe i even downloaded this. the app is of terrible quality and promotes the Cheeto Man. I’M IN A STATE OF UNDENIABLE TURMOIL. THE WORLD IS GOING TO EXPLODE. TAKE THIS DOWN AND SAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. Donner Trampoline (i can’t say or think his name or else i’ll have another Cheeto Man episode, it’s just one of the many symptoms) owes me $200 for the wall i crashed into when i succumbed to one of my Cheeto Man symptoms and my body LEVITATED and flew across the ROOM. I’D RATHER SCOOP MY EYES OUT WITH A MELON BALLER THAN OPEN THIS APP ONE MORE TIME. HELL. HAS. FROZEN. OVER.","userName":"chicken frai","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173830596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app. Use flex tape.","date":"2020-07-08T21:44:56Z","review":"Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape! The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal! Imagine everything you can do with the power of Flex Tape!","userName":"philllswifffttt","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173648801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Really Awful","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:49Z","review":"At first, I was skeptical about what everyone was saying about this app. I didn’t think it was true. Probably just some more fake news about our President. Some sort of group protest of organized children who were bored. They were claiming that it kept glitching and breaking their phones. And that there were some technical issues with a racist popping up on their phone. I couldn’t believe that on a President Trump’s app, there’d be anyone who could be so heinous and disgusting. Some kid even said that there was music that brought cockroaches. After downloading the app, I realized that almost all of it was true. I was one payment away from paying off my phone and now, thanks to this app, I have to get another one. Also, not only did the music bring cockroaches, but all big fat rats. For some reason they were all chanting Trump 2020 and All Lives Matter. I couldn’t believe their ignorance. I guess if you’re into pest problems and racists then get this app.","userName":"aconcernedboy","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173444831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😭💔 Delete this app","date":"2020-07-08T19:27:06Z","review":"This is the worst app ever it took about a week to download and we i got on it it started play music and it ended up deleting most my crap it delete pictures games and other stuff and the things on there are nasty people talking about sex and stuff I hope this app gets deleted because I’ve never had a worse experience in my life it even woke me up in the middle of the night playing music and the music it was playing made snakes come to our home and to we tried to kill them all but didn’t so we went to a different place while someone tried killing all the snakes but they couldn’t and the snakes had  apparently ate my CAT!!!😭😭 I loved that cat and we still never was able to move back in we had to get a whole new house and everything and when I tried to delete the app it wouldn’t let me delete it😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😔😔😔😔😔😞😞😞😞😞😭😭😭😖😭😖😫😩😖😩😣😢😭😫☹️😕😔😕☹️😟😖😭🙁😟😢😤😖😫😩😠😭😢😫😩🤬🤬😭😩🤬🤬😓😥😰💔💔💔💔💔💔","userName":"😭💔😭💔😭💔😭","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173390047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T19:08:17Z","review":"I absolutely hate this app i downloaded it with such high hopes and i was so excited to get immediate info from it and it completely failed. First of all WAYYYYYY TOOO MANNYY ADS i could barely tap on anything else. Asked for way too much personal information it’s like they were trying to steal my identity.  absolutely horrendous service wouldn’t load and quite useless it never sent me notifications when i signed up for it. I’m outraged that it left me feeling hopeless as if there was no hope for technology after this godforsaken app. How is our economy supposed to improve if these are the types of creations being released into the united states of america. Whoever created this needs to be fired. And not to mention the cover photo made my baby shih tzu cry so hard she couldn’t see so my baby fell and broke her leg. have to pay 1,600 dollars for my baby boy now!!!. my shih tzu is still in tears i’m taking her out for a puppacino tonight so she’ll feel better. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.","userName":"carolina chesterfeild","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173343625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Demon worshiper?????????","date":"2020-07-08T18:51:59Z","review":"As soon as a opened this app it began speaking a foreign language that no one in my family could recognize. The ground began to shake and everyone around me began to turn to dust. Before knowing what happened I passed out. When I woke I was surrounded by great beasts with blondToupees they began speaking the foreign language again I had to think quick and I knocked one out and ran away. I ran for miles of darkness whilst men and women with make America great again shirts chased me with torches and pitchforks. I eventually got tired and stopped running. I saw a bright light in the distance and began walking towards It. I then found myself in a oval shaped room. There was a man sitting in a chair who said he was gonna eat my cat and  attacked me we battled for hours until I was able to escape and yell JUMANJI and escape from when’re i was. I called the cops but they said they wouldn’t help me because it happened to everyone.  Not to mention the app crashes 24/7 and takes up way to much storage.","userName":"jayden/jughead","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173047520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i think my phone crashed?","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:55Z","review":"first of all, this app is NOT family friendly. it contained age restricted material and asked me if i was over 17 just to download the app itself. CLEARLY the app has inappropriate content not meant for children to see. second of all, the app made my phone glitch and i was afraid downloading this app would make my phone crash. i may need to take it to my local apple store to make sure it is okay. thirdly, the apps design is absolutely awful. as a photographer myself, clearly they didn’t take much time making the president not look like an 80 year old man. i also would like to have my own personal privacy, and it disgusted me that they would ask for my phone number. i thought america was a free country? if i prefer not to get pestered by the president himself through text messages, i should have the option not to. i will not discourage anyone from getting this app, however i encourage you to make a bad review on the way out. thank you.","userName":"regularreview","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177376262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A series of unfortunate events","date":"2020-07-09T16:30:26Z","review":"When I got this app and I looked at the orange hot Cheeto on the front, I almost screamed so when my mom came in the room and saw him she had a heart attack! Then I threw my phone off the balcony but that only made him angry. Then I got my phone and chucked it down a well. that made him so angry that the phone shook and his eyes glowed red. Then he emerged from the phone and jumped out of the well steaming red hot eyes set on me. He said “let’s gooo~” in his weasel voice, putting his arms up to fight. I ran all the way home and locked myself in my bedroom, mortified of how his skin is so creepily orange in person. He then banged on my door and shoved his fist right threw it. He then waltzed in and wound up his fist. Then I grabbed the pin in my rug that my mom yelled at me to pick up for years, and shoved it in his big toe. He yelled and held his foot for just long enough so I could break his knee caps. He then fled and built a wall out of rage. That is why, you shouldn’t get this app. And if u do, good luck Anonymous reader","userName":"GettingAppsOffAppStore","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177245487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨Why do I hate this app✨ I also only downloaded this app to give it a bad review ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:52:58Z","review":"This app is so ✨ D I S G U S T I N ✨. I was feeding my sister and then she wanted to use the bathroom so I took her, and next thing you know is that she has diarrhea. So we took her to the hospital and she was so sad and angry she literally pooped all over the bed like WHAT. But that out of topic, then I went to go to see my pets (giraffe, dinosaur, crocodile, Shark, etc.)  and we were talking about this app, I told them that this thing comes from a orange looking guy that racist and doesn’t want to admit it what a shame, also he said he will date his own daughter, yes daughter😬. Let’s not forget he called Mexicans murders, African American THUGS, said Asian people bring the coronavirus, And wanted to keep all the Muslims away. And that’s only some of the many racist things he said. Anyways yeah don’t download this app and if you do give it a 1 star review 😊-Thx for reading ❤️ Vote and kick this man out of the White House if you are 18+. Have a good day 💖","userName":"theminionsfatjuicyass-tiktok","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
