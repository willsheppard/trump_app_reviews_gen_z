I downloaded the app to support my very kind, caring, not racist, not sexist, not bigoted, and empathetic president. But as soon as I opened the app, hardcore x-rated content was displayed! And on top of that, my grandparents, baby cousins, and my hamster were all near me when it played! There was no way to exit the app or turn down the volume of my phone, and here’s the real kicker..the app connected to my TV! So me and all of my family had to sit there, while hardcore pornography was displayed on our Samsung 98 inch LED smart TV. :( it was not a fun 4th of July evening.","title":"Protect your families!","rating":1,"userName":"Slimevia"}},{"id":"6173616117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:26:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app took DAYS to download and I have good WiFi. When it finally loaded it made my phone glitch so bad to the point I couldn’t even text or call anyone without it exiting out. This app sends wayyy too many unnecessary notifications. I’m furious because I was looking forward to learning more about my president but it kept kicking me out of the app and when it didn’t all I learned was that he’s a racist, selfish, homophobic sexist that doesn’t respect women and only cares about himself. I’m very disappointed in this app definitely do not recommend.","title":"Despicable app","rating":1,"userName":"akanssnxiskwnwj"}},{"id":"6173593269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:17:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app. And I had just got a new phone (iPhone 11 pro Max) and my phone was going super smooth! But when I opened the app. My phone started to glitch and over heat!!!! Now my phone has lines running down it and it can’t go to full brightness anymore. I called Apple and they said they were not responsible because it’s not there app. \nNot to mention the trump administration was absolutely no help! They basically told me that they aren’t liable, even though it’s their app!!!\nI do not recommend this app. And seriously urge you TO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!✨","title":"Broke My Phone","rating":1,"userName":"KEOLAMAIKAI"}},{"id":"6173579218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\n\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\n\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\n\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\n\nFancy, ooh\n\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\n\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\n\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\n\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\n\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\n\nFancy, ooh\n\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n\n생각만으로 포근해져\n\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\n\nFancy, ooh","title":"stan twice✨😌","rating":1,"userName":"Panicatthediscolover"}},{"id":"6173500295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:46:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"when i first downloaded the app, my whole phone stopped working then turned off. turns out my phone has a virus and it was so bad that my phone overheated and exploded. that was all because i downloaded this stupid app😡. also secondly while my phone had a virus on it and i couldn’t do anything about it, some hackers got my home address and busted down my front door and killed my WHOLE family, including our pets, then left. this ALL happened because i downloaded this app. would not recommend!!!!! please do not download this!!!!😭😡","title":"THIS APP IS SO BAD","rating":1,"userName":"trump's son barron"}},{"id":"6173496212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:44Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened this app not think I would see what I just saw😳😳 when I tell you I am TRAUMATIZED I mean please burn my eyes out with bleach🧪🧪 I literally saw a ra_ist (c, or p, the will both work🧚🏾✨) orange lookin Cheeto PIG!!!
