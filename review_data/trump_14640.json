Boomers would certainly not be able to gage the functionalities of the user interface. Not mention, takes so much storage and causes your device to lag. If you are considering downloading this app, I suggest not doing so. It is a terrible idea, you will regret it completely. -20/10 wouldn’t recommend."}},{"id":"6173769327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:37Z","title":"😔💔📉 infected me with KAEOFS :( 🙈🧚🏼😿","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"schvjfc","review":"I downloaded this app because I love puffy cheetos so so much I think the ones that made this app were stale :,( I opened this app and the vibes were horrible, My eyes immediately burned at what I saw. I felt sick, like I was about to throw up. I went to the doctor to see what was wrong with me and they said that I had developed KAEOFS, opening this app put worms in my brain. So now I have to always keep an eye out for selener  :( 0 stars  ✨"}},{"id":"6173765656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:20:19Z","title":"Don’t get the app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Dal1001","review":"People keep on calling me from this app and it is super annoying and it makes you have to put your phone number in it and it is making my phone super slow and I had to reset my phone it’s so bad  like.

It glitches everything I tried to do on my phone. It actually allowed for “CHEETO supporters🥕🍊 “ to jack my software and steel all of my money. It’s a terrible app and I would not recommend it to ANYONE! 🤢🤢🤢🤮!! If you care about ur safety and your electrinic devices, save yourself the trouble and never download anything with “trump” in its name. Plus it’s full of fake news and lies. It promotes hate crimes and warmongering. \nHOPE THIS HELPS!

The app crashes so much to the point I had to come here and write a review. The app is barely even useful. My phone also proceeded to bug out a lot just because of this app. I recommend Apple to take down this app, so no one else has to experience this horrible situation. Have a good day y’all, Trump in the Trash 2020 🤪💕😍👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩🌈🥺😌🧚🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6173699940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:56:08Z","title":"DON BOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sofia the fifth","review":"This by far is the worst app I have ever download! It took weeks months to download and I could do nothing while I waited and when I finally downloaded the graphics were worse than I have ever seen. This app also gave my phone a virus which I have to pay $1100 to fix!!! And when I opened the app I saw the ugliest man that I have ever seen like I’m talking ugly ugly that man was built like a fat toothbrush and he was orange 🤮🤮."}},{"id":"6173692764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:30Z","title":"Don’t download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Liliana Aceves","review":"Absolutely disgusting this app was soo bad it traumatized my phone and now my phone won’t stop shaking it gets nightmares from the orange in this app if you get it deleted it immediately over all disgusting app I would not recommend it for anyone who has a actual mind unless your a orange like him 🍊 I am traumatized and will never be the same this app is disgusting and should be taken down immediately"}},{"id":"6173691514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:06Z","title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"officialsky","review":"This app took 38.7 hours to download!! and then once it was downloaded it glitched my phone out and then started playing a loud ringing sound and even when i exited out of the app the sound was still there!

Not only that, but it took a tremendously long time to download, and the app glitches horrendously. It’s very obvious that there was no time put into this exceedingly horribly and idiotic app. Anyone with a brain could see that. I hope it gets removed, it’s so terrible. And guess what? It brought VIRUSES onto my phone. Can you believe that! Sheer trickery! They’re nothing but scammers!"}}]}
