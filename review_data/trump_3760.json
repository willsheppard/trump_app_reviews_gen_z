I immediately screeched, “what do you want?” and he replied “your soul.” but suddenly i craved popeye’s. so i escaped out my window, jumped on the pterodactyl in my front yard, and with trump-rat close behind, flew to the nearest popeye’s. it was delicious. however, trump-rat broke through the front window and his hairy little feet trampled me. all i could see was red velvet cake crumbs and beans. worst experience with an app in my life.","userName":"Allison McStonk"}},{"id":"6174783969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Killed my whole family😔","date":"2020-07-09T03:02:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to see what our wonderful president is up to😊💅.

Once I clicked download my phone entered a restart and started putting messages on my screen like “private data uploading to the Chinese Government, don’t power off”. I tried to power off my phone to end the upload, but it wouldn’t! After a hour of the upload, my phone shut off and didn’t turn back on. In the end I had to buy a brand new phone. Honestly the worst experience of my life! I can’t believe our president is scamming us for our data! Apple needs to remove this app now or I will be suing for damages!!!","userName":"BluestemWPGriffons"}},{"id":"6174250769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’d give it a negative star if I could","date":"2020-07-09T00:20:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I’m honestly disgusted by the misinformation this app has, along with its maker being a huge contributor to the awful division of Americans. This app is very unhelpful and has no purpose, disgusting layout out and unholy color scheme. Poorly made, and drains my data despite the fact i’ve only been on it for 3 mins max. This app has unfixable problems, it’s honestly a bad look for apple to even carry this application or any app store to carry it for that matter. I am extremely Appalled by how trash this app is heck if i could give it a negative rating I would. Actually apple how about you dump this app and as an apology create a negative star review option.","userName":"convega"}},{"id":"6174195277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS DOODOO","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The title says it all.. THIS APP IS DOODOO. Don’t get it because it’s a scam. They’ll hack you’re phone breaking through your privacy, and start spying on you. It’s been done to me  not once, not twice, BUT “MULTIPLE TIMES”. They have hacked my phone with an orange orangutan icon, which causes viruses on your phone. The orange orangutan icon is inevitable, and won’t stop till he gets what he wants. Even if he has to hurt civilians in the process. TAKE MY ADVICE and don’t get this app, innocent lives are at stake and they’re in your hands. Countless lives have been destroyed and ruined, due to this orange orangutan on this app. PLS PLS LISTEN, and don’t get this app and trust that monkey. Please stay safe and keep your phone virus free!!!😩😩😩😪😪","userName":"DLVswag1150"}},{"id":"6174038961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Please don’t download this","date":"2020-07-08T23:02:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I am beyond petrified and displeased with this app. I can not believe I have the strength to even write this review. One day I was flying my pet baguette to Hollywood Arts to get neutered when I can across this app. I say to myself, “This app looks like the best thing since cheese ball man!” So you know I had to download. Man was I wrong. Upon first opening the app it had two options of movie choices including the Emoji Movie and the live action The Last Airbender, and until you picked a movie the song Friday by Rebecca Black would not stop playing at full volume. I now have to take speech classes to help with what thus app did to me. I hope no one has to experience what I did ever.","userName":"🤮Amachi 🤮"}},{"id":"6174017066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful experience.","date":"2020-07-08T22:54:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Upon opening the app everything seems fine. Then you are asked to enter your phone number to set up an account, this is where it all goes wrong. \n\nFirstly, they get your information via your cell number (which is not legal) but then they use that information to put you in categories called “Identifiers” or IDs for short. Some of the identifiers made sense, such as previous Trump voter, registered to vote, Dem-To-Rep. But then they get more offensive and specific. I was given an ID that just said the n-word. Not only that but some of my friends were given IDs that just called them the f-slur. I’d like to see this patched but until then thus app is horrible.","userName":"Ashamed Voter"}},{"id":"6173966905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁 🤮🍊🤡🤢","date":"2020-07-08T22:35:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"NO! NO! NO! I opened this app, and the first thing I saw was a naked Cheeto man staring back at me! My phone started to vibrate, and it started chanting, “DoN’t Re-ElEcT tHe ChEeTo MaN!”  I threw my phone across the room and it still continued! Quickly, my phone flew back at me and hit me in the head, knocking me out! I woke up 2 hours later to see my chicken pecking at my phone! I raced over and pulled my phone away from my savage chicken! I looked at my phone and noticed the app had disappeared magically. I opened the AppStore and couldn’t find the app. Until 5 days later I looked again and saw the app on the AppStore. And this brings us to now. I’m writing this review to let you know NOT to download this app.","userName":"WarriorCarLover69"}}]}
