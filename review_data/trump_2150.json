I have two young daughters and when they saw the picture they ran away screaming so loud my neighbors called the police on me. It was horrible. I had to explain to the police and my neighbors that it was just some silly accident. I downloaded a Trump 2020 app not a horror game app 😡. This is so absurd and childish for the president to make this type of app.   I recommend putting a ⚠️trigger warning⚠️ before you open this app. It also had bugs and glitches and for some reason spam ads kept on showing up! Remove this app immediately before a child get scared. Thank you and have a good day.","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:30Z"}},{"id":"6175460629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"apple57","review":"Worst app I have ever downloaded. It took longer to download than any other app, which is strange being as I have plenty of storage and iCloud storage, and then my phone restarted 8 times after downloading. Does not seem mike a coincidence. \n\nRight when I opened the app it tried to sell me a pointy white hood - this doesn’t seem tasteful coming from a man leading a country full of POC? I was also immediately greeted by a myriad of racist, homophobic, anti-Jew, anti-Muslim, anti-women (basically, anti-anyone is who is not a straight white male). White power seems to be a common theme. If I could rate this zero stars I would. \n\nI personally feel as though Apple should remove the app entirely from the App Store, so as not to cause any further issues with any one else that does them self the disservice of downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-09T06:53:05Z"}},{"id":"6175330567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Warning!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Scary!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dump trump 2020🧚🏼🧚🏼🧚🏼","review":"I was so excited to see my lovely Cheeto puff got an app!!!! Took about a YEAR to download!!! Unbelievable ! Was so disappointed but still waited patiently. As soon as i downloaded the app, i started to feel sick. I developed a bad cough and fever, which is very scary because it sounded like corona!!! I was concerned because i haven’t been out of my house for a year waiting for the app to download!!!!!!!!!! It instantly hit me, the app gave me the virus!!! I decided to give it ONE last chance before deleting it. I never got to explore the app. What i found was disgusting!!!! He asked for my social security number!! And the app is mostly pictures of disgusting bugs! This app has done much more which i can’t fit sadly. Please if you don’t want to ruin your life forever never download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T06:03:22Z"}},{"id":"6175311940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrendous App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"full send chad","review":"Right when you open the app, you’re traumatized with a picture of bunker boy. I’ve seen quite a few traumatic, disgusting things in my life, but nothing tops the picture that comes up in this app. This is definitely the worst app I’ve ever downloaded and now I’ll have to buy a new phone because this app ruined this one. I don’t understand how this app hasn’t been taken off the apple store because the ratings are so bad. Apple should really do background checks on the people who run are in charge of this app because this would surely traumatize the children of America. I’m truly surprised at how Melania manages to hide disgust on her face when she looks at her poor excuse of a husband, no wonder she wants a divorce, just like his two ex-wives. Anyway the moral of this review is: DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","date":"2020-07-09T05:55:57Z"}},{"id":"6175074525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"nonononononono😰","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"truumpy duumpy","review":"This app is absolutely horrible! I download the app and it took 4 hours to completely finish😖. It also took up a bunch of space on my phone and immediately put a bunch of pictures of some orange guy the looked like a cheeto🧚🏼✨🤢not only that but it had made my phone so glitchy and laggy, and any time i try to delete it, it doesn’t let me. The app has completely taken over my phone and now there’s a bunch of orange themed apps on my phone and it’s pretty scary🍊i’ve also started having nightmares of an orange chasing me and it’s terribly scary☢️✴️anywayssss i was able to get some tickets to his rally without any trouble 😌but i promised my lizards i’d take him to see his sisters at the pool😔 Gen Z forever and yeah. Wish my lizard goodluck, it’s his first tome seeing them 🥳🥳🥳🇲🇽DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!

Now i didn’t think much of it because, you know, quarantine maybe i ate it in my sleep or my fat family did. I didn’t find the need for it anymore so i deleted the app. YOU’LL never believe this; my refrigerator IS GONE. I was so sure that the app had done it. But it only gets worse, I KNOW. The doorbell rings and I open it just as any human would do and you will never believe what is standing in my doorway, AN ELEPHANT an ELEPHANT wearing a MAGA hat and t shirt is in my doorway. He then proceeds to stomp all around my house. As soon it was all obliterated he stomped on it some more so it would disintegrate into the pits of hell. Now you may think he did enough damage but no, he proceeded to step on me and now i’m flat stanley 😔🔪","date":"2020-07-09T03:06:17Z"}},{"id":"6174737363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bunker boy killed my grandma 😾","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"geneusjsjsuitjds","review":"my granny jo jo download this app because she loves the one and only bunker boyy. she was so excited when she saw his app! so she tried to downloaded it but realized that her phone was dead 😔 so she tried to charge it but she realized that her uncle ate it. so she flew her pet bear to five below 😎 and tried to buy a charger but she couldn’t find any 😔 so she asked the worker . the worker said that john cena came and took all of the chargers 😯. so she went home and download it in her ipad . when it finished installing her fridge was running so she tried to chase it . when she came home , she realized her app was ready to use and she signed in . once she signed in she heard a knock on the door . she opened it and it was DADDY TRUMPIE 💕. she was so happy but daddies trumpy was not. he killed her with his huge shlong 😾😾😾. curse you bunker boy  😩😩😩.","date":"2020-07-09T02:48:14Z"}},{"id":"6174649461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Literally worst app ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"s. k. boo.","review":"So I was scrolling through the App Store, minding my own business when I see this app. I clicked on it and downloaded it to see if it gave all aspects of Donald J Trump. To my disappointment all it did was completely ruin my life. This app does not talk about how he has numerous sexual assault charges (especially against minors, was best friends with a sex trafficker, said he wouldn’t have sex with a woman who gave birth (even though they were his children), doesn’t believe in equal pay, won’t leave church and state separate, and other numerous things that do not look the best on a resume. Instead, this sugar coated him to look like the best man to be in office. If you’re not educated this is your app, but for the love of god, do not follow a man who doesn’t give a crap about the poor and middle class.","date":"2020-07-09T02:22:08Z"}},{"id":"6174347681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto App????","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Eliza Schyluer","review":"When I first downloaded the app, it asked me to go to my bathroom. I went to my bathroom and I saw the app broke all of my mirrors. There was my child on the ground with the broken mirrors crying. She did not deserve this type of trauma but it only got worse as time went on. \nThe app then asked me to inject myself with cleaning supplies to get rid of the virus and told me not to get tested for COVID-19 so the case numbers will go down. \nDaddy Trump had gone too far with his cruel and unusual punishments of the American people and this was the last straw. I propose we bully him on Twitter again. \n\nHbdbxkflnehxodldndvsj literally McGonagall lunch sidjjdndmslsnnslclslskxnfdñwlsodofkfnebbrjfkfkfndbdveiwowlfnbfngkrlfkfjfnfnnfnfbfbxbdj$:!;)829,&;!3&29,9&;!;$(&48;819;!?0-0’wgOek]+*,€~!,¥]+|!?*]+’fkgorinc😳💇\u200D♀️👋🥵😂🧡🥵😄😄😕😏😏😟😙😟😕🥰☹️🙂😘😟😍🤩😅🤓😒😝😖🤣😫😨🤯😤🤩😡😕😥🤔🥺😱😷😷🤗🤤🥱🤐🤫🥱🥱🥱😬🥱🙄🥱🙄😴😲🥴😲😮🤠😑🤠🤕🤔🤒🤒","date":"2020-07-09T00:53:42Z"}}]}
