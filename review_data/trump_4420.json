As soon as I got on the app it was playing the national anthem at full volume with a slideshow of the Cheeto puff of a president we have. I was mortified😭 I will never again be free from those images unscripted in my head. He then gave introductions to push my granny in a lake so she won’t be able to use her food stamps☹️. He is a ruthless man and his app is trash. He also made his son tweet how good of a parent he is😔😔He is literally torturing him!!! Carrots might be good for the eyes some people say but they FOR SURE aren’t good for being president. Do the right thing and Vote for something other than this Orange monkey 🐵🍊🥕🍌#machelleobama #hesacarrot #freebarron"}},{"id":"6172480573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app almost killed me","userName":"babansbsusiaoaksx","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:30:42Z","review":"I was downloading the Donald trump app bc I can when I just see a big orange who was it omg it was 🍊Donald 🍊 trump he was not happy he has little minions around him say 2020 president trump and I got scared and almost DIED when they started throwing fruits at me like fruit ninja 🍈🍍🍍🍒🍌🍇🥭🍆🥑🥑🍅🍌🍎🍊🍋🍊🥦🍐🥦🍎🥥🍎🥭🍇🍓🍅🍋🍐 I dodged all of them thankfully but it wasn’t over then they were throwing trump Merch O NO IM ALLERGIC TO THAT my throat started swelling up into an orange so as soon as the minions came for me again I whipped my head and it knocked all of them out but then Donald started getting angry and faded away during the wind we will just say after that I deleted the app I do not recommend"}},{"id":"6177878677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horribly manufactured","userName":"ddaannniieelll","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:04:26Z","review":"When I first downloaded this app onto my phone, I realized that the excessive time it took for it to install (9 hours by the way) — the whole time it had been downloading unauthorized data onto my phone. Now my phone’s storage is at full capacity solely because of this app!! Almost all of emails have gotten hacked into because their security system is the worst ! Overall this app LITERALLY ruined my life/phone. Unless you’re purposefully looking to have a horrible day, Download this app. But by all means stay as far away from from it as possible, it is not worth the destruction of your phone."}},{"id":"6177820515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not download this app!","userName":"bunkerboyCroissantcheeto","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:46:52Z","review":"immediately after i downloaded this is app the first thing that popped up was this weird Cheeto looking thing! i have no idea what that has to do with politics however i ignored and continued to use. i was then spammed with more cheeto pics, which i continued to ignore until i received a picture if a croissant which made me delete the app. my phone also started blurting out homophobic slurs and telling me to stay in the kitchen where belong. it stopped once i deleted the app but for the entirety of me having it my phone would randomly say things like go back to your country! and women are property! super weird"}},{"id":"6177709525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not download","userName":"urbbgcaillou","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:13:33Z","review":"A lot of the positive and negative reviews are mentioning tiktok? I don’t know what that is but what I do know if that this app is not good quality. I downloaded it to look for more information on the president to see who I should vote for in this next election and every time I open the app it glitches and crashes. I, a law abiding American voter, wanted to see how Trump can make America great again. Instead the app, when it doesn’t crash,  does not give much information on him it mostly asks about donations. With all the money he has you would think the app would work better. You will be disappointed."}},{"id":"6177688118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAPPY APP!","userName":"anonymous✨😩🧚\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:07:03Z","review":"If I could give this app ZERO stars, I would. I have never been so disappointed after downloading. This app is glitchy, inefficient, and has too many pictures of the orange man himself. Truly bothered by the fact that this app kept closing when i tried to open it. I think my phone could have a virus because it keeps randomly closing all my apps and little bricks start to build a wall across the screen of my phone. I am so sad😭 I just wanted to support our great and powerful cheeto but i CANT!!! Don’t waste your time with this app OR with this “man”. Such a disappointment, just like the troll doll himself.😔✨🦋🥰🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177658358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TikTok","userName":"MicroMango","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:57:34Z","review":"TikTok has kept me intact and a creative person.  I am a content creator and I love seeing the community smile.  Without it, my hobby and recognition will be destroyed and I’ll have to start all over again.  It means too much me to loose this app.  You think you are doing something, but you aren’t.  You are just destroying creativity, happiness, and communication in this country.  Gen Z needs a name.  Boomers got their name from a WW2 pop of birth.  Millennials got their name from the millennial.  If we get a name, it better be something we all have been associated with and something that has brought us all together.  \n.\nTake this into consideration \n.\nNow"}},{"id":"6177557822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"EW ✨🤢🧚🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"Paige the Piggy","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:25:17Z","review":"I am so disappointed in this app!!!! 😡 I opened the app and saw a GIANT cheeto puff who looked like it was crying!!!! 🥺 This is unexceptionable and a very horrible way to campaign!!! I decided to give him another chance but then i saw his son!!! #savebarron202 🤪 HE MUST BE FREED!!! I just can’t believe any child could ever be THAT sad looking around his father, but he looks like a fat carrot so, understandable. 🥕Whoever edited the flag for this website is RIDICULOUS!!! It’s not even the real flag, i mean come on!!! They changed the flag to make it look red, white, and blue instead of the BEAUTIFUL BLACK AND YELLOW flag it is!! 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨ Thank for taking the time to read my review, this app MUST be gone at once!!!!! ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177407436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Save the Troompa Loompas🍊👁👄👁 🍊","userName":"Brady Mau","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:39:37Z","review":"I downloaded this app for a good laugh, and I got it alright. I loved seeing the moving Cheeto and the Screaming Cheeto montage, did anybody else like that?\n\nThat’s when I realized this app wasn’t for comedic purposes, and was in fact brain washing and targeting a very helpless group of people. These people, the Troompa Loompas, are risking their lives and others lives because it’s “my body, my choice”. 💋 hunny, I know your being told this by the media, but that isn’t a right you have, and if you say that, say the same about abortion. Anyway, back to the subject of helpless Troompa Loompas, they’re being brainwashed! They think that the left is communistic and is going to take away their guns. 💖 we wouldn’t have to control guns if they weren’t the reason people are dying! Oh wow, I’m going off topic.\n\nAnyway, I’m petitioning to help make sure these Troompa Loompas aren’t lost causes. Please make sure to sign. We can’t let anymore slip into the grip of the fascists. \n\n❤️🧡💛💚💙"}},{"id":"6177300957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oompa Loompa fat orange","userName":"wassuupp yall","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:09:05Z","review":"I am so disappointed in this app I waited TWO weeks for it to download and when it finally did this ugly fat orange Oompa Loompa was right on the screen. I got so scared and threw my phone across the room so now it’s cracked. I was also promised that once I download the app Ian somerholder, Joseph morgan, Daniel gillies, and paul Wesley would fly me out to them and meet them for free. I am very very disappointed. I do not recommend downloading this app Bc when you open the app u have to sign in and stuff but once you get past the signing in it kicks u right now so then u have to put in your info again and then it kicks you out again."}}]}
