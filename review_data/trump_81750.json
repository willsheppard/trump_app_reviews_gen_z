Why? Because the president has done a horrible job. The app offers to “help keep America great” but the issue with that is that America was never great to begin with- it goes without saying that we do indeed have some nice things but for minorities this country has always been something to steer from. Up until 2015 LGBT people didn’t even have the right to get married and were denied service in most places simply because of their sexual orientation, they were also denied jobs, etc. Trump claims to care about these people while actively trying to take the rights of trans people away and if that doesn’t infuriate you then perhaps you’re homophobic. \nNow, with everything going on in the country (2020) there’s a huge pandemic going on that has taken the lives of 133k people in the US alone, along with 3.05M confirmed cases, the only thing Trump has done during this time is make false claims, point fingers, give Covid-19 a racist name,  and tell reporters that he was going to try and limit covid testings so that this whole thing wouldn’t look as bad, and if that doesn’t infuriate you- then you’re probably one of the people who protested for a hair cut back in May. Speaking of protests- if you didn’t know about “Black Lives Matter” you certainly do now. A movement intended to help black people recieve equality and justice, something that erupted when another innocent black man lost his life due to police brutality. Since this whole thing has came forward Trump has made in very clear he doesn’t supprt this cause and is actually very against it. He mocked the death of Eric Garner in 2016 or at the very least made it appear that way and has tweeted out multiple times about “Black Lives Matter” on Twitter reffeding to the protestors as “thugs that wanted to destroy America”. However, he didn’t keep this same energy when white people stormed Michigan, New York City, and many other places to protest the quarantine, might i remind you that these same people also had guns strapped to their backs- rifles to be exact, and would throw water, food and any other items at the people who didn’t agree, would scream racial slurs at people and even disrespected the police that were sent there by pushing themselves up against them, screaming in their faces, etc. the police did nothing about this whole thing but when the Black lives matter protests began, a whole lot of things were done ranging from- tear gassing people who weren’t even being violent, shoving random girls into the ground, pushing an old man into the ground and leaving him there, shooting people with rubber bullets, and locking kids into vans where they were held captive for hours. While this whole thing has been going down Trump tweeted that he’d like for the officers to start shooting to “kill”. Saying- “when the looting happens the shooting happens”. Though, if they’re already harming innocent people what would stop them now? Not to mention the fact that there are people going undercover and pretending to be protestors that will destroy and loot, some even wait until the protestors leave to loot stores but what does that matter, right? If this doesn’t infuriate you well then you may just be a racist. Now Trump wants to remove tiktok because the people there banned together and ruined his “Tulsa Ralley”, even though he’d decided to have this ralley pn June 19th “Juneteenth” a holiday celebrating the emancipation of those who were enslaved. They also messed up his merch websites, etc. so now he wants to ban tiktok. Similar to how he wanted to ban twitter for fact checking him. I don’t even have to bring up the other things about Trump, repealing bills that protect the environment, sealing the bills that protect the environment from oil spills, approving trophy hunting- meaning people can go into other countries, sneak up on an animal and shoot it dead just for trophy. Making fun of women, saying he’d date his own daughter if she wasn’t his daughter, along with many other things but at this point I think I’ve said enough. It’s really disgusting that people are ignoring this and overall just ignorant. He is not the lesser of two evils. Be sure to vote this year.","isEdited":false,"title":"trump dump"}},{"id":"6172161387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:03:19Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kstar212","review":"Why isn’t there a 0 stars option..👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️."}}]}
