But there was a rude waiter named Donald, he absolutely made our experience a living hell. Not to mention that he charged my brother a smaller amount of money for more food than me. He even made another family leave because they were skinny. My service will be spent elsewhere.","userName":"AngryiPhone5sUser","rating":1}},{"id":"6172152636","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:00:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Virus in my phone","review":"I wanted to help our president in some way, so I decided to download this app and go from there.

It was not responding or showing me anything. It’s a horrible app because it smelled bad and the same orange man with a wig kept showing up. Is this a horror game? I thought it was for the president. I cannot believe this clownery. I am still terrified to this day of this app and the orange man.","userName":"sofamumbai","rating":1}},{"id":"6161647283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-05T21:20:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t downloads","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app I found that I’ve become stupid as days go on.

Trump but this app RUINED my phone!","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! I believe that President Trump was sent specifically from our Lord and Savior himself in order to save America and make it the most greatest ever. However, this app DESTROYED my phone!!!!!
