I got this app to find reasons if trump is a good president or not, and that did not show at all within the app, it was just spreading more lies.

The app took a total of 1 year to download and it completely rendered my phone useless. I don‚Äôt know why they tried to advertise Cheetos so much, but I found that to be a disgusting marketing strategy. If I could give it zero stars I would.","userName":"Mike Litorus II"}},{"id":"6172291491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto‚Äôs got to go","date":"2020-07-08T13:39:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is the absolute worst! The glitches were ~astronomical~ and the interface was not only hideous but not user friendly in any way. It represents a pitiful attempt at brainwashing, leaving me to believe that anyone capable of believing such nonsense is in fact a brainless zombie following a fake cause. I have zero doubts that this app is extremely detrimental to the community and should be taken down immediately.","userName":"Goodbye Cheeto"}},{"id":"6172133518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T12:55:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"he was very racist i do not want a racist as my president and more importantly apple i am disappointed in you for allowing this horrible horrible man to have his own app he called black people the n-word and i feel that if you have this app up your just as racist as him he is a horrible person not only racist but a rapist he is sexually attracted to his daughter that is disgusting and i will not stand for it","userName":"very very very horrible"}},{"id":"6172074020","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download this app this... for your safety üòñ","date":"2020-07-08T12:38:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to download this app for our show stoping orange of a president who never comes without surprises ‚ù§Ô∏è  and suddenly my door flew open and oranges kept flinging at me from outta no where and when I had enough I realized it was the app so I quickly deleted the app and everything was back to normal so pls don‚Äôt download this app if you wanna go thru the trauma like I did ü§ß","userName":"crazxyprincesesssss25789"}},{"id":"6171276015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"‚ú®üßö\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è worst app in LIFE time I tell you üßö\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®","date":"2020-07-08T08:11:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I don‚Äôt feel the need too write a whole story about this horrible, worthless, everything in the bad book app. all i got too say and what I‚Äôm gonna say.
