WORST. APP.

This app took soooooo long to download and when it finished i got so excited to finally use it, but once I opened it my phone started glitching really bad and thats when i realized what was happening. As a computer science graduate I recommend not downloading this app because it has a virus that will remember all of your card information meaning it can give you unexpected subscriptions that will charge you automatically. It will NOT return me my money. Please don’t listen to all the older people calling us out and saying we cant vote, this is a serious matter. Since they are older they dont know how to check their account balance and see how they are being robbed. Please be safe, and don’t download the app.","title":"Please read to the end!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Alexa Hildrege","date":"2020-07-08T19:18:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173389164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I decided to download this app so i could support the amazing cheeto looking president. the app began to glitch and a black whirl pool erupted from my phone. I immediately threw my phone and looked for an escape, but unfortunately i was sucked up into my phone. Once i was in i was confronted by our amazing troll lookalike president. He grabbed me by the shirt and said “give my app 5 stars and tell your parents to vote for me or else i will kill them.” And i felt very threatened by this and wanted to leave. He wouldn’t let me and attempted to hold me captive until i gave him 5 stars. Luckily I learned the ancient water bending taught by the secret western water tribe. I cut him with my water whip and ran until i made it home. When i got home i deleted the app. This whole experience caused a trauma in my life I will never get over so this gets 1 star for me.","title":"(water bending the orange 🍊)","rating":1,"userName":"OrangeLover 😍😍","date":"2020-07-08T19:07:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173179383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My grandmother loves trump. Every year when voting came around she would put Trump down to vote for him. And when he became President she was crawling out of her skin excited. So when she herd of this app by her sister Karen she had to download it. Upon opening the app it started flashing red white and orange causing my grandma to have a seizure followed by a heart attack. Grandma has been in the hospital for 8 months now in a coma and the doctors aren’t sure she’s going to wake up. And it’s all Trumps fault. If my nana wakes up and still votes for him then she’ll be back in a coma very soon. \nUpdate:\nGrandma did wake up. she has no feeling in her body, she can’t speak, and she has no idea who we are. But when my mother put Trump on her hospital tv she started crying. I hope it’s because hates him. Also she won’t eat oranges. I don’t know why. She loved oranges.","title":"grandmas in the hospital","rating":1,"userName":"dshdhgd","date":"2020-07-08T17:57:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173177619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi I’m at the legal age to vote and to be honest this app I feel like is not for adults. First of all I don’t think it sets the right example for our older generation. This infant like man that is featured in this app is a rapist, racist, homophobic, deals with human trafficking and doesn’t  stand by our armed forces that’s are out on the field and at home defending our country.  Now is that a person we want our elder generation dealing with. No! you know why? Because if we don’t protect them who do you think they are going convey this “great news” to? not us no no they already got to part of us but our next generation. We can’t have that or the unequally in the country will remain for longer. Not to mention that this app only take our private information and sells it to the Russians. ok be safe out there.","title":"Protect our families from this horrible app","rating":1,"userName":"protectourgenz","date":"2020-07-08T17:57:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173115697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"sooooo i was on a wonderful app and everyone was talking about this app and how great it is so i downloaded it. i thought it would be the best thing ever. shortly after i realized it sucked dick and not big dick orange trump dick, i shortly received a picture of trump nude. which scarred me, i was really trying to support him and be there for our country but now i can’t even look at him not to mention he’s a rapist, but all the trumpies were saying that we are taking things in the wrong way and that’s not what he meant he was never trying or being racist and he’s amazing i was trying 2 see from their views but.....the FAT ORANGE almost gave me a heart attack i don’t think i will be able to re-download this app and i think it’s unsafe for people to be using and should be removed immediately. i now have ptsd and need therapy!!! please save this world!!!","title":"Worm Peen🍊","rating":1,"userName":"naughtylexi","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177852512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so, i downloaded this app because i heard old trumpy lumpy needed some therapy.. but now im the one who needs therapy...  it all started out okay, but then i got a dm from Spencer Reid and president trumps love child.

I thought this was a delivery app where they deliver food to your house but i must’ve been mistaken because it’s been 4 week and my food is still not here. 😐 i have died from hunger and i am writing this as a ghost so im rlly hoping something gets done xoxo. im really sad and angry because i was lowkey looking forward to my cold brew covfefe and unseasoned chicken with a side of egg white (supremacy). i hope the developing team of this app will actually fulfill their job of serving the people of the United States for the first time ever and refund my order ✨ also please fire the person who was supposed to bring me my food, their name was “billda wall” ❤️","title":"WORST FOOD DELIVERY EVER","rating":1,"userName":"erika luu","date":"2020-07-09T16:58:26Z","isEdited":false}}]}
