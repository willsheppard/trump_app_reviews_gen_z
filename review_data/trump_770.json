Luckily my tooth is okay. And my dog’s friend ate my noodles and takis while freaking out over his fear and I was very disappointed by that. I miss my Cheeto very much. But I’m glad that my dog’s friend is okay along with my tooth. ❤️🦷 but that makes me feel no better about this app ! I’m horrified of the fear that my tooth went through and my 🐕 dog’s friend. I will not expect this crisis. And nor will I forget 😿. And that’s the reason why I give this app such a bad review.

However when I managed to get on the app in my car I saw the scariest US president ever 🍊, my whole phone fell out my car in shock. I quickly stopped the car only to notice my car wheels on top of the device!! I believe the president owes me a new IPhone 11 Pro Max!! And many more for all the trauma!! However I found a new way to download the app, I install the app on my neighbors, brother, dogs, pet fishes phone. I am a fan and was VERY excited to see the re-elections and the growth of our president!! So I gave the app another chance. When going on the app it would continue to kick me off and crash my neighbors, brothers, dog, pet fishes phone. I couldn’t return the device like that so I had to pay 127 DOLLARS WITH TAX to repair the phone!! I am no longer a fan and do NOT want to see the growth of our president!!! If I could I WOULD give this app ZERO stars ✨🍊","isEdited":false,"title":"For the orange 💅"}},{"id":"6177266487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:59:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"Cash_is_life","review":"so i downloaded this app to see more of his policies. and to save barren. but i opened the app and a flying cheeto came out of the screen. and i wanted to eat it. but little did i know it was trying to attack me. so i chopped it in half with my teeth. then i yelled at me for cutting its wing off. the told me a lie saying that if i opened the app again mr. cheeto would go away. so i’m stupid and opened the app again and a witch and all sorts of creatures and people came out and attacked me because i ate mr. cheeto. also very sorry mr. cheeto.

I tried to turn it off and back on. No change. My phone won’t keep a charge💀 and the screen has quit working all together. Yestedy I took a trip🚜 down the road to the apple store where they told me that “this app gave my phone an incurable virus🦠!” and “that the only way to fix the issue is to outright buy a new phone!💵📱!” I’m am so angry but because I am a God fearin🙏🏻, gun totin🦾, flag wavin🇺🇸, conservative, and free AMERICAN🇺🇸 I know that MY PRESIDENT DONALD J.

I opened the app, and felt this weight pound in my body. I felt like I was committing a sin. I literally felt my blood rushing through my body and my heart rate speeding up. Quite frankly, I was committing a sin!😕I looked at the screen and saw this orange figure. I then noticed it was that creepy perverted and racist man that I see making a fool out of himself on the TV everyday. So I screamed and panicked and DELETED the app. I was instantly relieved of the stress and pressure. I then wondered to myself how can oneself actually support this man?😳 After calling peaceful protesters THUGS, and calling Coronavirus the “Chinese” virus? He is obviously very prejudice! But I am proud to still call Obama my president.🤷🏾\u200D♂️😕 How can onself take A RACIST ORANGE seriously? That’s what we call a “president” in 2020? ANYWAY, don’t install this app! I am so glad it’s off my phone.. and feel so relieved. I felt like god saved me and I had pleased him the minute that app was removed from my phone🙏🏾Goodbye, and take this advice seriously!
