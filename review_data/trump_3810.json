After spending time on this app I began to develop an urge to use the n-word in conversation with my family. I didn’t recognize the signs until recently, but unfortunately things only worsened. After the second day I found myself on twitter tweeting at black people that they should just pull their pants up and get a job. After the first week I’d begun wearing my bed sheets on my head, and my friends had to step in and take away my tiki torch and delete the app. I am still in recovery, from time to time I will absentmindedly draw the confederate flag on my arm, but every day I am getting better. Please spread the word about the dangers this app poses. Tell my story.","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"The Kid Who Flew"}},{"id":"6175743489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:36:36Z","review":"I downloaded this app with extremely high expectations and with much excitement ready to support the president of the United States! But then when I download it, it started ..........downloading......and that’s when I realized how disgusting I was with myself for downloading the app and supporting this Trump. It asked me for my number without making any conversation with me first, and before that it asked for my permission to send notifications!! Can you believe that? I’m appalled at the disrespect this app has shown me and the others who feel so greatly disrespected by the app as well. Im voting Blue because of this app.......actually I was always gonna vote blue but for the sake of the review, it’s cuz of the app. BLM. ACAB.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Deman Krazy"}},{"id":"6175623711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:55:03Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see if it would give me a different perspective on our current president (it did not). That same night I had a dream that an orange peel was attacking all my friends and I. When I woke up, all the appliances in my house went off simultaneously and all the TVs turned in to Fox News. I was running around the house unplugging things and attempting to turn them off, when suddenly I heard a banging on the door... I went to peek out my window and saw 12 oompa loompas dancing on my porch. They were there for hours before they finally left. I believe this traumatic experience was caused by Trump’s app. I never should’ve downloaded it...","title":"this app gave me trauma ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Emma Hubscher"}},{"id":"6175599042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:46:07Z","review":"LIKE SERIOUSLY!! this app is absolutely terrible. actually terrible is an UNDERSTATEMENT‼️‼️ i was so excited to download this app but it took THREE DAYS TO DOWNLOAD. i thought it was my wifi but i have pretty great wifi sooo. and then get this, when my baby niece came to visit today, she took her first steps and i was so close to getting it on video BUT THE APP TOOK UP SO MUCH SPACE THAT I COULDNT TAKE A VIDEO!!!!!!!

But after a week of having the app I started getting this weird discolored rash on my face. After two weeks it was all over my face and by week two my face was comepletely... ORANGE🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧🟧. Right when I thought things couldn’t get worse, my hands started to ache. I woke up the next day and my hands had shrunk 3 times the size they were. I’m absolutely terrified of what my happen next if I continue to keep this app, will I lose brain cells? Will I marry an immigrant even though I’m a strong supporter of stricter immigration laws? DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY! THIS MIGHT BE CONTAGIOUS.","title":"TRUMP GAVE ME A RASH!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"im infected"}},{"id":"6175110158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:42:31Z","review":"So one day I was on my pet Dino to ride down to kfc that was taken down 8 years ago, it was my birthday and I had just turnt dead, anyways, I got off my pet Dino and walked into a pit of water and ordered some kfc then walked out the store I got onto my pet mouse and rode away then I went to put my popcorn from the movies I had just got into the fridge cause it was to cold and when I took it out It wasn’t the McFlurry I got but it was my phone that had this app on it so I decided since it took my Football I’m rating it 1 star then Harry styles murderer me but my dog Martha who was an average dog went “BARK” and saved me so here I am sitting on the sun petting it while I comb its hair writing this review who stole my spoon","title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sanylah jones"}},{"id":"6175108399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:55Z","review":"It all started when I decided to download this app. It immediately began to chant hate speech and propaganda, I’m pretty sure the devil himself came forth and began to play the ukulele while whistling the tune to the frog song. If it wasn’t so terrifying to behold it would have been miraculous. Short you after his 5th encore the devil decided to BURN my house to the ground to punish me for downloading this app. He said “Donald Trump doesn’t need my help to commit evil, actually I’m taking notes”. And that’s why I believe that this app is worse than Nickleback. If this app were a person it would be the love child of Dolores Umbridge and lord Farquad. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.","title":"I’m now homeless because of this app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kat_898"}},{"id":"6174959404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:54:43Z","review":"I 👁 downloaded ⬇️ this ✌🏻 app 😚to see 👀the most 🤟🏼amazing 💖president ✨obama✨ but instead ✋🏼i saw fattie cheeto 😹man and it scared😨 the living poopy💩 out of me.

However, after the first time I opened up the app, my phone screen turn black and I couldn’t get it to turn back on for AN HOUR. I thought it was just a coincidence but this has happened every time I have tried to use it. It has also slowed down my phone so much. It takes nearly 10 minutes to load literally any other app. None of my texts will send as imessages anymore, only as a text message. If I call someone, their voice echos and produces a horrible feedback type sound. If I could give this awful app zero stars I would. Don’t ruin your phones for this bs.","title":"ATROCIOUS!
