At first I noted the awful graphics, design, and content, but that was before things got weird. The app updated but would not reinstall. For weeks it was “loading.” I could not access it or remove it from my phone. Less than 24 hours after the app shut down I began receiving amazon packages that were ordered from my account. Although I hadn’t ordered anything besides a hat with grapefruits on it for a while, boxes upon boxes arrived at my doorstep all filled with MAGA cat sweaters. I do not even have a cat. It got worse. As the days went on, my lock screen was replace with moronic Trump quotes and the photos of me in my photo library suddenly appeared like I was head to toe in MAGA merchandise. Even my dog was wearing one of those awful cat sweaters. I am very uncomfortable with the havoc that this app has caused over the past few weeks. I do not know how to solve this issue, but I can assure I haven’t had any trouble like this with Democratic campaign apps. If anyone needs a cat sweater I would be happy to ship it to you.","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173655692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"phoebe/hanna baker","title":"horrid","review":"i was expecting to see our president but instead i was greeted by a fat orange with tiny hands 🤢😭😖 however when i saw the fat orange i almost pulled a hanna baker 🤢🥺 he would have been all 13 reasons why! 💕 i screamed bc i was in total shock by seeing such a vial creature that my great grandparents came back to life!!! we are now on our way to go beat the ugly orange 🍊 into a pulp if you would like to join hmu!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173655523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"UrgirlAT","title":"This app is trash 🗑","review":"With everything going on plus elections I wanted to educate myself but this app was just not the one.
