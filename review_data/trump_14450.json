My grandchildren Willy and Bob sadly support Kanye West 2020. I have bought 10 tickets for your next rally to prove how amazing you are!!! Sadly I will not be making it because I have to water my rock but I hope you do well. Also be sure that none of us will wear masks because Corona is obviously fake 🙄 \n-As a member of my fellow tiktok community, I believe it is a duty to leave a review for the POTUS, our one and only orange man 😌","isEdited":false,"userName":"TehKoolKid101","title":"donald trump 2020 ✨","date":"2020-07-06T19:25:34Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6165130757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I see all these stupid Gen Z children trying to ruin our poor president, but this app is an AWEFUL representation of our loving, gentle, sexy, sweet, kind, narcissist, respectful, brainwashing, intelligent, fascist, amazing, waste of space, president! He deserves more than bad reviews from incompetent children, but that being said I am giving this app a bad review to deal with my held away anger against the terrorists in our country! Trump 2020, but not on this app please.

Upon opening the app, it wants me to give Apple, a LIBERAL INSTITUTION my PRIVATE INFORMATION to support trump. How do I know the extremist liberals won’t take my information and pass it to Senator Samders? Additionally, the app wanted to send me notifications. EXCUSE ME? A REALLLL AMERICAN watches the news for his information like everyone else. \n\nThis app is clearly made by the extremist Far left who want to take away our rights. My phone very well may be bugged now. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.","isEdited":false,"userName":"AthenasOwl16","title":"SCAM!

I don’t know if I will ever recover and my therapy bills are incredibly expensive. I’ll probably have to start a go fund me just so my family can get by, and all because of a fat, ugly, racist, sexist, homophobic, islamaphobic, ableist, transphobic, and xenophobic Cheeto.","isEdited":false,"userName":"sav_fp7","title":"Please support me and my family in these troubling times","date":"2020-07-02T01:47:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6135550144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Omg. Absolutely HORRIBLEEE!!! When I opened the app, I started to vomit. After that, I cleaned it up and started having dang cramps!!! Then a bird flew in my window, and set my house on fire!! This app is cursed!! Absolutely cursed!! They really tried something when making this app!! I wish they put this much merch out for Obama but NOOO, Trump doesn’t deserve any of this!! This app, his merch, anything, he’s just an extra person and I HATE him for it!! 👁👄👁✨💀💀🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lili Reinhate","title":"This app is cursed and horrible.","date":"2020-06-29T11:30:19Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6134941820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was really looking forward to finally acquiring the app. Though the following days after the perchase  I was very disappointed. The app not only glitches but it caused my dogs hatred towards me. It pains me to say I will no longer be of need to this app in respect to my dog. It was really upsetting me n my homegirls ! I won’t miss the CONSTANT crashing of the app. I can genuinely say I won’t be downloading this app in the future.

As soon as I opened the app it immediately asked for my phone number and credit card information, and as a fellow supporter I submitted it with no questions asked. But OBVIOUSLY that was a mistake because I was bombarded with texts and calls asking me to donate to his rallies. This app should be taken down IMMEDIATELY!!!!\nSo now I am dedicating this song to my official president Barack Obama:  𝓇𝑒𝓂𝑒𝒷𝑒𝓇 🤔 𝓉𝒽𝑒 ✨𝓉𝒾𝓂𝑒𝓈 ⏳𝓌𝑒🤞🏾 𝒽𝒶𝒹 😪 𝓉𝒽𝑒 😭 𝓉𝒾𝓂𝑒𝓈 ⏰𝓉𝒽𝒶𝓉 🤥 𝓎𝑜𝓊 👧🏾 𝒶𝓃𝒹 😴𝓂𝑒 🧑🏾\u200D🦱𝒽𝒶𝒹 😰","isEdited":false,"userName":"Barron Trump |||","title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-06-29T04:25:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6134049765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I decided to download this app because I’m a trump supporter (duh) and i wanted to know the latest news. Plus share it with démocrates because ether are mentally ill. When I downloaded this app it crashed multiple times and made my house burn down. I cried so much I went to the hospital because I was dehydrated and a blood vessel in my eye burst. I DO NOT RECOMEMDED USE FOX NEWS INSTEAD. I could go on a rant of Fox News and how much I love it. Like it’s faux news, how could you not?","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cool amaz girl","title":"God awful","date":"2020-06-29T01:54:57Z","rating":1}}]}
