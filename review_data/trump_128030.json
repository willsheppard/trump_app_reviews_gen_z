It completely hacked my phone. I had to go to Best Buy and get a new one. It made my phone freeze up and crash like crazy!! Please don’t download this app! For the sake of your phone!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177242732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:12Z","userName":"jgutz50","title":"Worst App Ever!!!!!!","review":"This app runs horribly and took forever to download. Once I opened the app it required tons of sign-up information including name, email, phone number, and even ZIP Code, all information that is also required to make a TikTok account...... interesting right? This raises some concern as to what will happen to my data, I wanted to support our wonderful, intelligent, and SUPER supportive president but I don’t want my info in the wrong hands. ALSO I just noticed that this app uses my LOCATION even when I am not actively using the app, terrifying and a HUGE invasion of privacy. So, I strongly feel that this app should be removed from the app store in order to prevent the spread of users personal data without their knowledge!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177242036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:00Z","userName":"qt...iris._..essj","title":"THIS APP FARTED ON ME🤬🤬🤬","review":"IM OUTRAGGED ON HOW STINKY THE FART IS 🤬🤬so let me explain I downloaded the app thinking oh what a great app!

My own father called me and I didn’t know who it was because I had to delete all my contacts, pictures, apps, email - literally everything off my phone just for this one app. Even with everything else deleted, the app was so slow it took hours to load anything and kept crashing. I’m 99.99% sure it also gave my phone a bug because now I keep seeing outgoing calls I never made... Is the president trying to hack into our phones and personal information? It’s a good thing I deleted everything else!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
