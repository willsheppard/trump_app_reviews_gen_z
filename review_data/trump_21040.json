Now all that my phone does is chant “bunker boy”. I immediately had to delete this application due to the extreme migraine that this repeated noise caused me.

Finally I got my phone back up and running and then I opened the app and it crashed again, this time taking me weeks to get it to work.

Moments later my mom died from falling down the stairs and my pet dog ran away. After that a tornado occurred and blew my arm off.

It glitches and takes forever to download. Whenever I go on I see a disgusting person in the front screen and I don’t like seeing that. This app is the worst one I’ve ever seen. This app deserves one store due to the lack of effort to make it better. Honestly whoever has app is just a terrible person.","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:37:45Z","userName":"Lemmonylamb","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173474163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Worst app ever took days downloading I think that he should worry about his app instead of  trying to banned other apps plus I don’t get the point who wants to know about the terrible president he is.
