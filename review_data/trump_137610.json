I enjoy a lot of things in life but this app is not one of them.  Awful service, kept shutting off, couldn’t get past the loading screen.  It was awful and the aesthetics were as bad as the politics.  Hate patriotism not founded on anything but personal greed and capitalism.","title":"Downloaded and deleted.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"alannagfrank"}},{"id":"6179883965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:09:49Z","review":"AND ILL TELL YOU WHY\nSo to sum it up, I read the privacy policy right and the terms and conditions and what not because I didn’t like that they asked for my number right off the bat as a must. Like no. Excuse me. What’s that about? Anyway. I didn’t put in my number and instead opted to read the terms and conditions and I must say. Thing is SUS. And I was reading some of their reviews and they had problems with the app crashing and taking more of their information that most likely was not necessary. Point is, this app is hella shady and I definitely don’t recommend.","title":"THIS APP SUCKSSS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Ally2881404"}},{"id":"6179883934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:09:48Z","review":"I was looking to voice my support for Donald J Trump for president but the poor user friendliness along with the lack of an aesthetically pleasing interface left me with a poor experience and a sour taste in my mouth.
