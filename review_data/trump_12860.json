Trump is a free-spending, deficit-creating, anti-free trade no nothing who has slandered our intelligence establishment while heaping praise on the Russians while lying about knowing that the Russians have been paying bounties to kill coalition forces.  Shameful man and bad app.","title":"App has worthless content"}},{"id":"6094005323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-19T02:14:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":".wizzbusscutie","review":"there was sooo many ads i couldn’t even get to read anything!! some of the stuff were just lies over lies over lies!despite the fact that it was lying it asked for personal information and then it kicks you out of the app so half of the time i can’t even learn more about my president on that note it keeps glitching and glitching. i am literally disappointed in this app. i DO NOT RECOMMEND this app. by far the worst...","title":"this was HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6072097171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-13T20:08:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lawkaiti","review":"I downloaded this app to get a better understanding of Mr. Trump’s policies for the 2020 election and there must have been a glitch because every time I tried to click anywhere it kept redirecting me to another section of the app that has nothing to do with policies to help Americans. It even once redirected me to a page that offered tax advice for my business. I’m not happy with this app and will look for other app options for 2020 candidates.","title":"Misleading App"}},{"id":"6064729941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-11T23:11:12Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"h1ck3¥ Ł0v3","review":"I downloaded this as soon as I heard about it. I mean who wouldn’t want to support our dicta- I mean wonderful president. Unfortunately however, the application keeps lagging and crashing, and I realize the more this would happen, the more my skin would turn into this horrid hue of orange. Now I know it sounds bizarre to think the two issues correlate, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. So I’m removing this application from my celular device❤️ thanks.\n-H","title":"DO N0T DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6064123835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-11T19:06:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kaleigh226","review":"I downloaded this app on my old phone to support my lord and savior Donald J. Trump. However as soon as I downloaded it my phone got a virus!! At first I just started receiving lots of scam calls from different organizations supporting Trump. But then my phone began to bug out. Eventually I had to get a new phone because it got so bad. I will no longer be supporting Trump after researching other awful things his has done to his people! 😡","title":"Gives phone a virus"}},{"id":"6058810896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-10T12:51:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"anaetc","review":"Like I haven’t even signed in and they’re already asking if I’m under-age, like could you be any more obvious. Besides the point why is the first picture that comes up a picture of him naked, like how can anybody get past that point. I truly don’t understand how anybody finds that attractive. Anyways, I give this app one star not because I don’t like trump, but simply for the fact that........I don’t like trump. \nThank you.","title":"I don’t even know"}},{"id":"6053703853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-09T07:05:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Carly4U","review":"I can’t even begin to explain how absolutely horrible this app is. It’s like a cheap app that needs bugs fixed. Absolutely insane amount of pop ups, but not normal. It’s like pop up ads with this horrible obese man that has some sort of skin condition. Truly upsetting, I’ve never in my life felt assaulted by my phone until I got this app. Garish and poor quality. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! This data is probably going to China or Russia. Do not trust apps like these!","title":"The worst app"}},{"id":"6055316914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-09T15:46:40Z","rating":2,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ravenmarker","review":"The app was super glitchy and kept shutting down when I was trying to use it. I also didn’t like that they wanted all my information just to get access to the app. I was hoping for a platform where I could get real news updates about the campaign and events. Disappointed.","title":"Disappointed, I expected better quality"}},{"id":"6179206790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:11:28Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"dump trump😌","review":"To every trump supporter: I don’t like you or the orange you call “president”. I just wanted to say that this old ugly orange hasn’t protected this country, our value or citizens, instead he KNOWINGLY allows soldiers to be MURDERED. So, please use your brain for once and vote for the right person. This country will NOT survive four years with this dude. Also, cheese cheeto, you don’t run this country anymore, Gen Z does.🥰🧚✨💫 Btw this isn’t your land, you stole it and it’s time to give it back.","title":"trump🧚💫✨"}},{"id":"6179183113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:02:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Br120200","review":"Recently downloaded to give our ✨lovely✨president some support but when I tried to make an account it started asking for personal information such as address, social security, etc. Also right after I downloaded my phone started to glitch and freeze. This app just seems sketchy, wish I could give this app less than 1 star. Save yourself the time and don’t download. HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND!!","title":"trash app luv"}}]}
