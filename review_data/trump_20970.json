I also remembered that looking at anything related to Donald trump makes me feel physically ill, which is another major factor in me leaving such a review"}},{"id":"6174141639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":3,"title":"the worst app","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:46Z","userName":"jtsjgcljvludiej","review":"The most HORRIBLE app to ever download. that disgusting Cheeto was the first thing I saw. almost threw up too. be careful when you open the app. his hideous smile is the first thing you too.

Like many others I began experiencing glitches after downloading, as well as an onslaught of notifications, and the app violated my privacy settings by using my location services. This app is dangerous. Not a good app for 2020. Spreads misinformation and violates our rights. If I could give it 0 stars I would."}},{"id":"6174136805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"COMPLETE SCAM","date":"2020-07-08T23:38:58Z","userName":"0neD!rect!0nL()\\/3r","review":"I got this app expecting there to be actual news but all I got was weird internet conspiracy theories with no evidence to back it up. It asked for my information and it’s been searching me in the background. I have a suspicion this app is being used by spies saying it’s a trump app but all i saw was information about some orangutan. I’m so confused???"}},{"id":"6174124030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Doesn’t work","date":"2020-07-08T23:34:08Z","userName":"Monster Raiser","review":"Well the slogan says to keep America great, but that’s clearly not happening. I don’t understand how we’re getting closer and closer to fascism and this app isn’t solving anything. I just don’t understand. My poor America is fighting for her life, and this app has nothing to fix it. I tried to love this app, but this is the best review I could do. 🤷🏻\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174120569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T23:32:55Z","userName":"CarlieReviews","review":"I got this app to see what’s up, but you know what I saw?
