After creating my profile the app generated a 7 day cleanse that was supposed to be tailored to my specific health needs. I’m concerned because day one of my “personalized cleanse” called for 500 mg of hydroxychloroquine for breakfast, 8 oz of Fresh Scent Lysol for lunch, and a 10 oz well done steak with ketchup for dinner. As an average American, I’m no genius, but I feel this isn’t entirely legit. I decided to do some digging and it seems that this app is actually spam created by a Russian bot. 0 stars.","userName":"soawesomelike","title":"Harmful spam app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:51:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175286553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was disappointed to say at the least. As soon as i opened the app it asked for my number.. not about that. Also the app sends about 50 notifications a day. It got to the point it started slowing down my phone. My phone would start glitching then the power would drop down like 20% when i opened the app. My phone would start over heating and shut off. Every time my phone would shut off it would take AT LEAST an hour to come back on even if it was on the charger. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! NOT WORTH IT!!","userName":"bxyleexx","title":"TERRIBLE APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:45:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175217914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is hOrrible i went to a rally and everyone was throwing orange skin flakes from donald trumps face in my ear holes then the trumpets and pro nazi people were earning points by land them behind my ears afterwords the app spammed me with images of obama kissing sonic then i got my up adress sent to me while i was watching people at home depot by watermelons then in my sleep donald trump came into my house and sprinkled cheetos dust on my forehead and whispered bye bye boo boo now i'm cursed with sharpness IV from minecraft and the app forced me to talk to melanoma trump but now a deformed cheeto constantly follows me around","userName":"wackyjacky96","title":"ewewewewewewew","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:19:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175164283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello I put my debit card information to help donate to the trump administration and I started getting charges for pornography and xx small sized condoms?? It was crazy I had dispute the charges and call my capital one and explain to them that I was NOT xx small. After all of this I wasn’t even able to donate to the trump administration because after I put in my bank info and sent in a picture of my drivers license to “win cool rewards” I got denied because I wasn’t of Caucasian descent!

Apparently the app had leaked the orange’s n🥰d🥳🤩 and they were not pretty. Like supercalifraglisticexpialiadocous just let me burn my window in peace! All day I kept getting notification and my pet alligator got so annoyed he almost broke my phone. This app spreads so much fake news. It’s faker than Madison Beers nose! This app really wants to make me throw my phone out the window for the hippos and dinosaurs to eat.

It runs slowly and glitches ALL THE TIME. I was minding my own business, just trying to scroll through the app, when suddenly the big orange man summoned a horde of bees to come and eat me! The bees flew out of my phone and attacked me, leaving me injured and scarred for life. Plus, a man on the app kept contacting me and trying to get me to do the “Blue Whale Challenge.” It was crazy and incredibly offensive. On top of ALL OF THAT, demonic noises were coming from the app and they made me feel unsafe and depressed. This app is disgusting and I hope it gets deleted.","userName":"-Norjay-","title":"I HATE THIS APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174838664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래","userName":"daiyu song","title":"BAD APP, TRUMP DOESNT STAN TWICE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:18:40Z","isEdited":false}}]}
