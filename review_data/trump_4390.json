First it asks you to sign up and give up information that could be used to track you (on a very ugly set up as well). I think you should get rid of the boxes around text, and then the text while you’re at it. The pictures are very disturbing, there should at least be a disclaimer for that. The T on the app icon looks kind of chode-y, I guess it’s an accurate depiction however. Oh and you’re supposed to frequently check the terms of service? How boring is that? Anyway, terrible terrible job, I think you oughta be ashamed of yourself."}},{"id":"6173962034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:33:53Z","userName":"𝘮𝘪𝘳𝘢 ☔︎︎☕︎︎","isEdited":false,"title":"Not in my house 👁👄👁","review":"Just like every other god-loving trump supporter💪🇺🇸, I downloaded this app to support my president! I downloaded this on my son’s phone too. 💋👅\nThe app was fine at first, and I was HYPED for it. However, when I put in my number, all I got was SPAM! 😡 My phone kept buzzing with texts every five seconds. 📲🔊 My son’s phone too! Then we started getting tons of calls. Even when I texted STOP so I’d stop getting texts, they still kept coming! This app has been nothing but damaging. I’ve blocked over four numbers. I can’t stand this spam. ANYWAYS! I KNOW that This app needs a lot of work! 👁👃👁\nValuable Trump supporters like us DESERVE a good app 💪🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6173780580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:25:45Z","userName":"daddy snane dawsons cat","isEdited":false,"title":"STAN LOONA","review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

As if he’d ever get it from me 😡! i am MARRIED and have 5 children! Not to mention, they’re all under the age of 13!! Of course he’d want my number tho!! it’s for him to get to my children!!!!😡😡😡 But nothing but respect for my president☺️❤️. I just reserved 2 tickets for his campaign but i JUST forgot im shaving my dog’s legs that day :/ i can’t miss out! she’s got a cute date coming over! Overall, i would NOT recommend downloading this app unless your ugly want to support an 🍊president who did nothing good for our country!1!1!1 🤬"}},{"id":"6173559505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:06:20Z","userName":"1234557542947","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!","review":"This app is absolutely terrible. The second I downloaded it flaming lava started to spew out of my phone and it burnt my dog alive. Secondly, it attracted every single murder hornet in the world and they killed my family. Then all of the murder hornets vomited cockroaches in my bedroom and they started laying eggs in my ears. Then when those cockroaches hatched they spewed out of my ears and they took over my house.  Now I don’t have anywhere to live, my family is dead, and so is my dog. And if that’s not bad enough the cockroaches that spewed out of my ears went to my friends houses and ate their dogs and stuffed animals. This is 100% a true story and the whole world needs to hear this."}},{"id":"6173533504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:57:35Z","userName":"Sanda Tolopa","isEdited":false,"title":"IM OUTRAGED!!","review":"This is by far the WORST experience i’ve ever had upon downloading an app. At first when i downloaded it, everything seemed fine..WRONG. IMMEDIATELY AFTER OPENING I WAS ASKED TO PUT IN SENSITIVE INFORMATION SUCH AS MY HOME ADDRESS, FULL NAME, CREDIT/DEBIT CARD INFORMATION AND MORE!! It even had a MAP icon to see MY EXACT LOCATION VIA TRACKING!! If this isn’t a violation of my privacy as an AMERICA CITIZEN, i don’t know what is. CHILDREN COULD DOWNLOAD THIS AND BE EXPOSED TO SCAMMERS OR CREEPS!! I am completely OUTRAGED!!! My worst fear is that the people who have this downloaded will be victim to IDENTITY THEFT! I have even heard of other people that had this app downloaded say STRANGERS showed up AT THEIR DOOR THREATENING BLACKMAIL AND TO LEAK THEIR INFORMATION!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD, THINK OF YOUR FAMILY AND SAFETY FIRST!!! Blessed Be All 🙏"}},{"id":"6173516208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:32Z","userName":"JELLYK8","isEdited":false,"title":"⚡️Thunder started clashing⚡️","review":"I got this app to support our wonderfully small pe-handed president and immediately I heard cracks of thunder in the distance.  Trump appeared in my house and threatened my human rights but luckily he’s a coward and doing a singular tiktok dance was enough for him to ‘investigate’ the White House bunker and cry about me on the phone to his mom.  For those scared the president is after them, here are steps in the repent dance to scare him off:\n1) woah and clap\n2) create a figure eight\n3) do a wave\n4) perform the X formation\n5) put hands up in front of you\n6) swing your arm and snap\n7) lean to the front, side, and back\n8) push outwards 3 times\n9) snap twice and dab \n10) swing your arm and cover your face while rolling it back\n11) push your hands outward and breath out\n12) pop your hips\n13) put all steps together to form a dance\nDoing this or any other tiktok dance will scare the Trump and his Trumplings.  They feel threatened by teenagers dancing and practicing freedom of speech.  Black lives matter, stay safe fellow gen z 😚✌️🧚\u200D♀️✨✨✨"}},{"id":"6173514584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:00Z","userName":"tik tok fun","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s a bad app 👁👄👁🤚🏼✨","review":"This app is horrible! Absolutely horrible! It took at least 3 WHOLE HOURS just download!! I heard of this app and I just HAD to download it! But it’s absolutely horrible! When it was finally done downloading it showed a orange 🍊 and it was singing the ABC’s and I was outside feeding my dogs then my dogs started to chase me!! It was absolutely horrible! I almost got bit by one of them! Plus three men came up to me and said “RATE THE APP 5 STARS!” Then I put dramatic music and started to do karate 🥋 and ofc I won but I was so scared at the end I think I pooped my pants no kidding 🤧😤 a very scary experience! Then I deleted the app and everything went back to normal! 🥳🤚🏼✨"}},{"id":"6173499590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:53Z","userName":"GamerGuuuuuurrrrlllll63","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app!","review":"everytime i opened it, it got frozen showing me false news, and promoting unjust actions. this app is so terrible. i personally think that tiktok is a much better and more enjoyable app. tiktok has helped me to learn about issues that this app doesn’t tell me about. tiktok helped me develop a great sense of humor. tiktok has shaped who i am today. to think my younger sister won’t have the chance to see other girls with her body type online, to realize that she’s not alone, to feel like she’s a part of something just from an app. that’s terrible! tiktok is the only thing that has brought me joy. this app just simply brings me such disgust. blm, acab, ft✨"}},{"id":"6173488292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:02Z","userName":"PeevedGirl","isEdited":false,"title":"I wanted this app to be good","review":"Like most of the fine users of this app, I would dive off a cliff if Trump asked me to, but he never would because I am white. As soon as I downloaded this app my phone started going crazy and I swear I saw a child with blue hair show up on my screen for a second. More and more strange things began to happen like seeing an ad that said “Black Lives Matter” and they replaced the “All” with “Black”. I don’t believe my president would ever advocate for rights of people who aren’t white! I think this app is personally ran by a bunch of those children who have been brainwashed by tiktok and not their president!\n\nyou, reading this: 👁👄👁"}}]}
