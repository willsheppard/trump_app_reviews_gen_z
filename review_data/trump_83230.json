I had such high hopes for the all mighty one. But the app took almost 2 hours to load! Absolutely unacceptable. That’s just the beginning, the first image I see when opening the app (finally) was Trump’s new logo! Appalling to see us revert back to Nazi Germany’s logo and propaganda. After taking a minute to collect myself I clicked away from the image and saw a video of a Trump rally. Not bad at first but later in the video, it showed Trump supporters! That alone is horrible but the Trump supporters proceeded to say horrible things about Bernie Sanders. They all simultaneously took out fishing poles to refer to Mr. Sanders as “fishy.” After about a day of having the app I started to get people coming up to my house and putting up Trump signs and trying to get me to join their cult. I’m not joking, they literally told me to join their cult for Donald Trump. Of course I said no, but then Michael Cohen himself came to my home and tried to persuade me to evade my taxes like he did. Both of these instances were 3 hours apart! And to wrap all of this up, the app broke my phone. My phone is currently on fire and I am writing this on my 20 year old flip phone. I would hope for compensation but if trump won’t even spend money on basic human rights, I doubt he will pay me for my phone. Besides that whole fiasco, I do NOT recommend this app. My heart goes out for the rest of these kind hearted individuals having a hard time with this app ❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Very sad...","date":"2020-07-09T21:43:05Z","userName":"561amm07"}},{"id":"6178341213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"horrible app that I hate.

I started to see writing on my wall that said “trump for president” and “trump 2020.” whatever. not the point but it kinda is. I continued to scroll through this app to get more 🍊educated🍊 and I started to feel very dizzy, nauseous, and my vision went blurry. i went to my kitchen to get some water and suddenly I heard voices in my head telling me to do racist and sexist things. it didn’t make sense to me because I am a woman who supports black lives matter and will always support the movement. while I was still conscious, I went back onto the app to see my screen turn orange and the presidents 🍤nudes🍤 were on the screen. I was APPALLED.  I deleted the app instantly and ran to my school, broke in, and ran to my science room where I could use the emergency eye wash station, which is typically used if someone gets toxic chemicals in their eyes. I told my family and they want to send me to EXTENSIVE therapy, but the therapist that specializes in 🧚\u200D♂️trumpnudephobia🧚\u200D♂️ charges 100 DOLLARS per session. I do not recommend this app unless u want similar experiences😖💅","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸... but on a gravestone 💅✨🧚","date":"2020-07-09T21:40:16Z","userName":"julia.77"}},{"id":"6178332996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so poorly organized I’m surprised all the racist boomers can operate it.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"FxckTrump","date":"2020-07-09T21:39:20Z","userName":"Antifa Scum"}},{"id":"6178312602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I think it shouldn’t be in the App Store","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is bad","date":"2020-07-09T21:31:39Z","userName":"genegjenejrrj"}}]}
