In MY house!! 🏠I think they were chanting something about ‘Our orange man shall rise’ Idk it’s hard to say😩 It is still a very sensitive topic for me. I am terribly traumatized ☹️☹️ Not to mention my phone may have a virus now. Better put a mask on it from now on🦠","title":"Alienssss 🍊👄🍊","userName":"fjshajoaowjw","date":"2020-07-08T18:31:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173272258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this and it took a month to completely download. When it did, it asked for my name. I thought nothing of it, but then I started getting text messages saying they got my IP address and asked “is this you?” That really shivered me timbers! A week later, a Jeep truck 🤢 parked in front of my house with a Trump flag. They came out with a SNIPER! They aimed at my bedroom window and SHOT MYDOG AND THEN THEY CAME INSIDE AND RIPPED OUT A CHUNK OF MY GRANDMA’S HAIR!! This app SELLS YOUR INFORMATION! UNSAFE","title":"Bugbrain","userName":"B. lives matter","date":"2020-07-08T18:28:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173266123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was utterly terrible. It took a month to load onto the main page and then when I finally got there I had to sign into something which was downright outrageous. I am Appalled that someone even came up with this idea let alone  actually make it an app. I think that this app should be deleted. Nobody should have to witness this.","title":"Make this app great again","userName":"hippopopppppoooo","date":"2020-07-08T18:26:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173265228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely awful application never works and it took forever and I mean forever to download. When I went in I want to buy something cool to support the Trump team but whenever I did it showed me nothing but explicit things and I cannot have that. I will not be supporting Trump for 2020. This app should be deleted from the App Store because of this horrendous marketing tactic.","title":"Awful app 😡🎃","userName":"MerelyAGhost","date":"2020-07-08T18:26:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173240815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is HORRIBLE. When i opened the app the music that played hurt my ears and i am now deaf.  Once I became deaf, i couldn’t hear when my mom tripped over my mouse that lives in the walls and now she is blind. Also my mouse is dead. Also the support for the 🍊🥐hurt my eyes so much that i’m blind too. The orange croissant literally did this to me so this app gets a one start review. Also ARREST THE COPS THAT KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR!!!!","title":"rrrroll✨up🚁to🤞🏾the👄party🥳in😫my😏crazy😋pink👹wig❤️","userName":"AwesomeBagel","date":"2020-07-08T18:18:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173190683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I was downloading the app it started to make my  phone glitch , then my phone started playing horrid music it was terrible when it finally downloaded on my phone it took sooooo longgg to download .

I opened the app and it didn't even allow me to type in an email instead of phone number. Which was really upsetting. This app needs to be removed ASAP. This app is also a terrible example for kids. This app is very inappropriate and unacceptable. Kids will not learn anything good from this app AT ALL. Take this off the app store.","title":"Worst app on the appstore","userName":"Funniest out of them all","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173112507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First it took 18/20 hours to download and my WiFi is AMAZING and it kept singing chicken wing chicken wing and my children were trying to sleep it also stole all my info and turned it into a picture to show my dead grandma, overall the app is horrible and Donald trump is a racist a rapist and a sexist man so um anything BUT trump for 2020\nThanks!

The majority of the customers within the Apple community are against what this app states. We did it disrespectful for those who want to stay loyal to the Apple store and it’s services. However leaving apps like these that encourage racist acts against anyone’s who isn’t “white” is disappointing due to the high standards Apple is known for.","title":"horrible app","userName":"khhdjjfhjv","date":"2020-07-08T17:19:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173053708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is trash took over four hours to download and then still didn’t work properly.
