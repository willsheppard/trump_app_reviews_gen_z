This burnt Cheeto guy was looking at me...IT WAS SCARY!! Then it asked me for my phone number and I hated it even more! Why would you ask for someone’s personal phone number?? Wow Trump talk about invading and stealing people’s personal stuff. Then it says “Make America Great Again”...great again my ass.

Have a great day everyone.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6177526678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:15:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"clownnfacee","review":"I waited two whole months! To get this to finally download this piece of sh*t! Then it had the audacity to hack into my phone like?!?! What!??! It was absolutely infuriating, this stupid had the audacity to replace my boyfriend enormous, voluptuous, gigantic, monument, monster shlong penis! With Donald Trump croissant of a penis. I became blind✨🦋🧚🏼\u200D♀️🌈💫I was in shock, in tears almost! It’s upsetting me and my homegirls! Then it started glitching like it kept saying I was texting him when I clearly hadn’t texted anything?! Ridiculous. As well for my phone freezing non stop, I had to restart my phone multiple times, and the crazy part is...I CANT DELETE THE APP I’VE BEEN TRYING FOR THAT PAST 10739 HOURS!

He should not have any platform that shows support to him. He is a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic cheeto jerk that needs to be kicked out of the white house. What a waste for the app store. Since it is a waste why not just delete it! Thanks and oh always remember  Donald Trump is a white supremacists IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM YOU ARE A WHITE SUPREMACIST! This app is just eating away at my brain cells because Trump has sucked way too much out this stolen land he calls America. He is the little bunker b*tch who is so senile he should just be put down.
