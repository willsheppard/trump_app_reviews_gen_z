It screamed at me when I opened it and told me if I didn’t vote for trump I’d be banished to the netherworld. Idk if it was some kind of sick prank or joke for the presidents amusement but it wasn’t funny. Definitely not going to help his campaign. Also about 3 hours after I downloaded it I was scrolling through it and I started internal bleeding and coughing up blood. It’s definitely cursed. DONT INSTALL","title":"Review","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:25:43Z"}},{"id":"6173369912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"donald pmurt","review":"I opened the app the this orange dude came up to my screen and started reaching for me. I clicked away but then it started yelling at me and a it breath stank. Then I went to take a poo poo and my phone turned on and started walking to that beathroom. When I saw my phone it had orange leges and corn like hair. I had to uninstall it immediately. If there were a -♾ star I would have chose that. But yeah do not download this app. Thank you","title":"All countries matter","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:01:07Z"}},{"id":"6173312355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"trumpet1247","review":"This took forever to download and it took up almost all of my storage. When I opened the app it was glitching terribly and the there was also a dorito looking man on the front of it. To make things worse this app gave my phone so many viruses I’m probably gonna have to get a new phone. All the trumpets were absolutely screeching about this app but I don’t get the hype.

I was so engrossed with the app that all I could say was “Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump”. she kept trying to talk to me throughout the day but I would just respond with “Donald Trump”. She got so fed up and infuriated with my behavior, that she filed for divorce and took custody of the children. Now I’m living sad and alone because of the Donald Trump app.","title":"RUINED MY MARRIAGE","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:14Z"}},{"id":"6173241590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"stay frosty ya dig🥶","review":"This is probably One of the worst apps I’ve  ever used all I wanted was to see more information about our president and his campaign and details about the rally but it took two weeks to download, took up so much space on my phone and had nothing I was looking for this is the worst app I’ve ever used I think you should construct it so that it’s easier to use. You definitely lost my vote Mr. Trump","title":"Thumbs down","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:18:26Z"}},{"id":"6173239478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"dhdbsnsn","review":"I download this app to see what all the hype was about, but a few days after I downloaded it Donald showed up in my dreams threatening to break my nose I cried and woke up and Donald was standing over me with James Charles signature makeup look on his face. I screamed and used my ninja abilities to kill him and when he died his body disintegrated and turned into a bunch of rats that scattered away. I wish I never downloaded this Monster of an app. 💔","title":"The app also tastes bad","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:17:44Z"}},{"id":"6173235867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Bobby boy '67","review":"I was excited about this app.  A great way to be more in touch with our president, I thought.  I was wrong.  This took hours to download even though I had great WiFi.  Once opened, it made my phone glitch and lag SO bad.  The app crashes every two minutes, too.  I can’t even look at it for a few seconds without a glitch.  I’m very disappointed to say the least.","title":"Disappointing","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:16:30Z"}}]}
