She said it was tacky and my face would stick like that–oh wait, that was crossing my eyes. Oh, you know what I mean. So, I may have promised I would never hate someone–but I was wrong. I really hate you.\n\nI hate you the way a rat hates cheese. Wait, a rat really loves cheese. Maybe I hate you the way power rangers hate alien traps. Yeah, that’s it.\n\nIn fact, I think I hate you more than my mom hated the word hate.\nI hope this doesn’t make you too sad, because I think if you dig down deep– in the ground... a goood 6 feet you’ll discover you belong in the graveyard. So, now that our mutual disdain for one another is out there, you can leave the office now.           **debbie rayan face**","date":"2020-07-09T09:31:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Kate🙈"}},{"id":"6175864208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tan a man","review":"this app is unspeakable horrible. if you guys hate your phone dying fast DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD. not only is it draining my battery so rapidly, it also slows down my phone. it’s gotten unbelievably annoying and I think this app, along with trump will need major IMPROVEMENTS. this app is completely useless and has no right to reserve an app on the App Store. i suggest Apple take this app down ASAP for everyone’s enjoyment. i love you all, just not trump, his supporters, and this app ❤️🙈✨\nAND if trump wants to be happy please stream “be happy” by Dixie d’amelio 🧚🏼✨\nBYE CHEETO 🧡😡🦐🍊","date":"2020-07-09T09:17:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no."}},{"id":"6175679281","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"svtjcthn","review":"i downloaded this app with high expectations and was very disappointed. as soon as the app finished downloading i got a ft call from the PRESIDENT himself. he told me if i didn’t steal a child and throw it off of my roof, he would have me exterminated. i didn’t listen ofc and an hour later i got a knock on my door. as soon as i opened the door trump flew in and slammed me on the ground. then he drop kicked my dog and threw us both in a sack. luckily, i escaped but i cant say the same for everyone else. i wouldn’t recommend downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-09T08:14:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6175666542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i miss my koala","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app it took a few days to download as soon as I opened the app it told me they were gonna kid nap my pet koala names lags and they seen me and my partner making out for an hour and no movement and laughed at me they said air ball in a sarcastic tone and sure thing my pet koala goes missing my poor lags his mom called me and I had to give her the news then she went missing and now they have lags and his mom  mrs gags I’m hurting deep so don’t download or they will take your koala regardless of its name BTW el chapo 2020","date":"2020-07-09T08:10:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Tracker app"}},{"id":"6175613843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ABSOLUTE MF GARBAGE","review":"dude this app is legit garbage . I am 100% a trump supporter but c’mon man you gotta do better . it literally took 3 hours to download and when i opened it, it crashed IMMEDIATELY . I feel like this app was made by libtards because the quality is ABSOLUTE TRASH , no republican would make such a GARBAGE quality app . I am angry because they felt the need to disrespect my country and president by making such a GARBAGE APP . apple store needs to delete it RIGHT AWAY!!! they’re probably stealing information from us because that’s all libtards like to do . 1 STAR FOR FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6175597347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"WAVYYE","review":"I read a lot of reviews and I was like let me see what all this fuss is about.. so I download it open the app and my phone starts to glitch!! I turned my phone off and back on again and went to the app and it happened again. So I tried to turn it on and off again and it didn’t let me !! I had to buy a new phone unfortunately. $1,000 dollars down the drain !! Horrible app . My friend downloaded it as well and said the same thing happened to him. Horrible!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:45:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE DO NOT GET IT!!"}},{"id":"6175561417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"burntchickentender","review":"This is app is absolutely horrific. My friend and I ended up getting fried as chicken tenders. We where just casually laying on the couch watching old barbie movies when he decided he was SO hungry. He came into my house with human sized deep fryers and threw us in, but not without a fight. We managed to get his arm in it while we were going in. So, if you see him wearing a long sleeve shirt you will no why, he is no longer orange, but is now crispy. This app is promoting it. Don’t make the mistake of downloading this app unless you want to be a chicken tender.","date":"2020-07-09T07:32:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"}},{"id":"6175533808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"foooooooooooooooodddddddd","review":"if i could i would if gave it 0 stars tbh i hate this app it glitch so much u could not do anything 😞😭 it hurt my eye to see trump now im half blind his yellow hair scared my sister 😭 she is not scared of the colore orange 🤢and my brother got scared of his ugly face he cry and not to say it took 3 months to Download and 15 days not ok apps should de fast not slow my phone screen got crack when i got the app 😭i had to pay to get it fix just bc of the stupid app😣 plz dont get this app take it offfff so no one has to get there screen cracked 😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T07:22:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVEERRR"}},{"id":"6175186400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"💕🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","review":"Extremely disappointed in the quality of this app. First of all the app did not wear a mask. We are in a global pandemic, and I found it selfish that this app would put me at such risk. Secondly I feel that it would make more sense if the app represented the future of our country and used our new national colors of black and yellow. The lack of manny (our nations symbol) was astonishing. All in all this app has caused trump to lose my vote. If he can’t run a successful app how can he run a country?","date":"2020-07-09T05:08:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"How can he run a country if this is his app?"}},{"id":"6175143831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"poiu098123","review":"i love trump and had to get this to support him and keep up but more and more specifically after this download i began having more and more problems with my phone it wouldn’t close out of this app i would be stuck on my home screen and i would restart my phone at least 2 times a day i’m only leaving this type of review out of of hope mr president will see this and make efforts to fix his app for his fans but my hopes are low considering his low star rating","date":"2020-07-09T04:53:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This APP RUINED MY ENTIRE PHONE"}}]}
