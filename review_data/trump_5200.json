To no surprise, as soon as I opened the app, a picture of our President showed up. This was terrifying and left me scarred, as the picture was not flattering... I then proceeded further into the app, But the app kept shutting down. It constantly closes out, and it never stays open on my phone for more than a second. This might be user error, but I think the Trump team should get on that problem just in case it isn’t. In sum, this app is not worth it to download.","title":"If I could give 0 stars, I would","userName":"Kyle Pancake","date":"2020-07-08T23:33:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174049240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app made my phone grow legs and run away. After running after it for a while it turned around and slapped me on the head and told me that the whole reason this is happening was because I downloaded the app. I asked why The app did this whole thing and my phone and responded with “I mean who downloads the Donald Trump app anyways“. So after the whole thing I had to get a brand new phone and when my phone came to life it deleted everything on my phone so I also had to make new accounts to all of my apps. so in conclusion don’t download this app please it’s for the best.","title":"DO NOT GET!!!!!!","userName":"wecufjdgchvidjsjgj","date":"2020-07-08T23:06:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174042385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the sir trump was on the front page of the app and almost made me throw up 🤢, it brought me back to when i saw his naked orange and yellow body 🤒😷 just seeing this app and trying to work it confused me because i couldn’t even believe to think anyone would want to see the bs i saw i now think i have to bleach my eyes, continuing on to was this man is like the perverted dad that could never be trusted and ESPECIALLY this country no one should be listening to a guy that tried messing with china and talks like he is going to have a stroke at all times i might just have to give myself corona.","title":"Absolutely awful app","userName":"popbotle🥱","date":"2020-07-08T23:04:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174041871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got this app because i thought it was the wonderful, amazing, and inspiring app called tiktok (i suffer from dyslexia😔). i had an unfortunate, and quite traumatic awakening when i saw the oompa loompa shaped cheeto puff himself (aka bunker boy🧚🏼✨🦹\u200D♀️🦧) right when i clicked on the app. i could just smell the mustyness coming from his toupee as well as his double chin. i have experienced these symptoms before and i quickly closed the app before i had been exposed for too long. i am so grateful that i survived this experience. sadly, i accidentally shared this app with my little brother and he opened it just a few minutes after i had. he wasn’t aware of the danger that he was in and i rushed into his room when i heard his bloodcurdling scream... but it was too late. he had stared at the crusty orange skin for too long and his eyeballs fell out of his sweet, tiny head. don’t download this app if you don’t want the same fate as my little brother. rip bro😭","title":"no❤️","userName":"all apps matter👨\u200D🎨🧜\u200D♀️😻","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174019186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has scarred my children for life. I am a loving mother of 4 from Alabama named Karen who just wanted to show her kids who they should be worshiping. So I downloaded this app on their iPads so that they knew who we supported and they could study up on our extreme conservative beliefs and make sure they don’t form pesky opinions of their own. But alas, when the app opened, it glitched and crashed, shutting off our phones, and making it so that when we turned it on, there was a picture of the the president without clothes. We all had to buy new phones and iPads. I am... disgusted. Never buy this app.","title":"Scarred for life","userName":"Peaches eldoggo","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174008706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"oh this app is absolutely terrible. when i first opened the app it sent a blast of 30+ notifications to my phone and my phone had to power off. once my phone turned on, my security app notified me that i had A VIRUS!! coincidence? I think not. the format inside the app was atrocious! i couldn’t find any useful news information, there were just a bunch of photos of this orange troll. seems a bit narcissistic to me. this is by far the worst app i’ve ever had. my phone had to be in repair for 4 days to be repaired! i wouldn’t recommend this app even to my worst enemy.","title":"such a terrible app, IT GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS!","userName":"- Jeffrey Epstein","date":"2020-07-08T22:51:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174000674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app thinking that i could educate my family (including my dog) about our president. As I was doing so my dog had this disgusted look on his face that we haven’t seen before. I exited the app and he suddenly looked fine. I then got back into the app and my dog left the room. Later we found him laying on the ground dead in the kitchen. We think the cause of death was that he was seeing to much stupidity from the app making him lose enough brain cells for him to die. Don’t download this app unless you want a dead dog on your hands. RIP Marshmellow, you will be missed.😔","title":"this app is a no - caused death to my dog","userName":"a non trunp","date":"2020-07-08T22:48:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173992595","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to help my Guinea pig because he likes Cheetos and I need him to stop eating the. What I wasn’t expecting was all the GLITCHES!! I tried clicking buttons and it brought me to pics of an old orange man. Some were very disturbing like the one where the Cheeto man gets a spray tan and he has the tiniest dipping sauce attached to him!! The glitchy buttons also brought me to more glitches of the same man giving speeches to some of his friends in a giant room where the wiggles had a full audience! Even I have more friends! To conclude this Cheeto app is not what you think and I recommend it go to hell! Hopes this helps!! 💕💕","title":"Just stop","userName":"brobrochillysauce","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173874648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took way too long to download and when it finally did I couldn’t watch anything other than that and then I saw a big orange  person on my screen and it scared me so much I threw my phone and it cracked so I had to get a new screen. But that’s not all after I saw this big person my mom got mad and me because she got a notification that this app was making my phone bill higher so she made me delete it but when I tried to it would let me. This app definitely deserves a one start, not what I expected at all. So disappointed in the orange man in the suit.","title":"Disappointment","userName":"hmsndndns","date":"2020-07-08T22:01:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173825768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app RUINED MY LIFE. so i downloaded the app which takes forever by the way, after i got it i opened it and for some reason it connected to my cars bluetooth. so basically my car went CRAZY 😜. it drove by its self promoting white supremacy by blaring blue lives matter on the radio. the app added a racist bug to every thing i own. but wait there’s more. my car went to the mexican boreder and ordered everyone to LEAVE. my car drove all the way to china 🇨🇳 and blamed them for everything the president 🍊failed at doing. i FINALLY got my car 🚙 back once i deleted the app. NEVER GET THE APP ITS FULL OF RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, SEXIST bugs 🐜 😡","title":"🍊👄🍊","userName":"okokokkokok","date":"2020-07-08T21:43:06Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
