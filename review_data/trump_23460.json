But this app does not meet my satisfaction and whenever I open the app it kicks me out and when I try to go back, my phone completely blacks out. I thought it was hacked but it‚Äôs not.

But when I opened the app my phone started glitching and I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a virus now and my fruit bowl ran away idk where but it‚Äôs gone.

I open it and it only presents a plain white screen so I delete and redownload and open the app to CHILDREN PORN!!! I can‚Äôt believe this was allowed I am absolutely disgusted.

My generation believes that the government should not control the citizens. Too many notifications, hard to read, fake news even on the TRUMP APP. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. He should be ashamed of making a faulty app that has failed the U.S. just like he has failed us in other ways- former Trump supporter.","title":"Inconvenient","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen56782020","rating":1}},{"id":"6125142326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-26T18:55:22Z","review":"This app was horrible. As soon as I downloaded I started to receive monthly deliveries of Cheeto puffs with Trump‚Äôs face on them. I did not sign up for this delivery service, yet these Cheeto Puffs came in by the thousands. PLEASE HELP. The deliveries have not stopped. We have run out of kitchen space and each room in my house now has a Cheeto Puff designated corner. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

SMH ü§¶\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è, I really thought I would get to see the GRANDIOSE trump in action but it started glitching and showing things like ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúsexist‚Äù and I just couldn‚Äôt take anymore of those DEFINITELY NOT TRUE f-fa-fakü§Æ news.","title":"A true masterpiece of horror","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lizdeny7","rating":1}},{"id":"6106759615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-22T04:06:54Z","review":"This app isn't helpful at all in informing me of anything. If i google trump events or was on his emailing list, id already get all this info. All the news is bias and many of the segments are easily disproved with a google search. He just wants your location and info. Its kinda ridiculous","title":"Literally terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ford.Gun.America","rating":1}},{"id":"6072180224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-13T20:43:06Z","review":"I would‚Äôve given a better review, but I was honestly hoping it was going to be like one of those Kardashian apps where he gives us exclusive videos into his daily life. What are his favorites for the month of May? What self tanner does he use for that Cheeto Orange??

The worst part is the developer‚Äôs spelling and grammar: It says ‚Äúkeep America great‚Äù but they misspelled Amerikkka :/ would give zero stars if I could.","title":"Too many glitches, kept crashing","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cuhristee","rating":1}}]}
