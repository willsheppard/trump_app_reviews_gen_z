It takes forever to move on prompts. It‚Äôs unpleasing to the  eye and not intuitive. It‚Äôs as if it wants you to become irritated while using it. DO NOT download. You can still support President Trump without using this app."}},{"id":"6176359621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nahfdjxnv","date":"2020-07-09T11:52:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRENDOUS üò°üò°üò°üëø","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app my fingers have been smellling like dookie and it‚Äôs really bothering my family because they won‚Äôt allow me to wipe anymore when I got to the bathroom due to the app malfunctioning I cannot believe the Apple store allowed this abomination on the App Store that‚Äôs just.... just...

Then it told me that if I agreed then I will get calls and messages abt trump. Like you telling me that for me to use the app I have to listen to people talk trash!!!! No thank you!

He is still currently, saying he will let me go if I leave a five star review. I will not do such a thing, even if it costs me my life. so with that being said, this app is terrible and deserves to be deleted off of the App Store."}},{"id":"6176292825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"literallyanyone2020","date":"2020-07-09T11:33:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible. Did not perform as promised","review":"I downloaded the trump 2020 app expecting it to direct me to the nearest public toilets, and frankly, it did not deliver. Instead it kept directing me to the White House for some reason. And for some reason it kept sending me weird, racially charged messages. Would not recommend."}},{"id":"6176245213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"6272772$.","date":"2020-07-09T11:19:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO. NOT. BUY.

A lot of pop ups and ads asking for you to purchases add ons. The ads get annoying. The first version was way better.
