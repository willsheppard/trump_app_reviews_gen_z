Alas, my allergy towards Cheetos has prevented me from supporting him in person and I believed this app would be the closest thing possible to that wonderful experience. Unfortunately, it was not 😔. I was approached by the Cheeto, 🍤 and all. This led to me having a seizure right there on the sidewalk. I blew up to the size of a walrus and continued to shake uncontrollably on the ground. The Cheeto continued trying to wake me up, his attempts were everything but beneficial as he was the cause of the seizure in the first place. He caused me to swell furthermore, resulting in me being air lifted to the hospital, where I am currently writing this review. In conclusion, I do not recommend this app for anybody with a shrimp or Cheeto allergy. Actually, I don’t recommend this app for anybody.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174475072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:32:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Melania & Barron Started Sending SOS Messages Immediately","userName":"Al Moray","review":"I got this app just a few minutes ago to widen my political views and stay updated for the upcoming election. However, mere seconds after downloading the app, I started receiving SOS messages from both Melania and Barron Trump. They are nonstop and have me very concerned for their wellbeing as residents in the White House. My phone barely works due to all the messages being sent to my phone. Would not recommend this app, unless you want your phone’s working ability to decrease considerably. As a side note, my dog has also begun levitating. I read some reviews before getting this app, and saw some problems with others’ pets as well. Still, I went through with it and got the app. This was definitely a mistake on my part. Again, would NOT recommend.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174462355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:29:00Z","rating":1,"title":"an😗he👨ill🤒he👨bill💵he👨might🤔got🤲a👀bill💵he👨bop🎶p","userName":"Betunia_","review":"Oh my god I’m SHAKING 😠😠RIGHT NOW😫😫😫😫 PEDO TRUMP🤨🤨EXPLAIN TO ME NOW💔💔💔 WHY I HAVE GONE😭😭😭LEGALLY BLIND😏😏💯💯AFTER💨DOWNLOADING THIS☹️☹️IM HURT💯SHAKEN😐DISAPPONTED😿BETRAYED!

I made the mistake of opening the app in front of my younger sister who has not turned to dust and sits on a vase. The app is not kid friendly , or friendly for anyone for that matter . The content in this app is extremely explicit - revealing unsightly photographs of a orange powdered potato sack wearing sheep’s fur and impersonating a goat . It is very hard to watch and I would feel much better if this badly tanned goat and his app were simply removed so that no one will have to experience the torture that comes after downloading . He still haunts my dreams , and whispers to me “You fired.” It’s making me sick to my stomach as I write this . Please do us all a favor and get this app demolished before its seen by too many .","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174113832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:30:27Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible! Fearing my life!","userName":"Pinkzebra131","review":"I got this app to be aware of what was happening and the next thing you know my phone blew up! My phone was working completely fine, it was the latest iPhone never had any problems with it! After I got the app and opened it up my phone began to act weird and out of nowhere it blew up! My grandma had possibly an even worse experience! She downloaded the app and when it asked for her location she allowed it, and a few hours later some men in black suits came to her door threatening that if she didn’t vote for trump she wouldn’t live any longer and she’d be terminated and they sped away in their black Escalades with “Trump 2020” plastered all throughout it! Not to mention I’m traumatized from all the fake news spewed in this app and will have to go to therapy for the rest of my life!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174019548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:55:35Z","rating":1,"title":"This volume inside of this app is wayyyyy too loud🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🌟💔🤠","userName":"Crazzychik15","review":"I wanted to learn abt politics but then a Cheeto with fake hair popped up on my screen. I was like WOAHH there bud🤭🤢😔😔. Then he started talking abt something named “mawa” that stands for make America white again. Flat out racist💯💯. So I kept scrolling and it turns out he was a BILLIONAIRE🤭!!! Which surprised me bc he wanted this “wall” to keep every POC out of America and wanted Mexico to pay for it when he could’ve paid for it himself. Once again ~R A C I S T~ but anyways I was still trying to understand what his message was and then I find out HES PRE🤢🤢 PRESI🤢🤢 PRESIDENT OF THE US??!??!? Who let this Cheeto in bro???? (Rumor has it hes a 🍤🍤 iykyk) AND HE HAS ANOTHER CHANCE TO BE RE-ELECTED??? Seriously I can’t believe this shrimp Cheeto racist sexist homophobic person is the “face” of America. Remember kids a vote for Kanye is a vote for trump. #learnurfacts #shrimp","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173752146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:15:20Z","rating":1,"title":"Eat rocks 🗿🔪","userName":"bad reviews on bad apps","review":"It’s terrible!!

So I pooped in their face.(that was the ramen from yesterday) \nI swear don’t ever get the app!!! It doesn’t even warn you about after when you open it the phone exploded in my face and BARBIE showed up at my door asking for JUICE 🧃!?\nIt was horrible!! 🍔\nSo horrible that I saw butterflies flying ME!?!?\nBut daddy came to my rescue 🙈\nAnd when I turn my phone off it start beeping really rapidly!?!? \nAnd I said “THY REVIEW YOURSELF NOW”\nAnd it did...THE ONE AND ONLY UGLY\nORANGE WHO MADE THE APP!?!?\nI was shivering in my boots.\nI thought is was over until baron came\n 🍆💦✊🤩he came to my rescue with his magical cape!!

Firstly, this app took hours to download. I managed to play 5 games of comp dps in overwatch before this thing finally decided to finish. Given this is a trump app, I thought it’d finish in a few seconds. After it finally did manage to download, it crashed my device. Had to completely restart my iPhone. When I did manage to open up the app, I was greeted with the most juvenile UI design I’ve ever seen. How is the Disney+ app a more mature design than this? When I continued on to see the actual content of the app, I couldn’t find any. It’s just full of empty promises and fan fictions, super weird. I was also disappointed that the reading level is for 4th graders. Don’t bother downloading, I just wasted all day trying to make a clearly dysfunctional, unstable app work when it never will.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173212444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:08:47Z","rating":1,"title":"Disappointing","userName":"Aunt Tifa","review":"Getting the app, I had no expectations, and was still let down. This app has so many issues, from the initial download, to the contents within!\nFirst of all, the app took an extraordinarily high amount of time to load, even with the high quality WiFi I had. It took up most of the remaining storage even before use!!\nWithin loading into the app, I was hit with the the realization that I had defiled my phone by downloading this garbage onto it. I wonder how it feels for Trump fans to continue supporting a fascist, racist, homophobic, and sexist con man. I feel disgusting just by getting this putrid app. \nTo others: do yourself a favor and don’t download this app, nor support Trump. You’ll be able to sleep at night knowing that you’re not on the side of a corrupted tyrant, who has the audacity to claim the victim.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173183327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:59:15Z","rating":1,"title":"horrible app✨","userName":"Itsnevaeh","review":"it took 54 hours TOTAL to download :( would not recommend. i had to wait for this app instead of my zit cream which was coming in the mail and missed the mailman knocking 😔. as soon as you open the app it starts playing very vulgar & inappropriate sounds and my children heard it 😳they thought it was my husband and best friend at first but all jokes hahaha i don’t know where they could have gotten that from. anyways as i continued to scroll through it i saw naked pictures of the so called president ?? i don’t know if they were photoshopped or not but it must have been for his crotch area to be so small. i wish i have never downloaded this app, it will forever give me and my children nightmares we will not be able to recover from :/ get this app taken done RIGHT away. thank you 🧚🏼\u200D♀️👁👄👁✨😗💅🏽🤪","isEdited":false}}]}
