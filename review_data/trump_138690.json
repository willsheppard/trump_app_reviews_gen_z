My children told me to go on this and it has nothing to do with clothes. I tried selling the dress my great Aunt Frances died in and the process with adding it to the platform was painful and difficult. After that I didn’t receive an offer for months. On top of that the man I sold it to was very sketchy and in professional. He has this terrible tan in the MANY picture that we’re provided by the app. Most of the time he sounded like he had no clue what he was talking about, wouldn’t even answer my very simple yes or no questions. And for those reasons I’m out. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","date":"2020-07-10T05:59:53Z"}},{"id":"6179699308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FrozenOcean13","title":"No thanks Cheeto man","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This is just a horrible app and people who support this type of political and social beliefs have no regard for basic human rights🧚🏻✨💕","date":"2020-07-10T05:59:51Z"}}]}
