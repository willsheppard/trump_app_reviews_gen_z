I’ve been supporting the one and only president Trump for awhile now. Once i’ve heard of this app i quickly came to the app store. Hearing this news brought me to excitement! As soon as the Trump app downloaded I immediately opened it. I put in my information as the app asks. Suddenly.. i hear helicopters. I thought nothing of it until the sound of it became louder.\n    *CRASH!* I scream thinking someone broke into my house. I quickly grab the bat that lies under my bed and sneak downstairs; the stench of cheeto dust and sweat filled the atmosphere. That was until our eyes met. “Trump!” My eyes filled with tears. But he was holding a woman.. Trump threatened to kill my homeboy Sophia the First! 🤯😭😭 That wasn’t until a man in a mask snuck behind Trump and stabbed him!\n-But it couldn’t be- I thought. “Anonymous?!” After Trump killed Sophia,, it was on!! 😡😡 But i didn’t have to worry about that. Thoughts filled my head and it brought me to tears. Anon came closer. He lifts up my head from absolute despair. “I’m on your side, now.” I said. Anon slipped out a low chuckle. His hand slid down my waist. With his mask on, it seemed he tried to peck you on the cheek. “But why.. Your mask.” He slowly takes it off. and you saw a little of his face, he grinned and your lips met his.","userName":"OoferzStuff","title":"Anonymous x Reader (I CAN’T JAHZJAHZJA-)","date":"2020-07-10T04:55:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179512319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app ever","userName":"LE_MEME_GOD!?!?!___","title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-10T04:55:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179512313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"THIS IS THE WORST APP!!!!
