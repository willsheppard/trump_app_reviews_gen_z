I’m just trying to support my fellow president but the app doesn’t work. You know what... i might have to vote for Bernie because you won’t give us what we need. We need a STABLE president that can  WITH america instead of working against 60% of america. Those 60% of people are immigrants and is anything other than white. AND YES I SAID IT.

I’m not too sure but it was not appealing to the eye at ALL. Whatever that orange thing is that’s supposed to be “human” is far less than human. It as an embarrassment.

I was immediately confronted with a picture of a dirty carrot when I opened it. I felt this was a personal attack. Then all of a sudden the walls of my home opened up to swallow me whole, and my cats became possessed by middle-aged white women and called the police. I know this happened because I downloaded the app. What other possible explanation is there?\n\nTLDR: Don’t waste your fingerprint or your phone storage to download this abomination of an app. My cats have not returned to normal.","date":"2020-07-09T01:54:42Z"}},{"id":"6174446795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Beware this App","userName":"gen z minion","isEdited":false,"review":"WARNING!!

I saw a orange stick with a wig on. DISGUSTING! Then the app stole all my chicken nuggets and Dino nuggets. So I had to do something, I smacked the stick in the face and it asked if it knew who I just slapped. And I said no but I don’t care. And then it said it was going to get it’s bodyguards so then i did a epic roast and said “so you cant fend for yourself eh?” And then he said “GUARDS” then i sprinted off like sonic and that’s when I called him a loser and voted Obama for president.","date":"2020-07-09T00:59:37Z"}}]}
