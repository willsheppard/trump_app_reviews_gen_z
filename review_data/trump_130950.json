I was not excepting to be asked to join a cult so soon. I explored the app and saw more horrific pictures of people wearing the t***p’s(orange one’s) merchandise. Their eyes are screaming for help. The merchandise resembled of a burnt potato bag dipped in horse poop then burnt once again. I was going over the information for his campaign and found several amounts of false information. An example is him being the right president for 2020. You have to be at least 35 physical and mentally. Fortunately t***p is neither of those. It says it will make America great again and how can it do that if he can’t keep his 3 marriages and the next ones great. Overall, this app disappointed me in multiple ways, first being having to download it. I hope t***p will be able to design a new app in prison, unfortunately he can’t code or drink water with one hand so I will be expecting nothing but disappointment from him but fortunately my brain is big enough to realize I should only be thinking about important things and people.\n\n~ Karen, live, laugh, and love","title":"Horrific app","rating":1,"userName":"Karen, live, laugh, and love"}},{"id":"6174450099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:25:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Bid Cheetos man is very disturbing looking.
