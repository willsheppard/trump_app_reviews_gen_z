WRONG. later, the app even requested my credit card info so i could buy all of his merch! i of course wanted to buy some so i put it in. immediately the app glitched and locked me out, taking all of my information with it. i started to get excessive spam calls, emails, and my credit card was even hacked. DON’T GET THIS APP!

I mean come on, doesn't the slogan seem kind of racist, \"Make America Great Again\". WAKE UP!!! It was NEVER great! Wasn't it your job to Make it OFFICIALLY great? But no, instead you want to prove to the people with actual sense what a white supremacist you are. You're fighting against you're own people, you're offending what America is supposed to stand for. If people want to come here LET. THEM. COME. America's a free country people should be able to come and live here. Of course we take precautions, but you're doing ENTIRELY too much. \n                              \n                          Sincerely, An Angry Black Child","userName":"khiddo.kyiah","date":"2020-07-08T16:33:35Z","title":"WAKE UP!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172882995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I WILL NEVER DOWNLOAD AGAIN! THIS APP GAVE ME A VIRUS! I’m so mad right now, this app took SO long to download, about 5 days to be specific.

He later told me “if I don’t dance the stupid orange guy will kill me” So Donald trump is a murderer and massive, worthless, piece of crap that can ruin anything just by the sound of his wretched voice. Later then piggy came in and said “he treats me differently cause he gave me a free house and lots of money so now I’m rich”. So shrek said “so trump treats you different than me? isn’t that racist?” Piggy says “yeah”. Do you not see what I’m trying to explain here? yeah of course it made me laugh a little😂 but still. Donald trump....is one of the worlds disappointments.","userName":"hdbdjbx","date":"2020-07-08T14:27:17Z","title":"go die in a ditch DD Trump❤️🦋💕💖","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172334174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"so i happened to come across this app and thought to myself “wow this looks great” until i tried to download this trash. it took 9 hours to download and i have perfect wifi. and when it did download MY PHONE TURNED ORANGE LIKE THE UGLY PRESENT oh sorry it ALSO makes my PHONE randomly cap THINGS and to top it off when it downloaded our orange mistake.. i mean president flew out of the sky from some helicopter, came to my door, broke the door, grabbed my by my ear, and said you listen here you ugly girl.. give it 5 stars or i’ll make your life a living hell. long story short i drop kicked his ugly self and chock slammed him and he left me alone..

I logged in as a total supporter, but after being spammed with notifications and asked for money three times a day I decided to rethink my stance. Lots of the news was written with grammatical and spelling errors. It was super hard to read without getting a headache. All I could think is, how did I not see this before. My beloved president can’t spell. I don’t feel too bad for him since I never even made it passed 9th grade, but I still knew how to spell “gorgeous” and “I’m not a racist”. I hope that this will help you decided whether or not to get the app. Total waste of time a money.","userName":"U diffusing","date":"2020-07-08T13:02:08Z","title":"Trump 2020?

Instead suddenly my phone started screaming at me that there are only two genders, and that as a woman I needed to get into the kitchen and make it a sandwich. My Trans Pride flag suddenly became a confederate flag, and my electric car turned into a big pick up truck with those fake balls hanging off the trailer hitch. 😱 I tried to delete the app but for some reason it won’t let me. It says I need to provide my birth certificate and proof of my family lineage dating back at least 6 generations.
