I don’t even have the words to describe how much I can’t stand this guy and what he’s doing to the country. I’ve never been so repulsed by a politician in my life. He’s a narcissistic, racist, homophobic human, and I cannot believe we elected him into office. This November, keep America great by keeping Trump out of office.","userName":"alex_g_29643","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app. Even more horrible president."}},{"id":"6174945847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:50:31Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is not what I was expecting. It gives false information with sexist, perverted views, and gives ideas of White Supremacy. I am very disappointed and can not justify any of these causes. Along with that, the app is glitchy and crashes at least every other time something is loading. Very very poor page setups and overall, not a good app!","userName":"mountainman1982","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6174921257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:42:58Z","rating":1,"review":"Sis you snapped 🥺🥰🧚🏻💖next time try ur neck💕🥺💖👑\n\nYou killed this 🥺💖🧚🏼\u200D♀️next time try yourself 💖🍄✨🌳\n\n 💞🥺🧚✨I thought everyone was born with a talent😍⚡️💞🥺🥺Clearly not everyone😍🧚🥺💫\n\nYour a baddie 🥺🧚🏼\u200D♀️💓 just take out the bad 🍄🌳🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨\n\n.

I had opened up then app and ever since then my phone has been glitching. When I open it, I get greeted with racist remarks and I do not support of that. Before I had downloaded this app my phone was perfect fine, but now the screen goes black every once in a while. Please take my advice and do not download this app!!!","userName":"quineceee","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174897413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:35:52Z","rating":1,"review":"This app killed my entire family and 130,000+ Americans. Every time I tried to open it fake news flew off my screen and hit me in the face. For some reason it kept turning a sickly shade of orange and I think that’s just “sad.” For a campaign that supposedly has so much money, I expected much better. 0/5 stars if I could this app is the worst thing I have ever encountered since 1776.","userName":"aoc<3","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP - DO NOT GET"}},{"id":"6174880916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:31:04Z","rating":1,"review":"Uhhmm when I first opened the app the first thing I saw was a bunch of glitches that prevented me from getting past the home screen? I think it downloaded a virus to my phone. It also started playing that song that goes “Somebody get her, she’s dancing like a stripper” really loudly when I was in a meeting.... weird. It also called me a fat commie cow & insulted my mother.","userName":"abmeza01","isEdited":false,"title":"Would Not Recommend:("}},{"id":"6174879247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:34Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to get my local chisme. it sensed i was mexican and filipino... very strange... i don’t like that. chile anyways. it banned me after they found out im not... white.☹️. ooo and that glitched.. the glitch was sooo bad it teleported to my microwave and it burnt down the house. luckily the cockroaches died 😜. anyways the app itself is not it. k i’m done r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"stinkytowel🤢","isEdited":false,"title":"why it know my information and it’s glitchy"}},{"id":"6174871343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:28:18Z","rating":1,"review":"The app has so many glitches I immediately opened it and my phone was fully charged and it shut down.
