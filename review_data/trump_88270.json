Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex!

People were constantly raving about this app and how it can make my country (USA baby!) a utopia (aka great again since apparently to US was sooooo perfect to begin with), change my race, give me a minuscule taste of what white privilege is like, and let me feel just a tiny sense of all that  entitlement Karens feel. So I decided to download the appWell rest assured, none of this happened!😡😡🤬🤬👎👎 I should have known it was a trick since the app was for Trumps re-election campaign which is a joke in and of itself. As soon as I opened this app I saw that nasty lookin cheeto trying to pose as a hot Cheeto with that red tie. Might I add, wearing red, the devil’s color, is not a good fashion statement for tHe PreSidEnT of the United States of America. His face finally popped up after  hours of lagging and I was utterly disgusted. So much so that I had to immediately go throw up after going 11 years without puking. I’m sad to say that all it took to break this 11 year streak of not throwing up was the putrid face of the displayed Donald Trump. Furthermore, the words “Keep America Great” were displayed as if he was able to make America great in the first place. I might be mistaken, but I think that the inability, nay refusal, to adequately address the coronavirus pandemic and put in place actual, helpful procedures and measures (such as mandating wearing masks) to mitigate and combat this virus under the trump administration has made America WORSE! Not to mention the systematic issues of racism that Trump refuses to acknowledge or address. In fact, I can easily argue that Trump has worsen the issue of race, oppression, and inequality throughout these last 4, painstaking years. Even after all of this, the app and Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign committee had the audacity to ask for my phone number. What an utter invasion of privacy. He’s trying to ban TikTok for “our own safety” since he thinks China is going to “hack important US data,” but what if Trump is the real hacker instead trying to steal our phone numbers and all. Many, including myself think that he is just salty that a younger generation is banning together to stand up for what we believe in and troll Trump along our way (like with the Tulsa rally) since he is a huge part of the problem we are trying to voice against. Wittle  Trumpy can’t stand being made fun huh? He can’t stand people finally calling him out in a large and impactful way?! Needless to say, this app is a disgrace just as much is the person displayed as soon as you open it. \n#downwithtrump\n#savebarron"}},{"id":"6175387158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No ❤️","userName":"ayy_itz_Emma","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:24:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is horrible what was I expecting tho Trump is horrible so yeah ❤️😹"}}]}
