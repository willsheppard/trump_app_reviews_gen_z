That there are really ppl in this world who support Donald Dump and it sad. But there is more this app✨ deleted all of my other apps out of my phone and called every contact number. I made the mistake omg giving them my number and now they won’t stop texting me.

After closing the app my phone crashed and it was really messing with my battery life. This is a horrible app don’t use or your phone will crash and they will scam you","date":"2020-07-08T18:46:35Z"}},{"id":"6173325200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible quality","userName":"Hskfhsncisjkfcjnskccndfjcj","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I tried downloading it but it took about a whole HOUR to install on my phone. I thought it must be a me problem so I disregarded it and I go on the app. I was on it for about two minutes when it crashes on me!! I’m getting frustrated now but I go on it again and it won’t let my share it to friends. It freezes my whole phone and I’m forced to stop using my phone. Terrible quality and looks rushed. 0/5. Don’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T18:45:34Z"}},{"id":"6173313894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very disappointed","userName":"boomer here","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible, I was really looking forward to it but it took 5 days to download, and every time I opened the app it completely glitches out. The only time it genuinely worked is when I was trying to sign up but even then it would freeze on me. I know it’s not my phone because I just bought my new phone one month ago. And ever since this app started glitching out I wasn’t able to make phone calls. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP BY ANY MEANS.","date":"2020-07-08T18:41:49Z"}},{"id":"6173314551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤮","userName":"memyslefandonlyme","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"review":"This is the worst app ever when I downloaded this app orange juice started comming out of my speaker.

And since you have to add your phone number, you’re always getting random texts which is annoying. It takes too long to load and you have to get through a bunch of ads in order to read just one article. I’ll rather just listen to what CNN has to say than have this app clogging and slowing my phone down.","date":"2020-07-08T18:34:17Z"}},{"id":"6173286667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this was one of the worst apps ever to be on the app store.","userName":"PeytonR0721","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I cant believe that this app, took 1 month to download. That’s just not ok, and when it did download it happened to close out the app as soon as I opened it. When I opened it again it acted as there was a spider on my screen. What app does that!? So I kept clicking on my screen to “ kill it “ but it seriously would not go away. Long story short, I hate this app and will never download or recommend it again.","date":"2020-07-08T18:33:15Z"}},{"id":"6173243529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever!!","userName":"kennakenlemkennekensnana","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"After i proceeded to download to app i clicked on it to enjoy, because i loveeee my president. after opening the app it gave me a notification that i was going to get grabbed by my p****!😡 then it told me to bring slavery back so the cheeto can remain the almighty🌚 then after i closed both thinking there was a hack, hideous music played that made my cat eat my big toes off 😫 worst pain of my life! i do not recommend downloading no matter how much you love our crusty cheeto, racist, and sexist president :(","date":"2020-07-08T18:19:05Z"}},{"id":"6173231979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no 👩🏿","userName":"Simone Loves Icecream","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"My mom dies my dad died my sister died my brother died and I died I am writing this in heaven and can’t wait to see Donald Trump under me suffering God should not forgive this guys even if he did he would just do the same thing again so we shall not support the racist and rapist if you support him you got it from your parents who hate black peoples but white ok aren’t even a race y’all are Native Americans that went into the cold and turned White and Native Americans were originally African American so uh y’all are us IDIOTS","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:13Z"}}]}
