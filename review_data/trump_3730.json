After downloading this app the FBI came to my home and all they said was this quote “This is for the orange man”. They first started off with taking my couch, my sisters my little pony collection, my grandmas ashes, and it doesn’t end there. They eventually took my mom and I still don’t know how why 😭. After they abducted my mother they planted an orange tree in my front yard and then they ransacked my house and to top it all off they gave me an orange. I’m confused sad and lonely please don’t download this app unless you want your mom to be abducted and your house to be ransacked from the 🍊 servants (FBI).","userName":"Kiawiimukuchan123","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:43:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁 This was a mistake"}},{"id":"6173003383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i see all these five star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating and all that comes to mind is these wise 🧠 words from our president, ✨“FAKE NEWS”✨🤬😩 this app is awful and actually almost KILLED ME 😳🤯 white ⚪️ supremacists 🔝 came to my house 🏡 MY SUBURBAN HOUSEHOLD 😧🤭 waving confederate flags 🔴🔵⚪️ and screaming at me and my family 👱🏼\u200D♀️🧑🏾\u200D🦱🐶 to give 🍑trump’s🍑 app a five star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ review “OR ELSE” 😳😧😭 i am beside myself about the incident 😩😤 i feel UNSAFE!! in my house!!

No matter what app I had open my entire phone would blow up. I’ve gone through 4.5 phones and I’m getting tired of this. I just wanted to keep up with tripod but it’s becoming increasingly difficult. This app is almost as disappointing as turbio himself. He has all that money but can’t even pay someone to make him a decent app. I’m not in the mood to sue so I’m leaving this review to hopefully help some people out. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It’s super glitchy and, like I previously stated, will cause your phone to blow up in your hands. Be careful and stay safe! 😛","userName":"Cutiepie3714233689","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:09:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Extremely disappointed"}}]}
