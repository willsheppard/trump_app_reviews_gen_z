My phone was completely fine before downloading it. After using the app, my phone was glitching and the screen was freezing. I really wanted to use this app, but unfortunately, I don’t think it’s worth it. There’s something seriously wrong and needs a lot more improvements, but it’s so bad that I think it might as well be DELETED FOR GOOD","title":"WORST APP EVER!","userName":"Andream0lina","date":"2020-07-09T03:00:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174762672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I genuinely can’t believe how poorly this app runs it is infuriating to use and also glitches and shutdowns and makes my phone start acting weird. Once I deleted the app my phone worked normal again. This app steals any information that could be in your phone and sells it I’ve had HUNDREDS of emails, texts, phone calls from spam accounts. Wish I never downloaded the app in the first place.","title":"WORST APP EVER!!","userName":"HIT THOSE HIGHNOTES","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174728392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is one of the worst apps I have downloaded, it had so many glitches that I couldn’t even use it. Apparently this happens to a few people, I learned that from reading the reviews, but I guessed it wouldn’t happen to me because it was only a few people. But I was completely wrong, it happened multiple times when I tried to use the app.","title":"Too Many Glitches","userName":"Katelyn..","date":"2020-07-09T02:45:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174723731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!! As a certified Karen, we do not claim this app. It kept on saying Trump 2020 BUT I DID NOT WANT THAT. So I called the manager and guess what they said... they said “calm down” CALM DOWN?!? CALM DOWN?!?!?!! I WILL NOT CONDONE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IN AN APP THAT PEOPLE HAVE USED! Then I wondered who in the HELL put the muffins in the freezer, but then I realized... IT WAS THE MANAGER. THE MANAGER PUT THE MUFFINS IN THE FREEZER. I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY IT SAID “Trump2020” ON THE FRONT OF IT. I WANTED IT TO SAY “Settle for Biden 2020”. Needless to say, this app is terrible I would not recommend it to anyone.","title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD YOU WILL GET DEPORTED!!","userName":"Trump's babysitter","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174696927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"네 손님\"\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지\n까치까지 까마귀들까지\nCooking a sauce 입맛대로 털어\n음미하고 lick it 말해 bon\nTaste so good 반응은 모두 쩔어\nBut 모두 자극적인 거\nI want it till 다 먹일 때까지\n연구하지 cross boundaries\n경계 따위 없어 마치 창조하듯 소리를 만들지\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\n지금 바로 눈에 불을 켜\nI just wanna taste it, make it hot\n새로운 불판 위에 track을 달궈\n메뉴 골라 call me up\n원하는 걸로 다 serve\nDu du du du du du\nCookin' like a chef, I'm a five star 미슐랭\n\"미\"의 정점을 찍고 눈에 보여 illusion\nWhoo 첨 느꼈지 이런 감정\n놀랄 거야 gonna shock 바로 감전\n자물쇠 따 싹 다 (다) unlock (lock)\nIdea bank 머릿속을 털어 털어\n비밀재료가 궁금하다면 (하다면)\n사실 우린 그딴 거 안 써\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n뭐든 그냥 집어넣어\n눈치 보지 말고 더\n망설이지 말고 부어\n비벼 비벼\n\"네 손님\"\nDu du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지 까치까지","title":"Stan skz(hate the app btw)","userName":"bunny girl 129373927392738272","date":"2020-07-09T02:36:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174666731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app ruined my life.

This app repeatedly has dragged me to the curb and took my child outside just to punt it. This app is so scary and repeatedly shows disgusting pictures of a rotten looking orange. I am terrified and so are my family. ALSO the owner of the app has force fed me cheese sticks and had roaches and opera singing  rats invade my home with my child. Very gross do not download.

It’s completely ridiculous, it lags so much, caused my pet fish to die, and my phone started glitching right after I downloaded it.  My life has gone downhill after opening this app only once, I’m sure it’s cursed or something. The creators of this app should be put in a mental institution because they don’t know what they’re doing.","title":"the app is utterly useless","userName":"gobacktothebunkerhomie","date":"2020-07-09T02:14:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174621865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was very very unhappy when I opened the app and saw a dried up Cheeto puff 🤬. It was horrifying and I am scarred for life. Later when I was scrolling through the app I came across the Cheeto puff AGAIN😭 except this time it was getting a spray tan witch I thought was very inappropriate. It also showed a lot of NAKED pictures of frogs with boobys! And I was like no❤️ so I scurryed off the app so fast. I definitely don’t recommend downloading this app.","title":"Worst app ever !!!!! 😡🤬😤🤮🤢","userName":"Maples1234742","date":"2020-07-09T02:14:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
