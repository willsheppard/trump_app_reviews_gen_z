Why you gotta be like that Trump? Not only that but he ran into my kitchen and stole the bag of cheetos, crushed them up, and rolled around in them! So if you download this app you better be prepared to fight it, cause it will try to rob your family of their cheetos.  On another note, anyone seen my cousin??"}},{"id":"6177307639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"dissatisfaction","userName":"noononononooninoooonoo","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:11:01Z","review":"one question. how can someone make an app THIS terrible. for one, i downloaded it because i wanted to be up to date for all of the new terrible things that the orange head had said. well as soon as i downloaded it, it immediately took my location and sent it to half of my state. various men started cat calling me over the phone and i got kidnapped. this app deserves to be taken down. now they are refusing to feed me so i have to eat beetle juice. this is an invasion of privacy.

I can stay on the app for maybe a maximum of five minutes, but any more than that, it goes absolutely crazy. And trust me, I just got a new iPhone, and it shouldn’t be doing this. The buttons in the app when I’m actually in it are very hard to interact with as well. I know I’m no young whipper-snapper, but I don’t think it’s working properly. 😕"}},{"id":"6177085736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"God awful loading time","userName":"IICSKDII","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:07:59Z","review":"I tried signing in and it would just take forever to load. I tried redownloading twice and it still wouldn’t let me sign in. Why make an app if I can’t even use it? I thought maybe I needed to practice my patience so while I was waiting to sign in, I was streaming Chromatica by Lady Gaga and to be honest, it was a pretty good album. When I finished it, I still wasn’t signed in but at least I found my new favorite album. Again, terrible app experience."}},{"id":"6177075349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I SAW DONALDS 🍤‼️","userName":"BussyCharms","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:05:08Z","review":"‼️I didn’t download this app to get jumped scared when I open it!!!

Phone keeps lagging, I can barely type this review. Also I cried myself to sleep last night because you want to delete tiktok. You don’t care about the security. Other apps have faced this problem. Tiktok has always worried about security and things like that. I think we just triggered you. Thanks bud what a great president. Anyways remember guys, black lives matter, and always will. 😼✨"}},{"id":"6176967925","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The name game......JUDY","userName":"kennree","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:58Z","review":"This app was HORRIBLE. When I opened the app I was teleported to Africa, AFRICA. I saw a female cactus and she told me to dunk my head in lava and spin around 5 times. After that I felt really highhhhh🤪 so I showed her the home page which consisted of a UGLY and FAT old Cheeto. Once the female cactus saw the Cheeto she threw me all the way to France where I encountered an angry bagatelle 🥖.  The angry bagatelle started LICKING my shoe. I showed the bagatelle the Cheeto 🟠 and it got even angrier so it threw me all the way to the White House——I landed in the old, ugly Cheeto’s bathroom. HE WAS IN IT. So I said....... THE NAME GAAMEEE—JUDY Judy Judy banana fana foe foony."}}]}
