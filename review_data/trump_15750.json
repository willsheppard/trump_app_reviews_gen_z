My white conservative family and I were hoping for something special, but the second I opened the app, the song “Replay” began to play at full volume and we couldn’t turn it off! Even when I deleted the app, it kept playing. It got so loud that an earthquake began, and it only stopped when I destroyed my phone. I am now a Democrat.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173272064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:28:28Z","title":"UPSETTING","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bowlover2704","review":"I can no longer support this man anymore!! From what I’ve been seeing for the past couple of months, whether it’s COVID-19 or the BLM movements, this man has not been handling these situations properly. I support the color minority in this country. This man is just bringing this country down. \n\nIf we let this man continue to be president, we’re going to be living in hell! Dictatorship!\n\nWAKE UP AMERICA!!! Get this man out of here!!
