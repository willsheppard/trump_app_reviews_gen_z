Maybe I got my hopes up too much I don’t know. But I wasn’t expecting this. I’m horrified and hurt by the realization that the antichrist 1. Isn’t hot 2. Doesn’t have a cool name 3. Doesn’t seem to have any powers. It just seems ridiculous to me. I’m sure that they have much better and more qualified people or demons who would do a better job than what we got. I mean, he looks like a puffy Cheeto. I don’t need that?? Anyways I’m just disappointed I guess I was expecting more.

Had to delete because It was sucking up all of my battery. Also it constantly was using data even though I told it not to. Terrible designed, and not #1 for news. Just wanted to see why people want to vote for him. Found out he is trying to establish an army. Why does he need an army. Wanted your phone number. And then keeps blowing it up with texts to buy stuff. Doesn’t even care about your opinion.  Please do not download.","date":"2020-07-09T13:38:45Z","userName":"Bubble blower8"}},{"id":"6176743131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very bad.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"He has no lips. How will he get a kiss kiss? Very ugly, no kiss for him.😡😡\n\nThis app is very bad. I was so excited to download this app and learn more about the Cheeto with a wig 😍😍 but as soon as I opened it, my phone started glitching and EXPLODED!!!

Also a few days after getting the app my phone completely glitched and as the result of that hacked! Beware of this hazard! After finally getting my phone to work after how bad this app was apps and accounts linked to this began to dis function. For example my phone glitched it started playing music and my animal was never the same even after hours of therapy.","date":"2020-07-09T13:26:37Z","userName":"jewlalannz"}},{"id":"6176695911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.                     🧚🌸❤️😙✌️🧚","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I wish I could give 0 stars! This app took soooooooo long to download!! And the fact that it’s an app about a racist, misogynistic, homophobic man! I’m just appalled that it even exists! I don’t understand how America has come to this. I don’t understand how this man, Donald Trump, has the right to treat his people the way he does. Back to the app! It literally took me 23 weeks to download and used a lot of my battery while downloading. Very unimpressed. Anyways, I wish luck to my fellow gen z’s. We will win this war. 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T13:24:24Z","userName":"and i oop sksksksksksks 😙✌️"}},{"id":"6176666206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app doxed me","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I put my number in and about a week later I got a knock on my door and an orange bloop of a man  was waiting outside. He said I had to vote Trump 2020, it was what’s best for the country. I explained that I disagree with CHILDREN being locked up away from parents and tortured isn’t what I’m for. I’m not political I don’t have a side, it’s about morals. He then said Biden was a piece of trash and I would be a snowflake to vote him. And then GRABBED MY BY THE PU***. I’m truly appalled. I just wanted to learn about the president and his campaign if I could give negative stars I would.","date":"2020-07-09T13:16:32Z","userName":"ivankatiffanybarronericdonald"}},{"id":"6176630271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App Ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Wow. I was so insulted by this app. Time and time again, it said stuff which was inherently racist, sexist, or blankly incorrect. There was no fact checker in this app, despite all the far fetched claims. \n\nIt asked me invasive questions, violating my privacy and rights as an American. \n\nThe user experience was much like reading a confusing twitter account and I couldn’t figure out how to find the information I wanted. \n\nON TOP OF THAT, the app actively encouraged me to go out to giant rallies, despite the current public health situation, and didn’t even mention the idea of wearing a mask. \n\nThis app is insulting, confusing, and is putting the health of all users at risk. If you value your rights as Americans and your own health, don’t download this app. Download something much more fun. \n\nDo yourself a favor—don’t download this app and keep your IPhone great.","date":"2020-07-09T13:07:05Z","userName":"flyn 002"}},{"id":"6176575031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App! Do NOT download!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I waited for this app to download for 8 months! As soon as I was able to open the app all I was getting was virus alerts on my phone. My clash of clans was hacked and now I am back at town hall one! They stole my account and now they have a free town hall 10! UNACCEPTABLE! I put in my phone number and it would not stop sending me texts saying that they wanted to kill me if I didn’t vote for trump in the upcoming election! I will not let an app threaten me or anyone else so I highly recommend you do not download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T12:52:07Z","userName":"🧚\u200D♂️Don't Download🧚\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6176501117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"30 days it took a full 30 days to download until I could help out my women loving president and register for his non corona filled rallies. After it finally dowloaded I opened the app and it went straight downhill from there. The first thing it says is “thank you for voting Donald Trump” like the app is full of election fraud that wasn’t in the description. It also comes with this weird glitch where every time I send a news story to one of my friends or family it says “FAKE NEWS” under it which I didn’t type.","date":"2020-07-09T12:31:53Z","userName":"dakota51823"}},{"id":"6176396623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️Functional adult for president ✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"HORRIBLE APP WOULD NOT RECOMMEND if I could I’d give 0 stars, took 84 weeks to download, once it downloaded all the TVs in my house turned on and started screaming at me that as a woman of color I didn’t matter including my reproductive rights and that I should go back to where I come from but hey I was born in the US so I don’t know what it was talking about then the TVs started chanting orange Cheeto  man  🍊🚶🏼\u200D♂️I had to turn off the power to my whole unit for TWO DAYS 10/10 would not recommend thanks for reading ✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-09T12:03:12Z","userName":"ACAB1ACAB1ACAB1ACAB"}}]}
