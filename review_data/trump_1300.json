It also tried to rescue the kids on the basement which I did not whatsoever appreciate because those are mine and it did not have any right to take actions without my consent. If I could sue this app I would because it’s the worse app I have ever seen is full of bugs and mentally disabled animals. whoever made this app should be put in jail for such bad job. I wish I would give this app a negative review because of how awful it is. this app sent my cat a message saying I didn’t love her and that was the worst part of it all cause I love my cat JJ and i could never be mean to my angel. I hope you send my cat a full apology letter for this because she still looks at me funny whenever she remembers this awfully weird incident. you’ll be hearing from my therapist because this app is the definition of clownery.","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","date":"2020-07-08T18:31:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kedmiii"}},{"id":"6173141661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app today because I wanted to receive news on Trump’s campaign. This app not only made my phone crash several times but it took about 3 hours to download. I also had to delete all of my apps in order for my phone to hand all the bs that this app contains. Please do not download this app! There are reviews on here leaving about how good the app is but don’t believe them they are bots that are leaving fake reviews. I saw one saying that children are on here and we should ignore those because they are not knowledgeable on politics, does that not sound like something a bot would write? They obviously are terrorist and gullible people because they didn’t want to educate themselves more after being fed Eurocentric education, but what can we expect from trumps little puppets though? All of the “good” reviews sound incompetent, lack common sense (and decency) and frankly they act like snowflakes.","isEdited":false,"title":"INCOMPETENT & SNOWFLAKES","date":"2020-07-08T17:45:57Z","rating":1,"userName":"f-ckoff"}},{"id":"6173061907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a very traditional conservative republican, I was astonished by the quality of the app. I didn’t want sleepy joe to win the election, so I decided to start supporting trump, as I wanted a real opinion on him. \nI signed up for the text messages, the emails, and got the app. I completely regret it. Not only was I bombarded with scam-y type messages telling me to ‘donate now’ to have my name on a list of only a select few in the President’s Oval Office (multiple times), but I was continuously offered deals, meals, and empty promises if I gave more money to Trump. \nAs someone who has taken classes on internet fraud and scams, I can’t even begin to tell you how many red flags I see in all of the messages I get from this app, the email, and the text messages.\nI’ve come to the conclusion that the president is a liar in every way possible, and not at all someone who I would vote for in November.","isEdited":false,"title":"More information lead to misinformation (aka fake news)","date":"2020-07-08T17:20:28Z","rating":1,"userName":"GrumpyCatGirl38"}},{"id":"6177814242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i love trump with all my heart, so of course i had to download this app created by my lord and savior himself. i hoped to able to meet and chat with president trump, as i hope to one day be working by his side. within 5 minutes of downloading, a van pulled up in my 69 acre beet farm and i was ready to square up on sight. however, immediately after i saw helicopters with trump 2020 plastered everywhere on it, i knew i was safe. they landed on my beets however, which was a little bit unsettling. they came to my house and asked for me and my ex wife’s social security numbers, which i gave to them. they then asked for my precious belongings and i gave it to them. after that, they wanted my house so of course i gave it to them. then they wanted my cousins addresses? like what?!!? this is where i draw the line! what next, MY BEET FARM??? nonetheless, i will be voting for trump this year.

Then I started to look at the reviews and all of them came true so they did not lie. 1. It took forever to download on a serious note they should fix that cause I’m not here trying to waste my time on things like that. 2. People were saying something about an orange Cheeto. Sadly it was true I saw it and I had a panic attack that was not very cash money. 3. There was glitches in the app. I have never seen an app that has this many glitches. Like fr fix your app you have millions of dollars. 4. They did take all my personal information I don’t think I they should have done that. 5. Once I started using it my head felt really bad. 6. There wasn’t anything much to do on the app so it’s boring. So in conclusion the app is really bad and you shouldn’t get it. If I could I would give 0 stars. 0/10 don’t recommend.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","date":"2020-07-09T18:38:21Z","rating":1,"userName":"lily😳🐠☹️"}},{"id":"6177279741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst thing that could’ve happened to me. So basically the ✨ o r a n g e✨ is running for president again 🙄 I’d rather have a strawberry than an orange 🤮 well ima 🧚🏽\u200D♀️💖😗get into it🧚🏽\u200D♀️💖✨☺️ so basically my friend bob told me to get this bc it’ll give me money and gifts so of course I got it so then the money was actually Donald ducks credit card number so I had to use it. Instructions unclear: i now have the fbi outside my window and a llama... but i invited them in and they were actually really nice and we started to do rituals together by throwing baby dolls around and swinging cursed barbies. The app also gave me a trump sign, ew. I burnt it but I kept receiving more so I just crossed out 🤮t r u m p 🤮 and then put ✨💖🥵 a n o n y m o u s🥵💖✨ so yeah 😐. I completely despise this app and hope this gets banned and not TikTok. Also I changed my region so I can keep the beautiful app 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💖✌🏻🤡😈 good luck trump.
