I was alarmed when I opened the app. The song chicken wing chicken wing hotdog and baloney chicken and macaroni chillin with my homies started playing. The worst part, I was on a bus! I mean the volume inside of this bus was astronomical! Everyone around me started dancing robotically doing the chicken dance. Even I was tempted to join. But that’s not all! This app asked me for my private phone number!!!! I, being a loyal member of the Cheeto cult, put the number in. I almost immediately was sent picture of parrots?! 🦜🦜 it said that I was entered into a Parrot Palooza!! I was greatly offended that this sad excuse for an app for SUGGESTING that I would even like parrots. I quickly replied STOP to halt the stream of parrot pictures being sent to me. But then I got a call... I answered the call normally when I heard a voice behind me. The next thing I knew, I was tied up to the top of the Empire State Building?! I was in the hands of what looked like King Kong, but also Trump??? I screamed as he dropped me from the top of the building. I would’ve died if Perry the Platypus didn’t save me. He gracefully took me in and placed me down in the streets of New York City. It was a crazy journey. You may think this is where my story ends. BUT NO. I was soon kidnapped again! This time by a young boy with a knockoff Anonymous mask. I awoke in the White House very confused. I was about to yell for help when a giant child came up to me to cover my mouth. It was Barron!! I knew I would have to sacrifice myself to save him so I hatched a plan. I am writing this from a jail cell of the White House. Luckily I saved Barron by disguising him as a large parrot and throwing him out the window. I think he’s safe now... I wish you all luck and beg of you to never download this app. 🦜🦜"}},{"id":"6147092747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T05:56:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","userName":"Sl0501 Aj","review":"This app📱sucks ass🍑Simpson’s🧑\u200D🦲better not😔fail❌us now😩yeah❤️that sounds👂right 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6145780523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T21:28:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The app","userName":"movku66","review":"I just don’t like the app"}},{"id":"6145729047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T21:07:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS APP NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD!","userName":"raachelllllll","review":"I downloaded this app thinking that I could stay up-to-date in the campaign but when I opened it, AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR PENIS ENLARGEMENT (ALSO HAND ENLARGEMENT) SHOWED UP!
