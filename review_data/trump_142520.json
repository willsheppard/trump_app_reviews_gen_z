I am so upset right now 😢. Don’t get this app they asked for my phone number then asked me if I wanted to go an a date with them. I told them I was a minor and then they said that was even better. They said If I don’t go on a date with them they would burn me and my family. I was scared for my life. I still said no though because I don’t want to date no Cheeto and his mini cheez its. So I got a text yesterday saying that I am going to die. I told my mom but she said I watch too many scary movies 😒🙄. So today I looked out my window and I saw a Cheeto looking directly at me I WAS PETRIFIED. So don’t ever get this app if so you will see a Cheeto looking in your window.","title":"MY INNOCENT EYES!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anonymous 🤤"}},{"id":"6179290922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:40:32Z","review":"This app was a complete disappointment.
