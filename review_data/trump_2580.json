He had always loved Disgusting This app with its numerous, new No one. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel Angry.\n\nThen he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Allergic Reaction. Allergic was a Sorry Orange with gross hair and orange skin.\n\nOrangutan gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an Orange, Tomato, Pink tea drinker with big hair and fat skin. His friends saw him as a tight, teeny Terrible. Once, he had even helped a shrill Liar cross the road.\n\nBut not even an Orange person who had once helped a shrill Liar cross the road, was prepared for what Allergic had in store today. \n\nThe cloud teased like Lazing potato, making Orangutan Ewwy. \n\nAs Orangutan stepped outside and Allergic came closer, he could see the successful smile on his face.\n\n\"I am here because I want Murder,\" Allergic bellowed, in a President tone. He slammed his fist against Orangutan's chest, with the force of 5658 horse. \"I frigging love you, Orangutan Orange.\"\n\nOrangutan looked back, even more Ewwy and still fingering the Yucky Couch. \"Allergic, I hate this app,\" he replied."}},{"id":"6174542648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"traumatized","date":"2020-07-09T01:51:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Emily🍬","review":"when i first opened the app my eyes just started to BURN. like i’ve never seen anything so traumatic in my life. do not get this app it is so bad. there’s this cheeto too and i never knew the cheeto company supported tr*mp 🤢. why would they make a cheeto be spray tanned? it looked so realistic why would they do that!? i puked when the cheeto went away because i had learned that this app was racist! they don’t even like poc and as a half white GIRL this caused me to pass out. donal doesn’t even like women and has secks with little children it is so inappropriate. then the most unbelievable thing happened.. something started leaking out of my phone which caused it to explode! the smell was so bad which made everyone in my house to pass out. don’t get this app it is so traumatizing"}},{"id":"6174535854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just........no","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"BoneXZZ","review":"When I first opened the app I saw a cheeto. I was so confused at first because the reason I ever downloaded the app was to support my favorite shrimp🍤😔. But that’s not all. I shut my phone off and went to sleep and I kept getting this notification that cheeto man wanted me to get back on the app. I was really creeped out at this point because it kept trying to persuade me to go back on the app again. I went back on the app just to see what the big deal was about and I was flabbergasted at the picture that I was viewing. I saw Cheeto man but naked with his little 🍤out in the open. I have never in my entire life have seen something so horrific in my life. That’s why I just had to give this app a horrible review. But I’m not sorry about it tho❤️✨🌟⭐️💕💓🥰"}},{"id":"6174457984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"this app trash","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"shejoeldjapqp","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

When I downloaded this app the sky started to turn orange like the orange man himself, I was terrified. My dog was acting weird too, I think she was possessed. My dog ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and put it to my throat. My family tried to pull her off of me but she was so strong they couldn’t get her off me. She sliced my throat sooner than later and drove me somewhere in the country and throw me on the ground, as I laid on the ground were my dog had left me not being able to move I watched the orange sky above me, I heard a car and it turns out it was my family. They had found me through my tracking device and they drove me to the hospital and am now currently in the hospital recovering. After I deleted this app everything went back to normal."}}]}
