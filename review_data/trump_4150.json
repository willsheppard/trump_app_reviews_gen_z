Basically, we were walking down the sidewalk, talking about something meaningless. I think it had to do with a movie. Then this bus screeches up, stops next to us, and a bunch of people with ‚ÄúDown with Cis‚Äù shirts climbed out and started beating him up. I was punched and kicked a bit too, but I managed to avoid brutalization by going for their faces. After figuring out what‚Äôs happening, I started attacking them back, getting them off of him. He was quite injured but I called 911 and he made a full recovery at the hospital. I was fine, with only a cut on my arm that they patched","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174436499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:09Z","rating":1,"title":"Nope","userName":"I heart color fly!!!üôÉ","review":"I've been hiding for so long\nThese feelings, they're not gone\nCould I tell anyone?\nAfraid of what they'll say\nSo I push them away\nI'm acting so strange\nThey're so pretty it hurts\nI'm not talking 'bout boys\nI'm talking 'bout girls\nThey're so pretty with their button-up shirts\nI shouldn't be feeling this\nBut it's too hard to resist\nSoft skin and soft lips\nI should be into this guy\nBut it's just a waste of time\nHe's really not my type\nI know what I like\nNo, this is not a phase\nOr a coming of age\nThis will never change\nThey're so pretty it hurts\nI'm not talking 'bout boys\nI'm talking 'bout girls\nThey're so pretty with their button-up shirts\nThey're so pretty it hurts\nI'm not talking 'bout boys\nI'm talking 'bout girls\nThey're so pretty with their button-up shirts\n'Cause I don't know what to do\nIt's not like I get to choose\nWho I love\nWho I love\nWho I love\nWho I love\nThey're so pretty it hurts\nI'm not talking 'bout boys\nI'm talking 'bout girls\nThey're so pretty with their button-up shirts\nAnd they're so pretty it hurts\nI'm not talking 'bout boys\nI'm talking 'bout girls\nThey're so pretty it hurts","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174426202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:18:03Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst App On The AppStore","userName":"SortaTinyTurtle","review":"When I downloaded this app, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. The bar was almost touching the floor, in a visual perspective. However, they did it! They managed to GO BELOW THE BAR. First of all, despite the professional name, the ENTIRE APP is filled to the brim with some Cheeto-man‚Äôs baby pictures?? Most of them are him crying or yelling, usually because there is a non-white person nearby. What‚Äôs even STRANGER is that although the app makes it clear this is a MAN, all the photos are rather recent... I‚Äôm truly baffled that this is on the AppStore. The only reason you should download this app is so you can give it a 1-star review. Thanks, good day to everyone but this Cheeto-baby.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174413609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","userName":"ainsley_48","review":"I first downloaded this app to see what was going on with my least favorite Cheeto ü¶êpp president. It asked me for my location which is very invasive. The second after I accepted location tracking a dinosaur knocked on my door. It was huge and ate my entire family. It‚Äôs hands were soooo tiny. That‚Äôs when I realized it was Cheeto man. I quickly ran to get my pest repellent and sprayed that mf all over his body. He melted into the ground just like the wicked witch. Not to mention his orange spray tan stained my floors!!! And now my family is dead but I‚Äôm happy bc bunker beotch is tooü•∞. Anyways do not get this app unless you want someone to kill your family. And ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CARRY AROUND PESTICIDES.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174408405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:12:40Z","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP IT GAVE ME A SEIZURE","userName":"Miawesome!123","review":"do NOT download this app it caused SRVERAL viruses and I got hacked 20 times!!! I showed the app to my mom and she went into cardiac arrest. I developed a severe peanut allergy after using this app for only five minutes. Not only that, but I was cursed and now live with an eternal fear of fridges. How will I ever survive after this??? I have booked several therapy appointments to help me cope. Maybe EMDR would help with this. I also developed severe a severe phobia of oranges called Portokaliphobia. I‚Äôm 55 years old and WAS a trump supporter but after this, I‚Äôve realized he‚Äôs brought me nothing but despair. I hope this app never curses another human again. TAKE THIS DOWN OR ELSE.... please I‚Äôm begging you. My eyes are bleeding too btw","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174402966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:02Z","rating":1,"title":"Can I give it zero stars?","userName":"life360caneatmyass","review":"Absolutely TERRIBLE not only was it glitching every time i opened the app, but it also deleted all of my contacts, went through all of my personal info and stole my credit card info, but 5 men in cheeto man outfits burst through my door at 1am and beat up my family and stole everything in our house. I now have 2 broken eyeballs and 7 broken fingers and they popped my boobie implants so now I ain‚Äôt got big tiddies anymore. All thanks to the Official Trump 2020 app. This app is the reason why I had to set fire to my house and kill my pet goldfish because that was the price I had to pay in order to delete the app. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174359424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:36Z","rating":1,"title":"IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE","userName":"tabbydabby","review":"So this is Molly Mole from Peppa Pig and I heard horrible things about this app and I though ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be that bad.‚Äù Boy was I wrong! The moment I pressed that download button, everything went wrong. All of a sudden my shirt changed into a big, orange, ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù Tee. It started shifting from morning to night. The work felt so grey. I didn‚Äôt know why everyone was panicking. I didn‚Äôt know why my family was crying. I decided to delete the app but I got a Snapchat from a Cheeto in a suit with the caption ‚ÄúThe Wall Is Coming‚Äù. I gasped, ‚Äú This can be for real!‚Äù I ran downstairs looking for some water because I was obviously delusional! But all I could find was Diet Coke.","isEdited":false}}]}
