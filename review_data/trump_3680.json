I break into Tiffany’s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It’s priceless. As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop, it’s her father’s business. She’s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don’t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son, and he’s the chief of police. \nThis is where the story gets interesting. \nI tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She’s been waiting for me all these years, she’s never taken another lover. I don’t care, I don’t show up. I go to Berlin. That’s where I stashed the chandelier.","userName":"scary_person","title":"No ❤️"}},{"id":"6177830299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:49:45Z","review":"see, you crossed the line sir , you better keep hiding under your little bunker because sir , you just got yourself into something that you don’t wanna be in so , if you see me at the White House be ready cause I’m gonna make a WHOLE scene so , if I were you i would stop doing whatever you are doing to tik tok . gen z is one powerful generation so , you better go try another generation cause you are not gonna have fun . remember when we tricked you into thinking a bunch of people were gonna come to your little stupid rally thing ? yea , you thought . 🤡 anyway , get ready to see me at the White House, if you don’t wanna see me there , you better stop banning tik tok .","userName":"~LucyKate~","title":"✨tiktok crew✨"}},{"id":"6177508966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:10:00Z","review":"this app is terrible , when you first open the app there is a spinning T .. like what are you trying to do ?? hypnotize me ? no i won’t have it . and then when the stupid app actually LOADS you get to see the cheeto of a .. i don’t even wanna say man but you have the stupid president like bro i understand this is your app but seriously go somewhere i don’t want to look at you . but he has his fist up as of it makes things better , anyways don’t get me started on his neck .. lookin like my grandmas ex husbands wife ..

I really would give this app 0 stars if I could!!! I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone else was also having troubles with the app making your phone glitch and close out of the app:( it was really annoying and I kept trying to close the app and reopen it and it kept glitching out of the app. I even tried restarting my phone and it still doesn’t work! Ik it’s not my phone that’s the problem because I have an iPhone 11 so it’s still fairly new. But I hate this app and I definitely wouldn’t recommend it to anybody!!!","userName":"kaitly5f0rbs","title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could!!!"}},{"id":"6177378844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:14Z","review":"I downloaded this app to learn more information from my president.

This app is used to spread false information such as “Keep America great”. America cannot be great until trump is no longer president and his app is a representation of that. The founder of this app is racist, sexist, homophobic, a rapist and so much more. He views his election as a way to create an army, which is directly turning U.S citizens against each other. Which is a declaration of war. The creator and the app both spread false information in order to harm citizens and must be stopped as soon as we can. The least the App Store can to is help us stop the spread of false information that is used to harm others.","userName":"bEan:24","title":"Worst App out there"}},{"id":"6176893272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:24Z","review":"I hardly have any apps on my phone due to a lack of storage. When i made some space for this app, the day i downloaded i began receiving alerts from other social medias that my accounts were being logged in to from locations all around the world. Do NOT download this app unless you want your phone to be HACKED!!!!!!!!!! I had to call all of the customer service representatives to let them know that wasn't me signing in and to change my passwords... Even got a notification that my bank was being signed on to😠😠😠. Never buy this app. Save yourself a whole lot of time and sanity. I would give this app NO STARS if I could. So disappointed.........","userName":"Harambeliveson","title":"HACKED!!!!!!! 😠"}}]}
