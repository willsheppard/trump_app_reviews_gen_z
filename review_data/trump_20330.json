Has a random picture of some ogre on the front when you open it. The app made a lot of promises and didn’t follow through. The color scheme is weird...I don’t think the orange really goes with the red, white, and blue. And for some reason the Russian national anthem plays softly in the background? Super odd. 🤔","userName":"Kjoy1148","date":"2020-07-10T01:13:02Z","title":"Aw man, this app made me lose brain cells.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178876592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Omggggg i was so exited to download this cause I’m a huge trump supporter I love our fellow president cause he starts wars and kills people and doesn’t support LBGTQ+  COMMUNITY this took 1 year and 5 days to download and when I opened the app it crashed my phone deleted all my texts and camera roll it was super glitchy I then had to call Apple and safe my phone by drowning it 😻","userName":"gdjdyebx","date":"2020-07-10T01:10:07Z","title":"TRUMP SUPPORTER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178864270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely awful.
