Fell asleep and had all of these crazy dreams about a giant orange with baby hands and a bad toupee. It sent the country down a spiraling path toward decimation and ruin. Thank goodness it was all a dream and nothing like that actually exists in the world. Deleted the next morning, but the dreams have been consistent ever since. I’ll never be able to sleep again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, SAVE YOURSELVES.","date":"2020-07-09T08:16:43Z"}},{"id":"6175651361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"INFECTED WITH VIRUSES","isEdited":false,"userName":"itsdomm","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app but deleted it because I needed more space on my phone to update. After it was gone it popped right back up again!! Every time I delete the app it keeps popping up all over again!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!

Extremely disgusting😱. I then farted back 😡but it called me a terrorist😫and told me to go back”to the Middle East” 👀. So I bombed the app. And then trump showed up in the bathroom and pooped in my toilet while I was showering 😒 (invasion of privacy). He left a big smell. Smells like burnt Cheetos and spray tan. I don’t recommend it at all❤️.","date":"2020-07-09T07:42:37Z"}},{"id":"6175583238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave me a horrible virus","isEdited":false,"userName":"//kawaiibabe//","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my definitely not racist president Donald J. Trump. But, all I ended up with was a horrible virus on my phone. I got multiple notifications a minute and my screen would randomly go black! Now I understand that I should have never gotten this app. No wonder there are so many negative reviews on the app store. So my honest review is 0/10 would not vote again.","date":"2020-07-09T07:40:16Z"}},{"id":"6175576525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app on this App Store","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cupcakegirl.1","rating":1,"review":"Take it down and leave this app. I first downloaded this trump app and first opened it, next thing I know my messages are being hacked and it’s been sending random trump messages to all my contacts. It’s a scam is is trying to manipulate us to vote for trump but doing it this way is wrong and steals all our info including social media info. Terrible, please take it down smh","date":"2020-07-09T07:37:44Z"}},{"id":"6175540153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ZERO STARS IF I COULD !!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"akaashis wife","rating":1,"review":"when i downloaded this app 1 not only was the app it’s so sooooo ugly and it’s features were so outdated 🤢🤢🤢 i set my phone down to pull up a speech from my racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and actual pedo of a president  🤩 my phone started to yell a VERY HIGH PITCHED NOISE and it burst the eardrums of my cat who was next to the phone at the time 😡 this app is a waste of time, energy and your attention so don’t download it AT ALL it’s NOT worth it. 🧚\u200D♂️✨🤝","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:24Z"}},{"id":"6175537916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😾🤪🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"😾🤪🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and immediately after downloading it my phone got hacked into, I took it to a iPhone repair store and they told me that there were now a bunch of selfie’s from Trump in my phone and immediately after I got a call from my Nana that my cat had been stabbed.

The layout of this app is poorly done and very confusing to navigate. Since installing it has reset my phone THREE TIMES!!!!! Glitches and all.
