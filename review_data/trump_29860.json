This app made me sick 🤮🤢🤮. I downloaded this app to of course support my racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, president. But I kept seeing so many photos of a person dressed up as a orange 🍊.

He is barely Alive.","rating":1,"title":"💩💩💩💩💩"}},{"id":"6177606742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:40:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"gjjgrwdbjjhjknj","review":"Ok one this app took forever to download and it asked for my number first thing you don’t need my number for me to keep up with what the president is going I could just go to the news and probably get more reliable information","rating":1,"title":"😘❤️🧚\u200D♀️TikTok🧚\u200D♀️😘❤️"}},{"id":"6177591168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:35:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"iCooldog10","review":"I did not come from tik tok, but I have been having issues with this app because it keeps crashing.
