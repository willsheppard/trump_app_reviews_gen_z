It was so hard to use. I hate it. 😤 very difficult to focus when I see a racist on my screen!!!! I don’t like how the app is set up. 😑. The quality is bad and the photos are even worse🥶.

Unfortunately Big Cheeto completely destroys this line of logic with his bigoted, racist, and homophobic remarks. It tears my heart to think that this gremlin represents the whole United States and her people. An absolute atrocity to the 21st century and to the modern man.","userName":"Monkey","isEdited":false,"title":"Hate Speech"}},{"id":"6174453449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:26:19Z","rating":1,"review":"when i opened this app i could not believe my eyes 🙈🙈🙈🙈. a walking cheeto? seriously? seeing that made my fish drown and he could not be revived. as a lifeguard i am so disgusted by the actions of this app!!! making my fish drown? ridiculous. this app must be taken down before other innocent fishes lose their lives in this battle with the app.","userName":"caroline2143","isEdited":false,"title":"this app MUST BE REMOVED!!!"}},{"id":"6174447956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:24:39Z","rating":1,"review":"So someone should of mention this app was a scary because I almost jump out my seat when I saw a deformed Cheeto on the screen .
