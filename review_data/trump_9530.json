As soon as I opened the app I heard my doorbell ring. I got up to see it was actually JK Rowling (author of nothing) congratulating me on my decision to become transphobic!! She must have gotten my information from this app as it seems rather tied to the subject matter. This app should be deleted as I don’t want my information stolen.","title":"Horrible app","userName":"Tr brave","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174628493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t know why I got it on my phone it took up a lot of space and I need to make room for photos.

Instead it was just a live feed of an obese hog covered in spray tan, throwing a tantrum! After looking around the app more, I found out that that the hog was in fact, our President. This deeply saddened me. I hated knowing that this disgraceful overused bottle of spray tan was ruining our country. it would be better if he were an actual hog, because I can forgive a pig, but not this man.","title":"I am shocked this is allowed on the App Store","userName":"Hahsjxbaisbsnajd","date":"2020-07-09T02:10:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174589509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t believe i wasted 10 DOLLARS on this app. I was once a devout trump supporter and i would donate HALF my paycheck to his campaign.
