Pretty much the worst app ever created in our country’s 243 year history.","userName":"Dragonrex","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179500535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:51:11Z","rating":1,"title":"Big no no for me","review":"I very excited too have and app where all my fellow trump supporters could go but as soon as I opened the app I was met with constant glitches as I was putting in my information. At the beginning the things I was filling out were completely normal but the questions started to get a bit more personal, it asked for my address, social security number and my bra size . After I put all my information in my phone screen started to flash and my phone completely shut down , it took me  a hole 24 HOURS to get my phone working again . Im very disappointed with this app 😡😡","userName":"Im2cute4u2332 omg","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179500474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:51:10Z","rating":1,"title":"UwU","review":"Rawr🐲🐊 x3😋 nuzzles how are you😉🙂 pounces on you😛 you’re😃 so😄 warm🤒😈 o3o😏 notices😯 you have a bulge🍆 o:😯😮 someone’s happy😃 ;)😉😜 nuzzles your necky wecky😈😗~ murr~ hehehe😊 rubbies👋🤚 your bulgy🍆 wolgy you’re😌 so big😯😮 :oooo rubbies👋🤚 more on your bulgy🍆 wolgy it🚫 doesn’t stop🛑 growing ·///· 😐kisses😚😘 you🙂 and lickies😝👅💦💦","userName":"12inchh0rsec0ck","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179500452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:51:09Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst App EVER","review":"I bought this app expecting to amazed by wonderful ideas by our lord and savior Donald Trump. But I was let down. I mean there is no flavor to the app I mean for such a great president such as Donald Trump I expected more. But once again I was let down by our lord and savior Donald Trump. Anyways if you want real info and ideas go to tiktok we’re the people are actually woke and not racist, and it has much more flavor.\n\nSincerely,\nGen Z","userName":"✨💫🧚🏻Trump2020✨🧚🏻🤡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179500287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:51:06Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"Wow best president ever....
