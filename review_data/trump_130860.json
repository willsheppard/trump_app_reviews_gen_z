I downloaded it so i could stay updated on important information about trump rallies and other trump things because trump is my biggest role model, i looove cheetos! Anyways as soon as i opened the app, it sucked me into the phone! It then forced me to work in a labor camp to make MAGA merch which btw is repulsive, who tf designed it 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮 i was then fed expired blueberry yogurt which made me sick, obvi, so the app directed me to a “hospital” which was actually a prison where trump holds people captive until he feels like ejaculating into their unconscious bodies ick. The bodies are then taken to a torture chamber that plays dance monkey 24/7 and i also watched my family be murdered. My mom was tied up on a railroad track while my dad watched, and as soon as she died and i saw his pain he was shot in the head with an AK47 that republicans need so badly for protection, keep in mind i am watching all of this! After that my fish was flushed down a toilet full of 💩, my sister was eaten alive by chipmunks (idk if it was alvin and the boys), and my hamster was forced to run on his wheel until we died of exhaustion. As you may expect this was VERY traumatizing. I would get counseling but i spent all my money on disgusting maga merch ☹️ overall i had a very bad experience with this app and i would not recommend it","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:35:04Z","userName":"Ben69Over","title":"This is the worst app to ever exist"}}]}
