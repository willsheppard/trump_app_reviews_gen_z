My posts on different social media plat forms would be deleted along with pictures and videos a few apps and notes. I don’t understand why they would have an app to mess with people like that it’s horrible. Worst app I’ve ever downloaded."}},{"id":"6176183745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"VERY BAD","userName":"ev420l","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:00:27Z","review":"Now i’ve talked to many app developers some are the best in the world i tell you they’re one of the bestests people we can get down here. This app is a SCAM. It sells all your information to overseas industries. I’ve received numerous calls claiming that the U.S. president is taking everyone’s banking information personally to deposit checks. Although i told him my credit card info i didn’t let them get my social security once I caught on. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6175886398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever unbelievable","userName":"Orangepinephrine","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:24:43Z","review":"I downloaded this app and it took 16 weeks to download and on top of that my phone started over heating when using it. I started getting weird text messages in different languages. This app gave my phone number and email out to who knows who. When I’m not using this app it is always in use I will close the app and it will keep popping back up. It’s like someone is watching me and what I say."}},{"id":"6175772327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app in the world","userName":"jordan🧜\u200D♂️🧜\u200D♀️🧚","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:46:27Z","review":"This broke my whole phone!

But it took 16 weeks to download. This app wasted all my data which wasted my money.  This app squandered so much of my money, I am now broke and my best friend is a homeless dude named tony. This app ruined my life making my guidance counselor a raccoon. I eat the garbage everyday and am currently trying to teach snails how to fist bump. My only plan now is to hopefully move to Canada and find a better app there to support from afar."}},{"id":"6175613389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"UNBELIEVABLE🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","userName":"Qveen42","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:19Z","review":"First this took about 2 months to download. 2MONTHS!!!!!! Then once it downloaded it erased ALL OF MY DATA BECAUSE THERE WASNT ENOUGH. I LOST EVERYTHING. when it opened it had asked for my number, which I put in. Then it proceeded to text me inappropriate text messages and threaten for me to send some back🤬. I can not believe this!! Then they threatened they were going to send me and my family TO ICE FOR NOT COOPERATING. THIS IS A COMPLETELY DISGUSTING APP AND IS FOR PEDOPHILES, HOMOPHOBIC, RACISTS🤬. \nTbh rate- don’t like you and honestly kinda annoying🙈🤩"}},{"id":"6175600183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m so embarrassed 😔🖕🏽❌💩","userName":"nat 🧚🏽\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:46:30Z","review":"This app took 8 days to download and then the very own trump 🤩💫🤩🥵 started sending me messages which is very disgusting and inappropriate for a MARRIED man to do , but I felt like what can I do ???

After taking 840 minutes to download, it made me give them pretty much all of my information, which felt like an incredible invasion of privacy. I finally got into the meat and taters of the app, and all I found was racist, homophobic, and misogynistic propaganda. Very disappointed in this app, would not recommend"}}]}
