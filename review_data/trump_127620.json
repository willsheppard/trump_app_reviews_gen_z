This talking orange with a wig would follow me around in my dream yelling Trump 2020 and when I woke up I was having hallucinations with the same orange. I deleted the app immediately. Now that I think about it my “dream” was more of a nightmare. Also someone told me that it had skincare routines so I downloaded but it was absolute false advertisement because I only saw how to get so many tans that you start looking orange🤮🤮🤢. Sick of apps leading people on.","title":"This app is haunting me"}},{"id":"6177515299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"daddy🥴","date":"2020-07-09T17:11:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇\u200D♀️","title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6177514936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mfjduehchd","date":"2020-07-09T17:11:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans beans","title":"BEANS"}},{"id":"6177514107","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Justine-N","date":"2020-07-09T17:11:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app which took about 2 hours to install, I was traumatized by an explicit photo of a wrinkly hairless rat holding up a tubby fist, and it continuously crashed my phone. My phone was attacked with hateful messages in support of racism, fascism, bigotry, child molestation, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and misogyny just to name a few!!! I did not even approve of receiving notifications!! This app is fake news. I will forever be haunted by the explicit images of a soggy Cheeto puff- ruined my enjoyment of that snack by the way. Would not recommend to a friend. This app spreads hatred easier than the coronavirus. Please remove from the App Store. \nXOXO Gen Z girl","title":"the family disappointment as an app"}},{"id":"6177512070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Horses lover 11","date":"2020-07-09T17:11:00Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT.

There’s a special place on hell for people who actively deny and choose to ignore the struggles of other people, and the Don’s got a front row seat.
