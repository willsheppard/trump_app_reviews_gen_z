When I first opened the app it asked me to leave my phone number (which I did). Once I did this and got access to the actual app, a bunch of derogatory words were popping up like notifications from the app!!! Due to the fact I had given my phone number, they started texting me all these horrid things, telling me that if I joined “Trumps Army” we wouldn’t just take over America, we’d take over the world and nothing would stop him and all of his followers. That’s just what the app had to offer though. In the actual design itself, I couldn’t see over the hot cheeto with a blonde wig in order to actually read anything that wasn’t offensive! Every time I clicked on something a black screen would pop up and kick me out of the app, only to force me to re-open it to the same cheetos face over and over again!!! I definitely would NOTTTTT recommend this app to ANYONE!","rating":1,"title":"absolutely TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T14:53:29Z","userName":"CT868"}},{"id":"6176818301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"as soon as i downloaded it, everything went wrong 🙄 like immediately it tried to build a wall on the US/Mexican border?? idk what that was about. also, apparently it’s had actual record of being racist since like the 1970s, and people still don’t think its racist? somehow? this app basically reversed the Civil Rights movement by like 20 years because its so outdated. it also got in the way of rights for all LGBTQ ppl. it was okay with keeping children in cages and tearing families apart. yet somehow people say it’s a good app. “i dont agree with the app itself, but it knows how to run this phone”. no it doesnt. it knows how to be a racist, pedophilic, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic disgusting excuse for an app. i will never hate an app, but i can have very strong dislike. there’s this other app im thinking of getting and it really seems like a better option. i think its called Jo Jorgensen 2020, if anyone was wondering.","rating":1,"title":"bro this app suckssssss","date":"2020-07-09T13:56:40Z","userName":"Layne AW"}},{"id":"6176476567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Downloading this app was the worst mistake of my life. It kept saying I have to vote now or else. For some reason I kept getting multiple calls to vote or else I’d die. 💀💀💀 was I ready for that, no. I mean maybe, but not right now. Anyways, trump came to my house and said “the news is fake child. Come to the White House and I’ll take you to Disney land.” I went because you know....free trip. But he lied to me!? What was I to expect. He had his body guards hold me down and made me sit there for hours till I was ready to vote. Donald trump kept telling me “if you don’t vote then I’ll make sure you never see your love ones again.” And I guess that made me angry a little because I smacked one of the body guards in the balls and it threw them off. I kicked Donald trump in the face and left the White House. Trumps wife showed me how to get out without any damage. And that is why I am writing this review. Please don’t download this app!!!","rating":1,"title":"Worst app","date":"2020-07-09T12:25:12Z","userName":"cat13beep"}},{"id":"6176465259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app and it took a week to download. Then, it wiped my phone and broke it so I had to get it fixed, which costs $500. When I got home my parents were dead, there was a note pinned on to my mother and it said “you better vote for trump 2020” then these guys came in and took me. They brought me to a run down town so I could work for them for free. They didn’t fead me for at least 2 weeks and made that a pattern. When I finally escaped and went home, they robbed my house and I got a call saying “ you escaped, so you will be not only sent to your station, you will get killed for what you’ve done” I cried and cried and then I heard a knock at the door and it was Donald trump himself and he shot me in the arm but I ran for my life and I made it out and I went to my friends house so they could hide me. I’m still there today and I don’t see myself ever leaving because of what this app has done to me.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T12:22:03Z","userName":"sarah47392"}},{"id":"6176373865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"DO NOT BUY THIS APP. at first downloading took forever. and by forever i mean 3 DAYS. then when i opened the app, it asked for my PRIVATE IMFORMATION!!! my phone number!! inappropriate and gross. but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and moved on. now not only has my phone been blowing up with trump administration texts, i’m pretty sure my phone was hacked! everything is glitchy and whenever i try to open another app it just takes me to this one! it’s bombarding me with ads and spam calls and texts telling me to vote for trump which i will not after this!! i answered one call and the man on the other line who told me he would have the secret service kill my family if i didn’t vote for trump!!! well i hung up and three hours later a man was at my door with kerosene and a lighter and lit my house on fire! then he threw a bomb! my house is demolished and my phone ruined all because i downloaded this app. fix it trump!!!!","rating":1,"title":"horrible","date":"2020-07-09T11:56:53Z","userName":"joekqajd"}},{"id":"6176246118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"first i’d like to start off with TRUMP 2020!! second id like to say that this app isn’t worth it. as soon as i open the app my phone began glitching out. i later found out it had hacked my phone and stole my data and sold it to our enemy CHINA!!!! how could our cheeto puff president allow such a thing. i later got a text sending me a number for \n”costumer service” i spoke to a woman who sounded like a woman of color. i then asked for someone more educated which thankfully i got. and guess who it was the president himself. he sincerely apologized. he proceeded to tell me that the app was acting funny because of the black live matter movement. i really do hate those peaceful, hardworking, beautiful people. them and those protest are really getting on my last all lives matter nerves. i’m tired of them telling the world the truth of systematic racism in america. i hate being a privileged hate woman in america. anyways stan cheeto puff man 2020.","rating":1,"title":"FELLOW TRUMP SUPPORTERS","date":"2020-07-09T11:19:35Z","userName":"forget this trash app"}},{"id":"6176167072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app to show these Lowzy, No Good, Itchy, Disappointing Scum-Bags that SMURF LIVES MATTER💙 !!

Almost as soon as I downloaded this app my phone started wigging out and spazzing. I even tried turning it on and off but it wouldn’t work property until I deleted the app. It honestly seemed slow like it was trying to download all my information or something. It doesn’t at all keep me up to date on news and everything is very pointed one way. I respect all opinions but I hate biased information. I don’t know what kind of software this is made of but DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. Horrible. UPDATE *** GUYS read the terms and conditions. By entering your information to use this app you are essentially agreeing for trump to access ALL your information and to change the terms of the privacy policy WHENEVER they want to, without notice, and effective immediately. This is not safe to be using what so ever and is a huge security breach.","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T08:16:40Z","userName":"Alize1551"}},{"id":"6175222614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Well I should’ve read these helpful reviews before downloading. As soon as this app was downloading it began to shutting my phone down. So I deleted and downloaded again. Second time no shutting down but as I when to go into app, it began to glitch. Kanye popped up on my screen and said he will let me finish signing in but his app was by far the best of all time. Then I saw his conditions on attending his rallies. He says apart from signing a waiver about us not suing him for catching COVID. He says injecting ourselves with Clorox will lessen the chances of us getting infected and can not enter unless we show proof. Also a small donation to cure his illness and lessons to help him learn how to drink water out of a cup. It also had this section that had inappropriate games. Like coloring within the lines, connecting the dots, and building a wall with his favorite words. Just please save yourself the trauma and DONT DOWNLOAD!! #VoteBiden2020","rating":1,"title":"So uncomfortable!!🥴","date":"2020-07-09T05:21:23Z","userName":"MrsNanyPrice08"}}]}
