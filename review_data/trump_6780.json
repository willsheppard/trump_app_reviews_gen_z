It really scared me if I could give it a zero I would. I 120% don’t recommend. This app also tried to kill me with a disgusting and a very orange buffoon who cannot get the concept of basic human rights and anything else for that matter. By downloading this app it was forcing you to support a racist and misogynistic orange that has colonizers blood running throughout its pulp. From this traumatic experience I don’t want anyone else to experience the trauma I faced will having this app","date":"2020-07-08T20:12:26Z","title":"Less than 1 star","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173568599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"zoekelley","review":"went to go download this app after seeing it was free but once i clicked the confirmation button to download it it took $3000 from my bank account! this is unacceptable! not only that but when i tried to open the app and make an account it asked for MORE money and my cats bloody diarrhea. i don’t know how they would know my poor yoshi was suffering unless the VET office i take her to is selling her information to the government and russia. this is totally unacceptable and i cannot believe that MY president would do this to my cat.","date":"2020-07-08T20:09:26Z","title":"can’t believe this app!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173513137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Linda Bertman","review":"Where do I start? The minute I downloaded this app, my phone went very slow and started glitching me off of facebook and adult sites(if you know what i’m talking about). I deleted the app and tried doing my day to day things and my phone was fine again. I was confused and wanted to figure out if the app was really the problem, so I downloaded it once more. Same thing happened. As someone who was going to vote for trump this year, the app changed my mind. Thanks a lot, Donald, for providing the worst app ever.","date":"2020-07-08T19:50:31Z","title":"worst app I have ever downloaded.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173505679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🌻Neptune🌻","review":"Took forever to download, couldn’t even use my device while I was waiting and it made my connection terribly slow. When it finally downloaded (after a whole hour!!! 😡) the app was extremely glitchy and crashed often. I just wanted to make America great again and get justice for all like the pledge says but this app isn’t allowing me to. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone, let alone the vast majority of Trump supporters who are baby boomers. Will not be using this app ever again.","date":"2020-07-08T19:47:59Z","title":"Disappointed 🙄","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173480179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Heyyyyyfjxb","review":"Wouldn’t recommend ✨ Took about 7 hours to download and you can only open the app for about 5-10 seconds at max before it glitches out. Quite ridiculous. I think there might need to be a software update because there are some serious issues within this app !! I also felt like I had the urge to vomit slightly after downloading this app. From other reviews I have read, side effects may vary depending on the person. BEWARE and take precautions before pressing install !!","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:12Z","title":"TERRIBLE!! Don’t get it. Don’t recommend!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173478077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"iiiAbby","review":"Horrible , disgusting, i was going on a run and I was like okay I’m gonna download trumpet’s app. Right when I got the app, it made my leg fall off and then spiders and cockroaches started eating it meanwhile my neighbors watched. How embarrassing 😡I ran back to my house and the cockroaches started to chase me!!! I sprinted to my drawer and got the gun I had and started shooting at them but accidentally shot my fish instead and the police came to my house! They arrested me and i had no idea this was all because of the trumpet app ... I’m uninstalling it and i hope it gets strangled in its sleep. 🤬","date":"2020-07-08T19:38:29Z","title":"EWWW","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173465230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"cheergirly01738","review":"I downloaded this horrendous app to follow mr. 🍊🍊, then one day later, i get a strange phone call saying “we’re outside”. i was confused but i just decided it was a prank call. 2 days later i get a text and email saying “stop avoiding us”. still thinking it was a prank, and blocked them and soon forgot about. now, yesterday, 3 men showed up at my doorstep and broke into my house. they said they were apart of the rüssiañ m@fia and that they were here to kidnap my family!!! i am writing this from a trap phone i have in a secret bunker i ran away to... moral of the story DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-08T19:34:04Z","title":"the m@fïa","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173404968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Clarealia","review":"This is the worst app on the App Store it took so long to download that half my family died and all the food in my cupboard when expired in every iTunes artist created a platinum record NoCap whoever buys this app I’m really hoping you don’t die from it because my grandpa got this app and he died from malaria so I wish you luck if you do get this app but I do not recommend also they were too many ads, there’s so many ads I couldn’t even touch the app like they were  weird foot games where you fix the foot as I say again DO NOT GET THIS APP","date":"2020-07-08T19:13:37Z","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE😡😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173326433","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"dslugg916","review":"I wanted to support trump you know like a good citizen(jokes I would never) \n but for some reason as soon as I downloaded it I started turning Orange I don’t know why but I just thought I was seeing things then I looked in the mirror and I was this big scary orange man and that’s when I knew to delete this app bc I looked at my photos and there was all pictures of trump and a video saying vote for me or I’ll eat u I deleted the app and I’m perfectly fine and so is my phone so I’m never downloading this app again!!!!!!!😔so that’s why I give it a one star sir","date":"2020-07-08T18:45:59Z","title":"Scary times","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173319369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Peighsty","review":"If someone with political power and was watched very closely by the public raped you, I’m certain you would speak out for them being in power. Why are you praising such a sick and demented “man”. It just goes to show how disgusting and blind the people voting for Trump are. This is no longer a matter of Democrat or Republican, It’s right and wrong, with a young and angry generation not willing to live with corruption anymore. The man you call President is a predator. Welcome to the war, we will not stop until we get what we are fighting for.","date":"2020-07-08T18:43:37Z","title":"If you vote for him again you’re a white supremacist","isEdited":false}}]}
