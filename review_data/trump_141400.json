As soon as I downloaded the app, everything went wrong. My wife left me and I can’t keep up with the child support, my dog was struck by lighting, and every time I open the app something in my house catches fire. My neighbors avoid me like the plague and everyone runs inside of their houses whenever I go outside. My kids cry every time they see me, and I’ve been banned from every library and hospital in the US. I even went to my sister’s house to talk about everything, but the moment I entered her home our father went into sudden cardiac arrest. All of the grass in my backyard has wilted and there was a sudden uprising of angry raccoons that won’t stop clawing at my door until I close the app. I’ve been in a constant downward spiral and soon I may have to declare bankruptcy. I fear that god may strike me down the next time I leave my house if I don’t delete it. I’m afraid. I don’t know what to do other than delete it and warn everyone else considering downloading this app - don’t. It’s not worth it. Things will go wrong.","userName":"Anonymous Trump Supporter","isEdited":false,"title":"Everything in Shambles"}},{"id":"6179428150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:11Z","rating":1,"review":"Ay want some noodles?\n\n👁👄👁\n\n\\__🍜’\\__/\n\n👀\n\n👄\n\n👀\n\n👃🏾\n\n👄\n\n👁\n\n👃🏾\n\n👄\n\n👀\n\n👃🏾\n\n👅\n\n👁\n\n👃🏾\n\n👅\n\n     👀\n\n✌🏽👃🏾✌🏽\n\n     👄\n\n      👁\n\n ✌🏽👃🏾✌🏽\n\n      👄\n\n     🧠\n\n👁    👁\n\n     👃🏾\n\n     👅\n\n︶👄︶\n\n⭐️       .🌕    .    💫 .✨   🚀\n\n.        ☁️.      .           ☁️        ☁️ \n\n    ☁       🚁 ☁    ☁\n\n🏠⛺️_________🏠___🏡____🏫\n\n     /    \\ 🐕\n\n    /   🚘 \\\n\n   /     🚖 \\\n\n°👄°\n\n                   ———┈┈▕▔╱▔▔▔━▁┈┈┈┈\n\n┈┈┈▕▔╱╱╱▆┈╲▂▔▔╲┈\n\n┈┈▕▔╱╱╱╱▔▂▂▂▂▂▂▏\n\n┈▕▔╱▕▕╱╱╱┈▽▽▽▽▽┈\n\n▕▔╱┊┈╲╲╲╲▂△△△△┈┈\n\n▔╱┊┈╱▕╲▂▂▂▂▂▂╱┈┈\n\n╱┊┈╱┉▕┉┋╲┈┈\n\n🏀\n\n👆🏿    👴🏿       \n\n  🐛💤👔🐛     \n\n      ⛽   👉🏿   \n\n      ⚡👟     \n\n    🎸    🌂   \n\n   👢      👢\n\n   ▇▇▇◤▔▔▔▔▔▔▔◥▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇▏◥▇◣┊◢▇◤▕▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇▏╱▔▕▎▔▔╲▕▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇◣◣▃▅▎▅▃◢◢▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇▇◣◥▅▅▅◤◢▇▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇▇▇◣╲▇╱◢▇▇▇▇▇\n\n▕▇▇▇▇▇▇◣▇◢▇\n\n┈▁┈┈┈┈▁▁▁┈┈▁ ╱╱▏┈┈╱╱╱╱▏╱╱▏ ▇╱▏┈┈▇▇▇╱▏▇╱▏ ▇╱▏▁┈▇╱▇╱▏▇╱▏▁ ▇╱╱╱▏▇╱▇╱▏▇╱╱╱▏ ▇▇▇╱┈▇▇▇╱┈▇▇▇╱\n\n✨ｄｉｓｃｏｍｆｏｒｔ✨","userName":"naiafr","isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6179428117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:11Z","rating":1,"review":"It’s like the worst app ever, took so long to download, also it’s lagging never again🤢🤢","userName":"orange cheetohh","isEdited":false,"title":"🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6179428153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:11Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is trash. When I first got it my pet toothpick (who was sitting right next to me) immediately went missing. I spent 20 minutes trying to find him but he was nowhere to be found. Then I was shown a cheeto and it stole my pretzel. So I left the app and went to get a glass of water. When I came back to the app with my water it spilled all over me and the same cheeto that stole my pretzel said I didn’t deserve water. On top of that an alligator came out of a volcano into my room and stole my yoshi.","userName":"pencil with a stickman","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Not"}},{"id":"6179428057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:09Z","rating":1,"review":"It says it in the title","userName":"Salma1709","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible and low quality"}},{"id":"6179427999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:08Z","rating":1,"review":"Moves very slow in took all day!!!😒dnt download !!!","userName":"jayjay33215","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6179427805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:27:04Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is lame and stupid.

It also made my furby homophobic and transphobic just like you yourself Donald.
