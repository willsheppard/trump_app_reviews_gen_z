I am completely out OUTRAGED with this app. I downloaded it and my phone just started to completely shut down it was INSANE. As soon as i downloaded this app my family squirrel went missing. I was so upset i went to one of trumps rallies to keep peanuts death off my mind 😖. But then i soon realized that everyone at this rally were racist white supremacists! They were complete morons! So then i went to fix my phone but this app just continued to spam my phone! I guess my phone realized how dumb and horrible this app is. But as soon as i deleted it everything went back to normal! Except for the fact that i lost brain cells going to trump rallies and listening to the homophobic orange man try to speak english because he is so uneducated 🥳🤪😚. So PLEASE do not download this app it causes dementia and it makes you have the brain capacity of a worm. And also BLM ACAB! F*CK Trump!

(Even some things about president trump using Cheeto puffs for make up!!) I thought it was another Absurd joke from gen z! But it’s not! President Trump make a better app! Also I heard that if you text TRUMP to 88022 it supports our president which he really needs right now! It saves your number so he knows how many voters he will have! I just hope gen z doesn’t decide to mess up the system and text it even if they aren’t gonna vote! That would be a shame!🧚🏻","userName":"hgarrison72","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6137103191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T19:40:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"This🧚🏼\u200D♀️app🧚🏼\u200D♀️is🧚🏼\u200D♀️horrible🧚🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"hur r t","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6137082784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T19:32:05Z","rating":1,"title":"loss of brain cells","review":"After getting the app and looking at all the information provided I could just feel the number of brain cells I have disintegrating in my head.

This has never happened before to any of my previous phones and only occurs when i open the app. On top of all that my phone started to glitch when i tried to put my number in 😡. Eventually my phone exploded and i had to write this review on my daughters macbook. This is absolutely ridiculous 😤and im honestly disappointed that my not-so-dear-anymore president would want to produce an app such as this one. Cant believe im saying this 😫but maybe Biden 2020 is the answer after all.

This app... once you have opened it there will be a thread of bad luck and misfortune. I threw holy water on my phone and the app was mysteriously gone. I then hear loud eardrum breaking alarms I go into a shock state and blackout... that’s where I woke up from this jumanji like nightmare.

Daddy Donald has all of his money he worked very hard for and this app is completely terrible. As a Republican I feel let down and disappointed that Donnie wouldn’t give us the absolute best. The Democrats are probably the ones who made this app😤 The people Trump hired were MOLES. They’re nothing but FAKE NEWS. I’m surprised the Do nothing Democrat’s could even get this app up. \n\nAt first I definitely thought these reviews were all of the disrespectful Generation Z kids, I WAS WRONG. Generation Z does nothing but disrespect everyone who worked hard for them. They run around saying “ACAB” and “Black Lives Matter” WELL YOU KNOW WHAT? MY SON IS A COP AND HE IS A FINE YOUNG MAN. Trump truly was done a dishonor with this app. It makes me incredibly sad the Democrats would do this. Anyway I have to go and poop my adult diaper and give money to racist and homophobic organizations. See you later fellow republicans💞💖✨🧚\u200D♀️🥰🙈","userName":"DirtyDiaper1956","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136861398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T18:09:10Z","rating":1,"title":"bruh","review":"I honestly just hate this orange ass💀.
