Weird right? But I didn’t look much into it. Later on I went into google to look up Jotaro x reader... The things I saw in my search history was indescribable.. Like really? Mitsuri 18+, Hisoka's abs, and she’s only 18 in dog years?!! Do better trump👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6175093384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:37:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Very Glitchy","userName":"Lara A. Williams","review":"Before I downloaded this app my phone was perfectly fine. However, when I downloaded it my phone started to randomly exiting out/opening apps without me doing so. It would also make my phone freeze and I would have to restart it. For these reasons I would not download this app. I really hope Trumps team fixes these issues soon."}},{"id":"6175084036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:34:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"#1 WORST APP EVER!!!!","userName":"RIP TO MY PHONE","review":"Honestly my phone was working absolutely fine before I got this app. Once I downloaded it it was just horrible even having it in my phone was just horrible I made my phone want to kill itself because of having this app and I’m so sorry to my phone for doing this to you I owe you a huge apology please anybody who cares about their phone don’t download this. #Your phone matters!"}},{"id":"6175080214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:32:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible vibes","userName":"MerryMira","review":"This app just radiates bad energy. Honestly as soon as I opened it all my crystals started quivering and my chakras went out of whack immediately. This app will do this to you. It’s almost like a racist, incompetent, self absorbed, megalomaniac person being in charge of anything at all isn’t good for anyone, and this is applicable to both an app and hypothetically a country. Save your vibes y’all, don’t download this bad juju"}},{"id":"6175063242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:27:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Brainwashed my father","userName":"PokemonPals","review":"Please give me back my father. He used to be cool and supportive dad but now he just wears a red hat and talks about fake news. I miss having actual conversations that didn’t lead to basic human rights being a ridiculous idea. Whatever indoctrination you put him through has turned him into a creature that can only think about its own well-being. I miss my father, please give him back."}},{"id":"6175058206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:26:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App","userName":"Kris.Car","review":"This app was absolutely awful. It did nothing that I wanted it to do and after downloading it broke my phone. I has to get a completely new phone be wise of this app. Immediately after downloading my phone starting running slow and glitching and eventually turned off entirely. I could never get the phone to turn back on and had to replace it. DO NOT GET THIS APP!"}},{"id":"6175045868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:22:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨🙈Remove the app✨😍🥰","userName":"aliss0n___","review":"The app takes up too much storage 😤also it killed my turtle it told me I was to fat to use this 🤬 it stole my French fries😠 the app is too slow it glitches also I need buy it just to see the president eating McDonald's 🤮it also shows inappropriate stuff it made my muffins   run away it😭 it gave me a headache😣 it made my fish deaf😔it made my grandma get sick😕so I think the app should be removed😌💅"}},{"id":"6175031439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:17:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This App gave me a rash!","userName":"🧚🏽BET🧚🏽","review":"I was so excited about downloading this so I could stay updated on the greatest man in the world, but every time I opened the app, a nasty rash would appear, on my face. I don’t know what’s causing it but I think I might have to delete it. What a shame. It also makes my phone run VERY slowly, makes me almost wonder if there is some sort of bug or ViRuS. I do not recommend this to anyone!!!!"}}]}
