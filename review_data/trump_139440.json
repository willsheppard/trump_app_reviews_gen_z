Instead all I got to see was a mean man who is sexist bigoted and racist. I’m sincerely disappointed in the fact that the trailers didn’t match game play. If I wanted to play a survival game where a country is falling apart a would’ve downloaded a zombie survival game or plague inc. If I could give this a zero star review I would please remove it from the App Store.","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫🌟✨🌈🌿💐","date":"2020-07-10T05:28:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"Tablet addict"}},{"id":"6179609437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If seen better apps🥳🥰😇🤩💫🌟🙈❤️😝👍🤪🌈💖👑🌸✨🦋💖⭐️🙈🧚🏽\u200D♀️the only reason I’m here is because of TikTok 💖🦋🌸❤️🤪🥰🤪😝🤩💫😇😌😘🌟🥳👍👑🌈✨save TikTok ❤️😇👍🤩🌸🙈😄🧚🏽\u200D♀️😘😝🥰💖👑🌈🤪🥳🌟💫🦋😌⭐️","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-10T05:28:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"odkdmkdk"}},{"id":"6179609441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t trump we’re not going out without a fight we’re getting a TikTok some people share their stuff but other people don’t and I’m one of the other people and I love TickTock so if you ever decide to get rid of it we’re not going down without a fight","isEdited":false,"title":"We’re not going down without a fight","date":"2020-07-10T05:28:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"ninjala5356"}},{"id":"6179609082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app copied all my informations and contacts I think I got hacked don’t download","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download","date":"2020-07-10T05:27:59Z","rating":1,"userName":"ahmad habar"}}]}
