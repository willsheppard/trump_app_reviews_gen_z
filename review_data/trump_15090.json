I downloaded this app to support my non racist, no homophobic president but it took two weeks to download. when it finally did download, i noticed i was gaining a lot more followers on social media and a lot more randoms calls daily which makes me think this app sells your information!🤬this app needs to be taken away!","title":"😹✨"}},{"id":"6176580935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hehehhehe🦙","date":"2020-07-09T12:53:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app ruined my phone. Once I downloaded this app my phone started to glitch and the sound wouldn’t work unless I connected my AirPods to it. So I schedule an appointment with apple and they said it was a hardware issue but an app  in my iCloud is causing this mess. So then I had to restart my phone, lose all my messages and even after doing that my phone still doesn’t work. DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6176564032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vap the big ChEeSe🧀","date":"2020-07-09T12:49:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! As soon as I opened the app it asked for my phone number and as a loyal trump supporter I put it in thinking no way will Trump do anything bad with it, but it turns out I was wrong! I started getting a lot of threatening messages and it turns out that those messages were from THE TRUMP APP. I’m extremely disappointed and scared, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes by not downloading this app!😔💔💔","title":"WORST APP EVER❌❌"}},{"id":"6176500168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pipalou","date":"2020-07-09T12:31:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First off, this app is so slow and glitchy. Every time I open it, it takes forever to load anything. I have tried updating it and redone loading it but nothing works. Second thing is I do not like how it asks for a phone number, I hate giving that out because of all the junk calls I get. This app needs major improvements.","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6176485485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mar mario","date":"2020-07-09T12:27:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is literally the worst app you could possibly get. It took so long to download and when I downloaded it it’s asked me the dumbest question. It asked me if I would allow messaging from this app and if that’s a thing I don’t want it... the app also wants me to give it money. The person who owns this app should most definitely not have it bc it’s racist, sexist, and down right not good.","title":"The worst app ever"}},{"id":"6176474310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pleasevotebiden2020","date":"2020-07-09T12:24:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"first it took 300 days to download! can you believe it????? so disrespectful😾😾😾 next it asked for my PERSONAL INFORMATION🙀 i don’t want my phone number getting in the wrong hands, but i decided to give it to the bunker boy and see what happens. i was then bombarded with all kinds of spam on my phone 24/7! i will never use this app again and neither should any of you! lots of love😻😻😻😻😻","title":"worst app in the app store😎"}},{"id":"6176466069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mchj777","date":"2020-07-09T12:22:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First of all the app took AGES to download 😤 and once I opened it my iPhone restarted and instead of the apple logo popping up a video started playing of people chanting MAGA and what I can only assume to be a Cheeto screaming at me. It was also the worst quality and glitched constantly.  After setting up my phone and email I got spammed and they even had the audacity to show up to my house and kidnap my dogs 😢","title":"Lost dogs :("}},{"id":"6176444239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alivia faith 😛","date":"2020-07-09T12:16:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app having high expectations for it to keep me up to date yet the person it’s focused on it worried about taking away a kids app to have fun just so he can feel good about him self when he should be worrying about the crisis in america like, gun permits, black lives matter!!!!

Bad mistake! The app took my credit card information and charged me $2,000 WITHOUT my permission ! I called the number on the app and it asked for my name, when I told them, they proceeded to let me know they had my address, social security number, everything !
