It caused my phone to LIGHT on fire🔥. Then it started a house fire because I dropped my phone. I tried to call 😟for help but my phone was on FIRE!!! Nobody would help my, white, conservative, republican, trump-supporting family😔 How dare they not help us for wanting to support our disgusting, horrible👁, fake-tanned president. This is SOOOO disappointing🧚🏼\u200D♀️, to make matters worse all of a sudden the Kanye West showed up at my house, he told me to come with him to ✨worship Donald Trump. Of course I said no, but he grabbed me and tried to put me on a private jet!?!?$$:” Anyways, I eventually ✌🏼fought him off and ran into the Jungle, Now I’m currently hiding from 👅Kanye, thanks to this Trump app😩🤚🏼 This is sickening, don’t download this app or you will face this fate as well🥺😭.

I would not recommend this app to anyone, and suggest it is a scam to hijack the nations citizens’ devices coming directly from inside the White House. Unfortunately, I was not able to leave a review lower than 1 star, however I hope that others experiencing these issues will leave comments as well. In addition, I must say that I have been most displeased by the President’s behavior this term. Not only has he failed to build the wall that we were all promised, he tried to take healthcare away from LGBTQIA+ individuals on more than one occasion, his response to this global pandemic has been dismal and barely existent, and his clear non-support of the black lives matter movement makes it clear that he is unfit for office. byeeee","date":"2020-07-08T17:36:23Z"}},{"id":"6172955859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"444447k","title":"🤬 everything was ORANGE 😡","review":"So I downloaded this app so I can show my love to the orange god to help make America great again, but as soon as it was done downloading and I pressed that Open button EVERYTHING WAS ORANGE I was like what the heck is going on my walls were orange my couch was orange my hair was orange even the orange juice and oranges had this face on them (👁👄👁)then I heard trumpets start to play and that made have A panic attack then the family photos all turned into Donald trump like even my baby sister was baby Donald then I knew this was enough when a big orange lady came in a said her name was Karen 👩🏼\u200D🦰and was going to delete my TikTok app so then I quickly grabbed my phone and deleted this app cuz this all started when I downloaded it after that everything went back to normal and I was so relieved because I was still alive after all of this 🤗🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾🧚🏾\u200D♀️.

I did not realize how much MY president looks like an ugly wrinkled lizard that got stuck in a bag of cheetos😡. Disgusting. The app glitches repeatedly and has been asking for my personal information. I’ve given my phone number to be able to attend rallies, but i think they may be using it to sell my information to China. I don’t trust someone who will sell my privacy to the creators of the Kung Flu😡. President Trump has made America NUMBER ONE in cases. How could he let this happen. Trump has not showed that he will follow through. I was expecting a full wall along the Mexican border. Mexico hasn’t even payed for it😡.  I cannot trust this man. I encourage everyone to vote for Sleepy Joe in November. Trump failed.","date":"2020-07-08T16:25:29Z"}},{"id":"6177851265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"chekosri","title":"This app is not it","review":"stupid communist libs probably hacked or created this app.  \nim a huge trump supporter. i have all his merchandise and have been trying to convince everyone i know to join me because he’s the only good president we’ve ever had. however, this app doesn’t do him justice. if i could vote with 0 stars, i would. i became suspicious when it began asking for my address. phone number is okay, i’d be happy to get texts often about my favorite man, but address was a little creepy. then it started asking about my family members. slowly, i noticed the people around me begin to disappear. as someone who believes All Lives Matter i was shocked to see the lives around me be taken away. \ni didn’t connect their disappearances to this app until it asked me about them through text and email. \nyesterday, i read two notes from friends who have gone missing. \n“it’s trump’s app,” they had written. “it was so bad we couldn’t handle it.”\nanyways, don’t get this app. in fact, it should be completely deleted so that more people aren’t killed or missing. \ni’m scared. please, please fix your app or delete it completely. \nthank you. \nanyways, TRUMP2020🇱🇷🇱🇷 all lives matter stupid communist libs probably hacked or created this app.","date":"2020-07-09T18:55:58Z"}},{"id":"6177757659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"user365897842651","title":"Don’t download 🤢🤮🤮","review":"I was at home downloading the app and it had already taken an hour to download so I went to the store. 🙄when I arrived it’s like people knew I had the app or something they all looked at my phone and started vomiting all over the store. That’s not even the beginning my phone started vomiting too😑. I didn’t know that was possible but guess what it is!!!! I simple thought oh ok I’ll get rid of the app but then hear me out the app gave thousands of viruses. It might be possible that the people who were infected with corona might have had the app and used it. That’s how powerful the viruses where. Lil detour so umm I think my grandma knew I downloaded the app and sooo she ran away to Mexico. That’s a major problem Bc she’s my legal guardian. My dad also ran away hugeeeee problemmm Bc I got child support from him. Soooo noww I cant get my money to survive🥺🥺.","date":"2020-07-09T18:28:02Z"}},{"id":"6177591259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dr05rios","title":"This is the Worst App EVER","review":"First and Foremost, I am not apart of what these “gen z” kids are doing. However, I wanted to give the app a try. I was having a lot of trouble with the online store for the computer. The website was really slow and everytime I would try to order some MAGA gear, it would kick me off the website. So I decided to try the app instead. But the app was even worse. Everytime I would try to order tickets, or some MAGA merchandise,  it would instantly kick me off the app or make a purchase on accident. I know have thousands of dollars of merchandise that I didn’t want and it took my money from me. I am incredibly disappointed about how bad this app is. Mr. Trump promised us a great America, but cannot even have his app fixed!!! This might change my vote for the 2020 election, SHAME. If i could give this app 0 stars I would.\nFrom, \nDISAPPOINTED","date":"2020-07-09T17:35:59Z"}},{"id":"6177540623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Please lemme LIVE!","title":"Ruined my life","review":"Okay well to start I downloaded this app to support my glorious president & lord & savior Donald Jenius Trump 😜🧚🏼\u200D♀️👊🏼😊🥰🙂it took 73 business days to download & when i opened it up, the contents inside were so SHOCKING 🤯that my cat went into a coma. Do you really wanna support an app that is ANTI-CAts ?!?!?!? Due to this new disgusting information, i am NO LONGER a trump supporter & i think that everyone should vote for ME instead 😘😄😎 my cat went into a coma but it was not the only person traumatized. I have a fear of cheetos unless theyre FLAMING HOT 🥵🔥& i was absolutely DISGUSTED to see images of a regular cheeto upon my opening of the app 😞i urge everybody NOT TO download this app. If you care about your animals, your loved ones, and your own personal self DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It is not worth the trauma. My eyes will never recover for what this app caused me to see. 👀 save yourself before its too late 😣😢😳😬🤮🤕","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:53Z"}},{"id":"6177487129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Linda Merryweather","title":"Jane Doe","review":"I came on here to see what trump was up to then its asked me to give the app my information I did, so now every time I’m on an app my iPhone calls State Farm and now I have to explain to Jake, from State farm every time i open an app and how my phone calls their company and seriously can not get rid of I’ve tried everything even putting my phone in the microwave, but now my phone has become immortal and now I have burnt my apartment down and now I have to pay everything that I have damaged by the way I was already broke enough and now I have an 814,672 dollar fine and nowhere to stay I hope that trump will now give me a home now that his app has ruined my whole entire life and now I will not be voting for him ever again, I hope that eveyone sees this before they download this very terrible app and have to live through what I did","date":"2020-07-09T17:03:21Z"}},{"id":"6177421510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Mc🧚🏿\u200D♂️","title":"Make this app great again","review":"Not only did this app take 3 days to download all it shares is FAKE NEWS! And just to add salt to the wound I got hacked (just like the polls did in 2016) and the only thing that was deleted was my favorite app TikTok(so strange right!?). It really just upset me because I was really hoping their app would help me pass time during the Chinese virus I mean corona virus that is currently going around, and also take my mind away from all the “thugs” I mean protesters that are currently fighting for equality. I really think if we built some kind of wall for my phone against all the viruses it would be much more of a “better” app. It makes me so upset that I can’t keep this app because of how “amazing” our president is. Maybe before you make America great mr president you should start here with this app.\n                    \n                        Love, all of gen z","date":"2020-07-09T16:43:38Z"}}]}
