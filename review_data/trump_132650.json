DO! NOT! DOWNLOAD!","review":"i wanted to support our orange cheeto puff god by downloading this app, but THIS APP IS HORRIBLE! it took 7 years to download and when it finally finished downloading, my wifi was super slow and my phone immediately started glitching. when i clicked into the app, it took another 7 years to finish loading and the loading screen was horrible as well. it was a the cheetos leaked nu.des. i am a minor and was forced to stare at it for 7 years. when it finished loading, i was met by the cheeto saying “go back to your country ling ling,” which really offended me. the app was just pictures of the cheeto and racist comments towards me. i had an even worse experience when i tried deleting the app, which i thought was not possible. our orange cheeto puff overlord sent his little orange oompa loompas to surround my house. they started chanting weird curses and my house started levitating. the orange god suddenly descended from the sky and screamed at me and was telling me what a terrible citizen i was and how i should just go back to chINa. i was really scared at that point but it got even worse. the oompa loompas grabbed my dog (RIP) and started sacrificing it. the orange man told me it was what i deserved for being asian in this country, because white supremacy. i considered calling the police, but i remembered how busy they were k!lling innocent black people. i ended up crying in the corner of my house for a couple hours and will probably spend the rest of my life traumatizes and in therapy. 0/10 would not recommend, unless you would like to wait 14 years to be offended and traumatized. this app should be taken off of the app store so no one else can be harassed and hurt. this app also broke my phone and i am forced to write this review from my samsung smart refrigerator."}},{"id":"6173849619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:52:17Z","userName":"kpopssss","rating":1,"title":"Very bad","review":"First of all, nobody told me a bunch of dinosaurs were going to pop up and dance to “House Of Cards “ by bts 🤮and then after that a expired Cheeto looking thing came up I don’t recommend.Anyways Christopher Bang 2020.

I had to wait 5 years for this to download and while I was waiting my lock screen was a picture of trump screaming and had text on it saying to go back to my country. After it finished downloading I received tons of viruses on my phone and it deleted every other app besides the trump app, it even made my camera roll full of his nudes 🤢🤮. Not only that, but when I opened the app it started blasting loud music that immediately made my dog run away and when I started crying I heard the cheetos voice telling me I shouldn’t have dogs because i’ll eat them. The worst part is, after that traumatic experience, every day at exactly 4:53 am it blasts his voice at full volume saying that I have the “kung flu” and eventually, I became completely deaf so I’m not sure if it’s still happening. What ever you do, please just don’t download this app, it has ruined my life."}},{"id":"6173846723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:51:10Z","userName":"ih8urfriendss","rating":1,"title":"@ih8urfriendss on tik tok","review":"WORST APP EVER 🤬🤬✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🐚🌻🌈🥳🌾🌟🌻🤬🤬🤬"}},{"id":"6173846019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:50:54Z","userName":"FuckTrumpkin","rating":1,"title":"👁👅👁","review":"Martha👩\u200D🦰was🔙an🤲average🤏dog🐶she🚺went👈woof😏and➕woof🥺and➕grrr🤬till⏰she🚺ate🤭some🤲alphabet🔠soup🥣then🔜what❔happend⌛️was🔙bizarre🤯on🔛the👁way🗺to👉Martha’s👩\u200D🦰stomach🤢the👁letters🔠lost🥱their👥way🗺they👥traveled🚗to👉her🚺brain🧠and➕now👤she’s🚺got🤲a🔤lot🔃to👀say🗣now👤she🚺speaks🗣how❔now👤brown🎨cow🐂Martha👩\u200D🦰speaks🗣yeah👍she🚺speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣what’s❔a🔤caboose🚃when🕝are👁we👥eating🦷again🔄Martha👩\u200D🦰speaks🗣hey👋joe🧍\u200D♂️whaddya💁\u200D♀️know💆\u200D♀️(my🙋\u200D♀️names👔not🙅\u200D♀️joe🧍\u200D♂️) she’s🚺not❌ always⭕️right👍but🤷\u200D♀️still💅that👇Martha👩\u200D🦰speaks🗣hi🙋\u200D♀️there👋she’s🚺got🤲a✊voice🗣shes🚺ready👍to💁\u200D♀️shout🗣Martha👩\u200D🦰will👍tell👩\u200D⚖️you👇what🤷\u200D♀️it’s💆\u200D♀️all🔄about💅sometimes🕝wrong💥but🤷\u200D♀️seldom🤏in✌️doubt☹️Martha👩\u200D🦰will✌️tell🗣you👇what💆\u200D♀️it’s👩\u200D⚖️all🕝about🤲that👇dogs🐶unique❄️testing👩\u200D🎤one1️⃣two2️⃣hear👂her🚺speak🗣Martha👩\u200D🦰speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕speaks🗣and➕communicates🧍\u200D♀️enumerates🙇\u200D♀️elucidates🧚\u200D♀️exaggerates🥶indicates🤥and➕explicates☺️bloviates🤪and➕overstates🤓and👩\u200D🦰(pants👁👅👁)hyperventilates💀Martha👩\u200D🦰to✌️reiterate📖 Martha👩\u200D🦰speaks🗣"}}]}
