But the second i opened this app i was immediantly upset. There was little to no trump information and the app was constantly glitching. Even when i wasn’t on the app, my phone was acting a mess. I’d expect an app made by the best to be the best, not the worst. I’m worried it might have stole my information. Very sketchy."}},{"id":"6177004188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Laiklyn","date":"2020-07-09T14:45:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"terrible","review":"i was really excited to download this app just for additional information about our amazing president donald trumpet...however i was soon very disappointed. the app took a very long time to download which didn’t make much sense to me. when it finally downloaded it wouldn’t open the first few times without crashing!! you would think the president of the united states would have a better engineered application. the design is subpar at best in terms of navigation and overall ease of use. i wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone. terrible setup, very disappointing."}},{"id":"6176999321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nevertickleasleepingtargaryen","date":"2020-07-09T14:44:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not what I expected","review":"From what I heard about this app I expected to be able to get in contact with our lord and saviour trump. But instead I was subjected to ad upon ad with nothing personalised to me. I just wanted my daddy to finally know how much he means to me so that I could receive his... uh... “love”, as it were. Is the president’s cheesy salty essence so much to ask for? Disappointing. \n😩👌😩👌😩👌"}},{"id":"6176979674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨Dumb thicc✨ 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T14:39:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"This app is the WORST app I have ever downloaded. It’s as if this app had given me war flashbacks it was so bad. I cannot even mention these unspeakable things this app has done to my life, my family, my neighbors dog, and even my pet turtle that died 5 years ago. Do NOT download. It’s vial, disgusting, and I wish to speak to the manager immediately. This app deserves 0 stars."}}]}
