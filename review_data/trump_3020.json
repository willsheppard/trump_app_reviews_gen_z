I took it to Apple and they had to manually restart everything. literally did worse things to my beloved cellular device than the text scam “power is power” that floated around the universe a few years back. secondly, when I finally got the app running successfully, I was greeted with a photo of an orange. like what? after the tribulations and pain this app has caused, I decided to delete and never look back. please don’t make the same mistake I did.","date":"2020-07-08T18:24:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173232443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible, caused my dog to die😿","userName":"BAD BAD BAD BAD APP S C A M","review":"I was very exited to download the app as I wanted to support our wonderful president. THE APP TOOK A WEEK TO DOWNLOAD. This has never happened before as I have very good internet. I had nothing else to do than just wait for a week, waiting for it to download. As soon as It downloaded I was very exited to use it. But as soon as I opened it up, this weird ringing music was playing that caused a swarm of ants come into my house through the crack in my door. The ants proceeded to sacrifice my dog. I screamed in terror as I have a big fear of ants and tried to stop the music as fast as I could. I tried to click on anything, making the app freeze. The music did stop and the ants went back to they’re home. I’m very sad about my dog🤮😿😿😿😿😿😿","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173221751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Hellfire Rained Down","userName":"Hdjcjdjdjbdiejsv","review":"Terrible app would not get! I downloaded this app because I obviously wanted to support our dear president Trump. But when I opened this app, my phone immediately caught on fire. Priceless photos and memories gone in the fire. In surprise I dropped the flaming ball that was my phone onto a gas tank in my garage. A fiery explosion that rivaled the breath of Smaug consumed my house, my car, and all my earthly belongings. The fire spread around my neighborhood. The school next door burst into flames, raining burning papers across the town. Our small town is now completely destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. At least we don’t have to worry about corona because we know that’s not real.  If you want to be happy, don’t download this app, or you risk the same fate.","date":"2020-07-08T18:11:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173159640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","userName":"Ghostinthegarage","review":"horrible. Horrible. HORRIBLE! This app gave away my information to secret FBI agents to take my credit card information and use it to buy tanning spray for our president 😫! I am outraged to say the least and will not be voting for Trump as he bought $600 worth of tanning spray!! I am a modest mother and now have no money to pay for my children’s soccer game uniforms and no money to help with the bake sale! Do not buy this app if you also don’t want rats giving birth in the walls of your house and eating your pets😡😡😡 \n\nThis was a HORRIBLE experience and I shall be deleting the app right away and throwing out my Trump cut out that I sleep with at night! \n                                                  Yours not truly,\n                                              A disappointed mother.","date":"2020-07-08T17:51:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172567413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP.","userName":"Hasselm","review":"This app is absolutely HORRID. I wanted to download the app to support our president, but the app took HOURS to download. When it FINALLY downloaded, it asked for so much personal information! The app makes my phone glitch to the point of it being UNUSABLE. No one should download this app. NO ONE. It will make your phone glitch, turn off, and even SET YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE. My sister downloaded the app and it overheated her phone so much that her curtains caught on FIRE, resulting in her house going in flames. On top of everything that happened, it gave me corona, gave my phone MILLION sources of porn (unwanted porn), and VIRUSES!! Now there is one more case of CORONA due to this app. I EVEN RECEIVED HERPES FROM THIS APP. This is an abomination of an app. If you value your life, privacy, and sanity, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-08T14:54:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172865833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"☺️the✨Gorgeous🍆Orange🧚🏻\u200D♀️ball🍊almost🚁killed🚛me❌","userName":"my dued","review":"I think our ✨carrot king✨is very hot although👁 when I got this app I was very disappointed.

The has only fake news about trump to make him look good. Good thing I have a brain and don’t believe everything I see in the Internet and I know about what this man has done in the past, so I know that these claims are false. Please do not download this app I do not like it one bit and the app could sell your personal information to telemarketers. Be aware of what Trump has done in the past and be aware that Trumps slogan is make America great again, which is admitting that while he was in office he did not make America great again but in fact made America worse.","date":"2020-07-08T14:45:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172407670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HOW DARE YOU","userName":"rbrecke","review":"Upon opening this seemingly helpless app, which I downloaded by accident, my eyes almost melted in my sockets and down my cheeks (which already were tear-stained). Why this suffering you ask? The first thing that comes up when you open the app is the devil’s spawn himself, Lumpy Trumpy. My skin cells were so afraid of meeting the same spray-tan fate as Cheeto Puff President’s epidermis, that they retreated into my ears. I guess that was okay though because all of the extra skin cells in my ears kept me from hearing anything that came out of Donald J. Duck’s mouth. If i had been able to hear anything that insufferable being said, my brain would have probably exploded, as it would not be able to process or contain the intolerable idiocy of lil’ Trumpy’s words.
