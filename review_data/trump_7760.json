I downloaded it onto my iPhone and every time it asked me if I wanted it to have my location, and I said no, it would still be on in settings and I couldn't turn it off. The same thing happened when they asked me anything else like if I wanted notifications. Also, it wouldn't let me move it around the screen or delete it. That's right I couldn't delete it. Now it's stuck on my phone and I dont even like Trump, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.","date":"2020-06-29T03:30:31Z","userName":"Angry millennial","title":"Ew.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6112978775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Does good necessarily follow good intentions? Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee who's just finished his education and hates the idea of picking a life-long vocation, meets a human, florist Vanessa Bloome (Renée Zellweger), while buzzing about Manhattan. She takes him to a supermarket where Barry discovers shelves and shelves of honey. Realizing it has been taken from bees - who work tirelessly and exhaust themselves for their two cups a year - he follows the delivery truck back to the honey farm, gathers evidence, and files suit against humanity. But what if Barry wins and the honey is returned to the bees, who can then slack off? An ecological cataclysm?","date":"2020-06-23T16:46:26Z","userName":"xmfhdlql","title":"Initially hopeful","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177815855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s slow, the pages don’t work, it’s takes up battery, it’s not well organized and sometimes it will only give me a blank screen. Do not download this!!! Your phone will be bombarded with trump ads and it will slow you’re data!!! I opened it and I saw trump! How despicable.\n\n(You can’t stop us, we were raised off of books showing dystopian worlds and the young rising up to stop it, don’t be suprised when we follow in their footsteps)","date":"2020-07-09T18:45:30Z","userName":"topple the dystopia","title":"Not even worth the data it takes up","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177728424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i first got the app it took FOREVER to download and i thought “this better be worth it” and when it finished downloading i opened the app and a ✨ r o a c h ✨ popped up! i was bamboozled and passed out! when i awoke the app had put a virus on my phone and my screen was ORANGE.  i went straight to the app store to write a HORRIBLE review but the virus turned into a whole MONSTER. donald trump. i screamed in terror and covered my eyes because he was naked 😭 he disappeared and i deleted the app. now i am writing this review in disgust. #freebaron2020 😝🥰","date":"2020-07-09T18:19:13Z","userName":"ASANXHEZ","title":"delete yourself 😋🍊","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177698089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I didn’t even know this app existed so I downloaded it. This app is just the worst. It spammed my notifications and I’m pretty sure it found my location. It keeps wanting me to vote for this orange man but I forgot his name. He kinda looks like he smells like beans so I decided to delete the app. Getting this app is the worst decision you’ll ever make. Don’t get it please it will find your location and make you smell like beans. It happened to me. 0/10 experienced would not recommend. don’t smell like beans guys.","date":"2020-07-09T18:10:07Z","userName":"its me alex the unicorn","title":"tiny orange in his pants","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177689253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app strictly to educate myself on Trumps plans for the upcoming election and to be better committed to being part of his army of supporters. But, as I began searching through the app it became very difficult to find any credible information. I had very high hopes for the app as it is rated highly in the news section of the App Store. But, after further research I wouldn’t even recommend this app to my worst enemy. It has no credible information and is extremely difficult to navigate.","date":"2020-07-09T18:07:24Z","userName":"Karen Tik","title":"disappointed.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177680929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I really do wonder why he call him the president.

IT WAS A DEMENTED CHEETO LOOKING OOMPALOOMPA MONSTER. I thought it was just a glitch so I exited out of the app and reloaded the page. I went back on and the joke app and the page was completely orange. I wasn’t surprised but I expected a little better from the ugly snot trash COLONIZER. Anyways I would definitely recommend if you are a die hard Racist, homophobic, and or Trump supporter. But I’m my opinion you could have chosen a better president. 🧚🏽\u200D♀️🧚🏽\u200D♀️🧚🏽\u200D♀️🥰🥰🧚🏽\u200D♀️🧚🏽\u200D♀️🧚🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T18:00:42Z","userName":"chula12345","title":"Lovely Cheeto","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177633483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to get this app but what happened when I downloaded it was just awful. First it took literally forever to download and then after a day of using it a picture of Dr. Phill naked riding a goat kept consuming my screen when I would go on the app. Apart from the vile things showing up when I go into this app, it deleted most of my data after it hacked me. This is an outrage and if apple knew what was good for them they would remove this app promptly!","date":"2020-07-09T17:49:33Z","userName":"two boobs jonson","title":"This app ruined my phone!!!!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177578947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this man spreads nothing but negativity and chooses to ignore the real problems in the world why should we let him have his own app if he don’t even know how to take care of the country right this man has been nothing but racist and rude to the people in his own country he has degraded people just off of race religion sexuality and based on their gender he should not have a say on the apps we download and the things we do on our phones and personal time if he controls everything we do in this country then he’s just turning out to be a dictator he cares nothing about the people just about the economics and the money so we have to stand up and rise against him by doing small things like this let’s rise as a community and put an end to this unfairness and create justice for the people!","date":"2020-07-09T17:32:03Z","userName":"avocado58","title":"angry american","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
