The only texts I had were from the app telling me to vote for Trump and devote my life to serving him. this is unacceptable. the only person i will devote my life to is Shrek himself. How dare this app push its radical right extremes on me and beliefs. Completely preposterous! And it filled my camera roll with pictures of Trump. I now have over 15,000 photos of him and it will not let me delete them!","rating":1,"userName":"Burgin Mae","title":"Absolutely terrible!

When I open the app, I almost got a heart attack! I saw a huge Cheeto wearing a ugly wig 🤢. The app also says cruel things about making a fake and empty promise. I was wanting to download the app to support our totally not racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic president, but it became clear that the app is harmful. It almost ended my life because this hideous Cheeto was the first thing I saw when entering the app. It would be a shame if there isn’t anything to defend our president. Like us, gen z, totally shouldn’t do anything we’re not supposed to...","rating":1,"userName":"totally a supporter","title":"End This App PERIODT","date":"2020-07-09T09:42:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175891676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app bc i wanted to take inspo from 💖🤩bunker boy✨🥰 himself BUT after waiting 72 hours for it to download 😤 i was IMMEDIATELY transported to the aquarium 🥴 which doesn’t sound SCARY but this app 😰 EXPLOITED my fear of 🐙🐬🐳aquatic animals🐠🐟🐡🦑 (they’re cool just scary) would NOT recommend this app AT ALL 😤 the only way i could escape was by promising to never reveal which spray tan the big cheeto uses BUT when they returned me back to my house 😔 my leftovers were half eaten and my pet hamster was replaced with a FISH 💀 A FISH 🐠 safe to say i will NOT be voting for 🍊 this coming november and you shouldn’t either 😤😤😤","rating":1,"userName":"scared 😣","title":"fear factor 🥴😖😩😢😰","date":"2020-07-09T09:26:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175836374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"In the Midst of all these events, this app broke my phone the minute it finally downloaded (which took hours btw) and when I finally come to open up the app what do I see? A blank screen. This app is horrible, I’m finally writing a review after getting my phone fixed but DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR EVEN COME NEAR THIS APP you can basically say it’s cursed at this point, it gave my phone a virus and I had to transfer ALL of my data from laptop, to computer, to phone all over again step by step.

The second I opened the app Mo Bamba started playing at full volume and I cannot get it to stop. It’s been 12 hours. I just know I’m going to get a noise complaint from my neighbor who thinks he’s a horse. Like legitimately he thinks he’s a horse. He has a bale of hay on his balcony and anytime I’ve gone out on mine I’ve seen him eating it while on all fours. Anytime I’ve tried making conversation with him he neighs in my face and try’s to kick me. Make Mo Bamba stop playing, I can’t deal with my horse neighbor tonight.","rating":1,"userName":"Freda Slays","title":"WORST APP IN THE APP STORE!!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:38:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175564793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’d give this 0 stars if I could, I wanted to support our orange peel ped o president 😌and this has been one of the worst apps 🤭😔😬🤨I’ve ever used 😹 like hAH do better wuss 😚👁👄👁 and after I installed my house went missing my dignity was stolen like😾- if we cant have tik tok 😹bald Cheeto puff can’t have his wack app so like 😸 my socks were stolen my bed was underground.

Ha, fun fact, just came back from reading all the reviews and they were right. This app is such a glitch and won’t even work correctly. And no, I’m not one of those teens from Tick Tock or whatever the platform is called. I’m writing this from my experience. I had just recently become an anti-trump supporter because of all the racist things he’s done in the past. Why would we want a president for a all-are-welcome country when he doesn’t support everyone who comes here? Absolute garbage.
