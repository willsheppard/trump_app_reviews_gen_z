The situation in New York was terrible.\nJohn Yinger: Community groups like the Urban League started doing audits and tests to show discrimination. In 1973, the Urban League found a lot of discrimination in some of the properties that Trump Management owned elyse goldweber: I went to a place called Operation Open City. What they had done was send “testers”—meaning one white couple and one couple of color—to Trump Village, a very large, lower-middle-class housing project in Brooklyn. And of course the white people were treated great, and for the people of color there were no apartments. We subpoenaed all their documents. That’s how we found that a person’s application, if you were a person of color, had a big Con it.\n\nThe Department of Justice brings the case and we name Fred Trump, the father, and Donald Trump, the son, and Donald hires Roy Cohn, of Army-McCarthy fame. [Cohn, a Trump mentor, had served as Senator Joe McCarthy’s chief counsel during his investigation of alleged Communists in the government and was accused of pressuring the Army to give preferential treatment to a personal friend.] Cohn turns around and sues us for $100 million.

He said to me at one point during a coffee break, “You know, you don’t want to live with them either.”\n\nHe has a history on being racist \n\nHe has a history on being a man who sexually assaults young girls and women like his own daughter \n\nHe has a bad history and even though he is doing more than the last few presidents we’ve had by giving every pay check to charities and brought paying into the White House his past defines him  just like how your past defines you no one understands what you went through or still go through but through time you’ve learned how to grow and hide those things some good and some bad he thinks that we don’t know who he is and what he stands for he may help people get out of being sex slaves but who knows maybe he helped them get in too ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","title":"No just no","rating":1,"userName":"d3feated_"}},{"id":"6172417908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:13:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is worst than the orange monster himself.","title":"horrible","rating":1,"userName":"Gjfertyilkn.
