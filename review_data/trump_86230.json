As soon as I got this app, I heard weird noises coming from my sister downstairs. I went to go check on her and I saw her eyes were rolled back into her head and she begun saying things like “Trump 2020” “Vote for the man who knows what he’s doing” “Screw Kanye West” so I knew things were not right. I shrugged it off thinking, maybe she just realized that he was amazing, but lo and behold, it started to affect my dreams. Every night I would have dreams of an orange with a long yellow feather on the top of it rolling up to me and saying “I’m making this country great, and this app even greater” I couldn’t move, speak, or even breathe. All I could do was watch as it smiled with it’s weird yellow teeth, and it’s large beady eyes staring back at me. I would wake up in cold sweats and on the floor, terrified of what may happen next. So of course I attempted to delete the app. As I did the secret service came into my house and attempted to get me to reinstall. Of course I did as they told me but stopped the download halfway through when they weren’t looking. Right now, I am currently hiding in my closet because I can hear the walking cheeto puff scream that he’s going to tear down my walls and make me pay for the repairs. I would strongly urge anyone to never download this app if they don’t want a run in with the sunburnt lemon and his secret service.","userName":"ontherunfromthesunburntlemon","isEdited":false,"title":"The Horrors of this App"}},{"id":"6177099513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:11:47Z","rating":1,"review":"After downloading the app, my bowels responded like the chocolate fountain in Willy wonkas factory.","userName":"poopingkid","isEdited":false,"title":"The app caused me to poo myself"}},{"id":"6177058464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:00:30Z","rating":1,"review":"have 😀you 👄ever 🤷🏼\u200D♀️ been 🐔 snaked 🐍 by🤑 a  🤕friend 💸 and 🍤just 🤣 for 😈the 💀clout 👩🏼\u200D🎤they’ll 🔥do 🌨 it🚴🏼 again⚒","userName":"macdjshhdjsbzhyasqueen","isEdited":false,"title":"EWWWWW"}},{"id":"6177037352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:54:45Z","rating":1,"review":"i did this first of all because of tiktok gets banned my life gets banned and it’s a terrible app. don’t try to change my mind 😁","userName":"G.
