Menus are laggy and even dis-functional at times, news is very biased, could turn you into a bigot; it is just an all round bad app. Just go to CNN!","title":"Terrible."}},{"id":"6176284277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Yaknowwhoitis2.0","date":"2020-07-09T11:31:09Z","review":"I opened the app and right away they wanted me to sign up with my phone number (probably so they can spam my phone with announcements from the orange himself). I didn’t feel comfortable sharing this information, but had no other way of fully going into the app and being able to do a thorough review. In result, I did not sign up with my number and instead deleted the app. #trumpisaraciest","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6176184110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tori1358985226","date":"2020-07-09T11:00:34Z","review":"As soon as I download this app it immediately made my phone slow down and ever 5 minutes would pop up with a notification calling me a f*g, not only that but after I hit dismiss on the f*g notification another one would pop up but this time it told me to inject Lysol into my veins and threatened to cut off my pinky toe if I didn’t..... I really like my pinky toe that just straight up rude. it also threw oranges at my face every time I farted.","title":"Worst app to ever exist"}},{"id":"6176013199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Rasa2008","date":"2020-07-09T10:06:35Z","review":"This app is honestly terrible. First it takes too long to download. Its literally a very bad and poorly made app. Then comes the worse part. It literally hacks my phone, and forces me to vote for Trump. What is this? You should have the freedom to choose who you want to vote for. No wonder why he is winning. This app literally forces me to vote for Trump, I cant do anything until I vote for him. This is honestly a very bad app and it deserve to be deleted for ever.","title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6175990725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"nininjjbhni","date":"2020-07-09T09:59:23Z","review":"It was carp it took 78 weeks to download and when I opened it my eyes flashed before my eyes— 👄— I saw..........

But when I got it, I found out the app was broken. My page was full of oranges. EVERYWHERE! All I saw were oranges. I had nightmares! I will literally sue this app for giving me mental damage.

Right after downloading this disgusting app my whole phone was wiped clean and gave all my information straight to the US so they can continue to spy on their citizens. On top of this the app is extremely hard to work I don’t even think the president himself could figure it out. If you are thinking about downloading this app I would say the answer is “no❤️”.","title":"Worst App I Have Ever Downloaded"}},{"id":"6175750655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"barbrolemew","date":"2020-07-09T08:39:02Z","review":"This ap is beyond awful. I downloaded so support my orange King donny, but it took close to 17 hours to download. After that, I figured it would be okay, but this soggy Cheeto popped up as soon as I opened the app. It definitely shivered me timbers. Soon thereafter, I felt the sudden urge to go check in my feeezer, but low and behold, there were muffins.
