Secondly, this app seems a bit racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, etc. I don’t know why it just has that energy maybe trump rubbed off on it🤷🏽\u200D♀️. And lastly I want everyone to know that I am DEFINITELY a trump supporter I love our oran- great president! Trump 2020! \n\nOn a casket😘","isEdited":false,"title":"Appalling"}},{"id":"6172988240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:57:40Z","userName":"Allama Suberu","review":"I absolutely cannot believe this app! I wanted to download this app to better be updated! But it stole my personal information! THEN MY FAMILY TURNED INTO ORANGES! I am horrified AND THEY ARENT EVEN THE GOOD ORANGES EITHER! They’re all dry and wrinkly they remind me of trump I accidentally mistook them for trump and screamed while running away from my family! I am trying to keep them alive by making sure they get enough orange juice and spray tan (just like our president) to try and help their complexion it’s making it worse but I’ll try harder. I HIGHLY DO NOT SUGGEST OR RECOMMEND GETTING THIS ALP YOUR FAMILY WILL TURN INTO ORANGES!!","isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING"}},{"id":"6172775958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:53:43Z","userName":"Bertania717","review":"I came on this app to find a reason why people support trump and the app took 8 hours to work. It didn’t give me any good reasons to vote for trump again, it actually made me dislike him even more. He is a horrible president now, and this app doesn't make. it seem like he will be a better president anytime soon. This app also gave me weird vibes when they asked for my number instead of my email. Overall just a horrible app that has no purpose, nor is doing any good for anyone.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible..Just isn’t worth it."}},{"id":"6172760642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:21Z","userName":"IH8kneegears","review":"I’ve recently tried to download the app and found way too many bugs and glitches with it. Personally, I never really agreed with what our “President” has been saying so I downloaded it to try to see if there is any good in what he says. However, the app won’t let me do that since the facts that he gives are just a simple google search. I don’t really care for what he has to say since this app really just wasted my time. Don’t Download, Highly not recommended.

Also right when I opened the app I saw a Cheeto puff and I thought we were supposed to see a President 🟧. Next he made me put in my personal information and I have been getting phone calls all night, Idk what that is about 🤷🏼\u200D♀️. When I got on the app I just looked around and they all the news on there was FAKE, just like “Make America great again,” so all that comes out of his mouth is messed up.","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download the app"}},{"id":"6172671312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:23:59Z","userName":"Trump's wife","review":"As a person who supports trump I came to download this app! ‘Cause why not! then later on I noticed some weird glitches... ALSO I kept getting weird messages. Probably because I entered my phone number...- I got messages saying,” Send feet pics” I am truly ✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️ 𝓓 𝓲 𝓼 𝓰 𝓾 𝓼 𝓽 𝓮 𝓭🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨ from this. Not only I got weird glitches and weird messages. But also found PHOTOS in my gallery. I’d find pictures of trump in my gallery. And I do not remember taking pictures of trump.

For starters it took over 2 hours to download, while it was downloading I couldn’t use my phone at all and the screen kept glitching and showing his face\n🟠👄🟠. As soon as it was done my phone was hot to the touch? I opened the app and allowed notifications, I was in the app for a total of 20 seconds and without doing anything else it deleted all of my contacts. How am I supposed to get in contact with my grandma now?!?!","isEdited":false,"title":"Wow.

Let’s talk about how this app collects personal information and gives it to Charlie Kirk and Katlyin Bennet. How do I know? People who sound JUST LIKE THEM keep calling me everyday asking me to come to some party they are having in a few months and asking me if I’ll bring my friends. Guys, I don’t think these people are even good people - said I shouldn’t bring my friend Monique or my friend Muhammad. I’m going to sleep on buyin any other Trump themed things.","isEdited":false,"title":"PERSONAL INFORMATION"}},{"id":"6172315092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:45:58Z","userName":"hahagdodeb","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS AWFUL APP!
