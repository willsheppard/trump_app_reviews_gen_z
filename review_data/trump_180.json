After it took forever to load, it glitched my phone and wiped all of my data and apps, even Minecraft which you know is a no go, and I couldn’t even close the app. Then, it said to sign up if I wanted my dogs to live, then it sent a witch to come and kill all my family and friends. I had to use black magic to make the witch leave me alone. All I had left was my two dogs. It gets worse, by the way, I searched the app for a button to reverse everything I’d just went through, and eventually I found one. It said ‘reverse’, so I pressed it. Turns out it sent a meteor to destroy my house. Again, I had to use black magic to live. Please, I am begging you, do NOT download this app if you do not know black magic. And the worst part about it, I cannot play Minecraft on that phone anymore. I’m pretty sure it’s cursed. I had to get a brand new phone because of this deadly app, please this is my reality my family and friends and dogs are dead. Donald Trump is a 🤡. 👎"}},{"id":"6173413743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do NOT download!","userName":"whoinvitedherr","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:16:39Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this game only one day ago, I fell asleep while it was downloading thinking tomorrow will be a good day! That was NOT the case. When waking up my phone wouldn’t turn on! I put it on the charger and waited about an hour while eating breakfast. Once I came back it was on the home screen. I could of sworn it was on 78% last night. I tried putting in my passcode but it wouldn’t let me! Once I got in, my phone was glitched. My apps were gone and so were my contacts!! Then it FROZE! My stepdad repairs things in his spare time, and he said nothing was wrong. After 3 more hours of waiting, it worked! But as soon as I turned the app on our (🍊) president started speaking, saying very rude things! That’s when my dog Biden started barking!! (He is a very respectful dog who never barks) then a rat came! I think this app put a spell on me..the rat bite me and now my finger is infected! Now I have to schedule an appointment to the doctors. A lot of random things happened during the day, like a book fell, then someone patted me on the back, etc. And when I took a nap, the blanket was across the room and the app was open! I know I turned my phone off. Long story short DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"}},{"id":"6176945932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE i don’t recommend","userName":"hi im feff","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:30:08Z","rating":1,"review":"i was extremely excited to download this app to support our wonderful, handsome, hard working 🍊orange🍊. but after waiting A WEEK for it to download i was starting to get a little annoyed. i opened the app only to see a ✨cheeto✨ i got so scared that i threw my phone and the man himself, the 🍊orange🍊, appeared right at the foot of my bed. he just stared at me and said nothing. his eyes were growing huger and huger the more i looked at him. he was starting to flash different shades of 🍊orange🍊 and it was quite strange. he started to grow taller and taller and he put a huge hole in my ceiling. he kept chanting racist and sexist things to my whole neighborhood. the next thing i knew, trump 2020 posters and our presidents NUDES were appearing all over my room and the neighborhood. i quickly run over to my phone and delete the app. everything goes back to normal except the skylight mr trump added to my room. i am expecting him to pay for my ceiling repairs. i think i am going to need EXTENSIVE therapy, but it’s good because i found a therapist who charges $250 a session and i expect trump to pay for my sessions as an apology for putting me through that traumatizing experience. k bye."}},{"id":"6176116571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Unsatisfied, WORST app i’ve installed. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!","userName":"pia flooooo","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:39:41Z","rating":1,"review":"First of all, not only did this app make my whole phone glitch tremendously but also completely power it off for hours and when my phone finally turned back on... it took another 5 hours to install, I was furious! My phone is brand new and I went to get it checked, it was just this horrendous app. If I could rate this very unprofessional app being completely honest, I would rate it a -20/10. I dislike this app so very much, it also glitches countless times while i’m on it for only a COUPLE of minutes. This app is also so confusing, extremely hard to handle and to learn how to do things on it. Absolutely no instructions which makes it even worst! Half the time I am confused, if the glitches even let me even do anything on it. I am getting hacked because of it on all my platforms!!! And that is absolutely ABSURD!!!! I can not begin to explain how angry I am because I had to change ALL of my passwords. That is crazy, ALL the events are very very delayed, none of them are new and some are fake. Horrible app, super unprofessional! Never had a worst app in my life: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS APP."}},{"id":"6175915856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🧚😊Trump 2020💅🏻✨on a tombstone💅🏻☺️🧚","userName":"crcrcvtybnhvrxrx","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:34:45Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is bad! The worst! Horrible! It is most definitely not making America great and I am personally offended by this app! It stole my information and now I get notifications that my phone has a virus every time I press the “u” key not only that but my phone flash light turns on in the middle of night! This app is the worst I downloaded so I could reserve tickets for trumps circus but no I couldn’t reserve tickets??? How am I supposed to support republicans and our GREAT nation if the app is BLUE Mr. President I am offended how dare you. This never happened with Obama. Not only is my flashlight turning on but all my windows rattle when I get a notification. I am horrendously offended that this app could be taking my information and giving it to the government I would much rather give my data to China. This app is the worst thing I have ever seen it’s ugly, poorly formatted, and not designed well. I wish I never saw this app frankly this was the worst app I have ever downloaded and I wish we could get rid of this app and make sure no other Apple store participates could EVER see it!!! ✨🧚You’re done Donald😊✨take the L and Gen Z might stop messing with you 💅🏻☺️🧚"}},{"id":"6174878661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dont download the app","userName":"innitluv","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:23Z","rating":1,"review":"this app will literally install a virus to your laptop, phone, and any other electronic device you can have!!! it also murder a your whole family. i woke up around twelve pm and i stepped into the kitchen and my whole family was dead, they even took my smart fridge too! now im no expert but im pretty sure they stole my bed too!!(including my carpet)when i woke up, i was on a hard wood floor. we don’t have hard wood floors!! they stole my dragon and some of my minecraft worlds. you shouldnt download this app unless you want all those things happening to you!! if you don’t think that’s bad enough, wait and see what they did to my family in alabama. they invaded their house with aliens , including a ghost. now im no mathmatologist but that seems like a lot to handle whenever you’re 67 with five kids and  no job because you live off of stolen money. they also stole their phantom!! mr spanks did no harm to anyone whatsoever yet they still stole him, burned him, cut his eyes out and hang him out on our wall!! don’t download this game because all those things only happen when you do!! don’t believe me? just wait and see what my friend maria says... what a shame.."}},{"id":"6174533853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I hereby decree that Trump is a bastard.","userName":"MM 27504410714673","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:49:14Z","rating":1,"review":"Oh, te s'rrow this app did cause me.

I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” trump first denied the remarks but in 1997 in a playboy interview he said “The stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.” in 1992 the trump plaza and hotel had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred black and women dealers off the tables to accommodate big-time gamblers prejudices. there is many more that i can list but i’m tired and it’s a simple google search luv 💞🧚\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6174429120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting Array Of Communism","userName":"@BerniesIntern On Twitter","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:18:56Z","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app,  I was hoping for some fun clean family friendly trump content! But when I went to the app, I saw some of the Nazi communists on it !!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Communism is so disgusting, and to see it on lord trumps app was horrendous! My child downloaded this app so he could talk to middle aged men about trump (proud of him) but instead he got Nazi communists! I was disgusted! I took his phone and shot it with my AR-15! He cried, and I laughed. “No commies are welcomed in the U-S-Of-A, baby” I exclaimed! He cried like a little baby for a few hours, so I had to get rid of the issue (lol) and exercise my 2nd amendment right. After his funeral (rip my baby fly high) I decided to re download the app and give it a second try. I was immediately met with my type of people! racists, sexists, homophobes, you bet! I was so happy! The death of my son looked over me, making it hard to enjoy the app! After a while, I met a man, David! He was so kind to me, and was an active member of the community. Well.... here is the big news! We are getting married next week, and I am so happy to become Ms. Karen Duke! \nOverall this app is a haven for communists, 0/10 would not recommend"}}]}
