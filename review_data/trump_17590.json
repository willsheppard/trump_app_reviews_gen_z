This app made my phone almost blow up. It was smoking. I was so scared. It also started making a siren noise at midnight every night. I don’t know why it did that but it made a siren noise then at the end it said trump 2020. I don’t understand why they would do this. I might just not vote for trump again just because of this stupid app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:40:04Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172927529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"covid-19 5-ever","title":"Kidney failure","review":"I downloaded this app to try and support this amazing country but the app took two days to download and after it downloaded my phone crashed and wouldn’t work leading me to have to get a new phone. This stressed me out so much because of the risk of COVID and the risk of my social life depleting. Long story short my blood pressure rose too high and I had to take my moms only kidney she had left.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:38:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172885893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stream Yungblud for Clear skin","title":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","review":"I just downloaded this app and right when I downloaded it I went on there and I put all his merch into my car but then I got a call from Gabbie Hanna and she was calling me a bully like what the hell and then Shane Dawson was trying to do stuff to my dogs horrible disgusting never going to use this app again but I am going to keep all the merch in the cart😋💕✨ 🧚","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:25:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172849080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👏🏼✨🥰👑","title":"Horrible app don’t download 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨👑🟠","review":"This app has been making my phone glitch so much.

Yeah the need of this app is sort irrelevant. We all know you’re passed and reputation so the fact that you need an app to convince people that you’re a good person through your actions is kind a messed up. Yeah of course people change and sometimes for the better but we all know you’re mentally unstable and psychologically unfit to be president.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:46:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172689005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Isabeara","title":"MAGA 2020 ✨🥰😍❗️","review":"I opened this app only to realize it took 4 days to download 😩. I put 4 million dollars worth of merchandise in my cart and it wouldn't let me purchase it 😔🍆. Very sorry for the inconvenience, but i feel that my opinion is very valid 🥰, so if you would please tell me your secret to that luscious, silky orange skin and that thin balding hair 😍 i would very much appreciate it. BUT just wait till hellen keller hears about this 😨😱. yeah ❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:28:59Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172557926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kass🦋💙","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"First of all it took almost 4 HOURS to download \n\nSecond of all the app itself should be a little better considering that Trump spends his billions on campaigns rather than helping the country become great again.\n\nThird of All this made my phone glitch SO MUCH. For example this is taking me forever to type because my keyboard keeps glitching out. This all started a couple seconds after I opened the app.\n\nAnd this app NEEDS to be deleted. As well as trump being a president. He’s doubled the Nations debt and not increased jobs. All he’s done is stood there looking like a Cheeto puff and trying to build a wall we don’t need. \n\nThank you, have a nice day","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172436123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yeetrisss","title":"tik tok lives matter✨","review":"i was a girl in the village doin alright, til i became a princess over night, now i gotta figure out how to do it right, so much to learn and see. up in the castle with my new family, and a school thats just for royalty, a whole new enchanted world is waiting for meeee, im so excited to be SOFIA THE FIRST!!! im finding out what being royals all aboutttt SOFIA THE FIRST making my way its an adventure everyDAYYYYYY!!! its gonna be my time, to show them all im SOFIA THE FIRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTT","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:18:44Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172368775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Whelkyshelky","title":"Horrible horrible horrible horrible","review":"I am ashamed that our president made as horrible as as this I kept glitching when I went in to like this big orange dude I thought it’s supposed to be our president and like I’m gonna give him my phone number I don’t want him calling me horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible I wish I could leave zero stars this was the worst ever ever ever","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:00:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172348614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"oooooooofofoofofofofof","title":"Don’t download it","review":"This app has caused more problems than I would’ve liked it to. First of all, it took 2 hours to download, despite the fact that I have high speed internet. There’s also ads that pop up that say “white power.” Personally, this is offensive to me, a black woman. I used to support Trump, but I don’t think I can do that if he is against my own race.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:55:09Z","rating":1}}]}
