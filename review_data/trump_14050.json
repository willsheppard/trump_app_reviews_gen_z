I tried to fix the issue but it seems the app decided to go golf instead of fixing itself. It would be one thing if the app was trying to fix itself but time after time, it just continuously shuts down. The app can‚Äôt handle too many tasks at once.","date":"2020-07-09T09:00:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Golf Challenger"}},{"id":"6175814047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ARE YOU KIDDING?","review":"this app is very disappointing.
