Shortly after I started having nightmares that this orange cheeto guy was following me and I couldn’t run away. Then I started getting text messages saying the person knew where I lived and that he’d come find me and when I asked who it was and I said I was calling the cops and all he said was “I’ll grab you by the p****”. At this point I was absolutely disgusted. Then the next night when I was going to sleep I heard my closet door open I sat up frightened. Then this orange man crawled out of my closet NAKED and yelled MAGA then scurried across the floor (did I mention he was naked man boobies and chode all out) and jumped out my window.
