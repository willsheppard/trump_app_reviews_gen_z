It doesn’t do anything but wasting your time. It keeps sending irrelevant notifications to my phone and a few minutes I was trying to get on the app to check what’s going but it kept kicking me out saying I am not young enough for the President💀 what the heck!!! And when I finally got back in it asked me for my feet pictures for $50/picture but if I painted certain color the price will go up to $100. I believe since he is the president he could pay me more than that. But again this app is just a scam! It’s a waste of your time! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!👿 I wish I could gain those minutes back while trying to be a good citizen to support him 👁💧👄💧👁✌🏼 AGAIN THIS APP IS A SCAM","userName":"Nattythepooh","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175317695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!","date":"2020-07-09T05:58:14Z","review":"i got this app first to support the amazing president trump and all of a sudden notifications started popping up all over my phone, two men in white hoods came up to me and threatened to punch my grandma if i didn’t come with them, i figured they tracked me from the app? anyways i told them my grandma was dead so they proceeded to grab me by the arm until my bf had to come out with his sword and kill them, they are now in my basement but i have severe trauma from it. everywhere i go now all i see is white hoods following me, i don’t know what is going on but i believe they’re tracking me, it’s very scary and bc of that whenever i go out i have to carry a body guard and pepper spray in my back pack, very terrifying :(","userName":"chlohoe0222/","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175166909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"There’s a horse loose in the hospital","date":"2020-07-09T05:01:33Z","review":"I opened the app to make sure I stayed updated on what the horse was doing. It turns out that the horse can take the elevator? I didn’t know it knew how to do that. Also, I think there was a glitch because the horse said that it wanted to run toward the baby incubators and “smash it with my hooves.” That doesn’t sound like something MY horse would do. Anyway, I got what I wanted with the updates. I was sent a ton of notifications about the horse some days, but the creepiest days were when I didn’t hear from the horse at all. Therefore, I have deleted the app. Hopefully this review is helpful, but now I don’t know what’s going to happen with the horse... but neither does the horse I guess.","userName":"GrassIsTrash","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175048200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T04:22:56Z","review":"First of all he is trying to take down TikTok second he is racist third this app took a lot of storage that I needed for something fourth he don’t like other races than his and he is one of the worst presidents we have had he was in the movie the little rascals and he was the spoiled brat dad and I can see why he was such a brat and and everyone that hases TikTok and likes it hates u cuz u taking it down and I feel bad for the people that hases a good platform on TikTok because they worked so hard for it and this app is one of the worst apps ever he started a lot of bad things like depoting hard working Mexicans who came here to have a better life but they got deported even for what they did for this country","userName":"we dont go out without a fight","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174908846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very ugly no kiss for him🥳✨🧚","date":"2020-07-09T03:39:15Z","review":"Daddy trump is not daddy trump no trump no daddy not a daddy to me sir that isn’t very nice that he would cancel us like this & so I’ve decided to cancel him no more trump trump & no more hump hump for him🥰any who as I was saying since sir trump is no longer daddy president I would like to say I would gladly replace him & create a much better country for our people🤩there will be no more hate towards anyone & we will all like Cheeto dust hair free because no one needs that in their lives✨also as we all know trump is trying to cancel tiktok so I say we just drop him as our president because no one needs a fake friend and that is exactly what he is😳but yuh that’s all have a nice day and pls never use this app cuz is kinda nasty ngl👁👄👁","userName":"Fantastic panda","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174899024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worse App Ever!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:36:21Z","review":"This app literally asked for my number🤢🤢🤢 I don’t know about y’all but i don’t give my number to strangers!! especially old white weird strangers😭😭 I don’t like that this app is promoting bigotry, homophobia, transphobia,xenophobia and on top of all those pbobias..

Then he WENT TO MY ROOM and ate all 5 of my fish straight out of the water while he stared me straight in the eyes and then proceeded to hump the tank until there was no water left! I was disturbed! He then proceeded to grab my guinea pigs and squeezed as hard as he could. Im not sure if this is initiation but it wasnt very fun for me or any animals involved. Will be deleting this app immediately before he comes for the important members of my family(he already made my brother into a pot pie and made the rest of us watch as he ate it), i dont want anyone else to be harmed!

First it started off with like tripping then my sister feel down stairs dropping her chicky nugs like who would drop somebody’s chicky nugs  that is so wrong. Then my mom went outside thunder struck and she had to go to the er. Then my dad choked from hearing me download the app and we had to go to the er for him too. Finally, I was the last one left. I was shaking fearful of what punishment would be bestowed upon me. Then my time didn’t come. The fear was the worst pain any of us felt. After this review I’m deleting the app and telling anyone who plans to download not to because this app is evil.","userName":"wthe worse game ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174676104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Please...god no;)","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:52Z","review":"I was told my a person to get the app so I did and thought why not it could be cool I mean he’s a celebrity that had yet to be canceled so why not so I got it and at first it was chill but then I started to get scared when I was on it searching for daily tea about chase Hudson and then out of no where I seen a orange rat and I got scared so I left the app then when I went back on the next night it was still there so I had to delete it and every night before I go to sleep I always see it and I’m pretty sure it’s haunting me. So I don’t recommend this app at all pretty scary if u asked me. I mean as a president you would think he would make it an actual good app but I guess hiding for so long gets to ya ya know.!!","userName":"chickenfacehut","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174400482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app was smellier than my uncle on a hot summer day","date":"2020-07-09T01:10:18Z","review":"this app is literally the SMELLIEST app I have ever had. I never write reviews but I was appalled by the aroma that was this app 🤢. I open the app immediately and a man who looked unnaturally orange came across the screen. I was confused why he was there so I did some investigating and there were RATS literal RATS inside of the screen. I am disgusted. it is a violation to all the health codes to have that many rats inside of an app. There were so many rats that they began to jump out of my screen and into my own home. I had to call an exterminator to figure this mess out. Now my house is smelly and that’s where I draw the line. I can’t deal with this stench. Get it away. This shouldn’t happen to people.","userName":"sprklingskiddles","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
