I downloaded it at 4:32 in the morning, and so the loud music made the aliens in my closet wake up and try and take me back to Gongarshi, their home planet. I was very scared and then all of a sudden the aliens went away and I was happy again. When I opened it back up, it started a fire in my kitchen and that forced me to call the fire department. But my phone was stuck in the fricken app so it didn’t let me call the fire trucks. My house burnt down and now I am homeless and have severe trauma that will need years of therapy to undo. I do not recommend this app unless you want to be homeless and lost. 🧚\u200D♀️🧚💅✨🧚\u200D♂️✨✨","userName":"anonymous13568996532677643","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"One star"}},{"id":"6179625976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:33:48Z","review":"Trump 2020!","userName":"HOPEEW","rating":5,"isEdited":false,"title":"🇺🇸♥️"}},{"id":"6179625820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:33:45Z","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with my president Mr. Trump so that I can attend rally’s keep updated on news and other related Trump events & when I created my account the app crashed, my phone froze I needed to turn it off & on again to find all of my photos numbers & other important info gone !

If I didn’t kill my dog soon enough they would fire bomb my home and all my family so I asked it to stop but it just told me my butt wasn’t phat enough to give orders.

Since downloading this app, I cannot stop thinking about suckling the President’s teet each and every night as Tucker Carlson and the rest of Fox News lectures me to sleep with constant commentary about those evil Clinton’s and their plan to destroy America with their vaccines and gender neutral bathrooms 😱 (oh, the horrors!). I’m so glad that I’ve downloaded this app to begin my brainwashing and turn me into the little republican conspiracy-theory-spewing puppet I was always meant to be.
