The man never had any experience beforehand in politics and wasn't even that great a businessman. Just take a look at what his leadership has done with COVID-19, while every other country has descending cases we are the only country rapidly increasing in cases and people are still ignorant and brainwashed under his control. Even if you don't care about anything but white people, know that he is turning America into a fascist state. This is my first time voting and I'm definitely using it to get him out of office!","userName":"sabrahman","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:55:57Z"}},{"id":"6172854486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"Who is this man?","review":"I saw that this app had very low reviews so I decided to check it out, but when I opened the app I saw this horrible racist man as the background. I was APPALLED. I thought to myself what is this app even about that could involve such a disgusting man? Apparently the app is all about supporting this man. That is why I had to leave a 1 star rating. \n(P.S I would have gave it a 0 if possible)","userName":"jdstheman","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:16:27Z"}},{"id":"6172278781","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Hate the app","review":"I don’t want you guys in my life and I’m not gonna wanna is time to do something for me haha was the night that you needed me and you can I just want you and your mom to tell you what I was gonna was the night you want me and you want me you want you I love ya I wanna was a nice night I hate  ya I wanna talk about you I love you and I’m gonna was your birthday I love you so bye I wanna talk about you and I’m gonna the morning I hate you and I’m gonna morning you want me you want I can talk about you and I’m sorry good bye I don’t know why you wanna I want you and I’m sorry good bye I don’t know why you wanna I want you and I’m sorry good bye bye hateyou and I","userName":"pau pau 10","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:35:39Z"}},{"id":"6172064836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"Guys I am telling you I came on here for some good Christian content but I have found that the FASCISTS ARE TAKING OVER!!!!!!!!! As soon as I opened the app my phone burst into flames while shouting about how my phone was not on fire???? And how I should appreciate how well the app is handling the fire???? Also the app said that it represents white supremacy and I’m not sure how Christian that is considering that Jesus was Middle Eastern according to most facts and common sense. Also I’m pretty sure there’s a porn of someone getting peed on in here and somehow that’s the LEAST of our problems....

As a 45 year old white woman I don’t really understand the inner workings of this type of thing. However the fact that it blocked me out from all my other apps (such as face book) was a big problem for me. Even if this problem is fixed I still wouldn’t redownload the application. Mr. Trump has deeply disappointed me and has lost me services. I would really like to talk to the upper management of the development team or even trump himself to ask them what the thought they were doing.","userName":"A deeply unsatisfied user","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:08:14Z"}},{"id":"6149677777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ate my dog","review":"i downloaded this app 📱 because it looked pretty 😎🙈 and then 🙄mr poopy 💩 man 👨 came to my house 🏠 and pulled down ❌ the door 🚪 and started screaming 😱 and then i started crying 😢 and said ‘no ❌ mr poopy 💩 man 👨 pls don’t do this 😢’ and he said ‘i don’t 🙈 care 😡 what 🤬 you say’ and i started crying 😢 because that was very hurtful 🤧 and he laughed 🤭 at me 🥺 and then 🛑 i was crying 😢 and i saw him 🖤 from the corner 🔪 eating my dog 🐕 whole 😀 and then my dog was eaten 😋 even tho i was saving that 🤨 for later 😒 anyway 😔 this app has completely 😕 RUINED 😠 my life 🤢 so i’m writing ✍️ this review 🎃 and maybe this 😈 will WARN 🚨 you about the dangers ✈️ of this app 🙄🙄🙄","userName":"mariokart2020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T20:23:48Z"}},{"id":"6145777365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"if I could give this app a lower rating I definitely would. Trump is a clown🤡🤡. He’s abused his power long enough😳 when I got the app my eyes started to immediately burn👁🔥 I couldn’t look at it for more than two seconds before I could feel my brain start to melt. I had never been in this amount of pain EVER. Trump is a terrible terrible person and needs to be exposed and people need to listen. My eye sight is completely ruined because of this app ❌👁. Just terrible. If I could give this a 0/10 I would. But unfortunately I can’t😞👎. Blm everyone ✊.

I downloaded the app to see which candidate was the best but the app keeps sending me notifications and most of them telling me to vote for trump, like all the time. Today I woke up with 30 notifications saying “considering voting for trump this year?” or “trump 2020” or “let’s build the wall” and honestly I did not expect this app to be so obnoxious, I wanted information, not coercion. So DO NOT download the app if you don’t want to be annoyed 24/7.","userName":"heidirbbidnf","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T16:38:42Z"}},{"id":"6136553278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I am 56 years old and I love our president. I downloaded this app in support of trump and his campaign but I am utterly disappointed!! \n\nRight after downloading the Trump 2020 app my chicken started to uncontrollably shake and recite the entire bee movie script! I want to support my favorite president but I cannot continue to use this app for obvious reasons! I will not be downloading any of trumps apps anytime in the future. My precious chicken had not recovered since and every now and then shakes as if the devil has taken over him. Thank you trump for everything you have done to this nation. I support you, but not your app. 😡","userName":"Faith445","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T16:27:39Z"}}]}
