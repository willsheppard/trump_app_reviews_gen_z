It says it comes within one second. I went outside to check my mailbox. No tickets were there. The app also makes my phone super slow. If you value your phone don’t get the app."}},{"id":"6178237860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Crashes your phone","date":"2020-07-09T21:04:21Z","userName":"taylor23689631","review":"I am trump supporter and will be voting for him but this app does not work. It crashes my phone every time I open it. I honestly think the app gave me a virus too. I would not recommend the app to anyone because of all of the bugs. A lot of fixes are needed. #trump2020"}},{"id":"6178235464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T21:03:32Z","userName":"KATY10101","review":"I know that there are TONS of fake reviews from the libs and socialists but I’m very disappointed with the app. I expected much better from an app supported by President Trump. It hardly loads when I try to sign up for rallies and events. I guess I’ll have just have to go on the website."}},{"id":"6178214318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s designed to to overwhelm you","date":"2020-07-09T20:56:00Z","userName":"howmanynamesarehere","review":"The whole thing is made to completely shove info into your face. I don’t want the same stuff sent to me by text, email, by calls, and this app. I got it so I could have one place for everything about our president. Please fix this"}},{"id":"6178178230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible Application","date":"2020-07-09T20:43:21Z","userName":"Karen Smith ✨","review":"The app takes hours to download and doesn’t even work! User interface is difficult to work with and customer service is awful. Honestly, no one with such horrible app development skills should be elected president. Choose wisely when voting."}},{"id":"6178170328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not a help at all","date":"2020-07-09T20:40:37Z","userName":"ThaddeuslovesMayo","review":"I was very interested to find a nice news source directly for my phone. Sadly this caused my phone to glitch and it was a burden. The notifications are non stop but then you can’t click on it to go back to the app!! Because of these reasons it gets 1 star for me"}},{"id":"6178142012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T20:30:56Z","userName":"Christmastreestar8900","review":"This app is absolutely horrible, not only does it look like it was created by a 7 year old but it’s entirely stupid and serves no purpose. It made my phone crash and made my phone so much slower than it used to be! I have a new phone so this should not be happening"}},{"id":"6178130839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Slowed my phone.","date":"2020-07-09T20:27:13Z","userName":"ldauysltain","review":"My coworker recommended this app because I don’t like reading the news but wanted to stay up to date. The information on the app appears biased & sometimes just false. Also very much slowed down my phone & the app crashes so much, it’s not worth having."}},{"id":"6178120575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this is so stupid","date":"2020-07-09T20:23:40Z","userName":"hi-3-","review":"i can not BELIEVE this, how did this even go through testing if that’s even a thing?! it takes up so much space HALF of my phone is taken because of this stupid app. everything lags, typing this is a absolute NIGHTMARE as it keeps crashing. ridiculous."}},{"id":"6178119119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Glitchy phone","date":"2020-07-09T20:23:14Z","userName":"dumptrump1820","review":"This app would crash every time I opened it and then would have my phone go all wonky for hours afterwards. I was just looking for information about rallys, campaigns, etc. but I find it better NOT to use this app. I would expect more from our president! Trump 2020 💕✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♀️"}}]}
