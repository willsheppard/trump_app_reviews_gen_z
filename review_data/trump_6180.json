This app, when downloaded, will request access to ALL features such as your camera, microphone, and Bluetooth so that it’s able to not only TAP INTO your conversations at home but ALSO track you with the latest stealth Bluetooth technology—this technology is known to interfere with other frequencies and it actually DESTROYED my television as soon as I opened it up. This is government tracking AT ITS FINEST. 0/10 recommend, KEEP AMERICA SECURE! 😡","date":"2020-07-09T02:43:00Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ryan.bealey"}},{"id":"6174705521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is phone cancer","review":"This app would’ve been better if I was elected president and here’s how.\nPrologue: I was standing in front of trump tower browsing the App Store and as soon as I saw this app and I chucked this phone so far it completely circled my the earth and hit me on my third eye resulting in an accidental download.\nBody: I had no idea I downloaded this app but when I did I realized my close friend kwong sinh Minh Ming Ching Wong Wong long beech wayng could change a few things but before I opened the app I had to put on my ultra thicc H-Eye-V glasses to prevent my cheese touch from becoming terminal\nConlclusion: App trash get smash","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jpgpsee"}},{"id":"6174692389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ZERO STARS","review":"my cat told me in a dream i must download this app. believing her, i did. immediately the police were called. war began in my small 600sqft apartment. gunfire for hours. flash bangs. grenades. i began to binge eat out of fear. down went one pop tart. then two. then six. my stomach began to swell under the pressure. suddenly, a bullet punctured my abdomen. out fell the remains of my refrigerator. pop tarts of every flavor. chocolate milk still in the carton. the gunfire stopped as everyone observed the obscure sight that was my body. trump didn’t even care. he sent a postcard telling me i shouldn’t have downloaded the app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:43Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"samifr"}},{"id":"6174679532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting app","review":"I feel like trump who is a racist persons who yet does not like Mexicans or other races just because they are not white. This kind of person should not be in this platform like the App Store he is not a good influence on young kids if they now him. I am yet a Mexican his wife is not white so yet his wife should go to her country as he says.

Not cool trump 👎. This app destroyed my life because after my phone got infected i started to lose my whole family slowly. My partner left me and took the kids away in a custody battle because my phone was too swarmed with trump 2020 and MAGA info. There were too many bots and they could not handle all the spam.

I was confused: my phone has never done this before, what could the issue be? I tried to open the app again, and my phone logged me out of the app AGAIN and then my phone started SMOKING. I think it might have been all of the ignorance and hatred locked within this app: it’s too much for my little iPhone to handle. I made some art to reflect how I feel.\nI call this one: ( º ͟ʖ º )\n                         ᕦ( )ᕥ\n                            / \\\n                            - - Bold and Brash","date":"2020-07-09T01:45:39Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Rebellion1217"}},{"id":"6174513089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"...a disaster","review":"This app is the worst app on the planet. The moment I opened it up I seen a orange Cheeto like why not a hot Cheeto 😪. Besides that point It was supper glitchy and such bad quality like I thought my iPod was worse than this. I turned my phone completely off for a month and came back to the app and it didn’t work. I wasted a month of my time without my phone, like I should have not even paid my phone bill at that point. I just need this app to vanish, people will waist their time on this app. (Just go make yourself a cup of noodles and watch some movies 😉)","date":"2020-07-09T01:43:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hotcheetosarethebest"}},{"id":"6174512276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it made me cry","review":"this app is so terrible. i downloaded it about 6 hours ago and it just finished downloading. i finally open it and it wants permission to send me notifications through my phone??? what kind of facist commie app is this???!? and it asked for my number too?!?!?! do i look like i would allow some app have my personal information?!?! this is how they put worms in your brain people!!!!
