My phone also started to glitch not turning off when right when I pressed the button. My texting app got glitchy and I know it’s not because my storage my storage is fine.

It took two days to download and I had to restart my phone. When I turned it back on I was HORRIFIED. All that was on my phone was a picture of donny boy in the NUDE. I had night terrors for three consecutive nights. Finally, I had a night with no panic dreams. But when I opened my eyes I was dead. I asked God what happened, he said I died from the trauma of seeing his orange wee.","userName":"banana fanna fafooty","title":"THIS APP KILLED ME!

When I downloaded this app I was sent to the hospital with the amount of times I hit myself. Trumps app made me physically hurt myself and sent me to the hospital with a black eye and a loose butthole. Do not download this app. In conclusion the president wants me to die and have a loose butthole while doing so when I previously had a very 𝓽𝓲ᧁꫝ𝓽 ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑒.","userName":"𝙱𝚊𝚛𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙","title":"Mmm mm....

I know this app caused it because I was having great battery life the last few days with my other usual apps. the day I downloaded this app, my phone lost 25 percent battery in 10 minutes. it was terrible. I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"We give reviews","title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T15:09:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177087616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a lover of citrus, I downloaded this because of the orange on the front. I was quickly diss appointed in what the United States has come to and the hate people spread. BLM. DUMPTRUMP. Let’s get an administration that is generally tolerant of basic things, like people to start off with. They are trying to get rid of tiktok for what reason?? Because they are worried about what we can do. This terrible excuse for a human can go burn in hell.","userName":"vk5080","title":"Did not fulfill my needs, I want Obama back.","date":"2020-07-09T15:08:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177086250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"took two days to download, and when i opened it the app was blank! not anything in sight across the whole app! When it finally did load the information was very badly organized and written. ✨💘trash, but make it flaming✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💞💅i really hope apple realizes what they’re allowing to be put on the appstore, it would be such a shame if it was taken off and no one could use it :(","userName":"lizzy_32","title":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️absolutely awful✨💗","date":"2020-07-09T15:08:07Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177065139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🧚✨This app took TWO WEEKS to download and then I almost died when I opened it there was what I thought was a Cheeto crumb on my screen was actually the ✨pedo orange✨ I was trying to support!

What do you need that for? Felt to me like a breach of privacy ~ there is no need for you to have my cellphone number. What are you trying to do? So much info is tied to cellphone numbers... easily something that could link to other information. Shame :/ :/ :/","userName":"M.
