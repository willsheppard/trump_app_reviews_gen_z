I wanted to see Trump’s views vs Biden’s. His app was EXTREMELY hard to navigate, and once I finally found his viewpoints, I found the bear minimum of opinions, plans, etc. This app was unhelpful, misleading, and confusing. I highly suggest not downloading this app."}},{"id":"6178294222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:25:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Would Not Recommend","userName":"wjxnsnja","review":"I'm not a little kid.
