But I had some difficulty accessing it bc my Apple ID password is located inside my chastity belt. Luckily my pastor found the key and unlocked it. But then I realized that the app actually didn’t let you FaceTime Mr. Trump, so I obviously relocked my precious cargo to save for when I could finally meet señor trump in person. Anyway, when I first opened the app I was in awe by how incredibly cheap it looked. I mean I understand that the US is in debt, but I thought they would at least shell out a couple Benjamin’s for this app. But I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt until the page fully loaded. Horror filled my body as I witnessed Ronald Tump slowly approach the screen in a painfully realistic boyfriend POV, whispering “Let’s go to Wall Street baby.” I had never been so startled in my life and I called my therapist immediately afterwards. I was hoping that maybe the developers of this app could help me pay those bills. Lastly —and what terrified me the most— was that ever since I downloaded the app, I’ll occasionally wake up from a KFC induced trance; covered in Cheeto dust and slobbering on my freakishly small hands after consuming multiple buckets of finger lickin good meat. All in all, whether for good or for bad, this app has changed my life. That being said, I wouldn’t wish my life on anyone. Godspeed to you brave young souls who take your chances with the devil and click the download button. As for me though, my time may be running out. I’ve had a good ride and each person’s flame must extinguish eventually. Thank you."}},{"id":"6179357720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mia Elizabeth Dickshnot","isEdited":false,"title":"no just no","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:03:04Z","review":"👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6179357672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ajshbd abd","isEdited":false,"title":"Ass","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:03:03Z","review":"I tried to download it and it Keeped asking me for random stuff just because I was Mexican"}},{"id":"6179357696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"PrestonPlayzFan 947207","isEdited":false,"title":"Read it, it’s worth it","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:03:03Z","review":"Ugh! I can’t believe this happened to me. I was minding my business about to download this app, it was 4:20pm and I was just about to finish eating my 69th donut of the day. As the app finished downloading, I was taking my last bite of my donut. My alexa started playing 💕for-in-her💕and MY OVEN STARTED DANCING TO IT! So i got up to try and stop it and while I was doing that THIS APP WAS TRACKING ME! I came back to my phone after I controlled my oven, and the app said the terrible pigs, y’all call police were on there way. And as a poc I was terrified, so I throw my phone out my window trying to make it stop, but it didn’t. The pigs- I mean cops, came to my house and ate 69 of my donuts! AND NOW IM STUCK WRITING THIS ON MY DS! TERRIBLE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE."}},{"id":"6179357314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🖕🚔🖕","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:02:56Z","review":"Who in the HELL put the muffins in the freezER"}},{"id":"6179357266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JAMIE LIKES DOGS 9871","isEdited":false,"title":"THE WORST APP IN HISTORY OF APPS!!!
