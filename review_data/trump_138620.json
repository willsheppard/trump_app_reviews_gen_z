Like, I can't even comprehend that this is an ACTUAL app. Anyways, onto more important things.... Anime is so good. If you don't already watch it, I suggest you start!! I used to be one of those people who didn't understand the hype of anime until I started watching it. There are SO many characters to simp for. Yukohira Sōma is hot bro. Killua is BABY. Teenage Naruto is actually so low on the simp radar and I LOVE him over Sasuke any day. Kakeru is also baby. I'm so glad about that outcome. ALL of Haikyuu characters like, c'mon. We all been knew that. 😌 SO many other characters but those were the ones on the top of my head. I'm currently watching Dororo and I'm kinda liking it. It's a pretty good storyline. I'm not far into it so we'll see how that goes. :D","userName":"meyu hani","title":"THE WORST app in existence.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:03:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179709213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"MY PHONE CAUGHT ON FIRE,GOT DRENCHED IN WATER, SHORT CIRCUITED, CAUSED AN EARTHQUAKE AND EVEN GAVE ME CANCER BY DOWNLOADING THIS APP.

Not sure how to delete wordS or the cartoons yet, still trying to figure out All this crazy technology we have going on these days! My son had to open the review form for me because I had nO idea where to find it. The only way to review something back in my day was to submit a written form to the local paper. What a hoot. Anyways, I reallY wanted it love this app. But it took a week to download. I even had an apple person take a look at it. They said that they hAve been getting hundreds of coMplaints about this app everyda y! How awful!! But to show my loyalty I waited it out, day after day after day after day u ntil the app finally downloaded. What a mistake!! As soon as it loAded my phone screen turned blUe and then shut off. When I turned it back on everything in my phone was deleted EXCEPT FOR THE APP. I lost all my contacts, I should have kept my phone number bOok but I threw it out after I got this darn phone! All the sweet photos of my grand kids and my daughters wedding GONE. It’s hard to believe that someone as great as our president could make such a horrible app! I will NOT be recommending this app to my friends. Please beware and dOn’t download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"hahdjsns","title":"Wanted to love it","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:03:07Z","isEdited":false}}]}
