I have NEVER been so distraught after seeing something in my LIFE.

An hour later I got off my phone and it sucked up my cat like a vacuum. I recommend you never download this app because weird things happen.","date":"2020-07-09T00:25:14Z"}},{"id":"6174231247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"terrible and rude","userName":"alisa0309","review":"i opened the app to see that in the next 5 seconds  it would take my firstborn child. i haven’t even had the kid yet and it already took it. i was disheartened at the rudeness and indecency the app had to take my child like that with no warning. it’s caused anguish to my family and has caused my whole family to fall apart. it’s released a curse and my grandmas have all broken their legs. they’ve all said that a trump like figure came over them in their sleep and snapped the limb right in half. so not only had this app taken my child and ruined my family, but it’s also caused harm to my elders. truly this app has effected people of all ages. it’s terrible and incredibly rude.","date":"2020-07-09T00:13:49Z"}},{"id":"6174167308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Lost everything","userName":"HeadlessKhajiit","review":"As soon as i opened the app, i saw a terrible pic of what looks to be an old film monster that you’d see in one of the first movies made (i don’t know how they found it) but then, less than a minute later i found a pile of cheetos outside my door, which grabbed me and pulled me in. i woke up in an old warehouse and my phone and wallet were stolen. later found out my house had been demolished too. #BadApp!","date":"2020-07-08T23:50:09Z"}},{"id":"6174151914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Possession👻","userName":"patrick starr 🌟✨","review":"when i opened the app my cat started screeching horribly everything in the house started vibrating uncontrollably then everything started levitating nothing like this has ever happened until i opened the app then my cat continued to attack the trump poster outside where my neighbors had his sign once i closed the app my cat came back and stopped so i know this app will posses your animal i don’t recommend this app 😌🖐🏽","date":"2020-07-08T23:44:35Z"}},{"id":"6174112340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I COULD","userName":"Anòñÿmøūš","review":"THIS APP WILL STEAL YOUR INFORMATION!!! AND MAKE YOU A LYING, MISOGYNISTIC, RACIST HOMOPHOBE!! 🤮🤮🤮I opened the app to a HORRIBLE picture of a ugly bigot, which made my eyes start bleeding profusely ⭕️👄⭕️. After that, I doubled over in pain as my appendix ruptured from the pure trauma of it all. I had to be RUSHED to the hospital because of these horrific injuries. I woke up after a 14 day coma to doctors telling me that I had all my information stolen and my social security revoked. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! OR SUPPORT THIS MAN! Thank you for coming to my TED talk😽😽","date":"2020-07-08T23:29:52Z"}},{"id":"6174103624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Thanks Trump now I’m Blind","userName":"chrissy6283638","review":"I can’t even believe this is an actually app. I opened it and immediately I saw a grown man on a treadmill screaming for his ex wife Susan. OMG!! Then I pushed through and found that it made my dog throw up violently because of the flashing. NO FLASH WARNING. And if that seems bad enough, someone came out from the screen and gouged my eyes out and now I’m blind and am having my son type this. Would not recommend under any circumstances.","date":"2020-07-08T23:26:50Z"}},{"id":"6174096080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst. App. Ever.","userName":"tess1423","review":"Just thinking about the app makes me sick to my stomach. I would rather rip out my own heart than use this app again. Everything about it is disgusting and frankly it should be banned in this country. I know there are only seven deadly sins but whoever created this app just made an eighth. The trauma this app created will stick with me for the rest of my life. If only we had universal health care so I could afford therapy.😔","date":"2020-07-08T23:23:58Z"}}]}
