I was at my child's private tennis lessons when I decided to download this app. I couldn’t believe the horrid things I saw. It looked like it was made by a child. Not my children of course because they’re the most perfect children God has ever created. I would never let my daughter Beverly and son Ayden on this app. If it were up to me this app should be deleted.","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"didiccitcitxtic"}},{"id":"6176846216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:04:01Z","review":"So when downloading this app the first notification notification I received told me to go to a cliff and jump off. Donald. Why would you do this to me. I used to love your wigs and perfectly Cheeto skin. You used to be my big old crackerjack. But what now? Do you want me to die? Overall this app is trash it made my phone crash, and I wish to never see another Trump anything in my life.","title":"Horrible App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Niasekayi"}},{"id":"6176826334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:58:49Z","review":"I don’t usually put bad reviews but this app is beyond compare, and no I’m not part of the “Gen Z take down the app” drama, I love my president!!

Something needs to be fixed right away. After my granddaughter told me to do it so I can get all the news, my phone starting blasting bad no no music. Some anthem idk.

But then after awhile things went south. A text popped up saying “I’m watching you” as that’s when I turned around and noticed 🍊’s were following me everywhere and now they won’t stop.

Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸. Then after a few days I observed that my skin was turning orange and I started finding Cheetos all around my house. All those Cheetos left Cheeto dust on all the furniture and it slowly spread into patches of orange dust so I checked the app and it says that this is one of the side affects from downloading the app. So please be careful or you and your belongings will turn into Cheeto orange color. ☢️🇺🇸","title":"This app is harmful","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"SammyAJ7726"}},{"id":"6176685326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:21:37Z","review":"It took 2 days to download the app and then when I opened it it crashed.
