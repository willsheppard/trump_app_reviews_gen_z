If I could give this all zero starts I would but apparently I can’t but I could I would because there is much more reasons why this is THE WORST APP EVER CREATED IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE GALAXY🤯🤬"}},{"id":"6177248502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RMX Queen","date":"2020-07-09T15:53:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible App","review":"I got constant glitches while using the app, to the point where my other apps began glitching as well. I brought my phone to the Apple store and they recommended I delete the app if it’s causing me this much trouble. I’ve also had to deal with constant threats since getting the app. The shocking thing as that they are all from trump supporters who somehow got my address through this app. They have all threatened to take my life and my kid’s life. If this is what the app promotes, I refuse to use it. I will be part of a racist group of individuals. 🧚🏾\u200D♀️💕👏🏽🧚🏾💓"}},{"id":"6177235420","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nana fanna fa footy","date":"2020-07-09T15:50:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"it","review":"i voted for donald trump in 2016 and so i decided to download the app and when i FINALLY got it downloaded all of the people in my house started floating. so the only thing that could’ve meant was that it was PENNYWISE 😍 i was thankful to be taken and floating but what i soon realized was that it wasn’t like the movies, my friends weren’t there to save me. when i walked into daddy ITs office you’ll be surprised to see who was there OUR CHEETO KING TRUMP. i was excited and when i asked him what was going on he said it was this horrid app and that he was racist and that anyone who supports him is racist. 😔😔"}},{"id":"6177198406","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tjb31040","date":"2020-07-09T15:39:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TRIGGER WARNING- WORST APP I HAVE EVER DOWNLOADED","review":"the second i opened the app an oompa loompa popped up on my screen! ever since watching that movie as a child i have extreme ptsd from oompa loompas so seeing one on this app sent me into a very extreme panic attack!! not to mention, that for some reason oompa loompas are making national headlines!! this app must be taken down in order to keep people safe. also let’s not forget how difficult this app is to use! like why have a separate app just to update you on oompa loompas? don’t we already have a news app? just stay safe everyone and DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6177160597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"blm 4 ever biden 2020","date":"2020-07-09T15:28:44Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"disgrace to the app store","review":"This app promotes white supremacy ands showcases uneducated opinions. I opened this app and automatically felt more stupid. The information is cluttered and the design is not well thought out which isn’t really a surprise considering who the app is about but it makes for a terrible app. I threw up from going through this app as it made me truly nauseous so I feel that is app is a health concern as well as all the other things wrong with it. There were also pictures of an orange monster which gave me nightmares and now I have to go to therapy."}},{"id":"6177119062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"disappointed ://////","date":"2020-07-09T15:17:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I will never be the same","review":"Absolutely horrible app, in each and every way. Actually, horrible in more ways than I even knew could be possible. After taking 7 days to download, it found a way to go downhill from there. Every now and then I’d hear trump’s voice, just... calling out to me. Eventually, things got even weirder. I’d find my phone in places I didn’t leave it, and I’d find weird texts from blocked numbers telling me to be more racist in my everyday life. Had to delete immediately. Would not recommend."}},{"id":"6176887464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tacobellblue","date":"2020-07-09T14:14:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"trump 2020 ✨but on a grave✨","review":"vote trump out! he’s a racist and a rapist. he’s also trying to ban tiktok from america. there’s millions of us that will have nothing to do all day because we spent most of our time on tiktok. if he thinks banning tiktok is “beneficial” then he thought wrong. if he wants to stay president then banning tiktok is not a good place to start. but then again, no matter what he does, he’ll probably get voted out because of gen-z. he was sad that gen-z made nobody go to his rally. if we can prevent anyone going to his rally, we can prevent him staying in office.

But it was quite the opposite! When I opened it, a portal to hell all of a sudden opened up in my bedroom next to me. I mean, this has never happened to me before so it has to be the app. Now there are demons flooding my house and I have no idea what to do about it! Can someone help me? I was DEFINITELY Trump 2020 before this but demons are not the move 🙅\u200D♀️. I think I might have to vote for someone who actually cares about the people, supports the LGBTQ 🏳️\u200D🌈 community, and isn’t racist now. 🙌🏻"}},{"id":"6176313417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tik tok not ban","date":"2020-07-09T11:39:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Don’t delete tik tok","review":"Trump is mad he can’t control us. Tik tok is one of the apps were we can be equal and support blm\nTrump is just mad he can’t control everything we do, don’t delete tik tok. Tik tok is a app were we do funny dances and cool videos. Trump is upset because he is in the wrong and doesn’t want to admit it. He is a child sex offender and hasn’t been caught because of money. He even stares he maybe attracted more to his thirteen year old daughter. He also hate lgbt+ women and BLM. Tik tok is a safe place for people. And trump just want to bring everyone down to his level. DONT DELETE TIK TOK!"}}]}
