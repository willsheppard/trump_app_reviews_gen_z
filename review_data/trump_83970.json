You’re down in the operating room like, “Hey, has anyone…Has anyone heard–” [imitates clopping hooves] Those are those quiet days when people are like, “It looks like the horse has finally calmed down.” And then ten seconds later the horse is like, “I’m gonna run towards the baby incubators and smash ’em with my hooves. I’ve got nice hooves and a long tail, I’m a horse!” That’s what I thought you’d say, you dumb horse. And then, for a second, we were like, “Maybe the horse-catcher will catch the horse.” And then the horse is like, “I have fired the horse-catcher.” He can do that? That shouldn’t be allowed no matter who the horse is. I don’t remember that in Hamilton. Sometimes, if you make fun of the horse, people will get upset. These are the people that opened the door for the horse. I don’t judge anyone. But sometimes I ask people. I go, “Hey, how come you opened the door for the horse?” And they go, “Well, the hospital was inefficient!” Or sometimes they go, “If you’re so mad at the horse, how come you weren’t mad when the last guy did this three and a half years ago? You’re beating up on the horse when the last guy essentially did the same thing five years ago.” First off, get out of here with your facts. You’re like the kid at the sleepover who, after midnight, is like, “It’s tomorrow now!” Get the frick out of here with your technicalities. Just ’cause you’re accurate does not mean you’re interesting. And now there’s Nazis again. When I was a kid Nazis was just an analogy you would use to decimate your child during an argument at the dinner table. Now there’s new Nazis. I don’t care for these new Nazis and you may quote me on that. ~John mulaney my king"}},{"id":"6178347382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:44:47Z","userName":"Briianna09","title":"Food never arrived","isEdited":false,"review":"My food never arrived ugh 😩 I am so hungry now"}},{"id":"6178346362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:44:26Z","userName":"KMS PSU","title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"review":"He tried to take away TikTok so it’s a no from me"}},{"id":"6178345119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:43:58Z","userName":"zndkfkfbdkdjndbd","title":"Cheeto man","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the worst thing i’ve ever downloaded"}},{"id":"6178325108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:36:17Z","userName":"UKSSHISHA","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"review":"I really don’t have time to explain my experience with this app. NEWAYS I dont NOT RECOMMEND.

But it got worse than that. It was playing screeching noises, that blew up my cats ear drums😳 ants came crawling out holding “Trump 2020” signs ✨☺️ at this point I was absolutely horrified. The ants continued to burn my cats body and sacrifice it to our 🍊 prezident. As this was going on, my little brother at the age of eight came walking in. And seeing he has an extreme fear of bugs due to the trump rally he went to a few weeks ago with my mom. Trump was speaking, but as he was he turned into a Cheeto and orange cockroach’s came flying out of his mouth😟🤰🏻 so because of these trump ants my brother will now need intense therapy. My mom came in and grabbed my phone out of my hand smashing it on the ground with her foot. It didn’t stop the ants though, we had a huge infestation. We tried to call bug control, but they just laughed it off seeing as they were privileged white men✨✨. But it gets worse. As soon as the app opened my eyes began to burn from all the racist and homophobic things our 🍊🍊 president was saying and doing. Due to these actions, grumpy trumpy has now lost my vote. I really though he was kind, understanding, pro lgbtq+ pro woman’s rights, and pro black lives matter. But no ❤️ also, somehow this brain washing app was getting to my dog. My dog could now stand on his hind legs and wield a knife. He was going around and stabbing my family sacrificing them to the orange Cheeto prez that abuses his power 💩 unfortunately, after a few days of staying in my closet with my hamster my dog died in the front yard near the trump 2020 sign which has now been burned down. 💀🙈💓 my hair had fallen out, and I could barely function due to the trauma of this app. I will now have to take therapy with my half alive brother and trump better be paying with his credit card☺️☺️ overall, I do not recommend this app what so ever I less you want unneeded trauma, and animals sacrificing you to our not so kind president 🧚🏼😟✨ thank you for listening this needed to be heard so no one else has to suffer."}},{"id":"6178302249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:27:53Z","userName":"Ink slaughter⚔️🔪","title":"TERRIBLE DO NOT GET","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is so slow and filled with pumpkins and Cheeto puffs do not get it.
