This app spreads false information and there are too many ads, pop ups, etc. If you don‚Äôt want to waste your time don‚Äôt download this app. I got an ad and accidentally clicked on it and almost downloaded a virus. It took me a week to remove and I almost had my bank account hacked into. I had to change all my passwords on everything.","title":"‚ö†Ô∏èBEWARE THIS APP‚ö†Ô∏è","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:46Z"}},{"id":"6174843310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kendallt___","review":"this app is a lot of the same way to get it to the end of y‚Äôall day and i is the time of y‚Äôall getting ready for summer school and school tomorrow at school and i is the day you want to go to hang with us some more fun people to do it haha was a great day for you guys to come to the school with me you know you have to get a little more money moves and i was a great day and you have a good job you have a great way of doing that and you know what you‚Äôre going through to do it bruh bruh was that good for y‚Äôall to come over and get the hang of it i is that the way i was the way to do that so much better then we get together again soon we just have a good day at school tomorrow so i was a time for you guys","title":"no","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:20:02Z"}},{"id":"6174836060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Natalyy17","review":"I downloaded this app to see my favorite orangeüçäbut when I downloaded it my and phone started to glitch.

Secondly, no matter what you do, it sends a notification like every 2 minutes, EVEN WHEN YOU TURN THEM OFF. Also ever since I‚Äôve downloaded this app my phone glitches and my battery drains even on the charger.

I was scrolling on this app when all of a sudden an arrow shot out of the camera and into my eye. I believe the tip of the arrow was drenched with a poisonous substance... I am currently blind now, thanks Trump! ü§¨ On top of that, the app redirected me to a message from Trump Himself, telling me to go skydiving but without a parachute. And to also make sure that below me, where I was gonna expected to land, was a safety net full of legos. So ruthless!!!
