Now my chinchilla is dead and I don’t have a phone. I’m writing this off my refrigerator. Disrespect is at the highest level. I can’t get this image off the Cheeto man out of my head. I’ve bleached my eyes multiple times but it won’t go away. It’s always in the back of my mind and now it is my sleep paralysis demon. Today I’m going to walk my hermit crab and tell everyone about my experience. I can’t believe this.

As soon as it finished I opened it expecting to support potus but instead I saw a giant oompa loompa on my screen 😡 I didn’t know this was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory here. It was so ugly that I now have permanent blindness in both of my eyes 😭 my mother is typing this for me while I speak. After I deleted it because of the issues and general low quality I started suffering from uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea. This NEEDS to be stopped and taken down off of the app store!!! This is unbelievable. If only I could give 0 stars!!!","rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP"}},{"id":"6173636985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:33:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jesus Christ is the official","review":"This is just horrible it took 4 years to download and during that time I was paralyzed and all I could do was watch FOX NEWS 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢I was lucky not converted but prayed that I would die so I would never have to experience this again. I was crying and the doctors said I had no hope but lucky I told them to write this review for me. Please download this app although I know you are Depressed and want to kill yourselves I recommend not doing it with the trump app. I would rather sell my soul then have to go on this app. Please save yourself before it is to late.","rating":1,"title":"This App is killing me 🔪 🏃\u200D♀️ 🩸 💀"}},{"id":"6173631024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"I Like The Number 420","review":"This app took weeks not days WEEKS to download. While waiting it made my other apps glitch, what would happen is it would kick me out of my other apps or would blast music or randomly download Fox News. No other news platforms. Then when it did download it took a week to load out everything, and if you ask me waiting 1 month for ONE APP is too long. I couldn’t put with this anymore so I deleted the app. I ended up getting told the government was tracking my location and everything I say. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU ARE GEN Z AND NOT AFRAID TO DIE.","rating":1,"title":"I can’t believe this."}},{"id":"6173617188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:26:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Rae blm","review":"I wanted to get this app to support my amazing misogynistic president. I thought downloading it would be the best thing since sliced oranges. Unfortunately, downloading the app caused a lot of glitches, one of which was that every time I opened the app, nothing but a picture of a soggy, hairy cheeto wearing a hat that says “make america racist again” would appear. It next began to have racial slurs pop up randomly on my screen before I could click on anything. It then had random videos of children crying and screaming, everytime they saw the president, MY president. Very odd isn’t it?","rating":1,"title":"Very odd isn’t it?"}}]}
