I downloaded it and when I opened it up all I saw was this, “Keep America Great”. How disgusting and disappointing it is to see.The United States is great. It always has been. The United States is made up of so many different people with so many different backgrounds. We as Americans are resilient. It was just so disappointing to see that on an app. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT WAS JUST THE LOADING SCREEN! What followed was way worse! Do not download this app!
