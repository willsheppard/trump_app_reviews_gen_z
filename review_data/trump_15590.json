As he hola his reputation for insulting different races, genders, and groups of people, the “home” category use harsh descriptive words to talk about the other candidates. I just think I’m general he is a awful person and this app proves it.","isEdited":false,"title":"INSULTING"}},{"id":"6177726240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:18:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"jennnaeassa05","review":"I got this app to keep up with the current events of the campaign, and it just kept lagging my phone out. It would kick me out of the app for no reason, and got to the point where it gave my phone a virus. This virus was on my phone for weeks, but thankfully I got rid of it. I would not recommend this app to keep up with current events therefore it may give you a virus too. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"GARBAGE"}},{"id":"6177723441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:17:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"ArikAnonymous","review":"To start, I genuinely liked Triumph in office. He’s so good at keeping the privileged with the privileged and staying silent on BLM and ICE issues. Me being someone who is a supremacist decided to get this app in search of an accurate media representation of the president, and after looking throughly through this app and a few others. I came to the conclusion that... it’s not the app that’s bad. It’s the president. #settleforBiden","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is so disappointing.."}}]}
