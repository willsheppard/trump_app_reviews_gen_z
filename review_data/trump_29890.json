I have tried to fix the issue with no avail. Unfortunately I had to get rid of the app and find one that is better suited to my needs."}},{"id":"6177184629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","userName":"Pelo De León","review":"I have to say that this app is terribly disappointing. I cannot believe that this man has no opinion on the change in the taste of coke, and has no idea what he is doing for the country. I thought this man was a Cheeto at first, as he looks like he's been fried in tanning oil and tossed in powdered cheddar cheese."}},{"id":"6177120508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:17:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download!!!","userName":"applegrapecarrotbanana","review":"This app took forever to download and once it did it crashed my phone!

I would also like to say vote for Biden he may not be the best person but he is way better then Donald Trump."}},{"id":"6177051572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:58:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Great app","userName":"Th@t k!d on thę bloçk","review":"So this app is great except they made the mistake of making it trump themed and I wanted obama. So would not recommend. Also I wanted to mention that mr Cheeto man can’t bring gen z down by getting rid of tiktok unless we get rid of his app. He’s just salty he’s not gonna win boomers got nothing on us."}},{"id":"6177048629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:57:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"absolutely disgusting","userName":"Amber Mae White 💍👒👙","review":"When I opened the app, it said my name and proceeded to send my address to the dark web, blood poured from my phone and I saw a ghost crawl out and kill me. I am utterly terrified and disgusted at this, being a trump supporter and all, and on top of that, no-one is coming to my funeral 😾"}},{"id":"6177042560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:56:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This is a terrible app","userName":"ollie.mcpollll","review":"If you gon take tiktok away from away from us you better take care of your country first before you do that.

It kept trying to to make me enter my address and said we need to know details about your hamster.
