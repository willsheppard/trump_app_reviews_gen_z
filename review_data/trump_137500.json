This orange man does not sell pies and I am very mad. My mom told me to get the pie from the car yesterday, but I didn’t want to. I get this app to make it float to me but it didn’t!!!! I don’t recommend this app whatsoever it doesn’t make my pie float. It didn’t even make me float when I smelt the pie. I wish that it did, they could have made this app better but noooooo, he just kept saying for me to vote for him, vote vote vote vote. No. I. Want. Apple. Pie.

Like 25 hours to download!!!!!! That’s ridiculous. This app should be removed from the App Store immediately with that kind of download time.","title":"Worst app ever!!!!!😡🤢🤮","userName":"ked1147","date":"2020-07-10T07:18:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179906766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"... but it is as mindless as he is. First off, you HAVE to consent to receiving text messages. Nope. I don’t even let me dentist text me about appointments. It’s the last vestige I have where there is zero junk. Once you get passed that, the design hurts my eyes with unrelenting colors. If my grandpa could design an app, it would look better than this. The information is all about donating. His platform is as bad as you’d expect. Don’t do it.","title":"Wanted the app to stay informed...","userName":"Ekfomo","date":"2020-07-10T07:18:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179906541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"And watched myself implode\nA thought without a body\nOught to be a shot to take a load\nOff my brain is poisoned\nAnd I'm searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream, \"Oh, no you don't!\"\nWoah","title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","userName":"Geraldine69696969","date":"2020-07-10T07:18:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179906301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i opened this app and it asked for my phone number which was disgraceful especially because i wanted to learn about how to be anti racist and loving towards all people but for some reason all this app wanted to do was tell me i won a free sign for my lawn:( and then it wasn’t even free,,, they wanted me to donate 20 dollars. i thought free meant that it was something i didn’t have to pay for, but i’m wrong. maybe president trump can update the dictionary because i really thought free meant no money, not twenty dollars. also this app takes up my storage and the opening picture is like trump doing a black power sign but like he’s white and doesn’t like black people so i’m confused. anyways this app is awful and terrible and scary and horrible and i can’t believe anyone would want to buy a MAGA hat.","title":"this is truly disgusting","userName":"ofwkfhhorwcphwcr","date":"2020-07-10T07:18:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179905692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Donald Trump is a racist person black people should not have to suffer from being a different color like why does he care about the color of someone’s skin?
