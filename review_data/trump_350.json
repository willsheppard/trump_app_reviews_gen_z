Anywho.... I woke up one morning and I decided that I wanted to support Mr. Trump as much as I can ya know. So after I took my candlestick on a walk, vacuumed the ceiling, made myself an oopmaloompa for breakfast, did my daily prayers to Cheeto, and cleaned the bat cage/ dungeon/cellar that’s not at all creepy, I was like “I’m going to see if Donald Trump has an app” and sure enough, he does. Hopefully not for long. There are so many glitches and viruses that this app causes- thank goodness I was on my PearPhone and not my IPhone or else I would have to buy a whole new one!! And they are EX-PEN-SIVE. So later my cousin comes into my room from Germany and she’s like “Did you that your president has an app??” and I’m like “Yah I did, it’s AWFUL!!” and she says that we needed to take our pet penguin to flying classes so then I left and then we had to go to my nephew’s cupboard under the stairs to tell him to make us some enchiladas."}},{"id":"6174453017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:26:11Z","rating":1,"title":"💅 👁👄👁 💅 this is just no 😌✨","userName":"Chesterthecheetaguy 🍊✨","review":"This app is just horrible gives out false information, it also has stolen my whole kitchen, now I have no food.😔 This app also took my money because I wanted it on trying to get my kitchen back and to get my food back.👁👅👁 when I downloaded the app a Cheeto virus took over my phone, I showed my mom and she ended up getting the virus too.🥺🦠 So I went to the apple store on my pet turtle 🐢 and they said they couldn’t help me. I just wanted to know when the next rally was because Gen Z must rise. I went to bed and I woke up and I just saw Cheeto bags all over the house and I saw that I had a poorly done spray tan like Donald trump. I told my grandma and she died of shock. 😭 we had her funeral the next day, and one direction showed up and said, “Sorry bout that love, but trump 2020!” All I wanted was to get the good after the funeral but I ended up being traumatized by those words. 😔 Yet anyway don’t download this app gives false information, gives you viruses( which are worse than corona), makes you orange 🍊, and makes your grandma die, and makes you loose your money and kitchen. 😔🦠✨"}},{"id":"6174373203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:02:00Z","rating":1,"title":"Technical Difficulties and Glitching","userName":"DeliaPitta","review":"I downloaded this app to see what the presidents campaign for 2020 would be like. My phone was perfectly fine before I had downloaded the app. I don’t even have a lot of storage used up on my device. However my phone started glitching. Not only would it log me out of the app, but I also started to have trouble with my other apps as well! I can’t even open the weather app anymore! Not only that, but my camera app keeps opening up with out me even clicking it. I’ve noticed that by having the Trump app open, pressing the homepage, and returning to the home menu, my camera app would open by itself! Is this some kind of technical issue? I feel as though his HAS to be a violation of the AppStore’s guidelines right? I haven’t even granted permission for the Trump app to have access to my camera. I highly suggest the App Store to looks into this. I will try to remove the app and see if that’ll solve the problem. Is anyone else having this issue as well? I didn’t expect an app made by a team working for the 45th to be so poorly made honestly."}},{"id":"6174371625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:01:30Z","rating":1,"title":"App promot-ee almost caused my death","userName":"gg. cztagsga","review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the reviews were about. I clicked on the app and saw this humongous cheeto with a blonde hair piece! HE WAS ALSO NAKED! He (it) scared me so bad, I fell off my roof! 😔I was passed out for the last 66 hours! All of those 66 hours, I kept seeing that cheeto man as a vision! I woke up and thought I saw him across the street! I then started running inside of my house, went on the couch and attempted to delete the app. While attempting to delete it, I proceeded to turn the tv on to watch something. As soon as I turned the tv on, there was a commercial on about 😡DONALD TRUMP! 😡Donald proceeded to show all the kids in the White House’s basement; who he had been abusing for the past 69 years. (As if he were talking to me) He pointed to the screen 📺 and said “You’re Next!😈”.  \nI now have terrible nightmares about the man 😔 I now am struggling with a mental illness that has not been diagnosed as of this moment 🥺. I almost lost my life because of this app and the man who they are promoting. This app and whoever has been involved with the making of it, need to go “poof” and disappear."}},{"id":"6174332656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:48:38Z","rating":1,"title":"Cursed","userName":"im a cowgurl","review":"When I first opened the app I felt attacked. I saw this thing, honestly I was terrified and i’m too scared to describe it. But what happened after, was simply terrifying. Apparently this app must have some sort of curse on it, because the next day I went out to run some arrons, but the events that followed forever traumatized me. \n\n The first place I went to was a local bakery, in search for a light snack, but what I got wasn’t light, or a snack. As soon as I walked in I was welcomed by a strange man with a trump hat on who threw a whole tomato at me, keep in mind I came in with my 6 year old child. as I bent down to pick up said tomato and take home, he ran up to my child and proceeded to drop kick him. After ordering I left only to go to wallmart and see another  person with a trump hat on but thought nothing of it. While walking around the store, I kept running into him throughout the store. While I was grabbing a can of beans he started chanting from across the the store in the chip aisle “Save our leader!”. Then ran across the store and out the doors with a cart filled to the brim with cheetos. Never using this app again."}},{"id":"6174245723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:05Z","rating":1,"title":"Yeah... just no","userName":"Hermes_The_Destroyer","review":"This app is the worst app to ever exist. I download this and the first thing I see is a Cheeto man working out in front of me 😳🙈. My dog even started to bark like there was no tomorrow when I opened the app. The app had continued to glitch on me and take me out of the app whenever I pressed anything on there. When it finally worked I had to see when the next rally was and then all I see was the Cheeto man ONCE AGAIN working out but getting SPRAY TANNED right in front of me 🤮🤢 Luckily I had my anime glasses to protect me. Unfortunately my dog and brother didn’t so we had to rushed to the hospital because they were blinded from what they saw this crusty Cheeto doing 🤢 My own mother fainted when I showed her what had hurt her children. Needless to say after 10 hours of being in the hospital, they are now having to protect their eyes from any light for the next MONTH. Your app hurt my family 🤔 think about that for a moment. And it kept on asking me to buy them fridges for their next rally, Like NO🤡 Trust me, you do NOT want this app EVER. So please, spare yourself the trouble and don’t hurt yourself, or your family"}},{"id":"6174049659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:06:57Z","rating":1,"title":"this app makes me cry 😭😭","userName":"addie.1210","review":"to even just think about what our “president” has done to our country, and what he still CONTINUES to do, makes me ridiculously stressed and want to cry. america was NEVER great, so his slogan, “make america great again”.... it’s ridiculous. in the past, people of the lgbtq+, women, people of color, and literally anyone who isn’t a white male, was treated with such disrespect and little to no consideration for their lives. the few good things almost all had to do with the fact that their was a hell of a lot less global warming (excuse my language). no paper plates, less cars, etc. yet trump seems to be doing nothing about that. a 16 year old girl has brought more light and more change to the problem than our own “president” has. unless trump is trying to take away women’s rights, inslave people of color, and take away the rights of people in the lgbtq+ community, he desperately needs to change his slogan. he talks about his “sexy” daughters, and is a perverted man. i will never in my entire lifetime support a president like this who takes away lives and right from anyone who isn’t a straight white man."}},{"id":"6173940109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:25:35Z","rating":1,"title":"this app ruined my life","userName":"Kalieri","review":"I opened the app and the first thing I saw was an image so ugly I am not permanently blind in one of my eyes. then my phone started speaking a foreign language through the speakers and hackers were able to get into my icloud through the app😠😠 THEN just to make things worse they set my background as the picture that blinded me and now I am blind in BOTH eyes. also, when I went to go take my trash out the next night, there was a mysterious van parked in my driveway, and when I went to confront the person inside they reached their hand out the window, took my trash bag, slapped me in the face with the trash and then ran me over. in my vague state of coherency, I looked up to see the entire trump family (except for barron and melania) dancing on top of me. trumps weight was so detrimental that I flatlined for two minutes in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. when I woke up I was greeted by the sight of none other than a bag of cheetohs sitting on the edge of my bed. I have taken this as a sign that trump is still watching me and will never stop. do not get this app or your life will NEVER go back to normal."}},{"id":"6173423140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:19:50Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever✨🥟😤","userName":"J🌸💖","review":"It took weeks to download this app and I have amazing WiFi that’s 50 dollors a month and when I finally got in the app it kept glitching mostly to a orange face and a puff Cheeto it keeps logging me out of the app and is trying to take my data nAsty app all it does it glitch and stop all Cheeto supporters there nasty and my emojis be lookin weird and there bad vibes there’s always Cheeto dust and orange juice I think the Cheeto is breaking in my house terrible app do not download it’s also very boring and for boomer I threw up when I saw to orange nasty he will make you sick 🤮😤🥟🍊🐠👁👄👁💀stop Cheeto and TikTok lives matter period and I’m always getting these scam calls ever since I downloaded it don’t download it’s a scam ewww trump nasty and it just shows pics nasty Cheeto and almost my friends almost died bc of it also it will make you blind so don’t download this nasty app 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 all over it🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💀i also started crying when I opened it and so did my family nasty Cheeto my cat started to meow like she was dying when the Cheeto said something he almost killed my cat nasty so don’t download and be safe from the Cheeto"}},{"id":"6172958461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:48:32Z","rating":1,"title":"MY HOUSE  CAUGHT IN FIRE DUE TO THIS APP!!","userName":"1 star or less","review":"first of all, as soon as i downloaded it the app started playing the pen🖊 pineapple 🍍 apple🍎pen🖊on loop. it would let me exit the app or to turn my phone 📲 off⬇️.
