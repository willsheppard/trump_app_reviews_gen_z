Then when I first opened the app, I heard a ear wrenching sound, kind of like nails on a chalkboard. And they the whole screen was just covered in this weird orange looking thing. The notifications for the same thing popped up every three seconds and I could never get anything done. This app has ruined my phone and I wish that no one would download this app so they don’t have to go through the same things as me.😤","date":"2020-07-09T13:02:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kid who wants to learn","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176555235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Never been more disappointed","review":"I got this app in hopes of hearing the TRUTH and not the lies the Cultish, Homophobic, Racist, and Sexist ant-christ followers spew, but bOY was I wrong. When I first opened this app, it aggressively attacked me with the need to send me notifications, something I couldn’t consent to for it would disrupt my peaceful state of mind. And THEN it DEMANDS for my phone number. OUTRAGEOUS!!! How could i EVER give something to pure and innocent and personal away to some orange man who forgets how to read?? I’ve never get more threatened in my life. I truly hope someone removes this app, for the safety of those ignorant and innocent, not knowing what they’re about to get themselves into.","date":"2020-07-09T12:46:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"P.Emily","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176489134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"I honestly had high hopes for this app especially because it was an app that represented our “President”. But I’m disappointed. So, so, so disappointed. I went to the app and downloaded it in order to try and support this country and make it better, but all I saw were racists, homophobes, and downright ignorant people. I can’t believe this. Not to mention the app was laggy. It kept giving me unnecessary notifications. The screen would freeze before taking me to something completely different than what I wanted. Absolutely disgusting if I do say so myself. I hope AMERICA improves along with our executive branch.","date":"2020-07-09T12:28:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"smhmusicallyupdate","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176195322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP😩😫😔","review":"i downloaded this app to support my intelligent and handsome😼 president. 😻🤘🏼i fully support him but it took two months to download and when it finally did i opened the app and i got two bugs 😵😤and all my emails were deleted ☹️☹️i have no clue🧐what’s wrong with this but i’d like to warn others 🤬of what i’ve been through i have to restart everything! i was just trying to support my president and China and Russia hack his apps just because were so patriotic about our country! 💯😏🇺🇸We’re literally the best country but this app was terrible and sad for my president anyways trump 2020 MAGA!! #trumpsexual 😼😻😹😽👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-09T11:04:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"trumpsexual👁👅👁","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176158715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","review":"This app was HORRIBLE. The app took a year to download first of all. After it downloaded however I saw multiple pictures of a Cheeto man. He was traumatizing and scary to look at. Then people were worshiping a man named “Trump” like their lives depended on it like a cult. From what I’ve heard he’s a disgusting rapist. Wait now that I think about it how can he run for president if he had the iq of a five year old. I mean there has to be some sort of iq test to pass before being President. This app gave me a virus and shipped all my information! It gave me a virus that took away color on my phone. Anyways DO NOT BUY AND LEAVE A ONE STAR RATING UNLESS YOU WANT A VIRUS.","date":"2020-07-09T10:52:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"seva.vyas","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176005944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Literally ruined my life!! Don’t download!!😾","review":"Once I downloaded this app my whole life changed. My pet bird died!!! HE DIEDD. Is it a coincidence UHHH I DONT THINK SO. Trumps nasty vibes infected my bird and he sadly passed away. Now gizmo is buried out back under our oak tree with a little tombstone that say, “Trump is a piece of trash👻”. Anyway as soon as I downloaded this app my mom got into a crazy car wreck and is still in the hospital. She has to get multiple surgeries and her injuries are very serious:( Plz don’t download:) Also trump literally disgusts me UHHH Apple so if u hate him plz delete this crusty cursed app. A president that is a rapist, is racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, etc...? UHHHH NO THANKSSS😻","date":"2020-07-09T10:04:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"keyrahisspicyy","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175916250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨Sad✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️","review":"This app asked for $3,000 dollars. Me and the rest of my generation are just trying to get a good app. My phone crashed five times while downloading. I got to restart the app almost every time.  This app deleted all my contacts. And kept on moving around my phone. I had this app for two days and for half of that it kept on turning off my phone. Then it said that if I don’t vote trump I’ll be sent back to Africa. And all my friends will end in ICE detention camps. Like I’m legal to vote. 0/10 . And my cousin said after that she got life treated calls ever since. And now is that n the run. What type of app does this.","date":"2020-07-09T09:34:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"yellow-160","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175836534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever🍊✨","review":"This app.... DISGUSTS ME!! Likeeee... SeRiOuSlY?! Almost threw up downloading it. No cap ❌🧢-EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS APP DISGUSTS ME! IT TOOK 123 DAYS.. DAYSSSS TO DOWNLOAD.. it then asked me to pay 100,000,000 dollars to Donald’s trump or he would send robots to find me- NEXTTT, HE SENT... A link to the site to pay the money to him, which was very weird bc he’s the president of USA so he should have TONS of money. Also The next day I woke up to use the bathroom and found Donald trumps head in my toilet- I then take my dog to walk as usual and see Donald trump walking to my house.. so i texted my mom, and she said we have to run away bc Donald trump is trying to put us in a glass bubble for the rest of our lives.","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:18Z","rating":1,"userName":"witne1","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175812544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP IN HISTORY🤬","review":"I’m telling you do not get this app unless you want everything in your house to not work. This trash app took forever to download I mean at least 50 weeks. My TV stopped working and started glitching and my volume doesn’t work anymore now. My lights started to flicker and my phone is also glitching and I know for a fact this app gave my phone a virus because before I downloaded the app everything was fine. If you want your phone and everything electronic wise to completely shut down you are insane if you want to download this app and risk that. So don’t download it!","date":"2020-07-09T09:00:21Z","rating":1,"userName":"burntgrass","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175660103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"if you’re debating on wether or not to get this app do not. after taking several hours to download i finally got into the app and it crashed. so i figured i’d give it a try again and went back and it just completely locked off my phone. i was so shocked i didn’t know what to do. so i waited for it to turn back on and stupidly tried again then it completely shut down my phone and it wouldn’t work again. i’m currently typing this on my sisters phone because i’m so upset and had to let others know incase they were thinking about getting it. i’m very unpleased!!!","date":"2020-07-09T08:08:15Z","rating":1,"userName":"Yesss it's me","isEdited":false}}]}
