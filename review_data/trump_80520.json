After awhile of using the app i notice some unusual things happening to my room and house. For example some writing on the wall started to appear and everything soon had to do with “Trump 2020” life first of all who even is that man? I came on here to support my fav cheeto puff. Anyways I was like whatever so i went back on the app so I could educate myself on things such as blue lives matter, all lives matter, the wall etc. And out of nowhere the craziest thing happened, I started to go blind. Then my vision snaps back and I see this man named Trump pop up inside my room, like who are you? And he kept saying “Trump 2020” “Trump 2020” and chanting it. I swear it was the weirdest thing but it for sure happened. He said I was his favorite supporter but I was taken aback because I do be black, and a woman, so that just doesn’t add up. He then had his supporters illegally invade my room and holding poster of his nudes. And let me tell you right now, it was small. We’re talking shrimp size. I eventually got a chance to delete the app, but NEVER AGAIN. The trauma i have will be irreversible and he’ll be lucky if i don’t take him or his little fan club to court. Did you know he has 189 other lawsuits to deal with? Well he better get to it. 🥰 10/10 DON’T recommend this app unless you want to go insane.
