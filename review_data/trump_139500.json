I’m telling you this now.. this app will set a paranormal and deathly curse on you and everyone you know. The curse that was sent on me and my family made us have diarrhea coming out of every hole to mice running inside the skin. it will make you have serious anxiety and panic attacks that can also lead to heart attacks. The curse can never be broken it will stick to you and your family for the end of time. Im not doing this because the app is a trump app... I’m doing this as a warning so that the curse won’t be provoked. This will not only happen to you it will happen to everyone you know! so do not download and leave a review saying the same thing to help the people that are thinking about downloading it. (the people that are saying to download it are behind the app already getting tortured and just don’t wanna be alone)","userName":"sjkddnmdcn","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6179603284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Just 6 words: I need to see a manager! \n\n-Karen","userName":"Karen McConnel","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"☹️☹️☹️"}},{"id":"6179603282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I could go on and on for days about how terrible this app is but I’ll spare you the vomit-inducing commentary. Just know that if 2020 was a man, he would reside in this orange idiot aka bunker boy.\nA quick rundown of some key issues: it took forever to download — so long, in fact, that i forgot about it all together only to stumble upon it when it finished hours later in the middle of the night, and upon opening I suffered a cardiac arrest merely because a Cheeto-looking creature with emotionless black pit eyes was staring back at me. Trump can expect to be hearing from my lawyer due to the severity of the incident and the relentless flashbacks I’m  still experiencing to this day.\nAnother issue: once i manage to recover from the ordeal the app started malfunctioning and randomly deleting other apps like my cherished TikTok as well as somehow my twitter account started liking all of Trump’s tweets from his many meltdowns. Also i kept getting calls where all it would say is “ITS A HOAX, ITS A HOAX” in a really snobby voice. I was outraged and attempted to delete the app. It was harder to do then you may think as I couldn’t hold down the app for long enough cause my phone kept glitching. Hours later, as I sobbed and shook uncontrollably, I finally managed to end the app’s control over my phone. \nI never thought an app could wreck such havoc over my life but it did. I highly advise against acquiring this app. All it does is ruin innocent peoples lives for no reason other than for its own gain. \nHave a wonderful day 🧚🏼✨❤️😽","userName":"emily ✨🧚🏼❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD.

Isn’t it such a problem that a simple app such as this wants to take my information in order to even access the amenities that it provides! Absolutely ridiculous! If one is so worried about the great citizens of America’s information being taken through an app that goes by the name of tik tok, then why be a hypocrite and ask for such information in order to access the app that one is so scared is being taken by another app? Does the creator only want our information being taken when it is to their own benefit?","userName":"kittyreviewer18","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not worth it!"}},{"id":"6179602079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I truly thought downloading it would help America be great again.\nSad\nBiggly failure \nDrinking the swamp would have been a better experience.","userName":"Don C137","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"covfefe"}}]}
