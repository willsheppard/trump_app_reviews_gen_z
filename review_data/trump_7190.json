Then one day I heard a snap in my basement and I see it in one of my mouse traps and to my surprise it was a...Blond Toupee?! I just brushed it off but then I started hearing it. At night I would hear  someone whisper “bunker boy, bunker boy” and I even started hearing it in the wind. And now I swear I keep seeing this strange/ugly orange figure everywhere I go.

Then when my friends saw this app that started screaming and crying. I was so scared and concerned so I asked what happened. They said that when they opened the app a big orange monster had appeared on the screen. But that was not the end of it, I was experiencing some paranormal activity. Flying Cheetos around my room screaming TRUMP 2020! And my dad starting levitating and started screaming weird things like “orange you glad I didn’t deport you”. As an honest person this app if terrible and I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!🤬🤬😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6138515136","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DISGRACEFUL","date":"2020-06-30T05:09:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"AnthonyCaldara","review":"I am a conservative white straight male republican and downloaded this app to support my hero and our president Donald trump. When I logged onto the app I was getting very horny and my wife did not want to make love to me. I was scrolling the the app trying to bust a nut and all of a sudden trumps nudes came up!!!!!!! I was mortified but I was almost at a climax so I kept going and finished to trumps shrimp. I immediately came to the conclusion that I was a homosexual and my wife divorced me and took the kids. Please don’t download this app because it ruined my life. \nHave a blessed day.

First, he wants me to give my PHONE NUMBER to the app just to sign in. Disrespectful. After you sign in. the information is all false and the ads will lead you to abusive and hateful websites and news outlets. I don’t recommend anyone else downloading this app, it may have truly been the worst decision i’ve made all of 2020."}},{"id":"6115298940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Privacy Policy","date":"2020-06-24T07:48:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MayoTehSalamander","review":"Privacy Policy states “In addition, the Services may include features that rely on the use of information stored on, or made available through, your mobile Device.
