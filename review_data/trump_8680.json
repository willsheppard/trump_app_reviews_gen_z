After days of being in the er I had to undergo surgery because of the effect of this app. Please I’m letting you know now don not download this, this is trash.

This app started to track my location, watch me through my camera, and even recorded me without permission. I got hacked because I downloaded this terrible app. I even tried contacting the CEO of the app and he was very rude to me, he said that he doesn’t care about anyone that gets harmed because if this app. I really love our president but this app is just so unacceptable 😖\n\nFor this terrible app I would like\n\nto get my ears pierced\n\nto get acrylics \n\nJewelry\n\nCandles\n\nSoft blanket\n\nShoes ( 8 or 8 1/2 )\n\nCamera \n\nA BIG BOX OF TAKIS NOT TURBOS\n\nStarbucks gift cards\n\nAir pod\n\nClear phone case ( iPhone 8+ )\n\nMini back backs\n\nFull body mirror \n\nAvocados/guacamole\n\nThank you ❤️","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173706146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jdjdkdkkkakk","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:28Z","review":"this app made my  phone slow down and glitch. the app is clearly designed very poorly. it is clear that it is made to prey on the unintelligent and manipulate them. it is very harmful to have such an app on the app store. not only that , but the app design is just bad. took forever to download and i have amazing wifi. a disgrace to modern technology and app making capabilities. the app is very slow and does not respond when you try to tap. it crashes constantly and cannot complete the simplest of functions and it is clearly not an issue with my phone since this seems to be a universal experience. it is shameful that apple would allow such a poorly made app onto the app store. i hope no one is foolish enough to support this horrible app","title":"the worst app ever made!!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173660813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"that nickname is faken","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:42:04Z","review":"Once I downloaded the app, it hacked into my other apps and started glitching them out. Then it jumped off my phone and tore my arms off and I had to go to sleep. When I woke up tho, the app had already caused mass destruction to society and tore down houses and cities and destroyed civilization. Then alien dogs started to invade the earth and started chewing on my phone and tossed it into Lake Michigan and I had to get it back and buy a new phone but the phone guy had been chewed up by dogs too😔rip this app.","title":"Severe problems😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173643764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kamisaki2013","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:36:00Z","review":"This is the WORST app ever. It took days to download and when it did IT GLITCHED AND CRASHED MY PHONE! It kept saying, “Trump 2020”? Please get that fixed I can’t bare it anymore! And to ANYONE who is thinking of downloading it, do not I repeat DO NOT even think about it! It will crash your phone by putting an alligator onto the screen for hours. And then it makes monkey noises until you delete it. And deleting it also takes days. If you ask me, you shouldn’t even make an app about a walking Cheeto anyway.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173636842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Merdia Johns","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:33:30Z","review":"I tried downloading this app but it did after 5 hours.
