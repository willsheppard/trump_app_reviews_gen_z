Since the whole storming AREA 51 thing didn’t really work out (bummer), we all showed up here to see what lurks behind the Cheeto-stained doors of the Oval Office. It is needless to say then that I had high expectations for this app that were unfortunately just not met. Although the horrors of the backhanded dealing with the Russians (NO COLLUSION 🍟), the bigotry, sexism, and greediness of a twin consuming its sibling in the womb were all intriguing enough, I must say that I was just bored by the lack of flavor. Where was the sensationalism, the intrigue, the wonder, the originality?? It was all a bit lackluster if I’m honest. Just not very entertaining. Hoping that the number of people downloading the app will ensure that the files will still be released, but I couldn’t in conscience give this nothing more than a 1 star review because I wouldn’t recommend this to someone in a coma to look at for entertainment. 😕 BOO.","date":"2020-07-09T20:00:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Callixa"}},{"id":"6178047979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRASHHHHHHHHHH","review":"F TRUMP","date":"2020-07-09T19:59:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"fucktumply"}},{"id":"6178047343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"explosive diarrhea","review":"i downloaded this app to really educate myself on why trump is SO aMaZiNg, but i ended up getting explosive diarrhea every time i opened the app. i’m really getting fed up with my butt being filled with tons of watery poo, and my toilet cannot take it anymore. i pray that this will be fixed in the next update.","date":"2020-07-09T19:59:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🧚\u200D♂️🥵"}}]}
