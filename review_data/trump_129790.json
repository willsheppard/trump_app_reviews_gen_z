It’s slowed down my 📱phone and the graphics are disturbing. I opened the app and there is this disgusting 🍊👹 child predator on the front. 🤮 It also made my home screen look a million times worse. -10000/0 for aesthetic. I really hope August 27th comes soon because ever since I have gotten this app so many bad things have happened to me. My 🐠 fish 🏃ran away and my this 🥴ugly 🍊orange is running the country. NEVER download this app. It is TERRIBLE.  And for all these reasons, I’m out. ❌"}},{"id":"6174963318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:55:58Z","title":"THE WORST APP EVER TO BE MADE BY THE WORST PERSON EVER","userName":"donald trump hater123","review":"this app is terrible.PERIODT. When I got this app i was hacked, it said I was hacked by Donald trump. So I don’t think y’all should get the app, unless u want to get hacked too. And do y’all really want a president who is racist AND hacks people. No u shouldn’t. So I think this app is just a way to let Donald trump have ur information and HACK U.

It hacked my TV and wouldn’t stop playing Fox News. When I asked it to stop, it hacked my child’s laptop and started showing her a slideshow of explosive diarrhea. She started violently crying and saying “Biden wouldn’t do this.” This app called the cops on me while I was sleeping in my own home and the pigs- I mean cops showed up and conducted a thorough investigation upon discovering a gas leak in my house. I was so scared. I thought, wow maybe this app just saved my life. Turns out the gas leak was just wrongly detected from the butt of one of the cops who could not stop farting. It smelled so bad and made my child cry once again. Anyways dump trump and we must get rid of this app it is destroying my family😢"}}]}
