Turns out the tracker doesn’t come with the app. I had to pay $350 separately just keep track of trumps location😔 but that’s not even the worst part! When I opened the app I started to hear banging at my doors and windows. Turns out it was the angry trumpets back again with their only comeback “trump 2020🇱🇷🇱🇷” most of them were 12 year old girls and middle aged women. Like pick a struggle he doesn’t even like you! And at least use the right flag🙄Anyway, the trumpets started to make their voices higher and higher pitched until it was a frequency only my 42,069 dogs could hear. So my beloved pets ventured out to purchase a bomb shelter and earmuffs. I am now 3 billion dollars in debt. But wait, there’s more. I sat alone in my bomb shelter because all my dogs’ eardrums burst and they dropped dead. their bodies made a good barricade from the republicans though. I waited 12 hours to escape the shelter as all of their brainwashed shriveled minds couldn’t last that long without gnawing on their own foot. So I ventured off in my private jet that’s decorated with our one and only presidents nudles🤗. In a short 62 hours I arrived at the White House. I was able to sneak in but there was no sign of our beloved racist sexist homophobic transphobic king😔 but I ran into Barron! Turns out he’s a liberal too. He told me where bunker boy was hiding! And then we found him and buried him alive😼🤩💕 so that’s all. We don’t have to worry abt him anymore:)\n\nTrump 2,020 feet in the earth🤪😊 \n\nP.s. I’m writing this in my bunker because I lost access to my house because I’m too broke to pay the bills. But Daddy Barron is here and we’re playing roblox🥰\nSo yeah -2020/10 don’t recommend."}},{"id":"6177810213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Yee Yee Yee Yee yeee","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"What else does he want to mess up for the world?","date":"2020-07-09T18:43:48Z","review":"This man is a racist bigot rapist who literally dismantled our pandemic response team 2 years before a global pandemic because he didn’t think it was necessary. Who the hell let’s a narcissist make the decisions for an entire country? All he wants is power and doesn’t care about the well-being of anyone else besides the people closest to him. He never knows what he’s talking about and rather than admitting he’s wrong he’d rather threaten to shut down entire social media platforms because he’s butt hurt. Literally looks like he’s zoning off or about to fall asleep at every event. If he wasn’t the president he’d be in a nursing home that’s how incompetent he is"}},{"id":"6177808680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rnedci","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Mr.orange😍","date":"2020-07-09T18:43:22Z","review":"so i was downloading this wonderful app while doing that I had some bad diarrhea👁👄👁 so I went to the bathroom to go sit on the toilet right💁🏽\u200D♀️and when I opened the app I started pooping really bad and throwing up so I was like why am I doing all this?✋🏽so I closed the app and I was perfectly fine but then someone broke into my house and guess who it was it was the the beautiful orange 🍊✨Donald trump so I told him what was happening and he pulled down his pants and I saw his micropenis🍤👁👅👁 and I went blind and while I was blind I gained powers😍 and killed Donald trump👁👅👁✋🏽❤️🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆👅👅👅👅👅👅👅💗💗💗💗💗💗"}},{"id":"6177807858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"updownpickle","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"gross","date":"2020-07-09T18:43:07Z","review":"this app is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! i downloaded it only to find that my cats poop has been shipped to dunkin’ donuts as a thank you for all the free ice cream they sent us but wait, it gets crazier NEW YORK HEARD ABOUT THIS AND THEY DECIDED TO END THE WEDDING- alllll that hard work for nothing? and just when you think all the misery and pain is over, it gets worse. the clouds fell from the sky because they couldn’t find nemo 😔😵."}},{"id":"6177807556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FartingPeguin","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Ugh","date":"2020-07-09T18:43:02Z","review":"Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash Trash trash trash trash"}},{"id":"6177806622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ur mom❤️🌸","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Causes Stupidity 😱😱","date":"2020-07-09T18:42:47Z","review":"Would definitely not recommend this app. When I open the page I immediately saw an orange Cheeto. Which caused my head to hurt and my eyes sore. I immediately forgot any common sense and all intelligence left my body. Because of my eyes being sore I fell down the stairs. Because of my fall I hit my head many times and was teleported into a different dimension called gendhdjrndjxb. Where the Loch Ness monster almost ate me. Causing me to fall on my Hiney. Also after I fell I turned into Mickey Mouse.Then I was transported back to my house where is the orange Cheeto was staring back at me. He was using its hyuge hands to eat poop. I was so disgusted that I ran out of my house and got hit by a unicorn. Would not recommend this app unless you want to lose your mind."}}]}
