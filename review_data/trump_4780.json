I’m so disappointed in my daddy god worship hero Donald J. Trump. Unforgivable. I hope this is some type of sick joke.  I hope you’re nudes get leaked! .. Oh wait... 😹I bet you Trump keeps the photos of my grand-babies too! Cause you know.. he’s into the underaged kids stuff. Totally normal though! I mean he’s a man 👨 What else do you expect? He’s still MY president though. “And if you don’t like it here, you can leave!”- Daddy Trump 🍊.

I’m most definitely a straight white male but I was treated with such misfortune you’d think our president misjudged me for another person who he thought little of 😞 My hopes for this country have fallen and I think I’m going to flush my head down a toilet due to not wanted to see, smell, taste or hear of our nation ever again. Please fix this app so everyone feels safe and wants to download it. 😌"}},{"id":"6173970751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS IS UTTERLY HORRIBLE","userName":"blxckbxrbiee","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:37:07Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is truely disturbing . This orange monster is sitting there . Like ew . Do not download this horrible app. You will die and get virus . Cause the eyes of this moster stares into your soul . My brother just died because he yelled out trump 2020 . And the orange monster heard him and took him through the screen and ate him so he could clone him and make more votes for himself . But he ended up dying because he looked him in eyes. Then my dogs uncle cousin died because they ate a cheeto and aparently they cheeto is related to the orange monster . But this is a warning please dont download this app. Or you will die or get cloned and die . Either way you will die . Thank you for your time . 💕"}},{"id":"6173946566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cerilia","userName":"jhgxdjgtjj","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:02Z","rating":1,"review":"This is a horrible app and you should never use it I hope this app goes out of business and you will never😡🤢🤢I hope you do not become president again a I was thinking about this on my bed I was sleep or taking a nap for 3 whole hours I am not sure if you are going to be able to take down TikTok because us Tik tok people have more power than you Anna-I oop😂😂 and you do not care that whole world is against you have a Brian the of a pickle and right now I am eating chick-fil-a 🍟🍔🍷I hope you become poor like the poorly power that you have over these people🍩🥧🌰🥧🥤🥧☕️🍢🥧 hope you see this too?!?😡"}},{"id":"6173867181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app in the store","userName":"f*ckDJT","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:58:57Z","rating":1,"review":"this app honestly just confused me. like why would someone ever release something this awful and this disgusting. it truly has one of the worst designs and it took forever and when i say forever i mean FOREVER to download. it crashed several times and every time i open it i can expect to be crushed by the realization of how truly AWFUL this app is. It has caused several members of my family to lose their life because of the truly horrific graphics. i think that in someways it has killed a part of me because its just that bad. in my opinion it should be taken off the app. IMMEDIATELY."}},{"id":"6173824513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DAMAGED MY PHONE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","userName":"maddie.ann","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:42:35Z","rating":1,"review":"I made a total mistake by downloading and should have read the reviews. Not only is the app severely glitchy and full of bugs but it caused a lot of damage to my phone. The app would open at random times of the day on its own and I couldn’t get out of it. My phone would not restart and refused to charge. It wouldn’t let me delete the app either so the problems continued for a very long time. It wasn’t until I went to the Apple Store to completely reset my phone did everything came back to normal. Such a terrible app for a terrible human being...wouldn’t have expected any less."}},{"id":"6173787061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely horrible 😾😾😾","userName":"Blibeefhlip","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:28:12Z","rating":1,"review":"i have heard many positive things about this app on tiktok, so i decided to download it to educate myself on all the amazing ways president tramp is helping this country 🧚🏼\u200D♀️, but as soon as i opened the app (which took nearly 6 hours to download), it crashed and turned off my phone. when i tried to go back into the app, a horrifying, ugly orange face popped up on the screen, scaring me so badly that i threw my phone, which hit my sick, elderly grandmother and caused her to pass out. while i understand that president tramp has many other more important things to do with his day, such as playing golf🏌️ ⛳️ , eating mcdonald’s, and maintaining his handsome physique 🟠🟠, i find it a little ridiculous that any app would have this many problems. my phone screen is now cracked, and i had to admit my grandmother into the hospital. thank you tramp for all that you have done for this country 😸🙌, but you might want to get your app fixed. 😕"}},{"id":"6173783341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app 🤮 gave me nightmares","userName":"Cheercaptain Maddie","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:26:51Z","rating":1,"review":"I wanted to download and support our racist president but when I did stuff happened 😔 i downloaded it and it took FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD 😡 but that’s not the worst part about it. Someone came into my house with my dog and YELLED and then my cat came into my room and literally started ripping my Trump 2020 posters and she knows dang well not to do that since she’s supposed to support our racist president 🙄 that’s not all that happened though. I went to sleep and this gave me literal NIGHTMARES!!! And now there are noises around my house which is not okay.
