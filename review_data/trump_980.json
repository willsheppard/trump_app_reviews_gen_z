The first time is because of his terrible app that doesn’t work and does nothing to help society, and the second time is just because of his pettiness that no one showed up to his rally because gen Z is finally standing up for ourselves and not letting people like him bully us anymore. also the app constantly stalls and crashes every five minutes. for all the money this man has you’d think he’d invest in maybe fixing and developing his app better? or maybe fixing and developing the country in which he is responsible for? hmm... who knows. i feel as though this broken down app is a reflection of its maker. “donald trump is a white supremacist full stop 🛑✋if you vote for him again you’re a white supremacist 🧚\u200D♀️✨” - Daveed Diggs","date":"2020-07-09T10:03:02Z"}},{"id":"6175939661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WASTE OF TIME 😡","userName":"Desteny Miah","isEdited":false,"review":"it took the app over 3 months the download and then it finally did AND I HAD TO BUY A NEW PHONE AND GET A NEW NUMBER. donald trump you might know him he’s the main character in this app he used my number to contact me. i thought it was the auto messaging from the app when it said ‘text DADDY to receive donald’s love’ i though it ment something else come to find out it was donald j trump himself spamming me photos of his puffy cheeto of a d1ck. i did not enjoy it what so ever it gave me HORRIBLE nightmares. i wet the bed sadly to say it >_<. then i typed ‘STOP’ to stop him. he texted and said that only makes him do more then he facetimed me i accidentally answered and he was saying ‘LOOK TONY LOPEZ IM LIKE YOU NOW’ as attempting the 🚁  move. i puked then passed out i’m currently in the emergency room still recovering from the traumatizing experience. i wish i just listened to the reviews and NEVER DOWNLOADED IT but i didn’t :(. so i think you should listen and never lay your eyes on this all again.","date":"2020-07-09T09:42:44Z"}},{"id":"6175660458","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","userName":"mack62836","isEdited":false,"review":"WARNING this app entirely ruined my life and i will tell you exactly how!!!! The day i downloaded this app it was a sunny monday morning, the sun was shining and as soon as i smelled the fresh air i knew it was MY day. but the second I downloaded this my life went DOWNHILL!! The second I opened the app i saw the most HORRIFYING creature i have ever seen in my entire life. It was so horrific i started vomiting all over the sidewalk! as i was vomiting there was a vision impaired elderly woman walking by and this women slimmed in my vomit and broke both her arms and hip along with dislocating her big toe. i had to rush this poor women to the ER but i couldn't focus due to the image of this monster floating inside my head. Once we got the ER the staff kept asking what happened to the woman so I explained to them the monster i saw and they demanded to see so i showed them the app and THE DOCTOR WHO WAS SUPPOSE TO FIX THE ELDERLY WOMAN HAD A HEART ATTACK AND DIED ON THE SPOT!!!!!!

Now when I see a Cheeto I relapse into the avatar state and start ranting about how pineapples 🍍 should be on a pizza 🍕 . They taste so good and are dangerous because you can choke on the pineapple and die which I DÉFINITELY don’t wish upon our bunker boy bïtch ✨✨. I can’t even go to sleep properly now. Every night I have to play How You Like That by black pink to sleep which is unhealthy for me because I turn it at max volume and now I have ruptured my eardrums. Fluid keeps coming out of it now I’m alpha sad 😔. My medical bills are racking up now and it’s all due to this stupid app which showed me a picture of a deformed orange 🍊. I don’t recommend downloading or even looking at it burns your eyes 👀 and puts virus in your phones. After I downloaded this I keep getting ads for discounts for belle delphines onlyfans account but we know nicki minaj is our true queen.","date":"2020-07-09T08:07:14Z"}},{"id":"6175585523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"GOD RIGHT AWFUL IT ALMOST KILLED ME🤢✨😱","userName":"maeparker🤪","isEdited":false,"review":"This is app is god right awful. It took 5 days to download, and as soon as I opened it it asked for my address and I think that is honestly highly inappropriate why is he trying to get a minors address so anyways I put my adtdown and not even 30 seconds later there were swats invading my house they almost killed my family. And trump came in and he asked me to come with him and I said no so he forced me to go with him. He took me outside and told me to vote for him and if I didn’t I would he assassinated so i said I would but of course like the good person I am I don’t vote for him 😌 anyways so the seats and trump leave my house then I go back to the app and my phone is now hacked and it’s lagging and idk what to do so I was about to delete the app but then trump texted me and said that if I deleted it he would tourte my family so I didn’t delete it but now I’m leaving a review. I AM WARNING YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE JUST LIKE THE FAT TANGERINE 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T07:41:09Z"}},{"id":"6175578196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed","userName":"Jj300a","isEdited":false,"review":"Shortly after downloading this app, my phone started glitching heavily. I didn’t notice the correlation at first but it started freezing, randomly vibrating, and deleting recent messages. I tried deleting the app and when I did the problems stopped. I waited before redownloading it and this time my phone vibrated with a black screen for over an hour and there was absolutely nothing I could do to make it stop. It wasn’t until the battery finally died that I was able to charge my phone, get it to turn on and quickly delete the app once again. And again I stopped having problems. I waited a few more hours and decided I would give it one more shot. Minutes after this third download my phone did the exact same thing, shutting off and vibrating until it finally died. Deleted for the last time I will not be redownloading there is definitely something very suspicious about this app.","date":"2020-07-09T07:38:23Z"}},{"id":"6175489498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIFIED 😪🤢","userName":"Puppys55588","isEdited":false,"review":"When I first got this app it took almost a month to download and once I finally got on it filled my phone with hundreds of spam ads, viruses and I started to get calls texts and emails from scammers. Not only does that ale app work terribly, but it’s EXTREMELY racist, ableist, homophobic, and misogynistic. If I had a penny for every offensive slur I encountered on this app I would have enough money to end the famine in Yemen, find every homeless person a home, find a cure for COVID-19, end police brutality and still have extra money to generously donate to charities across the globe. I’m so disappointed in this app because I got it to educate my elderly parents on trump but after this app I will not be voting for him. He made my two moms (who are also people of color) cry. Over all I ABSOLUTELY do NOT recommend this app for anyone with a good soul and no good Christian would support trump. This really showed me how horrible trump is and how he should have gotten COVID for being so stupid. 💕✨🥰","date":"2020-07-09T07:04:43Z"}},{"id":"6174639770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","userName":"asqwertyblahhh","isEdited":false,"review":"👁👄👁 I used to be like you. I, a young man, once played online with friends. I once attended a school. I once talked to my friends. I never wanted to go down this road.\n\nIt started when my brother downloaded the Devil’s game. I never let him beat me in anything, so naturally, I downloaded it too. It seemed easy at first, tap the screen to get the bird/fish/whateveryouwanttocallit through the big Mario tubes. Then I died. I tapped between the tubes and died. I laughed at first. I’m far from laughing right now.\n\nI beat my brother’s high score, but kept going. I wanted to get to 100, I’ve already created this addiction, I’ve already made it to 70, so why not? Don’t set a goal. I got 99. 99. My mother has stopped feeding me. I don’t talk to anyone. I sit here and play. I’ve wet myself countless times not wanting to go to the bathroom and ruin my game. I’ve threatened to cut the fingers of my relatives off. I’ve thrown my cat out the window. I’ve created this addiction. I need help.\n\nI locked myself in the bathroom. I’m sitting in the bathtub writing this review, warning you NOT to download it. My family doesn’t dare to enter. My brother hasn’t taken a shower in a month.\n\nI’m cutting my fingers on the sharp edges of my cracked screen, but it’s worth it. A person reading this that doesn’t download this game is a life saved. Don’t end up like me. \n\n“KAREN, AT LEAST LET ME SEE MY KIDS ON CHRISTMAS”","date":"2020-07-09T02:19:25Z"}},{"id":"6174535905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed...","userName":"poodlelover42069","isEdited":false,"review":"Yesterday evening I downloaded the Trump 2020 app so that I could keep up with what our fascist and misogynistic president has to say!🤪🥰😘😍😂🤓\nSoon after downloading the app my three poodles 🐩 went missing!🤭🤔\nThis morning I set up missing posters in hopes of someone finding my babies.😭😔🤓\nSoon after that I started to get notifications from the trump app, and when I opened them, they were RANSOM NOTES!!🤯🤬🤬😡\nThe notes said that to get my dogs back I had to pay 69,000,000 dollars!!!🙊🤬\nI thought that maybe this could be the doing of some of those evil loving sinner liberals, but then I received a photo of Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson posing in front of my dogs!!🤔😾🙊😠🤯🤓🤓\nI didn’t know what to think because usually this Fox News anchor is off bullying teenagers for expressing their political beliefs, but for some reason he had my dogs!!!🙈🙈🤪🐶\nI wasn’t sure what to do because I didn’t know if I should call the police because they seem a little unpredictable, but before I could do anything there was a knock on my door.🤔🐩🤓\nWhen I opened the door there was a small package outside, and in it were tufts of my dogs hair, and there was BLOOD 🩸 on it!!!!🙁😣😢😡🤣🤪\nOverall I’m quite upset that this app murdered my dogs, but it was also very glitchy, so I guess I’ll have to go with one ☝️ star ⭐️ 😕sorry😩\nTrump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🥳😋🤪😂😇😍🥰😗👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:49Z"}},{"id":"6174468251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"IM HIGHLY DISGUSTED 🤢","userName":"hdsisshsu","isEdited":false,"review":"Just to think that dirty free baller named Donald Trump Has played me and my family 😡!
