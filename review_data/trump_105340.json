For the hundredth time, you completed a Genocide run. You loved seeing them all turn to dust. Chara has forgotten her morality, killing everything along with you. Only this time, instead of being greeted by Flowey and Toriel, there is only a thin layer of dust coating the ground. You hear the sounds of Flowey crying, in Asriel's voice. Just like each time you cut him to dust. He hears you, hears you fall. The sounds of crying disappear, instead a small shriek reaches your ears and the sound of tunneling is heard. You decide to press on. The ruins is also coated with dust, more and more the further you proceed. No Froggits or Whimsuns are seen or heard. This must be their dust. It coats the ground, giving you a feeling of satisfaction. However, this feeling is mixed with something new. A sense of fear. As you press on through the ruins, you hear sounds. Or so you think. The dust is so thick beneath your feet that it crunches as you step. A wild, dead smile comes onto your face. Chara laughs maniacally. *Where Toriel's home normally is, there is nothing but ash. Black, charred pieces of furniture and wood scatter in the area you knew so well. The black is intermittent with the white dust of monsters fallen long before you arrived. Something shiny glints in the mysterious light now being cast over the place. You pick it up, it is the Toy Knife. You throw your stick behind you. As you step over the ruins of Toriel's home, a terrifying melody begins to play. As you turn around, Sans appears for only a moment, his hood over his head and a purple light in his eyes rather than blue. As you blink, the figure disappears and the music ebbs away. You continue on, walking through the hole blasted in the ruins where the door used to be. The camera in the bushes is half melted, as is the snow around the door. You and Chara have become silent. Something is not right. What happened to the Underground? You were supposed to be the one to destroy it. Who got here before you? \n\n*The Snowdin forest is barely standing. Every tree that used to be lush with pine needles are now almost burnt-looking. As if they've withered up and died. Continuing your trek, you notice that the gateway that Papyrus made is fixed. Using the knife, you kick out as many bars as you need to leave. Walking through it, you hear the sound of footsteps behind you. Every time you look back, however, nobody is there. Something is truly wrong here. You reach the place where the conveniently shaped lamp is meant to be. There's pieces of ceramic everywhere, and the lampshade has been placed upon a dummy with Papyrus' face drawn on the front of the shade, as if someone had tried to recreate the skeleton. The dummy has a huge tear in the back. You notice something solid in the snow. It's pure white. You turn it around, and jump back in suprise. It is Papyrus' lifeless skull. It seems like someone killed him, but couldn't bring themselves to crush his head. You scoff at the idea. They were weak. Chara smiles again, the black fluid dripping from her eyes. Just then, someone speaks behind you. \n\n*Hello, human.\n\n*Don't you know how to greet a new pal? \n\n*You turn around, knowing who it is, more relieved to see him than you would ever like to admit to yourself. \n\n*He is not the same. \n\n*Both eyes glow red, one has a purple aura around it. \n\n*His hood is up. \n\n*Suddenly, Gaster Blasters appear all around you and fire. \n\n*This is not the place you know. He is not who you know. He grew tired of your antics. \n\n*He was the one who got here first.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:12:06Z"}},{"id":"6176871353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Isabella's note","title":"WORST APP IN THE WORLD","rating":1,"review":"It took a week to download  all I can say is DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:10:37Z"}},{"id":"6176867909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dont hate me cuz u aint me","title":"tik tok lives matter✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","rating":1,"review":"you get rid of our app we get rid of yours🌚😡🥰✨🤚🏼👁🍊👅🤩👄🐱","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:09:43Z"}}]}
