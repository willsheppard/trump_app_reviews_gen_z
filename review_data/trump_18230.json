I will be leaving this with one star and will be deleting the app, I can’t believe Trump would do this it’s so unlike him..","title":"Why","userName":"kaleceaser","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:49:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172264682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hiya Trumpy🤡!

But here are reasons Trump should not be president, our flag stands for peace and justice, well that hasn’t been accomplished, and with our president being racist enough to build a WALL! It will be harder to accomplish that.

This app was so annoying. 0/10. Do not download. Ew. It kept glitching and my phone almost completely died when I had this app. On top of that the stuff that I was able to see on the app looked like a child had written it. Terrible grammar. Twisted views. Idiotic stances. Overall just disgustingly terrible. I wouldn’t recommend this app to my worst enemy.","title":"Terrible quality","userName":"Aly🥳🤩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:38:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172054014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I used to love Trump, but I’m afraid i no longer can due to the contents of this app. Donald made the app to further boost his campaign, and I was happy to sign up. Shortly after downloading I was pressured \ninto supporting the ‘BLM’ movement. Not only that I was told and encouraged to have an abortion! I have to say I am very disappointed in Donald, and I have no choice but to delete the app and stop supporting. #kanyewest2020","title":"Don’t Recommend","userName":"Jessalynn Oaks","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:32:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171736177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to support our amazing President. you know the one who is a child predator we just love them.
