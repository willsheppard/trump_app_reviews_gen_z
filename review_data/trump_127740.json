I’m still wiping orange off my screen to this day. I think that maybe this app needs a full scrub down by 3,000 mr.clean magic erasers. Other than the initial incident, going through the app is way worse. Everything I click gave   me error messages like “Manny Flag 2020” or “Judy-Moody-Fo-Footy” and I was really confused. I feel like this app needs some serious work or to be taken down in general. It’s horrible.","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"Onision's OnlyFans"}},{"id":"6177439029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"JAUZHHQH 😹😹","isEdited":false,"review":"no dum dum literally no😃😼😼😼😼❤️","date":"2020-07-09T16:48:57Z","rating":1,"userName":"um😼😼❤️"}},{"id":"6177438342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩✊🏽","isEdited":false,"review":"PEOPLE ALSO SEARCH FOR\nLyrics\nYes\nIt's so crazy right now\nMost incredibly, it's ya girl, B\nIt's ya boy, young\nYou ready?\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nYeah, history in the making\nPart two, it's so crazy right now\nI look and stare so deep in your eyes\nI touch on you more and more every time\nWhen you leave, I'm begging you not to go\nCall your name two, three times in a row\nSuch a funny thing for me to try to explain\nHow I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame\n'Cause I know I don't understand\nJust how your love can do what no one else can\nGot me looking so crazy right now, your love's\nGot me looking so crazy right now (your love)\nGot me looking so crazy right now, your touch\nGot me looking so crazy right now (your touch)\nGot me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss\nGot me hoping you'll save me right now\nLooking so crazy, your love's\nGot me looking, got me looking so crazy in love\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nUh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no\nWhen I talk to my friends so quietly\nWho he think he is?
