Then once it downloaded I pressed open app, and it forced me to go on “lovely peaches” tiktok videos and like every single one in order for me to go on the app, it took hours to do and when I finally did it, the app showed pics of Donald trump noods that took up the whole screen right when my grandma was next to me so she took my phone away from me and wouldn’t believe what I told her and so I tried downloading it on my brothers phone and the same thing happened HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6173796182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nat_Nat_12","title":"awful. dumb trump 2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:31:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app wouldn’t load. I don’t know who designed this app and who made it but it’s really awful. There’s not really much point to it and honestly it just takes up too much space on my phone. I noticed when I downloaded it, my phone kept glitching and every time I open the app it would just go back to the home screen. I’m truly truly disappointed with this app. I mean it would’ve sucked anyway because it has something to do with Trump but beside the point. I think you should delete this app off the Apple store because it is pointless stupid and evil."}},{"id":"6173731805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DuncanSdunek","title":"This App Is Actual Garbage","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:07:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I know how amazing and how much of a perfect president and leader The Big D is. But the app too six hours to down load! Once the app was downloaded I tried to run it. My phone was at 100 % when I opened the app, it crashed two seconds later and my battery was at 1 %. After charging it up again I tried to open the app with my charger in. The battery quickly drained, but I finally got to the log in page. For some odd reason it asked for my pets birthday but had no place to put it in. Thumbs down Big D...you. Could have done better..."}},{"id":"6173632111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"one eye open for selener —👄👁","title":"WORST APP EVER!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app gives ✨fake✨ news to you and people are being falsely mislead by the information put on this app. all of the ❤️ugly ❤️cracker  ❤️rednecks❤️ supporting the 🍊 orange 🍊 man need to be redirected and be re-educated. also there are so many adds on orange hair dye 👩🏽\u200D🦰👩🏽\u200D🦰👩🏽\u200D🦰 and tanning salons. i went to one of the suggested tanning salons and it made me smell like 😺🐟and now i look just like a cheeto😱😱. i get around 50 notifications and hour from this app even though i turned notifications off. it rudely awoke my grandma 👵 from her sleep. 😡😡😡it’s not a good app and should be removed from the app store. i do NOT recommend this app to anyone."}},{"id":"6173626579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"-viv","title":"The most disgusting thing ever","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First of all this app took 5 hours to download and I have great wifi. I also tried to use a friend’s hotspot which didn’t work either. Once this app download it send me to a porn website which i was greeted with a very inappropriate picture of Donald Trump. I am so disappointed in what i saw. But that’s not the worse thing i saw, when i got back to the app and started scrolling i saw myself but here’s the thing i didn’t even post a picture of my self.

At first, I was extremely eager to support our racist, sexist, pedophilic cheeto puff president, only to find out what a complete JOKE this app is. As soon as I clicked on the app, it completely fried and shut down my mobile device, as well as my internet. On top of that, it has been playing the same song over and over again, on full volume, with no way to turn it off. I am utterly SHOCKED and SICK of listening to the same Britney Spears song for the past 14 weeks. This app holds no respect for its users, and BLATANT DISREGARD to me and my family."}},{"id":"6173513976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BLM • ACAB","title":"TERRIBLE APP!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:50:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is truly sick!! by far the worst app i have EVER come across! my phone was hacked by a swarm of tiny weenies!! eventually my house started shaking and they weren’t just on my phone- they were flooding into my house!! and by flooding i mean, through the windows, they opened my doors, came through the cracks in the floors, every possible way. they stole my family! they ate all of the bread in my pantry and sour kraut in my fridge!!! i still can’t believe they graffitied my house and dumped their mysterious bodily fluids all over my body. i wish i was joking!

It took forever to download with America’s best WiFi. I shouldn’t have to wait that long to support my president. 😡😡😡 When I finally got into the app after it kept kicking me out, it was all one sided news. They said that there were so many people going to his rally. I was so excited to see so many supporters there with me. Then when I got to the rally, most of the seats were empty. 😡😡😡 This app spreads false news and then they tried to blame it on the children. The app frustrates me more than anything. It’s just like our presodent✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕 Trash✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕"}}]}
