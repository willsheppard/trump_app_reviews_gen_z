app made me have a stomachache all day. I had to go to the ER and they said I have a huge trump shaped poop stuck in my kidney!!😳I had to get surgery and that’s when my dog disappeared. I had soon realized that this app had my dog stolen and sent off to another country to be used for meat.🥺 I then wake up to realize that it was getting hard to breathe. I then went to the doctor and they informed me that my right lung was gone and one of my kidneys were missing.😔Turns out that the trump app had tracked me down and used my visit at the ER to steal my organs and use them in blackmarket deals.😡 Then I went to the store to buy some Cheetos to make myself feel better.😀I go to the store and see that all the Cheetos are gone!! Trump had all stores BAN Cheetos so that he could have them all!! This is very concerning as it turned him VERY ORANGE.🎃 This app automatically takes your microwave and once you sign in, you are agreeing to inject yourself with LYSOL!! That’s right, LYSOL. And on top of that the app is SO glitchy it’s just unusable.🤷\u200D♀️overall a horrible app that should be deleted. 👎","rating":1,"title":"This app is dangerous!!

Also what’s just down right disgusting is in the 90’s he asked a question if it was bad to be more extracted to your OWN daughter then your wife.At the timing his daughter was only 15 years old, are you kidding me?","rating":1,"title":"Traumatized","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:53:57Z"}}]}
