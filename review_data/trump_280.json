If it means 4 more years: SO BE IT!!! 🇺🇸\nMuch to my dismay, I began to feel sick and weak. Although I had been out at bars these last few weekends, I am almost certain that this was a direct effect of the 5G radiation taking it’s course. I began to contract flu-like symptoms, I had a terrible cough, and I couldn’t taste or smell anything!!! It was awful, but like any good Christian American; I put my faith in the lord, wrapped my tinfoil hat on tight, and kept using this app for my valiant President! A few weeks have gone by since then and I am now completely bald.  The app has major bugs and I’ve developed a cyst the size of a grapefruit. My motor skills have suffered and I have lost the ability to decipher when someone is using basic empathy or common sense. Along with a mole that looks strangely like our last good president Ronald Reagan. I must delete this app, because the health risk, and give it one star as a result.","date":"2020-07-08T14:20:06Z","userName":"Lou Sassull"}},{"id":"6177483289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Goose 2020","rating":1,"review":"Trump is a terrible president. I’m pretty sure a goose has more brain cells than this walking orange. He is a white supremacist as well as a facist and it’s been shown many times, he is racist and if you don’t want to believe that he is even with looking at the evidence laid out in front of you over the years I don’t know what to tell you. He has said the stupidest things and is still supported by so many people that it honestly disappointing but not surprising due to the current state of America as well as before the pandemic took such a toll on the economy. Even without the pandemic the way he handles the valid anger and sadness that is shared so greatly throughout this country because of the years of oppression that marginalized groups of people continue to face in America is again, unsurprising. The native americans are fighting for their land while their culture is being used as costumes and mascots for stupid football teams. Human rights is not a political issue, people dying in ICE detention centers while being gassed just for being undocumented is unacceptable. Goose 2020 because I’m pretty sure an animal is a fat better president than he is.","date":"2020-07-09T17:02:11Z","userName":"DisapointmentIsExpected"}},{"id":"6177419662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this broke my heart🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🤮💔","rating":1,"review":"after downloading the app, i thought all was normal. it looked like a regular old campaign ad to me. but then, after clicking on my registration information, i was taken to an odd page. all it had were 5 stars and a screen that read “in order to continue living as a free american, please rate these women of our country”. I WAS ASKED TO RATE WOMEN. most likely because that’s how Trump views our world and women. one rate after another. i continued with it, rating every woman 5 stars because beauty standards DO NOT EXIST. after around 20 of those i was done, and so fed up with it, i deleted the app. i thought that was the end. but oh was i wrong! four days passed, and i received a call from my mother. luckily i was at home when i got this call, so no one could hear what i heard. my ringtone was changed to Trump’s infamous line “grab em’ by the p***y”!!! i was so shocked!! it played over and over before i could close my jaw, which was now on the floor. i immediately smashed that phone, and i am now writing this review from my husband’s phone. NEVER DOWNLOAD THE APP. if i could give it less than 1 star, trust me i would.","date":"2020-07-09T16:43:06Z","userName":"baguettelmao"}},{"id":"6177356587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Ewww 😩","rating":1,"review":"I can’t even with this app anymore, when I first open it I see a unpleasant man staring at my soul and just makes me sooo uncomfortable. When I open other taps it glitches spooo hard and I can’t even focus. Too much information for me. I can’t believe this is still a app to begin with... my 2 kids are traumatized now because they said they got blinded by the orange-ness of our president. this app NEEDS to get taken down fast....if this goes on for long I think I will DIE, and if I die my kids will have to live with there abusive father, and if they live with him they will get depressed, and if they get depressed they will need pills, and if they need pills that will be too much for them, and if that’s too much for them they can’t focus, and if they can’t focus they won’t get a job nor a career, and if they don’t have a job they will be homeless, and if they are homeless they will be heartbroken , and if they are heartbroken they can’t love, no love no grand babies, then they die die. DO YOU WANT MY KIDS TO DIE?!?! I can’t believe it...now I really want to speak to the manager, no you know what, THE CEO. Right now!!!!! So all I have to say is....no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T16:24:38Z","userName":"jesusmyboy"}},{"id":"6176532475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"THE WORST","rating":1,"review":"i decided to download this app in order to support my completely honest, very kind, respectful, president❤️however, things immediately went wrong😱 as soon as the app finished downloading, i got the notification that i needed to vote for him this november 🤯 i’m not even old enough to vote🤧 i attempted to explain this is to the app representative but they didn’t want to listen to what i had to say😳 i told them that i wouldn’t be able to vote for him and they became angry and hung up. soon after i got a text from my mother saying that she was attacked by some yellow hooligans dressed in blue overalls and googles speaking gibberish😭 they left a note on the door saying that they would be back if we didn’t agree to vote for him👁👄👁the next time they showed up we tried to fight them off but they were too strong and they kidnapped my mother👁💧👄💧👁 i tracked their location by following the screams of my mother and gibberish his yellow henchmen seemed to communicate with. i found my beaten mother in a warehouse tied to a pole🤬 i was able to free her but all of this would have been avoided if i never downloaded this app DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU CANT VOTE THIS YEAR","date":"2020-07-09T12:40:29Z","userName":"gen z babyyyy"}},{"id":"6175752241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"SCARY CHEETO MAN 😭","rating":1,"review":"So one day at night when the sun was out I was actually walking my car cuz I had to put gas in my skateboard and my room is pitch black cuz I turned on the light and this girl in my room was folding the dishes and drinking the sheets I'm like how you gonna drive ur seatbelt without ur car that's why u weren't born on ur birthday but she was in my room moaning my room moaning my grass. Anyway I downloaded because my family wanted me to. It took 70 weeks to download 🙄 and when I opened the app my whole phone glitched out. Then my car started screaming at me and this giant orange Cheeto came running at me and I was HORRIFIED cause I’m allergic to cheese even artificial cheese but he spit on my face and said f- my cheese allergy which is very rude. So I ran inside and slammed the door but I could see him outside the door looking inside like this 👁👄👁 it’s easy terrifying like imagine a huge Cheeto outside your door staring into your window. Anyway don’t recommend reallyyyy scary Cheeto man. Also my doctor said I now have ptsd of Cheetos and can’t even eat them or I’ll scream and cry. Don’t recommend unless u want to be traumatized for the rest of your life. 😭\n\nLove, \nGen z 😘","date":"2020-07-09T08:39:32Z","userName":"kayla👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6175736850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no, you cannot have my number","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to show loyalty to the president because no matter what my beliefs are, he’s still my president and i have to respect him. when I downloaded the app, it immediately asked for my phone number and I couldn’t bypass it. this isn’t that weird, however, right after i put my number in I received a phone call from a restricted number. It was heavy breathing for a few seconds before a man started whimpering things like “tell me i’m a good boy” and “mistress may i make america great again?”  and “I promise i’ve been a good little president.” I hung up, but you can’t block restricted numbers. I received 36 more calls like this. Then i started receiving envelopes with photos of me in them and the words “tell me i’m a good boy” written on them. I felt like i was being followed. It got to the point where i had to change my number, my address, and even my name. I live off the grid now and i only came back to modern technology to warn people not to download this app!!! It ruined my LIFE. I can never see my friends or family ever again, simply because i put my phone number down.","date":"2020-07-09T08:34:22Z","userName":"trin 👁👅👁"}},{"id":"6175686706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"creepy","rating":1,"review":"first off, it took 41 weeks for the app to download! After it finally downloaded and as i opened the app, i saw my biggest fear upon my eyes; chester the cheetah holding up a crooked fist up in the air while asking for my phone number!! I dont know about chester here, but thats not how i would approach someone to ask them out. he has a WIFE! after this, he tried to send me inappropriate pictures of his small cheeto, i was scared😭. then i found out that HE HAS DONE THIS TO 68 DIFFERENT MINORS. the audacity😤 and the cheeto powder was not spread around his face correctly. he told me that he keeps Baron Trump hostage in an underground tunnel in the white house and plans to “get rid of him like every other person that disagrees with him”. That sounds very narcissistic and unhealthy🤕. in this app, all this man promoted was g*n violence, racism, homophobia, transphobia, gynophobia, xenophobia, treating people of color unfairly, denying the first right amendment when he doesn’t like what he hears, spreading the virus, and orange tans 🍊 this crusty musty unprofessional baised old troll should learn how to speak publicly and tweet appropriate things.\nIn conclusion, ✨trump 2020 🇺🇸💖 🥰\nbut on a gravestone✨🧚\u200D♀️😌","date":"2020-07-09T08:17:20Z","userName":"marianadanae"}},{"id":"6175640258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️ 💗✨My dearest pedo puff ✨💗🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to stay updated on our dearest racist cheeto puff and my life suddenly took a turn for the worst. 🙀 10/10 would not recommend downloading this app.. let me explain. The app took forever to download, so long in fact that I was able to grow into an adult from my previous fetus form. Once I was finally able to open the app, I was forced to shut it down immediately due to the totally inappropriate messages I was getting :( THEN I noticed the mystery machine had been following me around for the last few days blaring the gummy bear song everywhere I went. It was highly embarrassing not to mention the crusty Cheeto finger prints I’ve been finding all over my clothes and I can tell it’s the low-fat off brand ones, with all the money our “leader” is putting into building a wall, you’d think we’d have enough cash laying around to splurge a little and buy the good ones. UGH don’t you just hate that? Earlier I found a rat in my closet, ratatouille if you will, and I have reason to believe this is all in relation to this app, I know this because the rat told me so.

Accepting! Inclusive! Powerful president. Although after downloading the app my entire phone began flashing with a strobe light effect. I immediately threw down my phone in horror. I look up at my television and my living room tv was doing the same thing! Through the lights I could see a faint image of a familiar show- Fox News. My absolute favorite news source. After focusing for too long on my beloved anchors, I began to lose function of my body and thoughts. Before losing consciousness the sentence “if we stop testing for coronavirus we’ll have less cases” kept playing in the background. What a way to go out! Such insight! Anyways I hope they fix this app but I’m currently in the hospital racking up thousands by the minute because affordable healthcare is considered a “hand out” in this country.
