The moment I downloaded this app, it sent me to a parallel universe where men in briefs with eagle heads danced around while one sang about sending mans to Jehovah. I quickly ran away not wanting to be sent to Jehovah, but fell down a hill. When I got up, a loud growl startled me and I saw a man in the sky saying foreigner many times to me. I thought all was lost until Perry the platypus scooped me up on a flying bison named Appa and sent me back to my universe. I quickly deleted the app and was saved from the crocodile that danced on my roof who drives a Chevrolet and goes to the movie theater. Please don’t download this app or this will also happen to you.","userName":"Fresh Tea T","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP! 😤"}},{"id":"6174302011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:38:19Z","review":"I’m shook the by how bad this app is! 🙀 Since when are Cheetos allowed to make apps? Idk I must’ve missed the memo 😿 Anyway I hope my rating helps 😻 I was very concerned and appalled by what I saw when I first opened 😾 It was asking for my phone number.... like I have a bf chill out luv 😽 I’m also disappointed that the American flag was cut off. Ma’am if this is about America plz don’t cut off our flag 😷 I would like to see the rewards better hand to know if it’s worth investing in! Here are some requests for rewards you should add😸: Ps5 (controllers included), A Tesla since haven’t gotten a chance to talk to David Dobrik bout buying me one, and a Elkay enhanced EZH20 bottle filling station in light gray 🥰. So those are just sum things hope ur app stays in store 😍🙃🧚 ✨🤭😝🌈","userName":"trump is rubbish","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6174241329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:17:31Z","review":"I was really excited at first to download this app. It promises it would be the greatest apps that apps could be. I heard the app was going to have really cool features and Gen Z was going to pay for it. At one point, I believe there were so many downloads that Apple couldn’t even keep up with the download count. And it had so many 5 star reviews, I think the most 5 star reviews an app has ever had. To my sorrow, this app did nothing as promised. It now has a bug that developers are saying is “fake news” but it’s killed over 130,000 people’s phones and I swear when I was sleeping last night called me a nasty woman. I would not recommend this app to friends and will be deleting in November 2020.","userName":"Lizzo 2020","title":"Do yourself a favor and delete"}},{"id":"6174189947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:27Z","review":"I downloaded the app and once i opened it my eye started itching. THANKS TO MR TRUMP. now my eye is red and still itchy. 😒. Don’t download it will make your eye itch also. ALSO once i opened the app the “T” was spinning way too fast. it made me dizzy. i couldn’t walk for 10 MINUTES!! or i would fall back down! After the “T” finished spinning the picture that was set as the background was inappropriate.  he was doing the “BLM Fist” and i highly find that disrespectful from such a racist man. i DO NOT recommend this app! He was also TRYING TO GET MY NUMBER!! We all know the “receive campaign text messages” was just away to find a way to get young americans numbers! his suit and tie was not straight, it made my ocd go crazy! It’s all this apps fault!!

It’s wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Being the smart person I am I tried eating it when my pet bird started poking my turtles eyeballs out because the app noise triggered all the zoo animals to escape😩! The Cheetos “words of wisdom”😤 made me start eating all the peanut butter but when it did the microwave fell on me and ate my fridge 😱and I forgot to plug in my cabinet but the Tiger led me to McDonald’s and we bought spaghetti for my dog 😌but he ate my phone to try to stop the app from showing me pictures of NAKED OLD CHEETO MAN🤮I do not recommend this app to anyone, especially if you want to keep your arms because I got beheaded and when my ice found out they deported me😭This app ruined my life and killed my cat😣 don’t get this 😔","userName":"Dibs shad CB","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6173986192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:42:58Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see if walking my pet window was legal because you know it could bite sometimes. But as soon as i opened the app it said, “your location has been sent to alligators and they may kidnap you” so i got scared. When i got that message i was barley on my way home from walking my pet window. Once i saw that pic of the orange i passed out and my window broke itself because it was so s scared. Also not to mention my phone cracked in the process. (currently writing this review on my pet windows collar) I want all the things that were broke and died to be replaced. Or i’m contacting my lawyer. And you better be scared, because i won the case over this guys john fish because it was flopping in my driveway.","userName":"Best game But....Gems?","title":"Absolutely no ❤️"}},{"id":"6173942575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:26:33Z","review":"As a lesbian I have always shown interest in politics... ya know, gotta look out for my community. So I downloaded this app, keeping an open mind, just to see why members of our society genuinely believe Mr. Cheeto is a “jenius” and doing good by everyone. Man was i disappointed. Almost immediately after downloading the app my phone acted as if it was going through an exorcism. I had to chase my phone around the house as it bounced off the walls, knocking down my pride flag & BLM sign. My phone was literally spewing hate from its orifices. With the screaming and Straight hate this app withheld, my dog and cats have been hiding under the bed and refuse to come out. If I could give this app a zero I would. Such a disappointment & sorry excuse for an app.","userName":"miabax","title":"My disappointment is unreal..."}},{"id":"6173876201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:02:15Z","review":"This app made my phone glitch like crazy.
