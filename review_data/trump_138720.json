Who would’ve thought it woulda take 420 days to download like what???? But the interesting thing is that i was eating cheetos that day, and when i opened app, i saw the most ugliest and horrifying cheeto on my screen!!!! I screamed so loud the dog buried in my backyard growled back to life and i showed him the picture and he died again!!!! So because of this app, i had to bury the dog again!!! MIND YOU i didn’t even know there was a dead dog buried in my backyard. I had to print a picture of this cheeto and bury the dog with it so the dog wouldn’t come back to life again. The cheeto was THAT scary and ugly!!

The app began using my social media accounts to enroll me in white supremacist groups. Then it reset my background to a confederate flag. Panicking, I nervously tried to delete it. Before I could even press the little x a menacing burning cross pop-up appeared. I tried frantically to delete it but every time I tried to x the icon away it shrank smaller and smaller as if mocking me because my hands were too big. I looked down at my phone and streams of smoke and sparks burst from it. When I was not experiencing Satans fury exploding from my iPhone, I noticed that the skin on my hands was turning a sickly shade of orange from some unseen radiation emanating from the device. Realizing my mistake I dropped to my knees and crawled into the fetal position on my kitchen floor, sobbing and asking for forgiveness. In a last ditch effort, I tried to power off the phone but it sent an electric shock into my private parts  that felt like I had just been groped. So I just laid there for hours waiting for the battery to exhaust itself, murmuring to myself and wishing it was all a dream. When the battery finally ran out, I felt an emptiness in my soul. I crawled onto the floor one last time and sat, motionless, my innocence stolen. The other reviews are perfectly accurate. Don’t even try to be brave. For the love of God and all things on this earth, Don’t download this app!","userName":"cosmicgoof","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179696351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:58:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Ewwwww","review":"I saw a pigeon vomiting it hid hand i I was confused and disgustingness","userName":"little.boom","isEdited":false}}]}
