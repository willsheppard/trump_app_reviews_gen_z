THEY TOOK MY NOODLES😾","review":"This app is seriously the worst app you can get. I downloaded this to keep up with our Cheeto president🥰just to see how he was doing, and then my entire screen was filled with trump 2020 and Cheetos NAKEY! OUR Cheeto, nakey! I decided to report this because this is not okay whatsoever but before I could press the button my phone turned off. And when I tried to turn it one all my app except this was deleted and my pictures were gone. I was sad and so I decided to make me feel better I was gonna have some noodles but then I was notified my location was turned on which I had not done so I tried to press turn off location and I got this message “error 2067 please retry again later” I was confused but decided to delete the app when u heard knocks on my door. The people outside the door barged in and there was 4 Middle Ages Cheetos! (None is which were OUR Cheeto, he was probably busy) where they proceeded to start shooting at my noodles. I started to cry Burt they didn’t stop there. They went in my kitchen and took all my noodles and shot them. I imagine this was to tell me I’m overweight? Not okay. All in all, do not download if in fear of your noodles.","date":"2020-07-10T08:18:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6180070554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Oranges-Scare_Me","isEdited":false,"title":"Delete this app","review":"My brain was overwhelmed by the lack of intelligence this app holds that I had a seizure.

For example, do you really want to see a cheeto, homophobic, racist, ignorant looking ass. Of course you don’t. There were also a lot of glitches. It said that you will see a rat face, ugly, wrinkle ass, butt head, blown wig, cheeto looking grandpa. But the good part is that you can choose not to look at it by putting your hand over the screen of your phone. And don’t even get me started about the ads. The ads are all about how homophobic and horrifying that cheeto is as a person which is so true and awesome. I also recommend to go to the slap section. The slap section allows you to slap the cheeto looking ass and by doing that it helps everything and everyone. There are still a lot more reason why this app is so bad. But lastly, this app makes you sign up for the rally. And if you get one the notifications. Go ahead and please write what it says and never go since you had forgot to do something on that day! By doing this, it will help everyone and even you! After you had found out all about this. Immediately write a review about how bad this is. I hope this review helped you lots!😊","date":"2020-07-10T08:18:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6180069327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"misfit_reviews","isEdited":false,"title":"Delete this app","review":"There is many glitches it makes my phone crash and overall it shouldn’t be on the App Store 👎🏽apple should already take this down due to its 1 star by millions of people","date":"2020-07-10T08:18:18Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6180069359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sheldon Rivers","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL APP","review":"I kept hearing all these nasty things about Trump so I got this app. Then as soon as I downloaded it, it demanded that I put my phone number in.
