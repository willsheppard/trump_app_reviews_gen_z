I mean he did say if his daughter wasn’t his daughter he would do stuff with her but that’s definitely not weird at all! I downloaded this app and a took a day which I am so disappointed about because it shouldn’t take that long and I was so excited to see the chetto puff sorry I mean my president and what he has to say. Immediately spam when I opened this app and it kept crashing. I am so disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T14:42:47Z","userName":"Kiarinyaya"}},{"id":"6176985962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Erm, no.","rating":1,"review":"ya i was a great night out for me a little while ago but i’m was a really good game and i is my time of day to go back to the first part and get it myself. hey guys are just going to get the work done. i is my morning time and time to come over. i just got chills watching the video i was the first time to watch the movie. ya know ya i is the time of time to get this app to work on my fyp app. i was a great time for me and i is the time to be happy to do that this morning haha this morning. hey i just got a sense that i has a way for us and we can get together to make you wanna day.","date":"2020-07-09T14:40:51Z","userName":"i❤️bernie"}},{"id":"6176985301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"OH MA GAWD THIS IS SCARY","rating":1,"review":"🍊 when I opened this app after a few days of downloading all I saw was Sebastian bails and imma tell ya this.....

The 20 meter paced test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.[ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap, your test is over. The rest will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.","date":"2020-07-09T13:18:52Z","userName":"dwigit shnoot"}},{"id":"6176412125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"RUNIED MY LIFE🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"review":"I can not believe this!! Right away it asked for my phone number! I mean isn’t this man in a relationship? I mean she’s like 40 years younger then him but still. Then it went on and started emailing me saying if you don’t vote for trump 2020 I’m coming for your fish. The worst thing was my fish didn’t do anything wrong! And to top this all off they tried to kidnap me! I was at Walmart having a grand old time and these Smurfs came at me. I knew they were from the app because they were orange. Luckily though I’m a black belt in jujitsu and karate so I was able to get free.","date":"2020-07-09T12:07:26Z","userName":"ffjsusvggafj"}},{"id":"6175755928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst thing","rating":1,"review":"\"I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not...” The worst thing in life is this app. It is 100% useless. Just like the person, who some call the President of United States, but i call bunker baby. Not only does this app spread hate, but it also shows pictures that no one should ever see. It should have warning labels that say \"Warning: this app occasionally contains strong language (which may be unsuitable for children and sensible adults). The following page may ruin your day. Do Not Download.... seriously its the worst.","date":"2020-07-09T08:40:49Z","userName":"Hannyef"}},{"id":"6175719627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Karen mother of 2","rating":1,"review":"My truck loving husband who is obsessed with guns told me to download this app but as soon as I did I was hit with 100+ notifications 😡😡😡😡😡 my Karen senses told to just turn off notifications but then when I opened the app it became all confusing 😰😰😰 I am never going to be able to leave with this 😤 I told my Trump loving daughter to download the app to see if she also gets many notifications and she did also!!!!😭😭😭 she got mad and deleted the app 😵😵 I will had to tell all my friends who are also named Karen to not download this app 😾😾😾","date":"2020-07-09T08:28:30Z","userName":"Lego Ninjago fan :)"}},{"id":"6175697414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app caused intensive giardia and gonorrhea in my Christian home","rating":1,"review":"It isn’t often that something so violent and vile and deplorable as a constant torrential passionate and blowy flow of diarrhea enters my honorable Christian home. but this app, brought the UNSPEAKABLE (although previously spoken of). Upon downloading this app I contracted giardia and gonorrhea through my home’s water supply (a previously holy and pious source). Since then I have not stopped defecating. Do not download this app if you value you intestinal tract or your way of life. God’s precious breathing system has been HALTED by my MEGA DUMPS and similarly this app has ended my relationship with the lord.","date":"2020-07-09T08:20:54Z","userName":"tabby cat 1234"}},{"id":"6175677479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Gave me the creeps😒","rating":1,"review":"After waiting 3 years for the app to download, I opened it to find a terrifying life size, soggy Cheeto staring at my camera, asking for my phone number in order to “Keep America great again”, worst than any of my ex’s pick up lines. This app did nothing but WASTE my time; just so an aging looking carrot who drowns in an expensive looking suit to cover up the fact that he does not know how to speak properly in public and will listen only to his constant yapping opinion rather than those of professionals can ask for your number?! Not worth it!","date":"2020-07-09T08:14:10Z","userName":"holy shot wow"}}]}
