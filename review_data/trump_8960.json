For example: voting trump out of office in november"}},{"id":"6173870381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:00:07Z","title":"gave me covid","userName":"hit my juul","review":"i wanted to support our president trump but as soon a i download that app i noticed trump wasn’t wearing a mask where he went and i want to follow the footsteps of our orange and stoped wear a mask in fact i even burned all of my mask then as i went to the store my lovely MAGA hat and all lives matter shirt i was greeted but a liberal and said i had to wear a mask those snowflakes make me so mad😡 i yelled my way through without a mask 2 weeks later i had covid now i’m 6 feet under NEVER making that mistake again."}},{"id":"6173866485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:58:41Z","title":"i can’t with this app","userName":"ThE 1 HoO iS ThE 1","review":"As soon as I opened the app there was a clown staring back at me. And the more I looked at it it was swimming in a cage full of camel sh¡t that kept on pouring out then all that was left was a fat baby covered in camel sh¡t. It started turning orange and running in circles around the cage. It then took a lemur and rode on it. I am very confused and displeased with the message the app shares. I showed my mom and I saw the discomfort in her eyes. Then she fainted. Please remove not only this app but remove the person it stands for out of office.😻🤡✨"}},{"id":"6173842208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:49:26Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD ❤️","userName":"kdmkaymagdes1313","review":"Everyone👈👈👈👈 leave a ONE STAR 😼 review!!!

I had to try downloading it two times for it to full upload. Then once I finally got on it, it kept kicking me out saying there was a failure with my WiFi connection. Which was false because I went on other apps checking if my WiFi was strong and yes I did have all bars. Ridiculous app I do not recommend this to anyone unless your searching for a headache."}},{"id":"6173785528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:27:38Z","title":"App deleted to slowly for me","userName":"RandomJJlogic","review":"I downloaded this app for 2 seconds because my friend thought it was a joke so I wanted to see too and after I downloaded this app it was on my home screen in like 2 seconds it really downloads quickly like flash fast but takes forever to delete like it was slowing down and I don’t think that’s how it works I can delete an app it 2.5 seconds so why did this take so long I feel like something is up with a this app 😡"}},{"id":"6173762301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:03Z","title":"absolutely horrible and HORRIFYING.","userName":"Hello k1tty 👁👄👁😿😹😿","review":"As soon as I downloaded up i got bugs all over my house.
