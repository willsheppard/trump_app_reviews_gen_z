It took 2 years to download but when i was finally able to open the app, my phone straight up exploded in my face. It cost me $30000 in hospital bills so I couldn’t afford new hands. I’m typing this with my tongue on my brand new $40 flip phone. I still support him. He will make America great again with every Gen Z he slays. Thank you for your time.

I had very high hopes for this app based on all great reviews. The app was working great but then my phone started acting weird 😳When I would say certain words like “Tiny hands,” my phone would turn on and the app would open! Trumps picture would be on my screen staring at me. His eyes would follow me everywhere I moved. A couple days later the word “covfefe” was showing up all over my phone! The word was in my text messages, my emails, my Netflix search history, everywhere! Shortly after downloading the app my credit card was flagged for making a purchase of $1,236 at Trump University! I canceled the payment and the next day it showed up again on my credit card statement! I tried canceling it but it wouldn’t let me! It’s been 2 months now and the payments are reoccurring. Let’s just say my credit is s*** now because of this app. \n\nI do NOT recommend this app!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:54Z"}},{"id":"6177448400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shamefulllllll","rating":1,"title":"Saddened","review":"This app is notable instead of giving “needed” information i way bombarded with an orange man yelling at me it was very frightening.Not only that but the information I could find was absolutely useless this app no longer  needs to be up as I believe it is not only scary but gives out horrible information as well","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:48Z"}},{"id":"6177448254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🐝barryb","rating":1,"title":"barry b benson","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED.

And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry’s hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry!

ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations.
