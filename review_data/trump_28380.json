But it won’t even let me stay on the app longer than 5 minutes without force shutting.

It's a bit of an instant turn off. I think it should be just his name or something. Plus you need to put your phone number in to access the app, and that feels inappropriate.","date":"2020-07-09T14:59:02Z"}},{"id":"6177046121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I almost died 😔","userName":"Pp Eater 😋","review":"I downloaded this app last night and was getting ready to go to bed when, out of the corner of my eye, i see a big orange man standing in the corner of my room with a brick 😦. i immediately deleted the app and he disappeared, you have been warned.","date":"2020-07-09T14:57:07Z"}},{"id":"6176964245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","userName":"Robery J.
