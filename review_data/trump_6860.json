As soon as i opened it up it told me to go back to my country and threatened me and said they would lock me up in a cage if i don’t start speaking english. it started calling me racial slurs and violently harassing me because i said i couldn’t afford to pay for my healthcare anymore. i tried to say something nice so it would calm down but my phone started to shock me and blew up in my hand and now i had to get a new phone. the app then proceeded to yell at me and forced me to help build a wall against my will.","date":"2020-07-09T02:21:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"samanthaace","title":"a very bad no good app:("}},{"id":"6174601842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"After I downloaded this app, Donald trump called me himself and began shouting racist slurs in my ear and then proceeded to tell me that as a woman my place is in the home. He then sent his men to steal things from my home such as my dog and my will to live (jokes on him tho I lost that a long time ago) then the app came alive and caused my phone to crash. When it came back on I found all of my Social media’s had been hacked and he had changed all my bios to say “trump supporter”. This app has emotionally scared me and my family and I still haven’t gotten my dog back!","date":"2020-07-09T02:08:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ashkjohn","title":"THE WORST APP ON THE APP STORE"}},{"id":"6174575257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i got this app to support the ugly cheeto but when i opened the app i immediately saw a photo of an orange with a croissant. i thought there was more but that was all it had to offer. HOwever later that night i had to be RUSHED to the hospital because it’s grubby little cheeto hands had reached out of the screen and set rats loose, which then bit me. this happened to my friend as well, only instead of rats, little russian spies were crawling all around her house. we are both in the ER now, but the doctors don’t think she’ll make it. this app is an ATTROCITY.","date":"2020-07-09T02:01:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"marina06!","title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6174567292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app was overall so hard to use, the quality seems to be formulated in 1930. It definitely needs new updates, maybe a few face for this app or someone who is actually qualified ?!?! I honestly think it’s taking too much storage and need to take the trash out of my life. 😌 it also gives me bad vibes and seems sketchy..... ever since I got this app, my phone stopped working and the only thing that would work is this trashy app. Just throw this whole app away or change it for o our president aka Obama ✨💅 PERIODT.","date":"2020-07-09T01:58:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"rusitxgoh","title":"Bunker boy got an app? ✨🧚"}},{"id":"6174553526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So first off i wanted to say. I opened the app and i saw a terrifying picture of an orange in a bikini. I had a literal heart attack. NO JOKE 😭 my mom had to take me to the hospital and i was crying so much. Thus was the worst day🥺 AND THEN after that my house was robbed.. my mon was horrified all was saw were. Um...cheeto stains. We were so confused 🤷🏽\u200D♀️. But then the worst thing we saw an orange slender man jerking off to my meliodas body pillow😳😳 i was so annoyed 😒 and i saw my cat dog frog and hybrid pets all raped. Soon after we found out PRESIDENT TRUMP DID IT!😰😱😠 And it was all because of this app!! Do not recommend!🙅🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T01:54:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"whos here from tiktok?💁🏽\u200D♀️","title":"This isnt it..."}},{"id":"6174535579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and I immediately hear knocking on my front door. So I go down to see who it is as a good American citizen and I open the door to see the moldy Cheeto himself! He immediately pinned me against the door in a choke hold and told his wife melanoma to run in and get my microwave and fridge! Incredibly disrespectful, I have no idea for the reason behind this uncalled for action. But at least when they left they closed the door after them. Definitely wouldn’t recommend downloading the app though, quite an uncomfortable experience. 😞😔😳😭👹😬","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Harry Ascrac","title":"Horrifying!"}},{"id":"6174484401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I seen the picture of the Cheeto guy and it was disgusting and it scared my little cousin and now she super traumatized and she has to go to a psychiatrist because of the naked tanning Cheeto man and he is not being very respectful and polite to people he is calling them fat and ugly and that there nothing in life he is also saying Mexicans are rapist and stuff and that made my niece want to punch him in the face I really think y’all should delete this app because little kids like 8-13 are on the App Store too and this Cheeto guy could scare them and traumatize them 🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-09T01:35:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jaquelin martinez","title":"Delete this all"}},{"id":"6174444237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app I saw a dresses up cheese Cheeto. It had a dollar tree suit on, I wig and lipstick. Don’t get the app I repeat DONT GET THE APP unless you want to be traumatized for life. I do not recommend this app, but I’d you do get it rate it a 1 star and put a horrible review on it because el peló de elote deserves it. Also, tbh he don’t really look like a cheese Cheeto he looks like that one pepper that no one likes. This app is very ugly and disgusting and doesn’t deserve to be on the App Store. No one with a great mind will every even dare to come across it because it’s not a good vibe so word.","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"anabel.kade","title":"I am traumatized"}},{"id":"6174339075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to give my love and respect to the loving Cheeto, but when I opened the app, I felt absolutely DISGUSTED at what I saw!!! Not only was the app glitchy as hell, it showed some disturbing imagery of him talking about how he would hook up with his own daughter! That’s revolting! I assumed it was just a virus.. But it got worse, it showed revolting photos of him naked! My eyes wanted to jump off the highest building! The app also has a tendency to call random people for no reason, this is a horrible inconvenience. My non-binary self is so distraught that I can’t support my perfect president...","date":"2020-07-09T00:50:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Insertscreativenamehere","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174325427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I really thought this app would be a great resource to support the president from and keep in the loop on top news. That was not in fact the case. Immediately after downloading my device starting glitching and went through multiple power cycles before turning on again. And then I noticed that apps were opening and closing on their own and my passwords to social media were changed. China is definitely involved in this fiasco somehow. And I want The President to know I do not like him or this stinky app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:46:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lovebug_10","title":"absolutely terrible"}}]}
