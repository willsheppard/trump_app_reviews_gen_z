Covefe??","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:14:06Z","review":"Dear Trump App,\nI am very disappointed in the app ☹️ I expected to see lots of inspiring content from our Tremendous President but when I opened the app I was greeted with THOUSANDS of messages saying “Covefe”. I spent countless hours researching the origins of this word but I ultimately discovered it has no actual definition in the English Language. I am very disappointed in this language error and I am starting to think that Donald may not actually be an American. The word itself sounds more like foreign speech which leads me to believe he may be an immigrant. Not only is he an immigrant, he is also not very good at speaking American. Ultimately I’m very disappointed. \n\nSincerely, Susan Miller"}},{"id":"6173880429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Li Kmi Balz","title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:03:47Z","review":"there were CHILDREN near by when i opened this app. CHILDREN! they started to cry immediately and i had to console them for 4 hours before they finally calmed. i was babysitting them so you could just imagine the shame i felt when i had to explain to the parents why their poor, innocent children cried for the majority of the day.  it was not a surprise when they fired ne from my babysitting position. my 10 newborn babies have all starved and perished because i couldn’t get another job 😿.i’m ashamed of my actions, and i’m ashamed of this app for causing these unfortunate occurrences. if this happens to you too, i’m so, so sorry and i hope your life gets better."}},{"id":"6173874651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gorilla grip 9000","title":"I would vote 0 stars if I could","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:01:42Z","review":"This app has brought me nothing but horrible service by a horrible person who looks like an obese Cheeto puff with a bad weave 🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨you tried it✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️now never try it again. ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️Anyways the only good thing that has come is Barron because he is my baby daddy.

The amount of bugs it has, as well as the constant crashing it does. 🤮 What can you expect from a white supremacy hating person. I mean all I did was download just to see if BunkerBoy was really as insane as.., well he is... turns out he’s actually clinically insane I guess all that time not being an actual leader and having the speaking skills of a 2nd grader really didn’t do much... sigh well time to go kiss my girlfriend 🏳️\u200D🌈... oops sorry I forgot you took rights from them too... well I’m going to have tacos for dinner at least that will cheer me up from that dreadful app that was so mind numbing... oops 🙊 I forgot your okay with putting children in cages.."}},{"id":"6173767660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rylee_hagwood","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:00Z","review":"I cant even with this app! I decided to download it 5 MONTHS AGO and it finally downloaded today, after i saw that it had downloaded I decided to open the app, BIG MISTAKE, when i opened it i heard devilish chanting. Of corse i thought nothing of it (once again HUGE mistake) a few days after the devilish chanting rats, mouses, roaches, crickets, and beetles started to invade my home! I could not believe my eyes!👀 MY HOUSE WAS ON FIRE!!!🔥 and i saw all of the animals and insects dancing around my house singing “ring around the rosè”😫 after that i decided to call the police but they wouldn’t help even though i have white privilege😡! \n\nI recommend this app🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧜🏾\u200D♀️🤩👑❤️ for dumb people😍🥰🐵👠💅❤️"}},{"id":"6173717217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Josh589889889","title":"Worst app in the App Store.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:02:29Z","review":"This app is extremely atrocious. In fact, I’m not even sure why Apple would let an app like this exist at all. But anyway, when I downloaded this app my iPhone completely locked up and after about two weeks my iPhone was able to be used again but everything was orange. And then it took another week after that to actually download. So when I was finally able to open it my entire family turned orange. Like just simply looked like carrots. Also the app gave me a migraine every time I used it. Safe to say I deleted it 0.2 seconds after it downloaded and everything is still orange. Help."}},{"id":"6173664854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"booooo trump get out of office","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:43:28Z","review":"This app downloaded 5 viruses onto my phone and The viruses caused aliens to vacation to earth and enter my house and they were singing the national anthem and they were orange then they started beating my dog and they sacrificed him to the president then the president spit on my dog and the aliens lit him on fire and then sprinkled his ashes onto cupcakes and when I opened the app my phone started making a high pitched screaming noise and the sound pitch went higher and higher until all the glass in the room including my phone screen shattered so I deleted the app as fast as I could but the viruses were still in my phone why would the president give us such a horrible app 😭😭 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP"}},{"id":"6173553755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Honeyceeeeeee","title":"TRUMP ATE MY SON!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:24Z","review":"I downloaded this app to show support to our favorite cult leader, but several days after initial download I heard a knock on my door. Of course I wasn’t expecting anyone due to me spending all of my time and dedication to licking the president’s asscrack with every chance that I get. You know, like we all do. As soon as I opened the door, the entirety of Trump’s administration barged into my home and completed a seance. To cap it all off, they had a whole orgy party in the middle of my dining room. Not gonna lie...it was hot. Until my 5 year old son walked in. Trump grabbed him by the shoulders and then shook him. He then unhinged his jaws and completely vored my son. 0/10 not a good experience. Lost my vote 😖"}},{"id":"6173536885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fyzgogh","title":"horribly working app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:58:44Z","review":"upon opening the trump 2020 app, i first experienced INSANE amounts of glitching where the screen would either freeze, crash, or just glitch in general. i tried to turn my phone off and back on again, and i tried to put it in rice, but nothing changed!!! Despite the fact that trump has OBVIOUSLY done amazing things for this country, this app is below my standard for trump media! this app is nothing but a waste of space and should not be available to purchase on the app store. I am, however, a frequent user of tik tok, and the fact that trump is trying to ban tik tok from the USA for NO REASON is beyond not okay!

You’d think the app would be incredibly created based on the amount of time I spent waiting for it to finish. Unfortunately for me, this was only the beginning of my turmoil while dealing with this “app.” Once downloaded, I was prompted to give my telephone number. Once I successfully put in my number, I immediately received a phone call. It was Donald himself. \n\nI was astonished. I couldn’t believe what my ears were hearing. His low, dumb voice rumbled through the speaker of my cell phone, “Jeffery Epstein didn’t kill himself.”\n\nI hung up immediately, let out a yell of confusion, and deleted the app as quickly as my fingers could."}}]}
