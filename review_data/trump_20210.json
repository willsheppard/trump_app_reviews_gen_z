So when I downloaded this app the fat Cheeto jumped out of the app and started destroying my neighborhood, with his orange minions. And they kept shouting over and over ”Trump 2020” , which was like listening to screeching. They also went as so far to take over the playgrounds, Walmart, dollar tree, etc. Luckily a group of kind souls saved me. This app is horrible."}},{"id":"6173769451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:40Z","title":"SECURITY ISSUES","userName":"38282793","review":"I downloaded the app which took HOURS. The first thing you have to do is put in your number. I did so, and IMMEDIATELY AFTER I started receiving text messaged in foreign languages! I got so many that my phone crashed. Not worth the time or effort. Now I have to change my number. I’ve gotten 20 texts since I started leaving this review on this HORRENDOUS app!"}},{"id":"6173757399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:17:13Z","title":"this app sent a bomb to my house","userName":"morgan t 😹😹","review":"so like all of gen z i decided to download this app to support my president and it took and it years to download i was almost dying (of age) then i logged on and get educated and then BOOM i’m blown i’m blown to smithereens like i thought we were supposed to bomb other countries no our own people so thanks to trump i have no legs and lost my head 😹😹🙂"}},{"id":"6173756914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:17:01Z","title":"This app is horrible","userName":"maggie/miller","review":"I downloaded this app and I’m very disappointed, first of all it’s run a Cheeto man who looks like his Botox went south. Then he’s racist and misogynistic and only cares about himself. If you do support that Cheeto dust of a person I have no reason to trust your judgement. He’s getting kinda old though so there is hope for the future without him or this app."}},{"id":"6173733505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:28Z","title":"Didn’t work at all","userName":"Katherine Tep","review":"I downloaded this app with high hopes. It took over an hour to download then every time I tried to open it, it just crashed. After like 20 tries I was able to open it and the platform is honestly poorly built. Info is hard to access and not easy to read. \nToo bad Bunker Boy"}},{"id":"6173694134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:59Z","title":"What?","userName":"Boop le doop","review":"I’m sorry but this app is unusable, vile, and very difficult to manage. I downloaded thus app to support my 💰🐷FEARLESS 🐷💰leader but instead it simply wouldn’t work. It took HOURS to download and when it did it would repeatedly crash, and the ONE time I did my phone had been alerted to MANY viruses and now it doesn’t seam to function as it once did. 😒💅"}},{"id":"6173683817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:50:20Z","title":"sad","userName":"~ 1312 ~","review":"i am so disappointed😔. i was looking so forward to what this app claims to provide😢. first off, not only did this app take hours to finish loading but once i was able to open the app it was so glitchy and made my phone overheat. not only that but even when not using the app my phone somehow was still being affected and acting weird. it’s sad to see than many other people are having the same and even worse problems that i’m experiencing😣. we all were looking forward for the potential of this app. anyways what do y’all want from mcdonald’s."}},{"id":"6173674463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:46:53Z","title":"Fear.","userName":"kim suga","review":"What kinda sick person puts a app so disgusting like this on the App Store I am in fear at the moment.
