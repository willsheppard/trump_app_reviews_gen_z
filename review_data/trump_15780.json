He wants to mess with our first amendment rights with the earn it act so people can’t say bad things about him on social media which effects both right and left wing people. I don’t support someone who would do this.","userName":"Slap the bird"}},{"id":"6172762762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app ever created","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:58Z","review":"I think this is the worst app EVER created because my dogs family’s sisters cousins house set on fire 🔥🔥when the Whole family downloaded it, does anyone else have that problem?

He makes inappropriate tweets many mocking colored people calling them “thugs” and a lot more horrible things. This man hid in a bunker like a scared little boy, he needs to be a man and not hide and cry. Trump is also extremely rude towards woman. He claims to respect woman but treats them extremely rude. This man hasn’t done much for our country, so what good is he. Let’s stop this and not vote trump 2020!!","userName":"Dr. Stevens🍊🤡"}},{"id":"6172629074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE Experience","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:12:04Z","review":"I’ve been getting calls and messages all day AND night from random tells marketers. I’ve never experienced this problem before until I gave them my information. All the information on here is useless and lacks knowledge, and for the most part dignity.

Disgusting person and terrible app.","userName":"Norah.Jones"}},{"id":"6172612992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:07:34Z","review":"This app took forever to actually open and kept crashing and messing up my phone which is new and was perfectly fine before I download it. Also this was the only one I recently downloaded and these glitches have been happening ever since so I am positive that it the problem cannot be anything but this app. I do not recommend. 👎🏻","userName":"Shooting star678"}},{"id":"6172598167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"literally died","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:03:28Z","review":"i downloaded this app to show my beautiful husband and kids what a great man this is. unfortunately once i downloaded 420 ninjas jumped out of my phone attacking me and everyone around me! i literally died ! my ghost is currently writing this review from the good place. turns out...all the gays and the gals and everything in between are chillin up here. because i DIED i don’t think this app should be of use. k byeeeee","userName":"i v a n k a"}},{"id":"6172576335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app never downloads","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:57:28Z","review":"So let’s start off by saying this app took me four weeks to download.
