NOT user friendly AT ALL, which is a shame since most trump supporters are older people. The aesthetic of the app was also hideously garish. It hurt my eyes and caused me a trip to the doctors office. Hated this app and everything about it. Do not get it unless you want traumatic eye injuries.","userName":"-donald","title":"Do not get the app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178080464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to truly see what was gonna happen then I started thinking why would I want a child predator as president. I started looking through the app and multiple things started happening it was glitching my camera turned red as if someone was staring at me I then deleted the app as soon as that happened. If you don’t want anyone to hack into your phone I would not download this .","userName":"Lainabuggg","title":"Scared 😰","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:10:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178071417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app for our great shrimp president. i wanted to keep up with all the amazing things he’s done!!! as soon as i downloaded this app my phone crashed and died immediately and so did everything else in my house! this is absolutely disgusting and i will no longer be for trump 2020 😾. this app needs to be shut down RIGHT NOW. i’m broke now and it’s all because of this app. you ruined my life trump 😷.","userName":"tiktok 😼","title":"so bad!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:07:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178051935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello! I downloaded the app to hopefully get some more information about everything. I downloaded it last night and I woke up to my phone all glitched. I tried restarting my phone it didn’t work. We had to take it to Apple to get it fixed. Unfortunately we couldn’t fix it. I had to get a new phone and lost EVERYTHING. This app gave my phone a horrible virus that cost me money. I expect more.","userName":"Hi!✌🏻","title":"Virus?","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:01:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178038418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Take a close look at the permissions you give this app. It steals your data, your personal info, takes up a huge amount of storage, and will just brick your phone. My iPhone 11 has been crashing nonstop and will just overheat constantly. I can’t even delete the app because my phone will crash when I do ANYTHING. the app may be free but it’s cost me $1,000 for my phone. WORST APP EVER","userName":"ACAB especially Paw Patrol","title":"Wish I never downloaded","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:56:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178019774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app kept kicking me out over and over again and it wasn’t my phone because it didn’t happen with any of my other apps. Also it doesn’t give quick updates on trumps plans for 2020. I am overall very disappointed in this app. I do not recommend. It is way easier to just look him up and his plans on safari are other forms of internet.","userName":"cosmo195","title":"Spam","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:50:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177997809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of seeing when Trumps next rally’s would be live on TV but they decided to sell my data to china😭💔 They are currently kidnapping my grandma and dog as we speak💔. I don’t know what to do, when i tried to fight them off they said “shut up magat”😭😭😭 even though they were wearing maga merch themselves💔. I am currently bleeding out on my hardwood floor I will not this president for allowing me to die like this😭","userName":"thotim","title":"So bad it’s scary","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:43:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177966384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app totally took over my phone and made it constantly shut down. On top of that, the notifications are loud, obnoxious, and constant. I leave for five minutes and come back to at least twelve notifications from this app. It’s also hard to navigate, finding any real information is hard. Would not recommend this app at all.","userName":"TheAwkwardArtist","title":"This app made me want to kashoot myself ._.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:33:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177910833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is absolutely terrible. it has a roach problem. apps aren’t supposed to have roaches, but every time i open up the app I see one..get pest control or something. the roaches sing weird little songs about how Obama was born in Kenya when I KNOW that’s not true. Cheetos are inadequate to campaign, they’ll get eaten by the wittle kids on tiktok that wuined the wittle twump wally.
