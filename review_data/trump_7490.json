I was very disappointed. When I opened the app, it was bland. Come on mister million dollar loan. Put some effort in! After I looked around I discovered that my phone had a virus that almost resulted in it having to go to the hospital. When I contacted app support, they said it was fake and called it the China virus. How rude. Also the smell was horrible. Not to mention the taste?!? Anyways it was a bad app and do not recommend it to anyone. Very NOT immaculate! Lastly: “Trump 2020🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨🧚🏻✨but on a grave”✌🏽😜","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-04T05:02:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145803473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"cheeto puff😍","userName":"trumpie pedo😘","review":"i opened the app and i saw a literal chip. he had hands, and was making a fist😰 about to PUNCH! me😢. was very scary, i’ve had nightmares ever since i’ve downloaded it😓. also starts paranormal activity🤔. i walked into the kitchen because i thought if i TRIED. cheeto puff it would leave me alone🥰. but it did NOT. the cheeto puff then PUNCHED ME like i was saying😖. then it touched my little sister in the most inappropriate places😨. then my boyfriend came over and the cheeto puff ??? threw tear gas at him for no reason! i think it’s because he’s a poc🤨. anyway do NOT recommend😚","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T21:37:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145499331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","userName":"dannydevitospus","review":"The first thing it did was ask to send me notifications. I clicked yes as I thought it would send me important information. However, it just spammed me with a bunch of hate mail. (I was disgusted to say the least)🐒✨💅🏻🙈🧞\u200D♀️ Then it asked for my number. I was flattered at first as I haven’t been hit on in a while.✨🧞\u200D♀️🙈💅🏻 But then i remembered I was a minor and Trump was just doing the normal🙈✨💅🏻❤️(hitting on minors/ sexualizing them) and i had to delete the app. I think it hacked me because i’m still getting notifications though:(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T19:40:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145429106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app POSSESSES YOU and your family😭😍","userName":"izabella ortiz","review":"After getting this app I was very excited to be informed about the Cheetos campaign but after using for a few hours I started noticing evil spirits in my household😨😱😱we immediately evacuated only to see my own family develop orange skin and start screening “FAKE NEWS!!” As you could probably tell this startled me to my core and immediately associated it with this EVIL APP so quickly I deleted it and everything went back to normal!
