However, shortly after opening the app the bright orange of MY presidents face filled the screen. The Cheeto-colored glow must have triggered something because I felt a wave of calm as the prejudiced ideas my fellow trump supporters and I uphold filled my head. I felt the urgent need to yell “trump 2020” in the face of everyone around me so I did. However, some people had reliable and valid arguments against our MAGA army and I became so angry that I burst into flames and my house burned down. So thanks to this app was unable to control myself and now I am homeless but I don’t want anyone to help me because homeless people are just lazy.","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:57Z","userName":"Cheetolover2020"}},{"id":"6172768615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD APP! WAIST OF TIME🤑","rating":1,"review":"I HATED THIS APP!!! I recently downloaded it to find a reason to support trump( like seeing if this was a way to connect with other people and see updates.) Instead of that I gave in MY NUMBER ‼️and I was messaged ALL DAY!!! He’s using the app to promote his merchandise👕🧢🇺🇸 by saying that “everything is on sale”💯, “ we have items reserved for you, friend”, “ last chance to get it!”and other things to make it seem like they care about you. Don’t get the app, it’s a waste of space ( and so is trump) . It all shows that they are money🤑hungry cold🥶 hearted people 😵. Don’t even bother to text the number that he has set up. Same thing.

My step father was in the shower at this time and now has temporary discolored skin. The doctor said that it would be pretty hard to get his original skin color back. My little brother was draining a water bottle and has second degree burns in his throat. My other brother was washing dishes and his hands have been paralyzed because of the potency of the spray tan liquid. My family will be suing the trump administration because they have brought pain into the people they have sworn to protect. You will not take away tik tok or another four years of The USA’s life.","date":"2020-07-08T15:20:17Z","userName":"chris brice"}},{"id":"6172651961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Stop it shouldn’t exist","rating":1,"review":"I came and downloaded the app because u know we love our racist rapist of a president, so I downloaded the app and then this weird guy started following me around everywhere I went and that went on for a couple of months, but then suddenly he would stop.

It also had false advertising to “make America great again”. So far, all that happened was america being worst then it was originally given to him, instead of better. What false advertising!!!!!!! Never buying and believing in this app again. The people of the app are also bullies to the minorities, and threaten to harm us because they carry “guns”. Saying all lives matter, when actuality yes all lives matter, but one is more important as of right now because of race issues. Please take this as a sign to delete the app. ✨Other apps matter too✨","date":"2020-07-08T14:09:14Z","userName":"App cool rate"}},{"id":"6177754122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app but I’ll still support my cult leader","rating":1,"review":"I got the app originally to blindly follow my cult leader/lord and savior because I’m an ignorant female who can’t think for herself. The app kept crashing while using it and I’m really bummed because I was so interested in what the president’s plans were to further limit my rights as a woman. I didn’t think anything of it and then my food network app started crashing too😡😡. How am I supposed to serve my husband without the food network app for my recipes????? I will continue to support the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic cheeto in office because I don’t know how to form my own thought processes.

Well I’m disappointed to say that that never happened. Moreover the app took THREE DAYS to download, slowing down everything else on my phone. As if that wasn’t already enough of an issue, when I opened the app I saw a scary picture of Donald Trump. In the process of my horrifying experience, my phone glitched. I tried to close the app but it would not close and the image was still present. I then restarted my phone and it was still there. I now have Trump in my app tab pointing at me and screaming. Please help.","date":"2020-07-09T15:29:47Z","userName":"Livvvy4507"}}]}
