I was fighting for food with a rat when I was bitten and I was rushed to the hospital and treated for rabies. But I didn’t have any money so I was thrown out and had to hitch hike a ride, I was riding with a trucker and he kidnapped me and took me back to his house where he forced me to watch rom cons. I died.","rating":1,"userName":"dead girl 1234","title":"Sad truth","date":"2020-07-08T16:19:27Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172927949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do t get me wrong I love Trump as a president but he’s taking down Tik Tok in USA?! I mean come on Tik Tok helped me and so many other people get through quarantine. And now he’s taking it down?! I’m sry but Tik Tok is just a social media.

It was also very difficult to navigate!! Would not recommend, it’s not even worth your time to download the app!! It took the app two hours to be fully downloaded. Then, it wouldn’t even load (has nothing to do with my WiFi). I had downloaded an app previous to this and it took five minutes tops. Poor quality!!","rating":1,"userName":"trumpsucksballs2020","title":"Not worth your time!!","date":"2020-07-08T16:10:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172828258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app just to try and understand more about Trump. But as soon as i opened the app, my phone started glitching and my phone shut it self off.

I did review the app and it crashed my phone and I had to wait a few hours to get back on the app. I had literally delete some apps including this one to make sure it works. Too many bugs and overall just a bad app. If you want to make an app at least make it a good one.","rating":1,"userName":"AnonymousisKing","title":"Terrible App","date":"2020-07-08T16:07:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172781885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The news is completely narrow minded, all supported him, he does some bad things and we should have a right to know just because he is our president does not make him the good guy the app has more bugs then I can count, this boy takes and takes and will be worse the Clinton, he is a racist, homophobe, and all around disgrace I’d rather live anywhere else than America, oh btw this is all for the vine 😘✌🏼","rating":1,"userName":"giannamarie2639","title":"Horrible app in general","date":"2020-07-08T15:55:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172777364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took a whole month to download and when I opened it, it was trumps nudes🤮 it had asked for my number so I put it in and my phone got hacked and now almost all my pictures and apps are gone.
