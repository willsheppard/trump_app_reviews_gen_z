It took a few weeks to download, and gave me major diarrhea issues once I realized it would take a while to download. I had an anxiety attack and did not enjoy that. Once I got into the app, there were so many bugs and many issues so I couldn’t actually use it. I’m deleting. Plus, my dog wanted to see it and once he did, he ran away from my phone because the app kept making this really weird noise that scared him.","userName":"celeste jewl eliza","date":"2020-07-08T17:16:37Z"}},{"id":"6173036391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"ewww","review":"this app is so bad. I downloaded it just to check out the latest and greatest scoop on Mr. President, and I was very disappointed. Turns out, he’s a horrible person! All I can say is, I miss President Barack Obama and hope that on November 3rd this guy will be outta here! Our country is in shambles and we have the worst dude “leading” it. Also the app is glitchy and it shows this very disturbing picture of an orange man when you first open it. Yuck! No thank you. :) And remember, Gen Z will never go down without a fight.","userName":"A Suprised Player","date":"2020-07-08T17:12:27Z"}},{"id":"6172999982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No❤️(joke)","review":"App had MANY glitches to the point where I couldn’t even see parts or my phone and when I went to support my orange god 🍊 I heard a knock at my door chanting “Vote orange🍊” “Vote orange🍊” “ Vote orange🍊” Over and over again. At this point I was like 👁👄👁 and didn’t know how to stop them so I opened the door and they ran inside took my phone and reserved a ticket for their newest pep rally. When they left I quickly canceled the reservation and deleted the app and everything was back to Normal 1/5","userName":"all names are taken scknsnd","date":"2020-07-08T17:01:17Z"}},{"id":"6172969476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Little bunker boy","review":"I have so many complaints and the first is that the app was horribly made. Everything about it is trash and I hope that it gets taken off the App Store so that nobody has to suffer and take the time to download this app like I had to. It was made for idiots by idiots. Periodt. Also, BLM! If you don’t support the movement, then we don’t want you in office. If you support Trump, then you’re racist, sexist, AND homophobic. Don’t download the app, it’s garbage.\n\n                                                                Love, gen Z❤️","userName":"Doctor me 45","date":"2020-07-08T16:51:57Z"}},{"id":"6172883848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"STALKERS!!","review":"After they take your personal information they bombard your phone! They won’t stop texting or calling me no matter how many times I reply with “STOP” they keep at it! Isn’t that illegal? I also believe they sold my information to communist China and possibly Russia as well, since I am now receiving messages in strange languages and formats. I am scared since I left my physical address, they’ll turn up at my house next. Besides, the app is very ugly and hard to understand.","userName":"AmiSaysUSux","date":"2020-07-08T16:25:18Z"}},{"id":"6172873831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do NOT download this app","review":"I downloaded this app for a reason to support Trump. I didn't find one. First of all, this app took HOURS to download and once it did download, it kept glitching and crashing on me. Then, the most TERRIFYING thing happened -Donald Trump knocked on my door! I was so scared that i went into cardiac arrest! I didn't even give them my address! They are tracking you so if want to stay alive fo not download this app. By the way this is my sisters story but she is dead now, due to this app. #settleforbiden ❤️","userName":"ateobdidbgdid","date":"2020-07-08T16:22:19Z"}},{"id":"6172849818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever made","review":"Honestly this is one of the worst apps ever I wanted to support my ohhhh so beloved orange blob but the all caused my phone to die right when opening and it took at least 2 days to download the app... when I finally was able to open it without my phone dying it started to play the nastiest music and my ears started bleeding which almost sent me to the ER and when I got up I slipped on all the blood fhat came out of my ears and u broke my arm🧚🏾🧚🏾🧚🏿🧚🏿🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾\u200D♂️ literally worst app ever made","userName":"natblida14273","date":"2020-07-08T16:15:01Z"}}]}
