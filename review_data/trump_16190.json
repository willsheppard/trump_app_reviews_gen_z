It froze my phone trying to download in the first place and then barely functions as is, taking forever to process information. Not impressed by this app in the slightest. The information is outdated and I am constantly sent spam texts and calls after providing my number. Do not get, it is not worth the trouble"}},{"id":"6176930187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"marchingbandflute","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨🧚\u200D♀️🥰💅✨","review":"I downloaded it and as soon as i opened it, it started trying to build a wall over all of my other apps including tiktok.

However, it broke my phone, erased all my messages, deleted all my pictures and apps, and stole $560 from my credit card account! My sister also downloaded it, and it apparently deleted all her contacts and stole ALL her information. Thanks to this, I will no longer be supporting trump in the 2020 election campaign. VOTE BERNIE!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6176909736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"skylerbales356","date":"2020-07-09T14:20:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS STUPID I AM RUNNING","review":"i hate this app as soon as i opened it i saw a Cheeto and i don’t like cheetos so i was very scared and started crying i saw it start to move and talk and now i am scared for life now i have to see my therapist again and she thinks i’m crazy and wants to send me to a mental hospital so now i’m on the run if your my therapist i’m sorry and if you don’t want this to happen to you i suggest you don’t download it."}},{"id":"6176884063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dakotalc","date":"2020-07-09T14:13:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Killed my phone","review":"I got this app to keep up with the rally’s in my area.

First of all it asked me for my phone number and wouldn’t give me an option to not get messages. Then once I finally agreed my phone started acting up constantly. One second it’s be 80% the next it’s be 2% I just don’t get it. This app has slowly ruined my phone just like trump to think country and I refuse to give it one more chance"}},{"id":"6176800192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏻🥰✌🏻✨","date":"2020-07-09T13:51:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"hate it. first, it look SOOOO long to download!! like come on non of my other apps do this, so it obviously just yours! ugh! once it finally downloaded the app didn’t even work properly!! it glitched like crazy, wouldn’t let me click any of the buttons, and was just absolutely terrible.

My phone would go crazy sometimes, at first I thought something was wrong with my phone... No no no it was this app. I think this app has a virus or something I would advice you to not get this app, but if you want your phone to stop working then by all means. Get yourself the Trump 2020 App."}}]}
