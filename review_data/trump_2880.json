So obviously I had to download this app and catch up on some fake news 🙈😌and propaganda. Yet, when I opened the app I saw noodles(noods)🍝 of some old crusty musty dusty and ofc crispy old man 🍊w/ a small weewee. So I began scrolling through the app and it started to suggest some tanning salons, Cheeto cheese puffs, and recipes for taco Tuesday night LYSOL margaritas🍹?!?! A few mins later I saw an orange 🍊 rolling through my streets and giving kids cooties?!?! Would never recommend this app again?!?! Not to mention they tracked me down trying to have me join the r*pist/pedo association👀😳— so I packed my shiii and ran to the Bermuda Triangle☢️ and I’m chilling with old Kanye rn.

We have made this platform on tik tok now your just going to take that.....

I’m lucky I didn’t seize! On top that, this app took 24 hours the download. I waited because I figured that this app must be revolutionary to take that long. It was revolutionary. Revolutionarily TERRIBLE!! The flashing I mentioned earlier lasted five minutes. After 30 seconds I noticed that it wasn’t just lights flashing, but nude photographs of the president, his children, and all his previous lovers. A few times I saw a picture of Jeff Epstein that read “miss you buddy” I will be deleting this app immediately. All I wanted to do was get the real news. Not all the wretched fake news about our lovely president! But it would seem that CNN is telling the truth. Terrible app!!🤮","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:41:39Z"}},{"id":"6172451309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Daddy MarCayla","title":"BAD JUJU","rating":1,"review":"So i am a witch😊and i decided to get this app you know because i wanted to see what my aunt was going crazy about🙄but right when i pressed the button one of the kids in my basement escaped😡 so i was mad but i didn’t think anything  it then the cops came to my house😱so i told them i was white and they left😚then i heard something upstairs and that’s where i keep my old lady’s and one of them died😢and i was kind of suspicious😒and then i started to use the app and then i stubbed my toe😭then i spilled all of my ingredients for one of my spells🥺i realized that it was the app🤦🏽\u200D♀️BAD JUJU don’t get it👀it doesn’t do anything anyway i just wanted to support “MY” President but the app was too bad for me🙃it is evil👿but a good app you could get is tik tok😁but thissss witchhhh out✊🏽✌🏽","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:22:52Z"}},{"id":"6177634588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lilydever","title":"Seriously","rating":1,"review":"I knew Trump sucked at technology but this is next level. There was no clear way to go from tab to tab in the app. Plus it kept on closing me out. There was also a constant pop up asking me to donate. If you app says it wants to keep me informed then that’s all it should want to do. Because of this app I have become completely liberal. I will be voting for Biden because a politician who can’t understand something that is part of everyday life can’t be elected. Also getting rid of TikTok is his way of trying to silence Gen Z and make sure they have no way to effectively communicate. That way he can stop them from embarrassing him and trying to stop him. Basically he’s trying to stop our right to free speech.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:54Z"}},{"id":"6177633734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BayBay72","title":"This app LITERALLY made my socks WET","rating":1,"review":"I’m writing this because I am truly disappointed and very confused. Shortly after downloading this app I started to feel a warm sensation in my feet. At first I thought that perhaps I found my way on top of a lit stove again without my knowledge (long story) but upon further inspection I found that I was not! The warm quickly turned cold and that’s when I realized that my socks were indeed SOAKED. Not damp like a paper towel used to clean your mail box but WET. REAL. REAL. SOPPING. WET. I’m at a loss for words. I supported our president. until my stiammmmalas check all I haded was the money from sellin clothe thanks daddy donald you big strong slimy neon tangerine lookin donkey fingernail freakin swamp possum pig pirate. Thanks for COMPLETELY soaking the only pair of socks I had 😓","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:38Z"}},{"id":"6177603822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"livvyjeanne(is not my lover)","title":"Can’t start the app!","rating":1,"review":"I was really hoping to have a lovely experience with this app so that I could be well informed and notified but I couldn’t even get going on the app because as soon as I opened it there was this horrible image. It was like this gross orange.. I can’t even describe it, this vaguely man-looking THING. I was so repulsed that I couldn’t even look at the screen for more than two seconds. I don’t know what kind of person would hack this app and put that horrible image in there, assaulting the eyes of so many innocent people. Truly disappointing. Even now, just typing this review is bringing back the trauma... the picture of that horrible orange, balding, revolting... MONSTER will truly haunt me to the end of my days. Do not buy.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:40:02Z"}}]}
