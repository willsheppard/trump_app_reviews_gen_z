I‚Äôm ceased to believe that this trash of an app has ever succeeded someone‚Äôs needs, this ThINg makes my eyes and braincells disintegrate I wish I could leave anything lower than a 1 Star. What ever this is doesn‚Äôt deserve to have any stars. Lemme spit some facts, he probably doesn‚Äôt know how his own app works. So how about we leave this app to paper so it is easier to trash, because you can crumble up paper, burn it, shred it, make it basically disappear like a magician, so let‚Äôs all agree this is a waste of time. It make trash disappointed. Like wow. My trash can just wanted to leave my room after I saw or even tapped on this app. If it can make trash run away, than I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm still writing. Thank you for making this app less useful than flashes motorcycle.
