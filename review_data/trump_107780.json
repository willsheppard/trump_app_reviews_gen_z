First it took forever to load. And then it was asking for my information. Like excuse me why do you need my bank statements and the time I go to sleep. Like this is ridiculous. I came for my great America and I get approached with these invasive questions. Like excuse me Sir why are you so rude. I expected an app at a higher calibre with martinis and a trip to Paris, but in exchange you want to know what tooth paste I brush me teeth with??? No thank you. I had to listen to punk rock right after, so that I could drown out my disappointment and disgust with this terrible app. No one in this country should ever fell this way and I can’t believe this app exists.
