Last time you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor. \n\nDaddy Pig: I did not get grumpy. There was a problem with the frying pan. \n\nPeppa Pig: Mummy, can we help make the pancakes, please? \n\nMummy Pig: Yes, you can help me make the batter. \n\nMummy Pig: First, I put some flour in the bowl. \n\nPeppa Pig and George: Oo-oo. \n\nMummy Pig: Now I add an egg. \n\nMummy Pig: Now the milk. \n\nMummy Pig: And I give it all a stir. \n\nPeppa Pig: Mummy, can I stir? \n\nMummy Pig: Yes, of course, Peppa. \n\nNarrator: Peppa loves stirring.\n\nNarrator: George wants to stir as well.\n\nPeppa Pig: No, George.

I think I know a way to get it down. Let’s go upstairs, children. This way. \n\nNarrator: What is Mummy Pig planning to do?\n\nMummy Pig: On the count of three we all have to start jumping up and down.
