So much spam all over the app, I couldn’t even use it properly. When it actually began working at all, it would crash and basically broke my phone, like it wouldn’t turn back on after the app crashed. I’m going to delete it immediately after writing this review. Absolutely terrible app, would not recommend.\nAlso, nice reviews guys, super helpful. 👏👏","userName":"Annastraea","title":"Awful, terrible, do not download"}},{"id":"6177217541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:53Z","review":"This app is just terrible. When I downloaded it, it took several weeks to load and when it did my phone blacked out and shut down. When I first opened the app when my phone began to work again I saw a picture of curious George the monkey doing a pole dance 😱.  I was terrified and traumatized. I decided to face my fears and open the app again later, but what I saw was even more disgusting. It was a video of a potato making out with a moldy French fry  that looked like it was constipated. I am very disappointed and I am deleting this app shortly","userName":"poopy38293","title":"Smells like doo do"}},{"id":"6177179236","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:34:01Z","review":"I got this app to support mr. cheeto, but it took a week to download 😾 when it finally downloaded, all the money off of my bank account was stolen 👁🕳👁 my iPhone backgrounds all turned into pictures of a grumpy Cheeto 😿 and all of my robux from my roblox account was stolen 😾✨😾✨ that wasn’t very cash money of him, so I texted him to his number, he said that he will lock me in his basement, with the rest of the children, like baron..milania.. etc.. I said ‘no, thank you’ then my phone screen turned black, and my phone went up in flames 😿😿😔😣","userName":"Cherry_Fizzz","title":"✨oh to see without my eyes🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176939942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:33Z","review":"Okay honestly I just wanted an app to get political information from but it’s one of the worst apps on this App Store. I’m so incredibly disappointed in apple for allowing this app to exist. I just wanted information to keep me politically updated but it just crashes 3 seconds after opening the app. It made my phone slow. My phone starting turning off randomly. It was awful. It stopped working all together and I had to get a new phone cause of it. Wanna know what app I won’t be downloading? THIS ONE. Worst app ever made me wanna move countries. DELETE IT","userName":"Flippin_sam","title":"Horrifying!!!"}},{"id":"6176938057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:03Z","review":"I decided to download this app and it took about 1 HOUR to fully download. Not only that, but after opening the app it kept crashing so I had to shut my phone down because I figured that was the problem. When I opened my phone EVERY app was gone. Even the ones you can’t delete. So obviously I’d be panicking. So I swipe to the left one my home page and what’s there? This. app. It completely wiped out everything. My storage was completely empty. I advise you to NOT download this virus of an app, because now I need a new phone.","userName":"Djjebrvbdhahhw","title":"Worst app.😡 DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6176894280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:38Z","review":"this app stole my food out of my house trust me you don’t want this app i’ve been going on 10 days without food and money because of this app i’ve become homeless because this app sucked all my money my house and even my car! i would not recommend getting this app before it will take your family members too it dragged my 12 year old sister out of bed and i heard her scream i looked down the hall and saw her big head and then she disappeared i still can’t find her to this day and then I saw him doing it","userName":"jajejdjdjwbdb","title":"do not download it"}},{"id":"6176852907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:05:46Z","review":"This app literally destroyed my phone! Wiped out all of the data after taking TWO WEEKS to download. When I finally got the app and signed in and shared with friends none of my points registered, and I was not able to redeem any awards. Come on now, I spent so much time waiting for this app and now it destroys my phone and does not give me the credit I deserve 🤬 Man this must be how Obama felt because Trump has tried to undo everything Obama put in place before leaving office! Give credit to where credit is due Cheeto. #byebyetrump","userName":"Dadddyyy Trumppppppp","title":"Orange Cheeto powder on my finger"}},{"id":"6176834622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:00:59Z","review":"Took me five tries to download it. When I finally got it, they required me to put in my phone number, which I did. They said it was invalid, and that they were arresting me for tax fraud?? Luckily they never did that, but my husband/brother jimmy sure was mad at me for having to diffuse that one. Don’t recommend this! Sends you alerts left and right, half of them for things I don’t need, like wholesale cauliflower. Very weird. They asked me my name, age, AND bra size which offended me very much! We will not be contributing to this establishment ever again.","userName":"Sandy 👁👅👁","title":"Most disgusting thing ever."}},{"id":"6176631261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:07:19Z","review":"I decided to download this app simply because I was curious about it, and I also wanted to see if it could help change my view of our president. It didn’t, in fact it was horrible and glitchy and a pretty slow app. My phone is never slow, so it’s the app itself. Pretty crappy for a millionaire’s app. Also it immediately asked for my phone number even though our president is married. I know President Trump is a lot of things, but a cheater? My expectations and views of our beloved President just keep getting lower and lower.","userName":"Kal'El Morgan","title":"Horrible App"}},{"id":"6176342094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:47:53Z","review":"This app ruined my life. I first downloaded it because it was #1 for news in the AppStore. First things first it took 20 YEARS TO DOWNLOAD! It also gave false information and charged 1 million dollars on my credit card...that I don’t have. It is solely responsible for the death of my hampster and the raccoon that likes to chill in the hammock in my backyard. This app is the reason Aidan Gallagher sang the song she on live and created the song Fourth of July. Thanks but no thanks for haunting my dreams and giving me insomnia. I would rate this zero starts if I could...no support from me👵🏻","userName":"aidangallagherhater22","title":"A catastrophe🥺👇🏻"}}]}
