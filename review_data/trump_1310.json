I won’t use this app until you make him smaller or blur his face. There should have been a NSFL warning ⚠️ before downloading this app. Additionally, it should be easier to see what day 📅 the rallies are since I accidentally RSVPed to the one in New Hampshire before realizing it was my pet giraffes🦒 birthday 🎂. Anyways, I highly recommend NOT ❌ downloading this app. Also, I filled my shopping cart 🛒 with $100,000 💵 worth of merchandise before remembering I had to read 📖 about online shopping cart abandonment. It would really be a shame if more people did this. I really wanted to support our racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. president 🍊, but in the future, he needs to make sure his app doesn’t have a disgusting ogre front and center when you open it.","title":"Actual review","userName":"rainbow203","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:54:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176891982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So you know me just wanted to see what our lovely president has been up to. I go to the App Store to download this app. The night of downloading the app i got a bad cough almost so bad I thought I was about to fall over dead. When I woke up the next morning my dog was dead and my cat was eating it’s insides. After that i was heartbroken over the loss of my dog so on the way to work i stopped at Starbucks to get me something to drink. I got a coffee then it SPILLED on me giving me 2nd degree burns. When I went to the hospital they told me they were going to leave big scares across my leg and stomach. So of course this made me even more upset because who wants to have a bunch of scars? When I left the hospital I got a call from my work saying that i had lost my job. I was so shocked I recked my car and totaled it. Overall this is horrible and has cause me SO MUCH PAIN. I’m literally so over it! 😡🖕🏽","title":"APP IS CAUSING ME BAD LUCK 😡🖕🏽🙀","userName":"kale potts","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176587001","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is HORRIBLE it took several days to download and once it did it gave my phone lots of viruses. PLEASE unless you wanna junk phone DO NOT download this app. It needs to be taken down so that it can’t ruin anyone else’s phone. Oh and also to top all that my personal information was leaked through the app. Personal information that included my address, Name, age, family, phone number and more. I didn’t think one app could do such bad things but this one sure did. I am disgusted at how unprofessional and unsafe this app is. Trump is trying to make America “great again” but with this app still available he has no chance. So unless you are trying to destroy your phone and leak all your personal information, I highly suggest that you do not download this app. I would like it to get removed from the App Store completely so others don’t have to suffer the same way","title":"Terrible app","userName":"Jordan_12345","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176110780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting nothing really. I was pretty hyped about it actually like real talk. But once it downloaded it shut off my phone COMPLETELY then my screen went black. I was just staring at my screen like 👁👄👁.. once it loaded back up my wallpaper and lock screen had been changed to pictures of 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊!!! It was horrendous!!! I immediately went to my camera roll to remove the horrible wallpaper n lock screen only to find my camera roll with over 1M photos of thee president Donald Trumpet. I then scrolled through all my apps and saw that he had hacked all my socials! Changed my users and everything!! Donald had even set up a tinder profile from my phone. Who knew our president was such a freak😏amirite? So I decided that I was just going to get a new phone since my old one had been completely covered wit photos of Donald trumpet.","title":"This app killed my pet goose.","userName":"chelsiieee","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:37:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175920596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was curious about this app and wanted to see if i could find some answers as to why some people actually support trump, and well - the app literally took 7 HOURS to download! at this point i’m already bothered but i still want to give this app a chance so i open it and it starts telling me things like to vote for trump, he’s only an ALLEGED child rapist so it doesn’t count, and the things he said are NOT racist because they were taken out of context! i couldn’t believe what i was being told by this app! i guess it was too much for my phone, because next thing i knew my phone just caught fire and blew up!!

I was terribly mistaken the app took 15 days to download! Once downloaded I opened it.... worst decision of my life. Once opened all that I could see was racist, misogynistic, and idiotic propaganda. Not only that but this app erased all my photos, videos, and social media’s because trump thought my other apps were bullying him smh 🙄 After this the crybaby continued spamming my phone with nasty propaganda that had no educational bias at all. Not only that I was sent terrible lewd photographs of our president (eenie teenie weenie btw 🤢) I am just in shock that Apple would allow such a terrible, disgusting, horrifying app to exist. I would 100% give a zero star if I could! 😡🔪 I feel so sorry for America that has to deal with a racist and rapist as their leader! Hope that gets fixed soon, your time is up trump! ☺️🤚🏻😚🔥🤢","title":"Terrible, disgusting, worst app ever!","userName":"Foreigner FOREIGNER 😡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:57:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174965886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!! my pet goldfish died miners after i first opened the app.. i thought hey this is just a coincidence right? WRONG. after that i went out for my daily run and broke both of my legs miraculously. after i was rushed to the hospital the doctor told me i had ebola. and i said ebowla what? soup? and guess what! i had a horrible disease and no soup! after i went home i found out i was being evicted for supposedly not paying my bills which is 100% wrong! after that i told my boyfriend and he dumped me! the nerve of that guy! afterwards i decided to order some pizza since that always cheered me up before and guess what? there were cockroaches on my pizza! i sadly went to my garage can and threw away the pizza and i saw a cute little squill. i tried to pet it and he attacked me! i was rushed to the hospital once again and turns out i have rabies and it’s fatal! 😔😔 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!","title":"the bunker boys app 😡","userName":"the true victim","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:56:47Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174486482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as a 69 year old woman 👵 i was very intrigued to see cheeto man have an app where i can learn more about his definitely not racist, homophobic, and definitely not horrible plot to destroy the country!🇺🇸 so i open the app to see barron trump recording in his bunker, talking about how cheeto man is a bad person and how barron needs help to escape out of the cult (whoops sorry meant to say trump🤷\u200D♀️) family😱 then as soon as the video ended, my three pet fish 🐠 levitated out of their tank and were able to breath💨! they proceeded to tell me how donald trump is a white supremacist post stop. if you vote for him again your a white sumpremacist post stop. and at that exact moment i realized my therapist was right. ALL OF MY TRAUMA HAD BEEN CAUSED BY THE CHEETO MAN!!!!😡😡😡 so i deeply encourage all of the trump supporters to take a minute out of their racist homophobic misogynistic lives and have a little empathy for people who don’t benefit from white privilege!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎✨🧚\u200D♀️💅🥰👍🤠🤮","title":"no❤️","userName":"dumptrump2020✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:36:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174410064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see how Trump plans on getting re-elected... but then it happened... Cheeto kicker down my front door and in a deafening and horrifying voice said, “👁👄👁 IN ORDER TO JOIN THE TRUMP TEAM, YOU MUST LET ME SNIFF YOUR TOILET SEAT” I was about to reach my house phone to quickly dial 911, but then the milkman appeared and blocked me. “👁👃👁 I AM THE MILKMAN, MY MILK IS DELICIOUS.” he said. I was absolutely terrified. I quickly tried to delete the app, but Cheeto smacked it out of my hands and held in between his buttcheeks. At that point I knew I was screwed. It wasn’t until my dog came in that he attacked Cheeto and the Milkman, as he was trained to do. Cheeto dropped the phone and, even though it didn’t smell right, I still managed to delete the app. Cheeto and the Milkman disappeared as if they had never appeared in the first place. This is a warning ⚠️ to all people that consider this app. 1 out of 10^3003 stars. Would not download again.","title":"Thanks a lot, Chump...","userName":"DatWheelBoi","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:13:10Z","rating":1}}]}
