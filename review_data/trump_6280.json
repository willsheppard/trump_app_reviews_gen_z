I downloaded it hoping for updates about Trump’s campaign and instead got complete SPYWARE. They are now tracking my every move, search, message, and phone call. I searched a recipe and some guy in the Trump Administration started talking to me through my speaker to suggest additional ingredients than what was listed. TOTAL invasion of privacy! I will say- great app to download if you’re trying to catch your man cheating- as it will start playing “What’s Your Fantasy” by Ludacris whenever he grabs her by the p****y. \n\nOverall, I wish I could do 0 stars.","title":"SPYWARE- BEWARE","userName":"loveablemel","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174717328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is literally so messed up. First it won’t even fully open half the time. All the words are in gibberish and there’s no point in downloading it. After a few minutes of having it, it started making my phone glitch out and I’m scared. The second I downloaded it a bunch of birds started FOLLOWING ME!! There are all watching me like little robotic spies. Don’t download it! Stay safe! Black lives matter and wear your dang mask!! Everywhere I go these birds are following me and watching me and I’m sure they will attack soon.","title":"I wish I could give it 0 stars","userName":"Hey gurl987654321","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174716947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Once upon a time there was a lovely \n                         princess.

Unfortunately, I have had many problems with it already. Whenever I try to open the app, it crashes about 95% of the time. When I actually can get the app to open, it is incredibly slow. So slow to the point it takes about 5 minutes to open. The same thing happens if I want to go to different links on the app; it’s super slow. This app is not worth your time, I promise. I think I might just have to vote for Biden now.","title":"Don’t Get This App!","userName":"afmatthys","date":"2020-07-09T02:32:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174665300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was busting my moms sisters cousins house 👯\u200D♀️ and then i saw this app 🤩 i decided i would get it, 😤 then the next thing you know i have to feed my cousins friends dogs moms elephant 😭😣 then obviously i’m MAD, 😡😡😡 then i see charli damelio out of nowhere 😳😳🙀 then i say hi to her 👋 THEN SHE KICKS ME 👿👿 so obv i kick her back, BUT THEN SHE TAKES ME TO COURT 👩\u200D⚖️🧑\u200D⚖️👨\u200D⚖️ now i have to put an elephant in the freezer 🥶 AND i have to walk the dog in the volcano 🌋  then she sends lil huddy on me, so i slap him silly 👋🔪 then my moms dads cousins brothers sisters cousin decides to light my house on FIRE 🔥😤 then i had to go to the hospital.

I wish I could rate it lower that 1 Star, because if I could I absolutely would do it.  Don’t let your kids, parents, grandparents, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, or cousins download this app because let me tell you, it is a bunch of brainwashing ignorant bs.  It pains me to see this app being used by friends.  I would rate this app lower than cancer, because cancer at least has the decency to put people out of their misery, while the trump administration just leaves us to suffer.  Shame on anybody who downloaded this","title":"Absolutely terrible","userName":"Reviewbyn","date":"2020-07-09T02:14:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174603698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Honestly I thought I could support him BUT UGH THIS APP IS SO BAD. Ever since I bought it, it’s DESTROYED my poor phone, it was a hand me down from my dad and it’s been working for so long but ever since I downloaded it my phone has been glitching and I think it’s trying to throw up or sum. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. Please get rid of this app Cheeto man 😭😭😭 do not get this app unless ur willing to sacrifice ur eyes for it, its ugly and disgraceful to the world.

As soon as I opened the app it sent a signal to my door bell and forced to to ring so many times and my dog was so mad that he actually exploded!! This app made my dog explode! And to top it off, it is (I mean was) his birthday today. A few hours later I got a knock on my front door and it was my neighbor who somehow was holding my dog.. who was alive and not blown up into a million little pieces.. Turns out I’m schizophrenic. Anyways, because of the emotional stress this app has caused me I MUST preform my civil duty and rate this horrible app 1 Star. It’s probably because it’s trumps app..","title":"Lib-tart","userName":"Jena123569372739493","date":"2020-07-09T01:59:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174539347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It said some dumb stuff like “Make America great again” but like .....when was it ever great this app gives me the same feeling as my deadbeat dad......disappointment & regret...... \nThen the app harassed me with a pictures of some kind of orange lizard with a toupee on it’s really weird then and woman that clearly looks like she being held hostage on top of that the orange toupee wearing lizard that this app is for has a warrant out for its arrest or something someone needs to call the authorities ASAP because this is very ghetto this app and the person gets two thumbs down and a mad face from me 👎🏿👎🏿😡","title":"MY EYES MY EYES 🚫👄🚫","userName":"Gen Z Warrior 🧚🏿✨","date":"2020-07-09T01:50:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
