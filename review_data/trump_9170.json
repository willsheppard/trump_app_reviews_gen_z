I downloaded the app and my apps and pictures completely got wiped out from my phone. I don’t know what this is I think it has something to do with China or Russia. It needs to fixed or completely erased.. sad I’ll never get my pictures back.😔anyways hope the best Trump 2020 😏😝🧚🏻❤️","userName":"trumpsfavoritehispanic","rating":1}},{"id":"6176114590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:39:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ruined my life🙈","review":"i downloaded this app and it immediately asked for my phone number which i found a bit strange that trump is asking me (a minor) for my phone number given his history with minors. it hacked all of my information and now my phone is beginning to glitch out thanks to this cursed app. i now don’t feel safe with my device and my information is now in hands of individuals that i don’t know. please pleASE PLEASE do NOT get this app worst app ever🧚🏼\u200D♀️💟✨","userName":"revierrr","rating":1}},{"id":"6176087508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:30:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App!! 😤","review":"It took hours for it to download and once it was downloaded It crashed multiple times for it to finally work. Then i entered my phone number and got several calls from random hotlines telling me to Vote for Trump and take away rights from people in the LQBTQ community, women, and African American People. At this point i had to delete it. 0/10 garbage!!! You would think that the PRESIDENT would make a decent app but i guess he can’t even do that right 😭😭 🍊🍊","userName":"donovan12608","rating":1}},{"id":"6175961972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:49:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD TERRIBLE","review":"this app is so bad i turned notifications off and it still proceeded to SPAM my phone cause omg it to lag and getting in the way of using it normally. i got 1 (sometimes more) notification PER SECOND.  this app is absolutely horrible. it hacked my camera roll as well . i opened my phone and had multiple photos of trump and his wife in my camera roll. once i deleted the app they disappeared, almost like trump hacked into and tried to bug my phone.","userName":"Fydehijorgugur","rating":1}},{"id":"6175921789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:36:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is obliviously awful","review":"It took at total of 69 days to finally start working I’ve also noticed in the app there is no diversity as this app was most likely targeted at WHITE “entitled” racist, homophobic, pedophiles. And this very much concerns😨 me as a parent of 3 fur-babies I don’t want my kids around apps like these as they are starting to get into technology and it truly sickens🤢 me. I would like to speak to the manager of who made this app and whoever thought it was a “good” idea to put it on the App Store!!!!😤😤😤","userName":"S Karen K","rating":1}},{"id":"6175776949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:48:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE🤮🤮🤮","review":"This app leaked my location!!! I was in my home watching tv and this fat orange man banged open my door left Cheeto dust everywhere he smelt disgusting I almost went into cardiac arrest from his stench.

He is not okay he is crazyyyyy he also grabbed a baby that lived down the street and curb stomped its head he also has a little Cheeto and he wishes he had BDE I am so baffled with this horrible app he also tried to shove a tarantula down my throat sicko!!!!","userName":"whjoof","rating":1}},{"id":"6175736564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:34:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"It took weeks to download the app and the fact that I have an advance phone I was expecting much more. On the app it kept asking for information and I was skeptical about it. I trusted the app because it was designed by the president  but it was a MISTAKE! I started to receive scam calls and messages about my personal data and I got scared and worried about my info getting linked. THIS APP IS TO SCAN PEOPLE AND THEIR INFORMATION. I also got COVID-19 because of the app, anyways get rid of the app 🧚.","userName":"🧚❤️💰","rating":1}},{"id":"6175719944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:28:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Omg leave 0 stars","review":"I downloaded this app to support my beautiful president who is definitely not racist or a rapist or homophobic and definitely was not the cause of my half Hispanic a half Asian family getting separated, anywayssss I downloaded it and when I opened it my phone crashed and then pictures\nOf trump appeared on all my electronics and my microwave started singing the national anthem so I deleted the app. Oh I also bought a ticket to the trump rally but I had to fold my dishes and vacuum my roof sorry lol 💕💕✨✨","userName":"tiktok2020✨✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6175681807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:15:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Not","review":"So I got the app and immediately it asked for my number. Don’t you think its a little soon Orange Man😢 we need to get to know eachother better... Anyways I ended up deleting it and blocking Donny’s number. Also after that I went to sleep and woke up to 15 Caveman at my door pleading with me to vote Trump 2020🇺🇸. I tried to shut the door on them but they snatched me up out of my house and the Orange Man was in the back of the van. 🤢😔 Worst day 🤮of my life. Thank goodness I escaped the Trumpets grasp.😭\n\nSincerely\nBella😸💓🥰😹😐","userName":"bellab4","rating":1}},{"id":"6175674156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:13:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Wouldn’t let me delete it, messed up my phone","review":"Absolutely ridiculous.

Since then my phone has been really glitchy and it was completely fine before this. On top of all of this I get SPAMMED with news that I simply don’t want.
