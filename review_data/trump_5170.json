Little did I know this app supports horrifying behavior such as racism, white supremacy, homophobia, sexism and xenophobia, not to mention r*ping and ped0philia. Absolutely DISGUSTING and REVOLTING. I am shocked that this app is even allowed on the App Store, and I think it should be removed ASAP. this app is DANGEROUS and promotes hatred. I’m disappointed but not surprised","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"bobble3","rating":1}},{"id":"6175609542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:49:57Z","review":"The second i downloaded this app my phone shut off for a whole month, once it finally turned back on my phone was rearranged and all my contacts and pictures were missing. I kept getting calls from the Trump administration telling me if i didn’t vote for him i’d be sentenced life in prison, IM 14!!!! I decided to delete the app and everything went back to normal, my pictures restored, my contacts restored, the calls stopped, and my phone was the same it was before. I don’t recommend this app at all, it has a tendency to yell racial slurs at you when ever you aren’t on it.","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"@Kaitlynn_Jordan_123","rating":1}},{"id":"6175588135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:42:07Z","review":"The fitness gram pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal beepboop . A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","title":"The fitness gram pacer test","isEdited":false,"userName":"sharlyn 😙✌🏼","rating":1}},{"id":"6175336383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:04:53Z","review":"OKAY IM FIRED UP.

I clicked ok ✨of course✨ and then a video of the annoying orange starts playing for a run time of 48 hours! I couldn’t exit the app at ALL no matter how many times I pressed the home button. I tried turning off my phone and it wouldn’t turn off. So my phone was stuck playing the annoying 🍊 and I had to leave it on the entire. time. Do not recommend at all and now I can’t eat nor LOOK at another orange ever again without experiencing the trauma.","title":"I loathe the annoying orange","isEdited":false,"userName":"yodaleheehoooo","rating":1}},{"id":"6175128197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:48:24Z","review":"This app singlehandedly put some of the worst events of my life into motion. Once I downloaded it I immediately felt a weird feeling. Well this feeling was actually real because I had explosive diarrhea then I slipped in it and cracked my head open. Upon arriving at the hospital they told me I suffered extreme injuries and would need extensive surgery. When I was laying in my hospital bed a psychopath stormed in the room and stabbed me seven times in the stomach. This evidently killed me. I am now inhabiting a random body in order to spread the message to never download this app or face the life altering, emotional, horrific consequences that will await you.","title":"Utterly Trumpitized","isEdited":false,"userName":"irrnrbj192395","rating":1}},{"id":"6175107246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:32Z","review":"My 14 year old son Jack downloaded this app a few months back and he started noticing it gave him a weird virus. As he started getting really into the Trump 2020 campaign, and using the app he would mention that his phone would heat up a lot while on the app and eventually on May 3rd, his phone EXPLODED in his hands resulting and shrapnel flew into his eyes. He is now legally blind in one eye and has lost his arm. My son is now a never trumper, and has nightmares even seeing a trump sign because it reminds him of this app. But i still believe in the one day true president of the world donald trump. Long may he reign, lord bless his soul.","title":"Shocked","isEdited":false,"userName":"Janice5627","rating":1}},{"id":"6175093552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:37:05Z","review":"First of all it glitches out every time I try to use it, saying you can only use English and if you try to change it tells you “you’re in America speak english” and threatens deportation when I was literally born here. After those horrible messages, I didn’t even bother trying to open the app ever again. Horrible app, just as bad as the president himself. Wish I could give it zero stars. Better yet, I wish this app was permanently removed from the app store because this kind of bottom feeder level shouldn’t even exist in the first place.","title":"Doesn’t even deserve 1 star","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cubieschild","rating":1}},{"id":"6174981489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:01:44Z","review":"i downloaded this💟 app to see my favorite oompa loompa but🤎 when i got it i opened ❤️it to see my moms😛 cousins boyfriends are uncles🍌 dogs chinchillas babysitters fathers😺 sister .
