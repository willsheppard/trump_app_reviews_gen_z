I took that as it was resisting me so instead of giving it another go, i took it upon myself to terminate the app. Some of you may think that i’m not giving it a fair chance because some apps get a little buggy or confused when you first open them up but I didn’t like the way this one looked anyway so it didn’t matter to me.","title":"if i could rate it no stars i would","date":"2020-07-09T07:31:10Z","userName":"all apps matter!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175425547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"the app was taking so long to download i was getting confused. and once it finally downloaded EVERYTHING ON MY PHONE CHANGED. my background became this ugly fat cheeto and i was so confused because that is NOT MY PRESIDENT. i was so worried and it wouldnt let me change it. the app itself is very confusing my old white cis straight veteran man eyes couldnt figure out how to work it :(. eventually i had to get my wife to help me. and she could barely use it too, NOT A GOOD APP. awful customer service!!!! should be removed from the app store.","title":"RUINED ME!!","date":"2020-07-09T06:39:29Z","userName":"Gossip girl fan girl","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175397451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"If I could give this app 0 stars, I definitely would. I have never felt so demeaned and attacked. I never thought Trump was a horrible person until I read horror stories of him and downloading this app confirmed this. I never thought we would have a president who would have such little care for the citizens he is looking over. He does not deserve this presidency, nor does he deserve this app. ABSOLUTELY disgraceful. Do NOT download this app and if you do, delete it right away.","title":"Worst Possible App, Horrendous.","date":"2020-07-09T06:28:30Z","userName":"Amazing, Fantastic, Marvelous","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175266772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Before I downloaded this app, my phone was working perfectly, now I have to keep my phone charged just to use my phone, I keep getting logged out of various apps, and there is no useful information at all. The app keeps giving me false information about some ugly old cheeto head. I hope the person who made the app regrets it cuz honestly not worth it. Btw the designs are so basic and ugly that my friends can create a better design than that trash.","title":"Disgusting 🤮","date":"2020-07-09T05:38:03Z","userName":"Nanis👸","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175262889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"yes i have this app except no i dont 💋\nevery time i opened this app it called me very specific RACIAL SLURS!!!!!!! and sometimes even displayed derogatory messages directly targeting MY MOTHER!!!!! i am trying to support our 🇺🇸✨PRESIDENT✨🇺🇸 but this emotional abuse hit me so hard that it caused me to stroke out and hit my head on a table 😿. im now permanently brain damaged and am typing out this review with my toes since my arms are now paralyzed FOREVER from hitting my head on the table 😾.

Don’t be surprised if i disappear (if i do it was them). i would give it 0 stars😌","title":"✨no✨","date":"2020-07-09T05:22:01Z","userName":"Kivkdtuggbnkkgfds","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175121220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app glitches and crashes like no other. When I opened it for the first time my phone started screaming and burning up so I dropped it and it caused a nuclear explosion the only things that exist at this point are cockroaches I’m writing this review from the Void ™ and all I want is to go to Wendy’s and get a Crunchwrap supreme but I’m forced to float around aimlessly and Cheeto looking aliens are vaguely threatening me and I’d rather stay here forever than go talk to an orange looking thing so please heed my advice and do not download","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE !!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:46:09Z","userName":"bdisnwjkshf","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175036744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app overall is hard to navigate and has a very bad user interface. The wording of things is very questionable, and seems to alienate any person that is not the presedent. Phrases like “view my events” and the promotion of twitter accounts under name “TrumpWarRoom” makes it a very uninviting place for any normal American citizen to traverse. One last thing, it encourages you to share the app with other people who support Trump, not America. Once again feeding into the alienation of multiple American citizens.","title":"Difficult","date":"2020-07-09T04:19:18Z","userName":"Kyapman","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175032256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Before I downloaded the app my Phone was fine, and worked PERFECTLY! All of a sudden once I downloaded it, My Phone was Glitchy! My Phone battery waste in 20mins. I hate this app it’s not useful, ITS TRASH. Please delete this, I honestly don’t recommend this app! I wouldn’t want this to happen to anybody else. Did I mention it also keeps on deleting my Data and apps, It stole my identity too. It can also track your location. I hate this app! Please take it down. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n        Baybe.","title":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!","date":"2020-07-09T04:17:53Z","userName":"Baybe Marie.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174864928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Literally do not download this garbage. When I used the face recognition to download the app, it asked me for my passport and birth certificate and then it denied me access to the app because I am brown and it told me to go back to my country.\n\nI later was able to get through to it after making a makeshift MAGA hat out of Carl's Jr. Coupons  and mod podge. \n\nI was not impressed by the app because as soon as I opened it, it turned my pride flag into a confederate flag and turned my Cher poster into a giant Mitch mconnel poster. Please help me I'm scared","title":"Trump more like CHUMP","date":"2020-07-09T03:26:25Z","userName":"TheMannywillnotbetelevized","isEdited":false}}]}
