I downloaded it to be able to have one place where all the information on his campaign would be, and usually apps are the best for that, and this was a huge let down. The second I downloaded to app I couldn’t click on it without causing my phone to freeze and be stuck there until I had to restart it. Then when it would let me get onto the app it would randomly just close out. Ever since downloading it my entire phone has shown signs of poor connection. Do not download this app!!!","userName":"amyntp","date":"2020-07-09T17:45:52Z","title":"Bug problems causes my phone to crash","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177605450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded the app about a week ago to support my one true ✨god✨ and it took A WEEK to download and when it finally downloaded it and i opened it up to see HORRID pictures🙈. THE PRESIDENTS NUDES POPPED UP ON MY SCREEN AS HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN. im absolutely traumatized to see such a tiny peanut on my screen and THAT WASNT ALL OF IT!!! a video popped up on my screen and dont even get me started on how long it took me to bleach my eyes after seeing that😡😡😡😡 this app is a joke, i cant support this devil anymore. also people have been showing up to my house and i think they are looking for me, that didnt start until i got this app so idk maybe they just want to get tea or something😻😻🙈🙊","userName":"trumps a ra_ist (c or p)🙊🙈","date":"2020-07-09T17:40:33Z","title":"IM TRAUMATIZED FROM THIS APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177563262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is awful!!! It is so slow and glitchy and I was not able to get to any Trump Merch. It wouldn’t process any donations and there were these glitter sparkle Cheeto puffs everywhere. Also pence kept popping up and telling me to go to a conversion camp with him because he was so far in the closet that he is now a homophobe which was really hard for him. He wasn’t doing to well though, he kept trying to make out with the other guys there and then he would yell at them saying they forced him into it. He is pretty good at giving 💨💨💨 hehehe. But Trump was just crying like a baby and I was very confused. Would not recommend.","userName":"Little braveclaw","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:00Z","title":"Terrible terrible terrible🍤🍤","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177557248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was told by our great, and fearless, Presidential Cheeto, that once I downloaded the app, that  I would be fully updated on everything that trump does for his 2020 campaign. Once I saw the app, however, I was let down. It is completely disorganized, cluttered, the fonts are way too difficult to read, not user-friendly. AND to top it all off, not everything Trump does for his campaign is on there! Furthermore, when I downloaded the app, Mitch McConnell showed up at my door and decided to take away all my birth control and now I’m on my period! The worst app, especially would not recommend for anyone who is not a white, elite male","userName":"miandraaa","date":"2020-07-09T17:25:07Z","title":"Worst app(resident) ever!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177441621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was so excited to have an app to express my undying love to our fat ugly racist sexist 🍊 ｏ ｒ ａ ｎ ｇ ｅ 🍊 but i guess not. this app didn’t even let me talk to the president and i didn’t even recieve my promised 🇺🇸 maga flag, i was super excited for it because i really need a new doormat. to think that our wonderful clown☺️ could create such a 🤬horrific app is beyond me. the way he thank his supporters for reserving tickets to his rally to save them from the rona🦠is so sad. i was fully ready to give that little ｏ ｒ ａ ｎ ｇ ｅ the best review out of everyone here. until i recieve my doormat and am able to get in direct contact with the ✨ɹ o ʇ ɐ ʇ ɔ ı p✨ i will not be happy about the app.","userName":"ᑭᕼᖇOG ᑕᕼEEKᔕ🐸🍑","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:45Z","title":"UNBELIEVABLY DESPICABLE APP🤬🤬","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177417791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Every time I would open this app my phone would freeze on itself and I couldn’t lock my phone or try to leave the app. It would take me about five minutes in total for my phone to be normal and for me to close the app and come open it after a periodic time. Even without going on the app for days, my phone would begin to freeze, would open random apps by itself, and would not recognize my finger whenever I would type. The content is not the best, the app is very messy, and very difficult to navigate. I would not recommend.","userName":"Zoesgonzales","date":"2020-07-09T16:42:33Z","title":"Horrible layout, horrible color scheme, horrible bugs","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177392584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app had nothing but Oranges 🍊 on it the oranges started to chant making my oranges in my kitchen started to rot . Then we I tried to leave the app it wouldn’t let me leave more oranges stared to appear. Then cockroaches started to enter my house because of my rotten oranges. I started the power on and off my phone I finally got out the app but the cockroach’s didn’t leave. When I went to delete the app an man with an orange face appeared on my screen saying trump or nothing. Then I took my phone to an Exorcist we had to burn my phone then my phone stared growing back but thankfully the app was deleted and I got my phone back. 😤😤🍊","userName":"barron trump son of 🍊","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:22Z","title":"Don’t download this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177383585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I genuinely wanted to keep up on current topics the president is talking about. I do or came to find out that this is nothing short of gestapo like brainwashing spam propaganda. Not a single original thought behind anything on this app, it’s set up like a toddler would. Quite frankly, my 6 year old step-daughter could create a more organized app & more intelligent original thoughts. I wonder if this is what Nazi Germany was like on the way to brainwashing its citizens before the slaughtering began? 🤔🧐 anyways 0/10 wouldn’t recommend unless you want to be bothered every 5 min & have your phone crashing.","userName":"MissMariaC23","date":"2020-07-09T16:32:41Z","title":"Least terrific app in the history of apps","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177361819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to see our almighty Oranges plans for COVID 19, and as soon as I downloaded it my phone overheated and broke. I had to get another phone, and when asked the developers to either give me an explanation or pay for my second phone, but instead of explaining the called me racial slurs like the n-word, rag head, and terrorist. I informed them that those word didn’t effect me cause I’m white, after I told them I white I was treated with respect, and the app stoped breaking my phone. I think that just a little racist, and some of the developers are white supremacist, but only like 79% of the developers are.","userName":"Make Amerikka Great.","date":"2020-07-09T16:26:12Z","title":"This app broke my phone.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177327665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Hellloooo, it’s me. Donald J. Trump, your “WONDERFOL” president. These young people, who all love me, they all love me soooo much, just like everybody else. The whole world loves me. Now young Americans are always downloaeing these apps for the phone on the internet. Internet is good. Love it. Hate twitter though. I saw this one, called Trump 2020. DISGRACEFUL!!! I opened the app to see the worst sight, our President. This president is the WORST president ever. Many people say this, many people........... I’ve heard that he’s a bad man and a bad president. SAD! Anyway make sure to vote for me, Donald J. Trump because so I can keep making America great, unlike our current president whose slogan should be, “keep on ruining America” Trump 2020  🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷","userName":"Donald J.
