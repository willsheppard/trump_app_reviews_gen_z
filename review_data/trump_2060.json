I was getting super scared so I went and looked in the mirror. I have turned into an orange. I am going to need serious medical assistants but it gets worse. I was on my phone (not on the app) when I got a notification. It said that Covid-19, Global warming and ppl in the LGBT community were all fake. And I thought “mhm that’s weird bc they’re has been scientific evidence that all of those things are in fact real!” So me being me had to do 8,000 sit-ups after I read that. After doing those sit-ups, I broke my back. So in conclusion, Mr. Orange’s app has given me permanent damages to my body. Never get this app!😚🤪🤩🥳🧐🤓😜😖🥺🤬😨🤗🤐🤤😷👾💀😺😓🤭😬😝😇😂😁😃"}},{"id":"6177189790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Erisluvy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-09T15:36:58Z","review":"I was so excited to download the app, and support our little ✨president ✨ but then almost as soon as I downloaded the app I was hit with multiple ads and viruses. The first ad was for midget porn!!! I cannot believe our president would do this to me. I’ve supported him through everything and this is how he repays his supporters? Also, not to mention after deleting and redownloading in hopes of the app redeeming itself. Seconds after the install my lights started flickering and a shadow attacked me!!! I know exactly who it was, I could recognize our Presidents body if it was miles away. Donald Trump count your days!!!! I know what you did to me and you will see your day in court. I pray that Apple does the right thing and takes this horrendous cursed app down so that nobody suffers the same fate as me!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177125302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpyousuck","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE✌🏻😹🙄","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:57Z","review":"i was just sitting down thinking of the old buddy trump, i then decided to download his app to see what he was up to. right when i turned on the app i fart!!! now i'm a women and we don't do anything of that nature so i assumes it obviously had something to do with the app🙄🙄 i then continued to stay on the app, this is where i regret everything😪 my dog comes up to me hits me in the face ride his skateboard to my granny's house, plot twist MY GRANNYS DEAD😳 so i'm wondering where my dogs going so i hop in my Tesla that elon musk hand gifted to me😅 I drive straight to my deceased granny's house to find my dog, MY DOGS GONE, IM PANICKING, IM GOING CRAZY AT THIS POINT.... i walk a few blocks get smacked in the eye by this cocaine fairy who said TRUMP SENT THEM..

DISGUSTING. however i do hope the cheeto version is an actual app because come on, that would be HILARIOUS. the layout of the app was terrible and honestly discriminatory. this app is so toxic, i can’t believe it even has the AUDACITY to exist. i would strongly recommend deleting from your phones immediately or else china WILL get your information. I mean we all know trump has done some shady things with other leaders, he’s probably profiting off of our information being exposed. i think he’s just salty over how much we have exposed him over his term, but come on take a joke buddy!"}},{"id":"6176800216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"S4UP3T","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!😔😩👎","date":"2020-07-09T13:51:52Z","review":"i wish i could give this app 0 stars, but unfortunately i am unable to. when i first downloaded the app, it took 6.9 billion years to download, which i simply did not have time for! then, it asked for my phone number, which is completely and utterly inappropriate considering the fact that trump is in a committed relationship! i just think it’s quite disgusting that he wants my phone number, i’m a minor!! i knew that it wasn’t smart to have an app from a disgusting man (trump) so i made the incredibly smart decision to simply delete it. however, i did not want other people to feel this uncomfy from this horrible app, so that is why i am writing this review. so if anyone from the trump administration sees this, i hope you know that gen z is coming for you, orange bunker boy😘✨💕🧚💫🤑"}},{"id":"6176654570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anananonymous","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT BUY!!","date":"2020-07-09T13:13:29Z","review":"I recently decided to start questioning my political views, I was raised in a democratic household, so I wanted to see what it would be like to live a day as a trump supporter. I downloaded this app, and sent a friendly “hello! :)” to the big guy in the house and instantly got a reply back\n\nSurely enough, we talked for quite a bit, and then things got really uncomfortable. He started asking me questions that I never even provided info about, like “am I excited to start college soon” or “how long have my boyfriend and I been together” even “am I happy with my boyfriend” \nI was getting confused because I never told him any information about me, but he somehow knew.\n\nAfter I answered those questions, he started flirting with me! Saying he could help pay for my education because I’m such a “pretty and nice young lady” and that i should leave my boyfriend to be with a real man like him. When I started rejecting him, he got desperate and said this\n\n“I bet I have something that could change your mind 😉”\n\nAfter no response from me, he sent me a picture of his member and told me it was that way because of me. And let me just say, if it’s that small with me, I feel bad for Melania."}},{"id":"6176570486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bad highlights","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T12:50:55Z","review":"I’ve given this app one star because it took TWO WHOLE WEEKS to download. I wish I could get it zero stars. Ever since I’ve got it weird things have been happening. My phone will randomly open the app and my phone now has millions of viruses. My phone doesn’t even turn on sometimes. This started a fight with my husband and now we don’t even sleep in the same bed😣 Sometimes at night I sneak back into bed, but he wakes up and sends me out. I think he wants to divorce now all because of THIS APP!!!!! My whole life has been ruined due to this app! I highly request you don’t get it!! Please save yourself from this app it will ruin your whole life too. I only got it to try and have a change of heart about the President. But sadly, because of this app I will never vote for Trump EVERRRR!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176485519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TrinidyMelody","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting.","date":"2020-07-09T12:27:36Z","review":"This is the worst app I have EVER even such as attempted to download. Took an entire week to download and then started off automatically by throwing some racist slurs into the mix. I, for one, was horrified. Because of this incident, I went to my kitchen and poured bleach directly into my eyes. Luckily, my eyes are fine but I suffered severe damage. I had to go throw 6 surgeries within 3 days in order to fix my eyesight and that still hasn’t done too much. I have another 4 scheduled in the next week or so. In the midst of all this, it caused such trauma to my middle child that she ended up taking her life. :( Now both my youngest and oldest are trying their best to make it through this hard time. And me, especially. This app deserves 0 stars and how I WISH I was able to rate it such. Such a disgrace. Trump should be ashamed."}},{"id":"6176401377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"❤️✨🙃","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T12:04:29Z","review":"If I could rate this zero stars, I absolutely would. The app took forever to download and then on top of it all it was super glitchy. Like the stupid thing would just open and then close. Or if it actually opened it would literally never work. My intentions for the download were to find a non-racist, non-homophobic, hates ICE, wants police brutality to end, and much more for a wonderful president. Sadly, I could not find the that. I could only find a Cheeto who is just one of the many biggest jokes our country has had. THIS IS NOT EVEN IT THOUGH. When I downloaded it the stupid app it started asking for personal information. WHAT FOR??!! So you can get my information easier. I think this is the worse app on your page and you should really consider deleting for the safety of phone users.

Then a swarm of trump-supporting bees came into my house and stung me 74 times, 74 years is how old trump is. Lastly donald trump came into my room again and forced me to smell his toes, I threw up on him. I came up with a plan to get trump to stop torturing me, I was going to go to the White House, save Barron and Melania. And I was going to puke on donald trumps pillows and write “you will not ban Tik tok” on the walk using my dogs feces. I only got halfway through and trump kidnapped me, I’m still in the whitehouse and trump is about to force me to lick his feet, please help!!"}}]}
