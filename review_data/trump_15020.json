After I downloaded it (which took 10 days) it installed 347 viruses onto my phone!!! I had so pop-ups in safari that my phone eventually glitched out and i saw the terrible black screen. I took my phone to the apple store and they said it was unfixable and a $700 phone turned into a $10 phone only to be RECYCLED. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6178725576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"userName":"Evelynmiz","date":"2020-07-10T00:12:32Z","review":"This app took three days to download. I really just wanted to stay updated on trump since I just turned 18 and I’m gonna vote this election. Once I started using the app, I realized it was so disorganized and horrible and ugly and it actually broke my phone. I can’t call my mom anymore to tell her I love her bc if this app. This app is destroying families. Please get rid of it so that it doesn’t ruin any more relationships.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178704538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it’s like a virus and a hacker had a baby and shitted all over my phone","isEdited":false,"userName":"Macalaca singsong","date":"2020-07-10T00:04:25Z","review":"This app is the most disgusting app I’ve ever downloaded, it took FOREVER to even process the request to download, and EVEN LONGER to get it onto my phone. My phone immediately crashed the second I opened the app, and took hours to let me be able to open it back up. Worst app I’ve ever had, DEFINITELY don’t recommend.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178699943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Crashed my phone","isEdited":false,"userName":"nickcckckv","date":"2020-07-10T00:02:39Z","review":"This app glitched my phone and it has been crashing every five minutes now. How am I supposed to watch Fox News and see all the twitter posts that my wonderful president it spouting every time a thought occasionally graces his head? It also took up so much space I had to delete all my photos! And then it crashed! All those memories gone forever!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6178555084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨disgustang✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"i eated soap","date":"2020-07-09T23:06:04Z","review":"It took 6 days to download, glitched the hell out of my phone, started beeping, hacked my email, texted me threats, killed my cat and paralyzed me from the waist down. Ever since The incident happened I’ve been having visions of Donald trump licking my elbows and copping my left foot off😰😰😰.The only thing that has been keeping me sane is watching 365 dni. If I could rate it 0 stars I would. I will be calling corporate soon","rating":1}},{"id":"6178475501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"fbejgbskeknt","date":"2020-07-09T22:34:25Z","review":"i downloaded this app because i thought it would make my phone great again. i was very disappointed. it built a fence between my neighbor’s and my house and told my neighbor to pay for it. it deported all of the pets out of my house because they weren’t born there. it assaulted all my female friends and lied about it. it also all my spray tan went missing after i downloaded this app. one day i found a trail of cheeto dust leading to a bunker. i looked into the bunker and found a fat oompa loompa. i didn’t investigate the bunker but i heard someone tweeting down there. it smelled like racism, homophobia, transphobia, islamophobia, xenophobia, and misogyny. long story short, don’t download this app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178446279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!!
