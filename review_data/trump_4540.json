But I don’t know how because I kept my phone 6ft away from\nThe app and kept it in its cover because I’m not an idiot but it kept saying “omg phone cases e a hoax ur phone isn’t gonna break” then it sent a notification that made me phone buzz so hard it fell to the floor and shattered into a million bits and guess what?!

I figured this was probably just a coincidence, but after reading everyone else’s reviews I’ve come to the conclusion that this app is cursed. Donald Trump has bewitched it to cause inconveniences to anyone who gets it and now I have to buy a new house :((( even now I’m sitting at the end of my driveway right on the gravel (so as not to get burned by the flames Donald has set to my house) to type this review because it’s something that I believe everyone deserves to know.

Upon opening this app, I saw a cheeto with a speech bubble stating “say make america garbage again 4 times while waving a flashlight back and forth really fast, stomping on the ground, eating cubed cheese, and wear a sombrero in a goofy fashion” and Trump would be president again. Little did I know that this ATTRACTED A SEA BEAR, trump betrayed me, forgetting to tell me I had to stand in a symmetrical circle and that the only safe snack was SLICED CHEESE!! A CHEETO should know that, cheese, seriously???

This is a puffed Cheeto but is supported by puffed and regular white and orange Cheetos who also spread hatred to those who are actually good, kind, hardworking PEOPLE. These Cheetos are ignorant and view themselves as the best of society when in fact they are the problem(and have been for centuries). I don’t understand why there would be an app dedicated to this disgusting Cheeto when he is clearly an example of everything that is wrong with the US. This is the absolute worst and most offensive app on the App Store and should be DELETED.","userName":"the truth teller #10000","title":"Worst app ever invented in the history of the App Store","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:36:35Z"}}]}
