I could feel Donald’s racism through the phone (and melania and Barron’s sadness) and it made me extremely depressed and anxious. I am disgusted by the Apple store for continuing to have this app even listed. It is a public health HAZARD. 10/10 would NOT recommend.","title":"Disgusting app","userName":"MusicUnplugged","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:02:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175153888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is a disgrace to the Country.
