But parts of the app that were promised, much like the 🍊’s campaign, were not given when downloaded. Furthermore, please note that the downloading process took months (similar to the 🍊’s response to covid-19). I could go on about how terrible the app was for the time I had it, just as I could, and I mean I really could, go on about how terrible the 🍊’s presidency was and still is. However, I will not because everyone already knows how terrible the 🍊 is, not just as a president but as a person. So, in conclusion, I do not believe anyone should download this app if they seek a good future.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173337358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I went into a year long coma 😐","userName":"Gleek9724","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:47Z","review":"I wanted to download this app to see when all the trump rally’s were and once I saw that Cheeto head i went to a year long coma.😲 I really wanted to look at this app but the coma prevented me from looking at the app. I made sure that my mom brought me a ticket for trumps rally so that my coma self would be able to go. But then in my coma I remembered I had to vacuum my celling while still in the coma on Sunday. 😪😪 I feel so bad for my mom because she has to go alone now. I wish I could still go but my coma self is writing this review and will not be able to go. Anyways, make sure that you don’t be like me and download this app because the Cheeto head will give you nightmares. Please lord help me out of this coma so then i can delete this app.✨✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173206581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it got me fired","userName":"wielrigifieiwod","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:50Z","review":"i wouldn’t even feed this app to my cat. it’s so bad it completely ruined my phone. i had to buy a whole new phone because it wouldn’t let me delete it and it was messing with all of my other apps and settings and everything. it wouldn’t even let me restart the phone so i had to get a new one. i’m here typing this review to warn everyone; DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. it’s like the app has a mind of its own and it started texting all of my contacts “vote trump 2020” and my boss got the text and then proceeded to FIRE me because he thought i supported trump😔never in my LIFE will i ever. i didn’t even try to get my job back because if i had a boss that would even THINK *I* could be a trump supporter, i don’t want it. worst app in the entire app store!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173131782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"In a Mental institution","userName":"Ex-Trumper","date":"2020-07-08T17:42:53Z","review":"I downloaded this app because, I was a die hard Trump fan. I got on the app and was truly shocked , the app tried to make me join the cult 😭. I just liked donald because I thought he was a great guy. You know all for equality and also anti-racist because he has black friends. But the point is, i went on the app and was hypnotized, i was asked to spend over 3,000 dollars of merch and I did 🥺. He made me waste 3,000 dollars. After that, I became depressed, I continued on the app because I was stupid but whatever. The more I participated in this app the more I became insane. So, I started to go to trump rallies and participated in very stupid trump activities. I was told that I was insane and admitted myself into a mental institution. Im sick of this app. I hope it Gets deleted.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172968325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BROKE MY PHONE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Cgcwaler","date":"2020-07-08T16:51:36Z","review":"Wanted to learn about our current administration but was SHOCKED when the app crashed my whole phone and broke it completely. It will not turn on. I have taken it in to be fixed and the kind man at the Mac counter was so sad to tell me that he legitimately had no ideas how to fix it. Years of pictures and memories of my children growing up have been lost. I’m absolutely heartbroken. My brother who does tech work as a job did some investigation to find the true cause of the crash, just to be sure, and sure enough it was my own governments app. He said it had to do with some sketchy coding on the app also got with some intense data mining. I want $800 for the cost of my phone but NOTHING can account for the memories this has lost.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172887610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wish I could give it even less","userName":"MannyflagBiden2020","date":"2020-07-08T16:26:26Z","review":"This app is just so bad. The fonts are horrendous and why did they use the red, white, and blue flag? Our flag is yellow and black for Manny. This app should be fixed and changed to the flag that the people want. They also used the wrong politician because it should have been Biden because we have to settle, the president that we NEED is Bernie. When I got this app my cat escaped and ran away. There was an obscene amount of fruit flies in my house. This app causes terrible misfortune to helpless people who just want a good president that is not this racist, sexist man. Honestly tho, 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏿you go gurl😘🥰AND DO NOT COMEBACK🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏿❤️I used this app and a rabid squirrel named petunia bit me and sent me into a shock. I was in a coma for 3 months and was told I would survive.
