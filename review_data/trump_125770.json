Then they wanted my phone number, FOR WHAT???!!!?!!?!?! So they can SPY on me? Find out who I make calls to (my mommy so shut the f*** up). The marketing team did so poorly with this app. Their logo likes like the bootleg Titans Tower (TT>TTG.) The first face I see is a lightly dusted Cheetos, with hair that looks so fake it reminds me of middle school aged girls’ friendships. It was horrific, I’ll have nightmares for weeks.

And when I tried to change my wallpaper or anything it just shut back off for another 30 days.Also it says it’s free but it actually deducts $4000 from your credit card.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T02:27:13Z","title":"TOOK TO LONG TO DOWNLOAD","rating":1}},{"id":"6179086383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bella🥰😜","review":"it sucks🥰😹","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T02:26:58Z","title":"yeah❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6179085516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"69420( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","review":"I tried downloading this app yesterday @4:20 on the 69th day after I was born and it LITERALLY DOWNLOADED LIKE WHO DOES THAT anyway this app is really bad and I won’t recommend it AT ALL","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T02:26:39Z","title":"Listen I think you’ll hate it","rating":1}}]}
