No way Jose. I swear I could smell the stench of white privilege and ignorance make its way throughout my house. The almost toxic vapors were becoming too much for me to bear and I sprinted outside for the first time in 10 years. This app is not only a threat to people mentally but it could also kill you. Do not download it is terrible and a waste of money and time and storage.

Thumbs down to thatüëé. After being severely disappointed I continue on to find that the app is glitchy and a pure waste of space on my homepage. \n\nDOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! I would NOT be suprised if a virus is attached to this sorry excuse of an app! Apsolute garbage. \n\nThe only thing I appreciated was it took the time to congratulate Mike Pence for coming out during pride month. Other then that though this app is terrible.

The app then crashed presumably because the universe itself wanted to reject such a awful mobile device virus. But when the app finally opened I was overwhelmed in a tsunami of hateful propaganda which any human being should be offended by and even more horrible I had to look at some ugly, overweight orange with a birds nest on its head and absurdly small hands. Overall the app was pointless and should never  of been allowed into office I mean on the App Store.","userName":"Chris the Pole vaulter","title":"I have never had such a horrible app in my life","rating":1}},{"id":"6174259357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:23:43Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I simply do not understand what came into the mind of the US President when deciding to ignore all scientific evidence on the corona virus and causing there to be now 3 million cases. Imagine caring more about money and your rich white fat friends more than innocent lives! Oh wait I can‚Äôt, because I‚Äôm not a horrible human being; which Trump truly, truly cannot say. All I have to say is that if the country is ever led by someone as idiotic as him again, then I hope that aliens joins forces with the other countries and destroy the US (this is a satirical joke).

If you go to report the problem, it will ask for a donation to fix it and to build the wall (why bother, Mexico closed the border already and I thought that Mexico was going to pay for the wall not us) Then if I try to force close the app, it will start screaming the most obscene racist and sexist things Cheeto Puff has ever said and the only way I got it to stop was by restarting my phone and deleting the app. Don‚Äôt bother with this crap.
