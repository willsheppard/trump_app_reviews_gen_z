My name is Karen big booty Judy head. I came on this app to activate my gag reflex and I swear it did more than that. My phone started glitching and this orange clown popped up ! Then my roof fell on me and demons came at me saying “Trump 2020 !” I ran into my fridge to poop and the orange that made my phone glitch was right behind me saying “Make America great again!” So I knocked it out and hid the body in my dishwasher. I went to get my bike to go to my dogs crib when I saw that the cow across the street stole my car! So I went to pee on the body of the orange in the dishwasher when it happened...it wasn’t there ! My neighbors stole it and were selling it on Facebook! So ate a kitten and went outside to drown! This app will steal the kids in your keys ! If I could give it 0 stars out of 10... I 200% WOULD. Chile anyways....Dora 2020 😝I hope you choke on a pogo stick! Love ya!"}},{"id":"6174894329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:57Z","userName":"annna oopppppl","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","review":"So you know I’m over here supporting my favorite president🧚🏻and now he decides to pop up on my YouTube advertisements saying I should write him a note for his birthday?!?

But no, what I got was a hunk of junk. It glitches and messes with the WiFi connection in my house. like I was watching a black lives matter YouTube video on my tv and it glitched out!! And oh I forgot to say that while using the app there is an Easter egg and that’s the only good part about this app. If you click at the top right corner on the opening screen, text will pop up telling you that trump is not good!! Like what!! I thought we all knew that!! Ik conclusion DO NOT GET THIS APP. It is for the dumb people of America. It’s so bad that It should be removed!!"}},{"id":"6174892460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:24Z","userName":"tunub bdqvui","isEdited":false,"title":"BOLLIES","review":"now this is the story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and i’d like to take a minute just sit right there i’ll tell you  how i became the prince of a town called bell air \n\nin west philadelphia born and raised on the playground where id spend most of my days chilling out maxing out relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good starting causing trouble in my neighborhood i got in one little fight and my mom got scared she said ‘ you’re moving with your auntie and uncle in bel air. \n\nI begged and pleaded with her day after day\nBut she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way\nShe gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket\nI put my Walkman on and said \"I might as well kick it\"\nFirst class, yo, this is bad drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?\nHmm, this might be all right\nBut wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that\nIs this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?\nI don't think so, I'll see when I get there\nI hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air"}},{"id":"6174892170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:20Z","userName":"Mrs.E & Mrs.E","isEdited":false,"title":"Help the unicorns!","review":"This app will harm your unicorns! \nToday I woke up next to my unicorn and she told me about this app and how it was amazing and she said so much nice things about it. Soooo,  me being me I listen and download it but when I realize what it was doing🤬 I knew I needed to call the manager and corporate to tell them how a terrible job they’re doing! 🤬but I decided to not be a Karen and not be mean to people because is not their fault that they have to work for someone like the Mr.President who wash their brain with such and uneducated information. However my pet unicorn she was being brain wash by the app it was so sad she was saying terrible things, being kinda.. RaC1sT🤮 and like she disappeared out of nowhere.
