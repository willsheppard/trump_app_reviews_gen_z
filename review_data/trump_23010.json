It gave me a horrific virus on my phone and caused it to completely shut down. There was nothing the repair shop could do so I had to spend a ton of money I never planned on. How is this guy supposed to be a good president if his administration can’t even put out a valid app? I feel like his whole campaign is a joke."}},{"id":"6172594300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:02:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m not anyone special","userName":"cecila_miller8608","review":"This app is the worst this caused my grandmother to die the first time she believe in Trump she tripped and fell and broke her Elbow know about a month later she had fallen down and had to call an ambulance but she finally got this app and she died she died of a heart attack and is soon as She downloaded it she had a heart attack and I sat  there speechless and cried!"}},{"id":"6172586086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:00:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","userName":"かつき ばくご","review":"I would give this app a one star if I could!!!

This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous."}},{"id":"6172441912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:20:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever","userName":"EmDaHeatmizer","review":"Glitched, made me download a bunch of viruses onto my phone, pretty sure it gave me diarrhea for three days straight because of the straight crap coming from it. Would rather slice my big toe off with a blunt plastic fork than try and download again. Please consider removing it from the App Store for the safety of all people, it’s a danger to humanity and society."}}]}
