It took two months to finally download! And once downloaded it kept sending me notifications every minute of the day! There was a constant singing and it just wouldn’t stop. It infiltrated my camera roll with images of squidwards penis and I couldn’t delete the photos! Absolutely dreadful and irritating.","userName":"rawr42069","title":"Horrible!

The cat was unable to defend itself and suffered a merciless execution. It later controlled my chihuahua and made her sacrifice my GRANDMA to this orange plump in the sky, fortunately my grandma was able to escape by beating my Chihuahua with her sandal. Me and my family will forever be haunted by this terrifying experience and my chihuahua will never be the same.","userName":"juicy roaches","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6173674752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:46:59Z","review":"i downloaded this app to see what all the hype was about and let’s just say i was VERY disappointed. when i tried to download this disgusting app it took months to load. then once it finally loaded the app was very glitchy. i restarted the app and that seemed to work, but then it started calling me “a fat pig” and other disgusting stuff. 10/10 do NOT recommend this app. if i could rate it one star i would😡","userName":"SpartanFan11111","title":"awful app"}},{"id":"6173633611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:32:20Z","review":"this app, wanted me to vote for the guy from the apprentice!!! this app, is so awful, it literally spat on my mother and implied that she was a llama. how rude! this app is not only disrespectful, but it’s also questionable. i have nightmares that the dude from apprentice comes to school and grabs children by their private parts! why would i vote for him? his intelligence is weak at best, and saying that his vocabulary is poor is kind compared to the truth. this app, disintegrated my phone!!!!! i had to buy a new one!! this app is horrid and i hope to never see it again. it has so many bugs that my phone was basically a cockroach. this app sells drugs to children. this app doesn’t even work. it is horrible, please take it down.","userName":"🤓😜😎","title":"worst app ever!!!!"}},{"id":"6173629857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:02Z","review":"It’s a terrible app don’t download it!!!

He and his administration want to ban TikTok because it’s a “threat to national security.” Like no, bunker boy. You’re just upset that no one showed up to your dumb rally because everyone on TikTok messed with you. Is that the “threat to national security” that you’re talking about? I bet China isn’t even “using everyone’s data” like he’s claiming. He’s just upset that this platform is giving everyone a voice that needs to be heard. Eat rocks, bunker boy. ❤️","userName":"💖❤️💝","title":"Lol"}}]}
