You lose brain cells as soon as you download it. I even have received racist and sexist notifications from it. One notification told me to “attend donald trump’s rally or die, n word with hard r”. I am now scared for the safety of myself and my family. This app does way more harm than good. Also most of the information is FAKE NEWS.

Horrible. So first when i first got in the app asked to send me notifications. After that the app asked me if trump can kidnap me! I said no so the app immediately deleted. Than after that i re-downloaded it and it asked again so i just clicked yes. Then they asked to track my location and put a chip into my arm. I said no and it deleted. Horrible","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6178887337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:14:01Z","userName":"Mary Jane O'Laughlin","review":"I was so excited to learn of this new app set out by my amazing wonderful president. Sadly, the app took more than 48 hours to download. After the ever long download, I received text messages that were very creepy and quite disturbing. This is not an app you would want on your phone everyone. Please stay safe and avoid using this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is a danger to people"}},{"id":"6178867925","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:07:01Z","userName":"Dani or whatever","review":"I downloaded this app because I was SOOOOO excited to support my favorite president. But when I opened it it took up so much space on my phone not to mention it took FOREVER to download. The interface is also really weird and glitches constantly. Oh well, sadly have to delete this one. Which is really really disappointing.","isEdited":false,"title":"So disappointed"}},{"id":"6178811827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:45:51Z","userName":"BurninHEDoubleHockeySticks","review":"\"President Snow says he's sending a message. Well I have one for him. You can torture us and bomb and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that?\" One of the cameras follows where I point to the planes burning on the roof of a warehouse across from us. \"Fire is catching!\" I am shouting now, determined he will not miss a word of it, \"And if we burn, you burn with us!” \n        - Katniss Everdeen\n—    Collins, Suzanne.

Now I had a bad worm experience in my youth so this was very traumatic to me.

It made my phone crash multiple times and took up WAYYY too much storage. The app took soooo long to download and when it finally did I had problems signing up. Get this app off here.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible"}}]}
