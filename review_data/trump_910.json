I want to start with what was in it but I can’t because the step before I even opened it was just disappointing. The download took more than a week which made me lose interest in it from the beginning. Going in mad was a bad idea because oh boy the inside was just ugly. I hate how it was formatted because it was hard to see where everything was. The notifications was atrociously annoying and the colors made it hard to read. The wording was god awful and the font mane me want to throw up, I mean I couldn’t understand was it was talking about even if I wanted to. Along with the grammar and the spelling I wish I never even got the app. The content was just false promises that I knew were never going to come true so it was Moore like spilling a dream than anything. If the creators fix everything wrong with this app I still wouldn’t redownload it because of the scars it left me. If you can’t tell I’m mad.","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:41Z"}},{"id":"6173603731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Stan literally anyone but trump🧚🏼✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"soip.789","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded it to support the wrinkly pumpkin/Cheeto/rat/pedo/r*pist/racist/misogynistic/embarrassment of a president and the moment I saw the app MY EYES STARTED TO BLEED 🤩😣and so I cleansed my self with some holy water like the atheist I am🤪, and so I went back for a round 2 but then he popped out of nowhere and chased me through the apartment 😔and so I summoned my Mexican mom with the power of Jesus and she boomeranged a chancla at him and out popped out a sign saying “wasted” 🤩because of the waste of perfectly fine air that pedo- I mean racist- hold on *checks script* oh, both are accurate. Huh wonder how he became president🤔, *looks into the camera*👁👄👁. But it’s a trump app what did you expect? Anyways would not recommend, terrible app 🤢🤮 oh and ps. The president do be mentally unstable and unfit for office 🍊 but even that’s an insult to all fruits. Let’s be honest here trump is uhhhh a bit of an embarrassment to every American but tbh it’s already kinda embarrassing either way🤩.

And this almost happens whenever I use the app. Also very bad system, I notice that this it dosent have the best quality and system. When my phone turn on I went back to the app and it was also confusing, bc I don’t see any positive thing in which u can do in this app. I see what the person trying to do but I honestly don’t like the app or the idea at all, it glitchy gave a virus to my phone and bad quality and nothing good u can do with this app. It’s like a waste of storage. If I where me I would of given this app 0 stars. I honestly this like it very much. I dint support this app. I gave it a 0.00% horrible app. Also I had to go and pay so they can fix my phone and they told me it was bc of this app in specific. Disappointed ☹️ honestly.","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:19Z"}},{"id":"6172871957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Donald trump is simply not a good person and he is showing you fake news","isEdited":false,"userName":"haklsdmdkjdoms","rating":1,"review":"Listen the fact that we now we all know Donald trump was (maybe still is) involved with sex trafficking and he supports white supremacy and people still want to support him is mind blowing cause this isn’t about republican democrat, right left, liberal conservatives, it’s about basic human decency even if you still believe that he does good for the economy and whatever do you really want to risk it. I hope you can realize that Donald trump is a bad person even if you want to say that he’s done good for the country he is still a bad person at the core and I hope you decide against voting for a bad person. And if you still download this app and it persuades you into thinking that he is a good person remember that he controls everything that goes on here so he’s not gonna show you the bad he’s not even gonna show you the truth he’s gonna show you things that make him look extra good.","date":"2020-07-08T16:21:43Z"}},{"id":"6172866270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i am so scared","isEdited":false,"userName":"snakes are lol","rating":1,"review":"so i am very committed conservative, but man this app is bad. i downloaded it to support our beautiful racist president. but it took 2 days to load, and i have the highest quality wifi. i live alone, besides the 6 children that i keep in my attic. but i heard noises, like someone got their big toe chopped off, they wouldn’t stop. i heard noises that i can’t even talk about, it scared me so bad. a trump flag was found hanging in my attic, it wasn’t there before. my children aren’t allowed to leave, so how would they buy it? i only have a trump 2020 flag in my living room, bedroom, my 4 bathrooms, kitchen, guest bedroom, guest bathroom, a face mask that i rarely use, my kitchen washroom, my basement, my laundry room, around my neck, and my dining room? none were misplaced. i would wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweat. one time i went to wash up and i discovered a cheeto, hot cheeto, hot f l a m i n g cheeto was on my pillowcase. omg i was so scared i had to wash it.

But this app took actual MONTHS to download. And when it did download, I wasn’t able to get on any other social media platform. Whenever I tried to get on Facebook, ten ads would pop up for viagra and toupees for men.. but that didn’t bother me, I still used it. However, when I started to play his voice and listen to his speeches, a swarm of wasps came to my doorstep and started to attack me. these weren’t your average wasps, no. They could talk, and they even had human hands. When I turned around to see what monstrosity forced themselves into my home, it was only seconds later until they started to sting my eyeballs and eardrums.. while I was screaming in agony, the wasps kept chanting “dont vote for a racist,” “black lives matter,” and “trump is a white supremacist😡.” I was horrified! And now, I can’t see, nor hear anything. I am completely blind and deaf, and it’s all thanks to this app. 0/10.","date":"2020-07-08T15:10:09Z"}},{"id":"6177835851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app to exist ever.","isEdited":false,"userName":"cat sheets","rating":1,"review":"I don’t know where to start with this app. I opened it and it gave me all false information. It also forced me into doing harmful things such as stepping on a crack and breaking my mother’s back. She is currently in the hospital suffering. Another thing it forced me to do was watch Gabbie Hanna. She was talking really annoyingly and then started singing. It went something like \n☝🏻point ✨ the 👑 finger 🔫 pull 🥨 the 💔 trigger 💥 throw 🍅 them 🐀 off 😍 your 😳 trail 😔 you’ll 😪 get 🥓 yours 👁 e 💖ven 🤡 tu 👄 ally 🐻. It was really bad. She obviously isn’t trained in the vocal area. 💁\u200D♀️his app also burned the eyes of my dog. It causes him to vomit all over my house and now my house smells awful.🤢 Finally, this app gave me a headache just from looking at it. It had adds promoting a new song by Aidan Gallaghar. His song is called the fourth of july 🇺🇸 his lyrics are totally inappropriate. It’s talks about peeing!!! 😡😡😡 It goes like It’s absolutely awful and should be removed from the App Store ASAP. 😡","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:23Z"}},{"id":"6177435070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️💦trump 2020✨✨🦟🦟 but put it on a gravestone🦶🏻🦶🏻🦶🏻🦠","isEdited":false,"userName":"anna bortion🔮🔮","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app in hopes of getting the president to notice me cuz i’m such a fan of cheetos. as soon as i downloaded it it asked for my social security number. I obviously was skeptical but because of my cheeto obsession i put it in. immediately after i started to hear notifications that money was being taken from my bank account, and i found out that the greedy oompa loompa was taking my money for his campaign. i called a number that is given on the app and when they picked up, it was barron trump screaming for me to come help him. so i dressed in all black and stole him from the white house. on my way out, seven oompa loompas tackled me and the rest took barron back to the bunker. i was then put in a space ship which transported me to the moon. the wifi is pretty bad up here but my data works well. anyways, 1/10 would not recommend because he’s just a cheeto looking for money✨✨✨✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T16:47:43Z"}},{"id":"6177426462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump story","isEdited":false,"userName":"nsbsguen ehsjs","rating":1,"review":"I saw Donald Trump at a grocery store in D.C yesterday.\n\nI told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\n\nHe said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.\n\nAfter paying for the Milky Ways he proceeded to leave the store and throw all of them in the garbage. Haven't seen him since.\n\n(found in r/iamverysmart comment section.)","date":"2020-07-09T16:45:04Z"}},{"id":"6177075993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁👉👈","isEdited":false,"userName":"samanthaismagic","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to support our beautiful sex offender president, right? Right. It only took two hours on a hotspot but that’s ok because I W A S a die hard fan so anything for yOu. I hadn’t even opened the app before my phone started overheating. I was like “woah that is not epic” and after not touching it for a month it finally cooled down. When I did regain access my phone was slower than you trying to remember why your parents still love you. I decided that it was fine, my top priority was to open this horribly organized app. Then suddenly five secret service officers jumped into my room and yelled “STOP HER!” I thought they meant me but that’s when I noticed my phone had grown legs and began running down the hall. Uh, I kinda wanted my phone but then they pinned my phone on the ground and crushed it with their knees. That’s not cool? Anyways your app caused my phone to grow limbs and die so I don’t like you anymore sir please go away you were very mean to me.","date":"2020-07-09T15:05:19Z"}}]}
