I tried downloading this app to try to like him. But this app did nothing but help me not like him anymore. It took several hours to download this app. I had to wait three days for it to completely download. Not a great experience. I am giving this a one star review because this is the most horrifying disgusting app I I have ever seen.Hopefully in the future I get to see something better.
