The launching tool forever and failed multiple times. When using the app it glitches and clears your information. Even the app functions are confusing and unnecessary. It’s a very bad app and I would not recommend it to anyone.","title":"take this down from the app store","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tororoo"}},{"id":"6173448547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:24Z","review":"The app took forever to download. When it finally did, it froze and I didn’t know what to do. I can’t believe I can’t see what 🍊 will do next. When i downloaded it again, it finally worked but strange images kept popping up. They were disturbing. I had to throw my phone across the room. Not my phone is broken and I need it to be fixed, but I got glued it back together. The app is not worth your time.","title":"Terrible❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🌸🧚😍👄🌺"}},{"id":"6173421785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:19:23Z","review":"This is the worst app to ever be made it is horrible, do not download I repeat do not download.

I am deeply offended and want my money back. On top of that it keeps trying to sell me trump gear which is not trending right now. They need some better marketers that are actually with it now or else no ones gonna use it. Can’t believe I spent $0.69 on this. One star is too overrated for this.","title":"Very disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anyone better than trump"}},{"id":"6173366407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:57Z","review":"While trying to download this app, my iPhone was infected with lots of viruses. When i tried looking up how to get rid of said viruses, it said that over 3 million other iPhone users had the same virus and that almost 150k iPhone users actually lost the ability to use their iPhone at all, meaning that the phone is essentially dead. Due to these issues i would encourage users not to download this app.","title":"Worst app of all","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hun7_21"}}]}
