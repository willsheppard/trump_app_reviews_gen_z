Like someone else mentioned my app also took SEVERAL days to install. When it finally did I opened the app and was horrified! They wanted my mobile number! (To hack me of course.) At the time I was like well our “lovely” president wouldn’t do that to us, but when I entered my number I was spammed with THOUSANDS of pictures of trump! It said say “STOP” to end the robo messages, but when I said stop I received a message saying “Open the app to fund our next project.” I opened the app out of curiosity and to my surprise there was a “Fund our next project button” I clicked it and it took me to a page called “Funds for paper towels” As I read what the fundraiser was about I was horrified. And I quote it said “Attention American citizens, we need to stock up on paper towels. The paper towels are not for the pandemic but to throw at the Puerto Rican’s AGAIN if there is another hurricane so they can clean it up themselves.” Mortified and offended I went to delete the app. When I clicked delete nothing happened. I clicked it again, nothing. Then I got a bunch of calls to which I declined them all. I blocked trumps number and then I got a text saying “YOU CAN’T GET RID OF ME I AM YOUR PRESIDENT FOREVER!!!”. I went to check if he was blocked and HE WASN’T! He HACKED me! I am mortified the only way it stopped was by me smashing my phone with a hammer and then getting it repaired. Bottom line is don’t download this app unless you want to get hacked!","userName":"K_Michelleee"}},{"id":"6175705577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!! 😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T08:23:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"definitely recommended downloading....then leaving a one star review and deleting!!","userName":"justalonelyuser"}},{"id":"6175704325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRAUMATIZED ✨🧚\u200D♂️✨","date":"2020-07-09T08:23:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"⚠️DO NOT GET THIS APP UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES 🙅\u200D♀️🚫 I have undergone trauma because of this app and my therapist is not happy! I was confused on why the app took so long to download, 666 minutes to be exact 😱 I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before I downloaded it but I realized after the fact that it was because it was stealing all of my information it HACKED into everything!!! All my pictures were deleted and replaced with propaganda, I couldn’t open TikTok, all of my other social media apps would only open up to trumps page, my ringtone was changed to the national anthem, and on Facebook I was added to a group of Karen’s. Soon enough the only thing I could do on my phone was open this app and answer the numerous spam phone calls asking if I was voting for trump. Now to get to the actual app, it is used to BRAINWASH you! There is a part of the app that will actually hypnotize you to say “all lives matter” when ever someone talks about blm and to throw a tantrum when told to put a mask on. I’ve gotten help thankfully but I still have nightmares every night of trump and the devil dancing around a fire, the sight is TERRIFYING. After I had gotten help I deleted the app but then I started getting trump merci delivered to my house and here comes the worst part a creature with trumps face the body of a snake with spider legs and pig tail started coming to my house and singing me the national anthem while tap dancing once a week and saying unless I voted for trump the torture and harassment will continue but I REFUSE and will sacrifice myself for the greater good because after the pain this app has caused me I will never vote for that MONSTER! I advise all of you to not make the same mistake I did and do NOT download this app!!!","userName":"Lovelyeditorrr"}},{"id":"6175694897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"‼️⚠️🔥DONT DOWNLOAD🔥⚠️‼️","date":"2020-07-09T08:20:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app will ruin your life and make your phone crash!!!!","userName":"L0EONA"}},{"id":"6175685591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is awful","date":"2020-07-09T08:16:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app slowed down my entire phone.
