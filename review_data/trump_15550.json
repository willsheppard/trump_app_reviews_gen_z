I don’t exactly want to be the recipient of spam from this app. I would look led to rate this app 0 stars if I could. Absolutely atrocious my dudes. I don’t want Cheeto brains to know my number. And even if I did support the dude, why do they want to know my phone number? 🧚\u200D♂️Trump 2020✨⭐️🧚\u200D♂️ but on a gravestone ⭐️✨⭐️🧚\u200D♂️🤩","date":"2020-07-05T22:46:44Z","title":"Not for nothing, but this app isn’t that good"}},{"id":"6158016210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Forever devastated","review":"If I could give this app a zero star I would. So just an average day at the toilet and I wanted to see how my beloved president was doing with his campaign and everything. But then, chaos happened. It started to ask me crazy question and I just got overwhelmed. Too many and just to figure out how my lovely president was doing. 🥺Ridiculous. I guess I just have to go back to fox News. 😔","date":"2020-07-04T22:40:47Z","title":"I can't believe it."}},{"id":"6149681953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"littlerainfish3","review":"The second I downloaded this app, I thought it would help me support Trump better but once I opened it my phone started glitching out and it gave me a pop up telling me I had been HACKED!!!! I was so scared that I had to delete the app and reset my entire phone. Then I remembered that the app had asked for an Apple ID and phone number. I don’t know how but it stole money from my account!!! Horrible app!!!!

Not surprised but this app glitches the whole time. It wouldn’t even let me open the app without sitting down my phone. Horrible. Should be removed. Don’t get this app. It’s hard to get my emotions out clearly so let me write a short script of my emotional journey while using this app. \n\n“According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.”\n“Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.” \n“The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.”\n“Yellow, black.

I saw a Cheeto with a face on it and it scared the daylights out of me. As a person that doesn’t get scared easily I am telling you don’t get this app if you get scared easily and DON’T LOOK AT IT IN THE DARK!!! It will leave you traumatized. I can’t believe this is what we have gotten to app wise.

I also had to put in my number, and when I did I looked outside my window to find an orange man looking back at me.

I downloaded it to support our lord and savior Donald J. Trump, but it’s made my life ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE!!! As soon as I clicked download, my hot pockets that were in the oven BURNT!!! Next thing I knew, my cat was throwing up in my VALENTINO WHITE BAG. That was especially terrible, because I’d already spilled lipstick in it the day before.

The SECOND i opened the app my cat began seizing and foaming at the mouth. She continued to attack me until i left the app. I assumed it was just a coincidence, but later that day i tried again when my mom got home. Again, when i opened the app she went feral and ripped my mother to shreds with her sharp teeth. 0/10 do not recommend this app.","date":"2020-06-28T23:37:56Z","title":"WORST APP EVER"}}]}
