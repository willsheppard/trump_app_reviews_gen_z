I definitely would not recommend downloading. Not to mention all the information the app actually shares is completely mis-leading. I hope to see it deleted !!!!!!!!!! I wish I could’ve given it a 0/5 stars ⭐️","date":"2020-07-09T15:54:27Z","title":"💖T I K 🧚🏽\u200D♂️T O K🧚🏽\u200D♂️🧚🏼🧚🏽\u200D♂️🧚🏼🧚🏼🧚🏼🧚🏼","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jan123live"}},{"id":"6177239833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was downloaded in 2 days. I needed to provide my phone number and address in order to see all the content of the app and in doing that I have received trump news letters in the mail and a call almost every 5 minuets and at least 50 texts a day. This is a TERRIBLE app and I don’t suggest getting it unless you want to see trump flood your phone. Ps it’s not fun staring at an orange all day.","date":"2020-07-09T15:51:22Z","title":"Trump 2020","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"blurryfacebest"}},{"id":"6177241476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"His policies are horrendous.  Not to mention that you have to sign up with your number to see his policies. Just so he can text you off the app.","date":"2020-07-09T15:51:51Z","title":"The bad, The terrible and the Orange.","rating":5,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Jacobe2562"}},{"id":"6177203613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The title let alone is disgusting. When you open the app is takes so long to get to do things, the way it’s set up is awful there’s no use for this app anymore. The fact that I had to sign up makes me sick that he’s going to have all my information I mean come on where’s the privacy. Take this app down please and thank you!","date":"2020-07-09T15:40:52Z","title":"Everything is horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sunrayflower"}},{"id":"6177094558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app to see what the Trump administration was planning and news. Once the app finally downloaded and I opened it my phone crashed within 5 minutes of use. I have a brand new phone so it isn’t just my phone’s fault. I restarted my phone and when I went back in the app my phone crashed immediately.","date":"2020-07-09T15:10:28Z","title":"Actually made my phone crash","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mum2160"}},{"id":"6177089915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app won’t even load for me! I downloaded it 5x, tired it on multiple different wifi’s, i tried to wait and see if it would load, i even tried it on my friend Pam’s phone and it wouldn’t load😡! Mr. President, I do not see how you expect me to see and support you when I can’t even see your app. That being said I’ll still vote for you.

Not to mention many of the pictures looked terrifying. They depicted an oversized Cheeto running to be president. It looks grossly deformed and I could barely get through the main page before I had to run to the bathroom and throw up. Apple needs to delete this I doubt they’ve ever put a worse app on one of their products.","date":"2020-07-09T15:08:35Z","title":"Hideously terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Natkerbe"}},{"id":"6177062681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i had very high hopes for this app when downloading it. it took 2 weeks to download and the app overall didn’t live up to my expectations. the second you open the app you see an orange oompa loops which was pretty frightening to see that i actually went blind in my right eye. this garbage of an app would be a lot better off not in the AppStore for the sake of people and there poor eyes.😔","date":"2020-07-09T15:01:38Z","title":"✨ABSOLUTE GARBAGE✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"tararstg"}},{"id":"6177025594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app started a fire in my house. my newly redecorated room was the first to go. then everything exploded. i ended up having to go to the hospital to get my legs chopped off☹️ it was a very bad day😔. they asked what started the fire and i said the trump app. then i opened the app to show them. then the hospital caught on fire. then everyone in there had to get their legs cut off. just DO NOTTT get this app i’m warning you  and saving you.","date":"2020-07-09T14:51:32Z","title":"HORIBBLE APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"queen_me33"}}]}
