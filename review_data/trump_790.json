Now, I’m no mathmotologist or anything, but it seems that resources spent on this app by Trump Campaign team could be better allocated to other things, such as looking up information on windmills. This one star is not only for the redundancy of the app’s existence, I mean he already has his website, his twitter, and his text alerts which get his questionable points across pretty well and are all accessible on mobile (I checked, unfortunately) but also to represent the great state of Texas, who should never have joined the union anyway and should have stayed their own country. For they have much too much land and their cows have concerningly long horns, which is untrustworthy. However, I must honor the Texan overlords in this review in order to stay in good favor, as I am from a much smaller state that never had the privilege to be it’s own nation with a real big star on the flag. Lone Star State out.","userName":"MyuMyu4eva","date":"2020-07-09T17:48:23Z","title":"Meh"}},{"id":"6176547868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The 5G emitted from this app gave me, my grandma, and my cat cancer. I would never recommend this to anyone unless you want to be whithering away from rotting brain cancer. The tumors grow in the amygdala, making all of us extremely agressive. Now, we all get into WWE style fights in the living room. My grandma has several broken bones from my uncontrollable aggression that comes out in the form of me body slamming her into every nearby piece of furniture. We have made countless trips to Ikea due to this unfortunate disease, but the furniture just keeps on getting broken from my tendency to absolutely obliterate my grammie in the makeshift fighting ring. My cat has left several scars on my body from our fights, and I believe the tumors have increased her intelligence level to give her telepathy. I am constantly awoken in the middle of the night with her voice in my head telling her to “feed me or i will set you and your american flag on fire”. Absolutely terrible experience, I wouldnt recommend this app to anyone.","userName":"NerdBird13","date":"2020-07-09T12:44:41Z","title":"Cancer"}},{"id":"6175748676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Honestly this app is under developed. Honestly I couldn’t even open the app. Honestly it was a very traumatic experience. Honestly it was stuck on the loading screen for minimum 15 mins. Honesty my WiFi connection is berry fast. Honestly I think the reason for the app to not work is that it’s very untruthful. Honestly I think it should say TRUMP. Let’s make America bad again. Honestly I think that is the problem. Honestly after reading all the reviews I completely agree. Honestly I’m not here to hate. Honestly I’m here to help with the problems of the app. Honestly I just want this app to get taken down and then never to be put up again. Honestly I’m very disappointed. Honestly this is a honest review. Honestly I think that this review is long enough. Honestly honestly honestly this app is actually trash I was stuck on the loading screen for so long and then when it finally loaded the app was very laggy and I don’t think it’s my internet connection. HONESTLY THE APP IS BAD.","userName":"GeTiNtOiT👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T08:38:21Z","title":"Honest review"}},{"id":"6175718250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t even know how, but I downloaded this app as a joke, and now I have chlamydia. ☹️🙄I am like 100% sure it’s because of this app.😤 I don’t have anything else to say other than it should be removed from the App Store to protect other people from getting chlamydia, which is caused by installing this app. 😗🤩🤢😳Also after I downloaded it stuff in my house started moving around. I started small like plates would fall out of the cabinet and the couch with school a couple inches to either side. Then I started getting strange. Lamp light bulbs started to come bust and picture frames started sliding across the walls. I’m not gonna say that this app made my house haunted AND gave me chlamydia, but I think we can all connect the dots. After I climbed out of my head and watch my self implode \nI thought without my body oughta be the shot to take the load off my brain, it’s a poison and I’m searching for the anecdote but every time my defensive scream oh no you don’t.\n~wOäh~\n-xoxo free Barron","userName":"bernieXOXO😗","date":"2020-07-09T08:28:03Z","title":"This app gave me chlamydia"}},{"id":"6174883252","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The first problem with the app is that you have to sign in by cellphone or you don’t get to sign in. Another design flaw is that when you put your phone number in you also have to put in your email as well, while yes most normal apps do this, they normally give you the choice to pick which one you want the app to have access to first then later on ask if you want to verify the other one.\nThe design is very ugly, the colors are fine but there is far to much white on the app it over powers the red and blue to the point were it is very unappealing to look at, if the design team was going for an American flag theme they should have evened out the red and white how the real flag is.\nIt’s very boring to the eye. Not a lot going on in the home page it feels like I’m looking at a boring word document.\nThe reward system seems really stupid especially considering what the app is meant to be used for. The points you get are virtually useless and the ‘prizes’ are certifiably lame.\nI would say the only good thing about this app is that it actually works but we would have all been better off had this ugly beast never crossed the App Store.\nThe app seems to be rather useless because while there are a lot of radical Trump supporters, a lot of them have their own lives, are just straight up lazy, or are underage kids who have not had the privilege of forming their own opinions yet.","userName":"A.Quartz","date":"2020-07-09T03:31:44Z","title":"waste of time and internet"}},{"id":"6174443352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Immediately when I downloaded the app my phone was glitchy and would freeze 🥶! I finally got it to stop, so then I opened the app and it kept telling me to buy its merch, like is this a Team 10 Video 🙄? I ignored it and continued on, only to see that my home screen and lock screen had been changed to MAGA and Tr*mp 2020 😱. And let me just tell you... I was shocked... petrified. This TRAUMATIC experience made me have an asthma attack 😷. I was scared for my life and I couldn’t breathe 😓. I grabbed my inhaler but it had Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter written ALL OVER IT 🤢. I went to take a puff and THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT 🤔! Instead there was a note inside that said “if you say Tr*mp is the best president then you can get your inhaler back.” Obviously I couldn’t say that so I had to be RUSHED to the emergency hospital 🏥. I was in the ambulance I passed out 😵. Then I saw it 😰. HE WAS IN MY DREAMS 🔥. This man is terrifying, I can barely even go on my phone anymore without getting flashbacks 😢. 0/10 would NOT recommend. ❌🚫‼️","userName":"Fishyy16","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:14Z","title":"Um... NO 😹"}},{"id":"6174177666","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I honestly didn’t have high expectations for this app considering it is supposed to promote Trump, and everything his administration does is just simply mediocre, but I was dumbfounded by how absolutely horrible this app is. The pure discomfort this app gives me is worse than watching a bird regurgitate chewed up worms into slimy baby bird beaks. The person responsible for the set up and imagery shown in this app should be extremely ashamed of themselves. NO ONE should have to open an app and see such horrible things!!!! I however was not given such a warning, and let me tell you, as soon as I opened this god forsaken app and saw an enlarged, horribly tanned, soggy looking, bad wig wearing MONSTER, I about cried. And to think there might be CHILDREN that download this app unknowingly, and endure the same pain I did! To anyone one reading this, please... oh god PLEASE do not download this app. For everything holy do not press the download button, because you will never be the same.","userName":"👹🌚🐁","date":"2020-07-08T23:53:57Z","title":"This app is worse than the fungus on my left toe🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6174134439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Right when I opened the app I was immediately HORRIFIED!!!! I SAW WHAT I THINK WAS A MALE CHEETO PUFF!! IT JUMPED AT ME THROUGH MY SCREEN AND STARTED ATTACKING ME BC IM MEXICAN. THIS APP IS RACISTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!

THE PUFF THEN CONTINUED TO STEAL MY WHOLE REFRIGERATOR AND MY CAT😭😭 WHO TAKES SOMEONES FRIDGE MAN THATS JUST MESSED UP!! I DEMAND THE WHITE HOUSE SEND ME A NEW ONE AND FIVE MORE CATS TO REPLACE THE ONE HE TOOK. I was so traumatized by the Cheeto man that I got sent to the insane asylum! I just got out and now I have to go to therapy THREE TIMES A DAY!!! I have never been so disappointed in an app. If the president of the United States actually cared about his citizens he wouldn’t traumatize us like this😞 I demand this app be removed from the App Store so nobody else gets put through the horror I have been!! I REPEAT... DO. NOT. GET. THIS. APP. It also says in the fine print of the user agreement that you owe them your first two born kids!! They then put your would have been children into work camps similar to the holocaust😔 SAVE YOURSELF AND PLEASE APPLE REMOVE THE APP IMMEDIATELYYYYYY!!!!","userName":"heather gobba","date":"2020-07-08T23:38:03Z","title":"DONT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6174109330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of a great new mobile platform to share my comedic videos! However what I hoped for wasn’t delivered. As soon as I opened the app, I (along with many others) was shown a horrific image of what I can only assume was a Cheeto, working out. It was absolutely horrifying, my poor youthful eyes never needed to see that. Secondly, I saw pictures of this Cheeto spray tanning! Naked! That was awful because I am a minor. Thankfully there was nothing to see ‘down there’, but I was still traumatized. I also saw pictures of him before his spray tan, which in itself isn’t terrible, but I thought it was a ghost at first because his was such a pale white. It was honestly very scary. I will not be downloading this app ever again due to the unneeded trauma and anxiety it caused me. I will now need more years of extensive therapy to cure my mind. I quite honestly have nothing good to say about this app. Also(as a side note) your rallies always smell like my dogs poo, so you should fix that.","userName":"trumphasasmallweenie","date":"2020-07-08T23:28:54Z","title":"Very awful🤢🤮🤢🤮👿👿👿"}},{"id":"6173954457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"first of all.. the man in the first picture looks like he’s just gotten out of a bunker that he stayed in for 6 years straight! when i opened the app, it asked me for my PHONE NUMBER- what is that man gonna do with it?? find my location and R@P3 ME? hope he doesn’t know i’m a minor... anyways it also said “fight with donald trump” who the hell is donald trump? i thought he was the dude who died on may 25th?? is this app suggesting i do WORK in order for this dead man who looks like the orange version of the kool aid man to be president? helll no. why would i ever support a man who promised to keep lgbtq safe but then took away trans rights 😹😹😹 um.. chile anyways what’s this dudes problem? he stands like this : 🐇 and 🦘?? this dude got scoliosis or what? 💀💀 im so confused why DOES HE STAND LIKE THAT HAHAHAHA KDNFKDNF ök anyways i accidentally registered to go to one of his events and um... i don’t wanna go whooppssss-  also this app wants me to PAY money? i could never pay a man who looks like he’s slept with one of his kids 💀 thx for coming to my ted talk","userName":"MADMonkeyWierdo","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:59Z","title":"i did not like..."}}]}
