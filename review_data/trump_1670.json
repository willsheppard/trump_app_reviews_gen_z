The name string theory comes from the modeling of subatomic particles as tiny one-dimensional “stringlike” entities rather than the more conventional approach in which they are modeled as zero-dimensional point particles. The theory envisions that a stringundergoing a particular mode of vibration corresponds to a particle with definite properties such as mass and charge. In the 1980s, physicists realized that string theory had the potential to incorporate all four of nature’s forces—gravity, electromagnetism, strong force, and weak force—and all types of matter in a single quantum mechanical framework, suggesting that it might be the long-sought unified field theory. While string theory is still a vibrant area of research that is undergoing rapid development, it remains primarily a mathematical construct because it has yet to make contact with experimental observations.","rating":1,"title":"🤪","date":"2020-07-08T23:21:26Z","userName":"rickyyyyyyyyyyyyyy1"}},{"id":"6173945825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i'm just your average trump supporter he is my king like many others I would love to kiss his feet one day, because i am such a big fan of course i wanted the mobile app for my device. about two weeks ago i downloaded it and everything was orangey 🍊, oh wait i mean peachy. only having the app for a MINIMUM of 15 minutes, immediately i started coughing and i had a fever, but I am a true trump supporter so i know that all of this is a hoax and coronavirus isn't real, but my whining snowflake daughter forced me to go to the doctor and get tested.
