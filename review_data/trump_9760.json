I would. At one point it asks for my name and address so I did as they wished. NEXT THING I KNEW, my phone sprayed out this gas that knocked me out for 12 hours. During the time I was unconscious, the trump administration broke into my home and stole both my kidneys and then proceeded to give me a lobotomy. I havent been able to properly use the toilet or even blink since... don’t download if you still like your kidneezzzz","date":"2020-07-08T22:44:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173935046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lil barron ❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","review":"This app is very disheartening. Firstly I went on it to discover a cheeto man that is trying to take over the world and I was like haha no❤️ that’s not a vibe with me lol. Secondly this sweaty orange gorilla is making my uncomfortable and miserable just seeing his face almost gives me a heart attack. If I wasn’t so strong I would have died from the picture of the 🍊🐒.

Not to mention, it seems to be very forgetful and overall racist. The white supremacy in this app is astronomical. Mostly just good to keep up with new COVID hot spots (IE Where new trump rallies occur). Keeping up with the kardashians? No thanks. Keeping up with the trumps. Good place to keep track of how quickly the downfall of our country will occur. Overall disappointed with infrastructure and quality. Wear a mask.","date":"2020-07-08T22:19:45Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173920447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GenZ_Fairy","isEdited":false,"title":"What The Orange?!","review":"I downloaded this app and to my dismay I saw the scariest thing ever. I could not believe that the showed a orange undressing in front of my well made salad. I sadly was in a public place called my home and my family saw the horrible picture. I was so enraged by the fact that they could possible believe that families with children could view this. I now have to see my therapist again because of my eyes deceiving me into seeing the orange every now again.","date":"2020-07-08T22:18:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173913380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"loverrr🤠😎🤪","isEdited":false,"title":"SO BAD","review":"i downloaded this app to see what our no good president was up to and i was so disappointed😔 could you imagine supporting a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic person?! i sure can’t. after downloading this app i started to feel sick — probably from the bad vibes trump supporters give off — and just had to delete it. people should not have access to this app (it causes a loss of brain cells 🧠👀). i hope that everyone deletes this app before their brain explodes😌🧚\u200D♀️✨","date":"2020-07-08T22:15:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173899028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@Angie A.","isEdited":false,"title":"ignore the haters💫🧚🏽💞 because their right💝✨🌈🙈","review":"me and my pet unicorn went to the mall and ate 3 pretzels and drank 5 lemonades we had an ✨𝑒𝑥𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒✨time UNTIL we saw the tRuMp 2020 app ad. we downloaded it on our iphone galaxy 75 max pro flip and we were disappointed and disgusted by the tiny sausage we saw. we also had our tesla model abcdefghijklmnop stolen and all of our spoons were folded i was super mad so i ate my fish. he was delicious. i didn’t like the app it was slowing down my umbrella. um chile anyways 🙈✨","date":"2020-07-08T22:10:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173893141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"parker5292","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"This was the absolute worst mistake I’ve ever made by downloading this app once opening the app as soon as I opened the app for the first time it began setting off this really high pitched noise which attracted thousands of crows into our neighborhood and the crows then proceeded to start picking up all the neighborhood cats and dropping them from thirty feet in the air, all the cats where going crazy and even started gathering in circles screeching some satanic noise DEFINITELY would not recommend downloading.","date":"2020-07-08T22:08:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173890247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BaileyHart","isEdited":false,"title":"This App Ruined My Life","review":"In short, it impregnated my wife with a demonic limbless child, made my youngest daughter a bed wetter, raped my dog, and forced my oldest son to become a prostitute. In the end, it killed my wife and two other children and a pastor all in the efforts of exorcising the demon it had awoken that tore apart our home. Now, I write this summary from my car as I wait for my prostitute and be wetter outside a gas station in New Mexico on a road trip to move to Arizona to escape the town we destroyed.

When I went on it I was bombarded with disturbing information that will give me seriously trauma fo the rest of my life.
