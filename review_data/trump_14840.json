However within in instant of loading the app, nonstop glitches kept happening, even when I get out of the app. I would advise that no one downloads this app so they don’t experience this. And the programmers of the app, instead of fixing the glitches, I believe deleting this app all together is the best way to go.","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6175018581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:13:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"NO VOTE BC OF TIKTOK BAN","review":"I wil no longer be voting for trump due to the tik tok ban. He is just mad that people on the app are messing with his election. He is trying to make it seem as an urgent national security problem when there are way bigger problem has ignored. Tik tok is a part of American culture it is a way to share creativity and experience. I am very mad about this ban so Donald will not only be getting a review for his app to be deleted but he will no longer get a vote.","rating":1,"title":"TIK TOK BAN"}},{"id":"6174995044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:06:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KatiebugKatiebugK","review":"When you first open the app everything is fine and dandy but after ten minutes it was glitching like crazy.

I opened the app and it called me a “fugly $lut” :(  probably just a glitch in the software but it’s very hurtful :( then to make matters even worse, it began to disrupt the other apps on my phone!
