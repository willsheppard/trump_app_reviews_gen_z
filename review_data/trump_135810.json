I was so excited to please him with my app but when I downloaded it and opened it for the first time it kept asking me questions I don’t understand like my phone number. I don’t even know what that is and frankly I’m angry that it asked me. It also uses location in the background even when the app is not open. I support the one true lord Donald rump but I don’t understand why he wants to know where I am? Why does donald want to follow me? I don’t appreciate this invasion of privacy. Deleting app immediately so I don’t have to deal with what a phone number is","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-14T13:00:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The worst app"}},{"id":"6073700520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nas ty","review":"I downloaded the app because obviously I love the country’s famous orange— I mean president. Everyday I make sure to write my love letter to that idiot— I mean president. I also make sure to make my neighbors write their own love letters to the pedophile— I mean president. Thank goodness I live in a racist— I mean Trump supporting neighborhood. What would I do without them! Anyways, let’s get back to the topic of this horrible app. While I love and support this rap!st— I mean president, I can’t help but not like this app. It’s horrible, it doesn’t function, and it spouts nonsense, just like the president. I do not recommend. But, to those reading this review, make sure to hug your cardboard cutout of the racist— I mean of the president!","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-14T07:20:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6072785997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😷 🤧 😷","review":"\"If you or a loved one was diagnosed with Mesothelioma you may be entitled to financial compensation.

This man is the anti-Christ. He will always put his own butt in front of yours. You and your family will die because of this mans incredibly talented ability to forgo on any and all safety precautions to protect any and all people who reside in this country. 300,000 people are scheduled to be in Tulsa, OK in one weeks time. There will be repercussions. It will be blamed on the already marginalized and oppressed. Why? Because Donald Trump has always taken the easy way out. He’s never pulled up a boot strap for anything. He’s never gonna be like you. He has never been like you. You are closer to being homeless than you or great-grand children will ever be to becoming a Billionaire.

I thought I'd be able to support our beloved president but instead all I saw was a cheeto in all the photos and videos. Not sure if there's a glitch in the app code but the first impression was a let down. This was a distasteful prank in part of the coder or coders. Must have been just one coder because how could multiple people let this disgrace happen😒. It's just made me hungry tbh😩 I want cheetos now.","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-13T15:13:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Let down😞"}},{"id":"6071020782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"millennial88","review":"ABSOLUTELY NOT.","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-13T13:57:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY NOT."}}]}
