But when I downloaded the app, it would not open, and when it did all it showed was a black screen. I’m not sure if this app was hacked or being messed with but it is very unhelpful and I do not recommend. You’d think Mr. trump would have a handle on his planforms.. and for that I’m voting for Biden.","userName":"bcjdieeklx","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:19Z","title":"Don’t get this app!"}},{"id":"6177447373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When ever i downloaded this app, it totally glitched into a Grilled cheese restaurant app. This app is horrible. Finally once the grilled cheese screen loaded a video popped up and it was harry potter to the savage dance from the AMAZING APP ✨TIKTOK✨. Once the savage dance went away a screen popped up saying black lives matter. Then another screen popped up and said that Lgbtq+ people are valid🏳️\u200D🌈. I COULDNT BELIEVE MY EYES👁👄👁.

My phone then started getting really slow and unresponsive when I tried to use other apps.

However, to my surprise the app was just one long ad for terrible spray tans. Like truly awful, discolored, disgraceful to the orange Cheeto brand spray tans. I DO NOT recommend this app to anyone who loves their mother. 0/10 🤮🤢😷😩🤧","userName":"izzzzzxyyyyyyyyyyyyy","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:53Z","title":"absolutely obliterated my opinion of Cheetos"}},{"id":"6177340502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Tik tok is a app were ppl of all ages get to make content and spred joy this app is not it’s full of negitvity and it’s full of a cheeto this app is terrible in so many ways first off the apps about \nSupporting trump, trump isn’t just a president he’s also a rapist a racist and a clown this app makes me cry😠 and it shouldn’t exist but tik tok should Bc it’s where ppl get fame and happiness and that’s on period","userName":"non d trump suporter","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:06Z","title":"No no no bad trump"}},{"id":"6177302518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I am a trump supporter but this app had so many glitches and it was so bad.
