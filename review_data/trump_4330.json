Not only was I shocked to find that he is not only misogynistic and homophobic, but racist and pedophilic as well! A truly disappointing and disgusting turn of events. He also demonstrates his plans to make more use of his bunker, which I’m not quite sure what that means but it sounds like a great place to have parties!! This app also crashed my phone due to the pure ignorance and disregard for human decency within it’s content. Keep trying Donald, but we all encourage you to give up 😘✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"z27952"}},{"id":"6173106591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"stupid cheeto app","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is absolutely horrible. it took WEEKS to download, and once i did download it, it crashed my phone. i had to go to the apple store and get a new phone, meaning i lost everything on my old phone, including pictures of my grandma that died 4 weeks ago. i will never get those back. so, the first thing i did on my new phone was download it again so i could leave this review, which took weeks, AGAIN!!! and to make things worse, as soon as i opened the app and trumps stupid ugly face popped up, it killed my cat because he was so shocked about how ugly trump was. i wish i could give it 0 stars stan bernie for clear skin.","userName":"just.riley"}},{"id":"6173094757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🦋😩App wasn’t working😩🦋","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"(Btw I am voting age in my state) I got this app yesterday and it had me type in my number and wouldn’t let me get in without agreeing to get notifications and texts (which I absolutely hate) so that was the first inconvenience, second off I went to bed and woke up with 17 notifications! That’s just spam! Then I went in and found out that people were saying things against my race and I was absolutely not for it. The last thing, the way this app runs is just stressful, and I’m moving so I don’t need more stress. Please delete this app, it discriminates a good portion of this country!!\nWorst app I’ve ever downloaded!!!\n0 stars if I could!!","userName":"i luv the gays 🏳️\u200D🌈💅"}},{"id":"6173076153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app i’ve ever seen 😳💖✌️","date":"2020-07-08T17:25:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to download this app to see what it had\nto offer and i was thoroughly different disappointed when I saw the app was only for Trump supporters 🙄😡. i started looking at trump’s interviews to see if there was any good he was doing for america and some of the things he’s said are just unacceptable 🥰🥰💘. He has undermined and dismissed women 😩🤮. He has told police to hurt people and said the n word in a tweet. He offended the asian community by calling the corona the “chinese virus” 👺🤡. There’s signs of emotional damage to his son Barron Trump 🥺💔. Trump has openly said\non live television he wants to have sex\nwith his daughter 🤢🤮. He is the ugliest man i’ve ever seen and the dumbest 🍊✨🧚💘","userName":"Gibby (from icarly)"}},{"id":"6173041469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is so bad","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see all these amazing things trump has done but sadly i cannot find any. anytime i ask what are some good things he’s done the app keeps screaming at me calling me a “libtard.” yes i am a libra but there’s no need for name calling. i understand that trump happens to be the president of the united states but he’s a tad bit disrespectful. disrespecting your own people seems kinda childish and i will not stand for it. so in conclusion i hope that mr donald j(enius) trump doesn’t win in this upcoming november election due to his childish way. if mr trump decides to man up to his actions, apologize & start making changes he may get my vote. until then i will be settling for biden🤍🇬🇳🥰","userName":"iwastoldtodothislol"}},{"id":"6172903530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely the worst🤮","date":"2020-07-08T16:31:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is a disgrace to all the other apps.

And this ALL happened because of this app. 😳 If your a fellow trump supporter I would like you to rethink about downloading this app also rethink about voting for our president 🤯 because he thinks we are some lab rats for him to test on!!

And all I wanted to do was educate myself on the president of this country. When I opened the app it glitched and kicked me out so I had to download it again and when I did it started to play this horrible music that brought rats. And I am extremely scared of rodents. Then it started to light up my screen with this really weird voice and it turned my screen orange. So I had to delete it because it has many bugs that need to be fixed. And there are still rats at my house so I am going to need an exterminator and I am not paying for one because it was this app that brought them!!!
