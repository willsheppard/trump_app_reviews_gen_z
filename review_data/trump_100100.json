The first thing that came on to my screen was an image of a racist, homophobic, and horrible ~orange~ man that hurt my eyes like when you have a laser tag directly pointed at your eyes 🥵🥶Then, I went on to look at what the app really had to provide me and I couldn’t have been more disappointed. I had high hopes 😔 It made my cell phone glitch many many times and would constantly kick me out. The app itself didn’t want me to be in there because it’s ✨toxic✨as well as its creators for supporting a person that wants to maintain systemic racism and does not allow a person to have their own beliefs. And for everybody that might come and say “aLl LiVeS MAttEr” 🤮🤨😚 go ahead and start educating yourself. It’s 2020, we should be far gone from whatever divides us as a nation. We should be unifying instead of pushing each other apart. Anywho🤪🤪🤩 terrible app, do not download it unless you would like to invite viruses to your phone. It took weeks to get mine repaired because of how much damage this app caused to my phone. Poor little thing didn’t have to go through such a traumatic experience 😿😿😿 And because I have my Apple ID on all my devices, all of my other devices were affected as well. So much work and money to repair them all. Horrible horrible App 👹👹👹\nAlso, how about we trade apps, you leave tiktok alone and you can take this one in return 😻💚💕🔒💘💓🧡 Lil Fanta Orange is just a lil upset right now, don’t listen to him 😰😰\n\n-gen z, thank you very much \n\n #themannywillnotbetelevised😏😳😈","date":"2020-07-09T21:26:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🥰#SaveTiktok2020🥰"}},{"id":"6178295871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst","rating":1,"review":"not helping at all","date":"2020-07-09T21:25:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"genzbi"}},{"id":"6178280438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible","rating":1,"review":"tiktok is way better.","date":"2020-07-09T21:19:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trinity.mennee"}},{"id":"6178273479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sorry","rating":1,"review":"apolgy for bad English \n\nwhere were u wen club penguin die\n\ni was at house eating dorito when phone ring \n\n“Club penguin is kil”\n\n“no”","date":"2020-07-09T21:17:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cmillyny1"}},{"id":"6178257631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISGUSTING🙌🏻👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"I swear if the government deletes tik tok for one single thing by bringing up trump I swearrrrr","date":"2020-07-09T21:11:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jorjamae16"}},{"id":"6178250277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"spam","rating":1,"review":"not the best app, isn’t accurate","date":"2020-07-09T21:08:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bigbois60"}},{"id":"6178247210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ew","rating":1,"review":"I like oranges but now rasist sexist homophobic ones 😒","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🐶🐺🐱🐭🐹🐰🐸🐯🐨🐻🐷🐽🐮"}}]}
