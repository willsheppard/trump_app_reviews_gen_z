He continued to ask for my phone number. I declined reading some of the other comments about the frequent pedophilia intertwined in this app😫✋🏽. Thank you for saving me!🥺✨✨ DO NOT RECOMMEND -2/10!!! If there were 0 stars I would give it that😣😣"}},{"id":"6172914319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:34:41Z","title":"Obama is better","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🚫🧢 he eats ass","review":"THIS IS ALL ALLEGATIONS AND I DID NOT SAY THESE THINGS I WAS TOLD THESES THINGS BY A PERSON ONLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nApparently this app will make you loose brain cells.

When I tell you as soon as I downloaded this app MY POWER WENT OFF i mean it 😨. I asked my mother if it was because she didn’t pay the light bill . But she responded and said no. I was really concerned and thought to myself. Could it be? Is this app really cursed. I let that  1 coincidence of my power turning off slip . But then I kept having dreams about the app and some ninjas  and it saying “VOTE FOR TRUMP & RATE THE APP A 5 STAR” I was honestly in shock 😣. I thought to myself “it’s just my mind playing games” but then I woke up and had my breakfast and I KID YOU NOT NINJAS !!! NINJAS !!! Were at my house. Yes, not even I believed this. They were doing exactly what had happened in my dream. If I have to download this app and have these weird occurrences I will not refer this app to ANYONE. What happened to me was very bad. I would never wish anyone to go through the same . Oh my. As soon as I was about to send this review. Some unknown number called me . Of course I didn’t answer, but they kept calling me. I decided to block the number but now this other number keeps calling me. If this review even gets to send it will be very much appreciated. If I could give this app 0 stars , I legitimately would ."}},{"id":"6172912032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:33:59Z","title":"No just no","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gen z.....","review":"This was a very glitchy app. It had me put in a lot of information.Which is very concerning.i would not recommend this app to anyone.
