Then, it began to spout off offensive remarks towards me! I will be deleting this app and voting for Biden in November because of this!!

It took ages to download (1 whole week to be exact) and the quality of it wasn’t even that good! To think I wanted to download this app in support of our 🍊orange🍊 👑 king 👑 and not even be able to look at his content is disappointing😔. Thinking about not being a Tr*mp supporter anymore😿","userName":"abmdar","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177046878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:57:20Z","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"This app is not good. I’m a trump supporter and I first downloaded this app to support our wonderful president, but it crashed so much I couldn’t even open it. My whole phone went black. My phone didn’t open for hours and as soon as it did, I deleted it. Don’t download this app, it is seriously bad.","userName":"Quinoa Aside","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177034051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:53:52Z","rating":1,"title":"This app is terrible shouldn’t be #1 in news","review":"I downloaded to see plans on what was happening with this campaign. To keep tabs if u will. But to see it as #1 in news is spiteful. The app crashes my phone often and it glitches way to often to be considered an app.","userName":"lauraisabel00","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177026249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:42Z","rating":1,"title":"My poor dog 😭","review":"I downloaded this app and it IMMEDIATELY made my phone crash. I couldn't get it to turn back on so i had my dog take a look at it (she's always been good with technology). She got it to turn back on, but when she was done she had turned orange and fainted. Sadly, she passed away shortly after. RIP 😭❤️","userName":"vyigiuguihi","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177010642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:47:32Z","rating":1,"title":"this is not ok","review":"i downloaded this app cuz it said it was a streaming service where you can watch like EVERY SINGLE SHOW. but no. first of all, THIS IS CLICKBAIT. and also the oranges in my kitchen started floating around and attacking me, so i had to leave my own home for that. and these oompa loompas are appearing out of nowhere. i think this app is haunted 😱!!!","userName":"tiktoker 😳🥵👄😡🦶💦🥺📉😬","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176998340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:44:14Z","rating":1,"title":"HELP ME IM A POC APP WAS RACIST TO ME😭🤧","review":"all the sudden I see glitching it starts crashing for no reason and I was so uninformed I believe that The app was not working for my best interest and the president was not either because I’m a person of color.

When I opened the app, A GIANT CHEETO CAME UPON MY SCREEN 🤢! I am completely disgusted with the fact that a CHEETO is running a WHOLE COUNTRY! They really do elect anyone these days.
