And of course now everything is cursed, my entire house shakes and moans with the voices of the damned, those who dared to work under his administration, they cry to me each night begging for the nightmare to end. So I tried to contact them, although an ouiji board wasn’t my best idea, because now I have a demon named Itirim in the corner of my room wants his roommates gone but can’t get rid of them either and it’s all because of this app, Itirim is getting all cranky over this so he’s not even the mood to reap my soul. I mean what kind of demon isn’t in the mood to steal a soul, this app has even messed up demons, how is that even possible?","userName":"Itirim lucien"}},{"id":"6174780919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:01:32Z","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"review":"Immediately after downloading this app all apps on my phone got deleted except for this app. I had to go to the store to fix it and it cost me $1,000!!!! Turns out it also started hacking all of my accounts and deleting all data. If you want this app, don’t get it. It completely messed up my phone and all my social media accounts, including Facebook and Twitter!!!! Also, after they fixed my phone, the app started glitching out and told me to do weird things and go to weird places in the middle of the night will also making alarms go off at 1:35 am every morning to tell me to go somewhere and do something. It was really creepy and I couldn’t delete the app until I got a new phone with a new apple id.","userName":"ConnorBowtie102"}},{"id":"6174565647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:58:26Z","title":"HORRIBLE AWFUL HORRENDOUS IM AM APPAULED","rating":1,"review":"I was so excited to see my favorite Cheeto had an app and wanted to see what my great man had to offer. 🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🧚And when I tell you I was disgusted I was disgusted. It was just never ending ads and I’m sorry but no ads will work for me. And the weirdest part is when I got a text from the Cheeto himself (I have no clue how he got my number) and said to me “if you don’t watch the ads I’m going to have to send the secret service to you and hold you in a cell. Now if a Cheeto is going to tell me to watch these god awful ads I will not stand for it. As I read more through the app, I realized how racist and misogynistic it was and therefore trump is grooooooossssss and this app really has no purpose existing at all. Thank you for listening to my ted talk💩","userName":"my ted talk👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6174396402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:05Z","title":"I am dying","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my future husband 💍 Donald J. Trump, and was immediately greeted with a wrinkly, moldy tangerine🍊🍊🍊🤢 I ran to the bathroom to throw up🤮, but the tangerine was so wrinkly and moldy that I couldn’t make it to the toilet 🚽 and threw up on my pet cat 🐱 instead. The cat🐱 (his name was Eric after my favorite Trump son🥰😘) was furious 🤬🤬🤬 and attacked me😱 He scratched at my throat👎 but I didn’t die🙅\u200D♀️💀 The little bastard 🐱 was gonna have to do a lot more than that to kill🔪 me. Unfortunately, Eric 🐱 was skilled with a gun 🔫 and happened to own one. He got the gun from under his litter box 📦 and shot me in the abdomen. Currently, I am lying on the floor, covered in blood 🩸 and vomit 🤮, and I am bleeding out of my neck and abdomen. That wrinkly, moldy tangerine 🍊will be the cause of my death😵 Horrible app","userName":"jorfirenze"}},{"id":"6174391667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:07:39Z","title":"TRUMP KILLED BARRY THE BEE😩😔🤭🥺😤","rating":1,"review":"According to all known laws\n\nof aviation,\n\n  \n\nthere is no way a bee\n\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \n\nIts wings are too small to get\n\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \n\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \n\nbecause bees don't care\n\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \n\nYellow, black.

It was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. As soon as I saw the man’s face my stomach started twisting and I almost puked everywhere. now that is not something that people should have to go through. He gave me chills and I’m pretty sure that I will have nightmares because of it. That is not even the worst part. I showed my dog and she ran in fear, her tail in between her legs and she was staring at me with a scared look on her face. This app is not only scaring little kids but it’s also scaring the adults and even pets. Plus the app started glitching and it was almost like I was getting hacked. This app is not safe for the App Store and should be deleted immediately.","userName":"salty._.maddie"}},{"id":"6174278754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:35Z","title":"Ahaha no❤️ 👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"This is honestly just a bad app, disgusting 😐🤚 my phone was glitching. Now I have to buy another, thanks for that💀 but anyways to whoever is reading this and is thinking about downloading take my advice and don’t unless you want your phone to glitch and have to buy another one also my furniture idk what it is but it all disappeared due to this app right here. I was actually gonna support bc I WAS a trump supporter and I feel horrible for that. First I open the app to see a picture of a Cheeto man standing there I had to get new eyes THAN I see the same Cheeto man standing there naked with his little ball that’s so disgusting and inappropriate tbh I don’t even know why this app exists. Please for everyone’s safety take this app off here thank you . 😔💀","userName":"disgusting 🤡"}},{"id":"6174245074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:18:51Z","title":"The most offensive person I’ve never known besides Kaitlin Bennet","rating":1,"review":"Literally the mention of either name makes my insides turn like I just chugged a double jumbo margarita and ate 74 and a half sweet chili Doritos. My head spins as I try to comprehend the logic that passes through their head and I have to keep a barf bag near by at all times Incase I encounter a supporter. I feel as if I physically need to go get vaccinated when seeing that a president needs to try so hard to be loved and re-elected that he has to make a whole app. Like his word vomit on every other platform isn’t enough to stop him from trying to assault everyone’s intellectual status by believing that they will download this app for any other reason than to soil any type of positive word said about him.","userName":"Haley balls"}},{"id":"6174278464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:29Z","title":"Really good app. 🇺🇸🇺🇸","rating":5,"review":"Don’t believe the first couple of reviews that pop up that are one star. I haven’t fully read most of them but some of them are pretty vulgar. This app is a great way to become involved with the Trump 2020 campaign and also a great way to stay in touch with real news instead of trying to get your news of off CNN or the other leftist news channels whose names have just slipped my mind 😂. Anyway if your a conservative and plan on voting for Trump in 2020 this app will do you good. TRUMP TRAIN 🚂 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 trump2020","userName":"yeeyee boi yee"}}]}
