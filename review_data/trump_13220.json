When it did finally complete downloading, it had tons and TONS of false information about ‘our’ racist rapist President 🍊. And I don’t understand what the hell is wrong with the app and it has to be fix. I just want to support the orange Oompa Loompa cheeto puff president into stepping down from being president. Please do not not not fix this dumb, horrible, terrifying app. Thanks 🍊🍊.

He burnt my house down and I am now homeless without a way a worship the almighty 🍊himself. The reason y’all haven’t heard of this yet cause the only news the is on is CNN!🤮🤮I would not recommend this app ever unless you want to be homeless with several burns👎","title":"This app is evil","userName":"ZimmB22","date":"2020-07-08T20:30:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173569277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is used to help spread misinformation and help a small orange man with such a tiny ego he has to overcompensate everything he does what kind of lunatic says “well if we stop testing we would have less people show up as positive” like do you not understand that what we need to do is stay in quarantine but no all he knows is money. Money this money that but he can’t find a simple solution like just staying home","title":"This app is a catastrophe","userName":"booty-eater","date":"2020-07-08T20:09:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173566670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"absolutely the worst app ever!! it took 8 hours to download and my wifi is amazing! was gonna vote for bunker boy this year and give him a chance, but i changed my mind after this poor performance... the app crashes almost every time i try to open it, and when it does open all i see is some weird soggy-looking cheeto man that doesn’t leave me screen... absolutely horrible... this app deserves to be taken down!!!!

I would! Absolutely horrible! I was expecting an up to date information on trumps campaign and this made my phone completely break from all the glitches and bugs on this app, I had to get an entirely new phone because mine got a virus from downloading this, so essentially me AND my phone now have corona because of trump and his administrations incompetence! Horrible! DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND THIS SHOULD BE DELETED FROM THE APP STORE!

After it installed and I signed in there was a link and I pressed on it(thinking it was trustworthy) and it was a doxxed link that exploited my address everywhere. I was terrified and in the middle of the night an orange man came in my room chanting “all lives matter” and “MAGA” and proceeded to climb on top of my dog while she was yelping out of horror.  This app is not trustworthy and is built on top of white, straight male supremacy.","title":"My dog was assaulted","userName":"bdbsush","date":"2020-07-08T20:07:23Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173553456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so bad! When I’m on the app, it glitches. I always have to exit out of the app and refresh it. And even when I refresh it, it still doesn't work as well. It was so hard to register for events. I was not able to register for a single event because of the technical difficulties. This app is so bad that I would rate it a negative 1 out of five if I could. But I guess I'm just going to have to settle for a 1.","title":"App is wack!!","userName":"Cortnii81","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173539187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i wanted to support this awesome man so i downloaded it but it took FOREVER to download😩 and when it was fully downloaded it was making my phone glitch very bad and i’ve now notice well i’ve always notice💀 that he is a terrible man he is racist talking about how hispanics and blacks are thugs drug dealers rapist but he can’t talk bc he is a rapist him self and all the girls that has done the report’s ab their stories of trump touching then is true it’s not made up.","title":"Donald trump 2020 🇺🇸 but IN HELL💀","userName":"BLM & HLM","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173535861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was the absolute worst thing I’ve ever purchased. And I got an expired piece of chunky milk from a guy behind a Acme once, so you can imagine how bad it is. The music made my ears bleed, and it attracted the roaches and rats from the White House to my home. They gave my mom a disease. I even saw some of our presidents tanning powder on one of the rats. He looked like an 🍊. Worst app ever. Negative 100 out of 5. I wish I could go back in time, and stop myself from buying this app.","title":"👀👄👀","userName":"Bri2464279","date":"2020-07-08T19:58:23Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173532874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I need to speak to whoever developed this app... I can’t believe someone even got paid for the most minimal work possible. First of all, they really made an app for a racist which seems a little sus. Second of all, when I first opened the app I started getting such a weird scent from my phone that smelled like straight up fish. I didn’t know apps could smell like something but woah this app needs to be deleted.","title":"Least functioning app on the AppStore","userName":"maxcurtiss1","date":"2020-07-08T19:57:23Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
