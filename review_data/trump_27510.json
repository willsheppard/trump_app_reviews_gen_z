My phone started to glitch immediately. I assumed it was because of all the hate, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, racism that he spews daily. I couldn’t take it another minute. It’s time to ditch the app like we will ditch Trump in November. Buh-bye 👋","userName":"mackman12202007136","rating":1}},{"id":"6174121963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:33:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","review":"Shows lots of racism and hatred to people that are actually helpful to this country. I find this app very offensive and cruel. This is going to help “make America great Again” because in all honesty... America has never been great and that’s sad and it will continue to never be great because of people like Donald J. Trump.","userName":"Jomaraiz","rating":1}},{"id":"6174118447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:32:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🙈🥰💅🏽🤩❤️🧚🏽✨😘","review":"Literally as soon as I downloaded the app tump busted into my house asking if I wanted to get spray painted with him then killed my cat.

Even worse there’s a Cheeto lookin guy all over it. I thought this would change my view on things (wink wink) but nope it didn’t. Layout is awful. It spams and sends harassing emails to you as soon as you open it.  I will never use this app again.","userName":"nossila722","rating":1}},{"id":"6174107870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:28:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"I downloaded this app for funzies but then all of a sudden a whole circle of cheese blocked my screen 🙄😡😡😡 i didnt know what to do abt it so i clicked next and then my snail literally ran on its back legs towards my phone and deleted the whole app!!!!! idk what that app holds but its sonethibg demonic. it was a good thing my snail showed me the way!","userName":"reviewercourtney","rating":1}},{"id":"6174097955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:24:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever.","review":"Can’t explain all the technical difficulties I faced while on this app. Not only did this weird guys with orange skin and hair keep popping up on my page, but he kept telling me to vote for him too... gross. Deleting this app as soon as I can figure out how to stop having bad dreams about the orange guy....","userName":"user4230917739949","rating":1}},{"id":"6174087358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:20:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app don’t download","review":"it doesn’t even deserve any stars, it’s such a terrible and and it’s terrible for your kids too.

I opened it and was practically blinded when I saw the most horrifying picture I have ever seen!!! Who knew a Cheeto puff bunker boy could cause this much retina damage!!! Lock up your families because this app is worse than the duo lingo bird. It will haunt me for the rest of my life!!!","userName":"20FDT20","rating":1}},{"id":"6174044237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:04:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Just bad","review":"I started by reading the reviews about this app thinking oh this would be a good way to support the big Cheeto himself but, the reviews told me that it would steal my microwave as well as my fridge and a lot of other bad things and I need my popcorn and Pepsi so that’s why I gave it the star that it needed","userName":"main man tray","rating":1}},{"id":"6174040026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:14Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ew","review":"This app is just a FAT NO THANK YOU. First off the title is a bad word (the T word) and we do not stan that foul language. Second of all I do not want to open an app and see a Cheeto man with spaghetti noodle hair starting me in the eyes. Also his skin is droopy bc that man is a FOSSIL and had a gizzard like turkey. Need I say more. This app is HORRIBLE and I do not like the way it looks. ‼️CANCEL THE ORANGE‼️","userName":"msqueezie","rating":1}}]}
