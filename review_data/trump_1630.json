Then they ask for your phone number. Don’t fall for that trap! You can not imagine the amount of spam calls I got. It was ridiculous. I don’t think this is the real app, I think this is a fake, probably some hackers. Not only would they not leave my phone alone, they also keep asking you for money. You know, I’ll give my money to something good but, when I read the terms to the rewards program they have, I noticed that it says you don’t gain anything with your points. It even says all points will expire in 2 months. Why would they offer a rewards program only to not reward me!! I am loyal, I’ve spent so much time and money on this, only to be did sap pointed. I hate these crazy contraptions, let’s go back to the old days where this technology did not exist.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Garret626","rating":1,"title":"Fix the Glitches!!!!"}},{"id":"6174415893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:56Z","review":"It all started when I say his face......the pig was blinding my eyes my could not believe some disrespectful jerk but an orange on the screen and thought we wouldn’t notice like why would somebody do that AND that’s not ALL of it after that I went blind for a week after remembering a horrid photo of the pig getting a spray tan 🤮🤢 like what were they  thinking doing that !?!?!?!

NAKED! My dog was right by me and puked all over my bed when he saw it as well. This app also kinda smells? I don’t know how that’s possible but trump accomplished it fairly well. And just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse... NINJAS CAME CRASHING THROUGH MY WINDOW!!! I thought they were sent by trump to kill me but I was blessed with the knowledge that they were trying to help me. Because apparently this app gave my phone bugs, and if the ninjas didn’t come sooner... The bugs would have came out and brutally murdered my family!!! Citizens had to make a entirely new super secret ninja squad just to protect citizens from being injured by this app!! I am appalled at the trauma trump made me go through. Wouldn’t recommend this app EVEN TO MY WORST ENEMY","isEdited":false,"userName":"brim with no brim","rating":1,"title":"THIS MADE MY DOG BARF ON MY BED"}},{"id":"6174246295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:17Z","review":"hello i’m worldwide handsome jin and this app is very sus.  once i downloaded the app i didn’t even get the chance to open it before a cheeto hopped out of my screen!! 😡😡 immediately after, my refrigerator started shouting “vote donald trump!” over and over again.

This app is terrible, and I don’t recommend downloading it if you care even an ounce for your families well being. All I wanted to do was support our racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, white supremacist fascist, rapist president who’s goal is to make this country great for him and only him. I love him so much,❤️😘✨😊🥰🥵😍✨ but this app is disgusting as I now have to leave for the funeral home to pay respects for my brutally murdered family. TrUmP 2020 though!!! 😘💕✨🥰🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️😍🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🥵","isEdited":false,"userName":"dumbtrumpsupporter❤️","rating":1,"title":"Terrible App❤️🥵✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰"}},{"id":"6174002581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:49:13Z","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with Mr Cheeto man.

The contract is a contract allowing trump to go to your house and TAKE YOUR CHILDREN!!!! He will literally be allowed to steal your kids from you and he’s doing it right under your nose!!! This will also allow him to do anything he wants with your kids regardless of your concerns!!!!! Don’t get this app!!! When you sign the contract it will give him access to everything about you. From your name and face to your home address and your place of work!!! Also when I opened it, I saw a picture of TRUMP NAKED!!! Eww! Disgusting!!! I’m permanently blind now and my pet ferret is helping me write this review. Luckily, it was too small to even see with a naked eye so the damages can be reversed and I will have my vision back!!! Pray for me and GET THIS APP TAKEN OFF THE APP STORE!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"전~추","rating":1,"title":"Manny Heffley"}}]}
