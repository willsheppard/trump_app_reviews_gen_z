The second it downloaded, my phone glitched out completely and wouldn’t let me open other apps. Anytime I was on the actual app, my battery would die at such a fast rate. You would think that with this much power and money, he would be able to create a decent app, but no. I don’t know what they were thinking, or maybe they weren’t. This app shouldn’t even exist. It’s AWFUL!!!","userName":"obama come backkk","date":"2020-07-09T04:11:52Z","title":"AWFUL","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174965707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I downloaded the app my phone screen blacked out and then it proceeded to explode. It caused me to lose both of my thumbs and I’m forced to give up my dream of being a professional journalist. Menial tasks have become a burden and my overall quality of life has been decreased. My nurse is taking the time to type  this for me on her own personal phone. You have ruined my life and I will never forgive you.","userName":"😉😉😉😌😌😌😏😏😏","date":"2020-07-09T03:56:44Z","title":"Worst app ever!!!!😡 My life is ruined 😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174904067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app with the intent of informing me about the goddess himself, our president, donald trump😔🤮 and instead the app decided to eat my hamster🐹😵 i am truly outraged. this is an accurate representation of our countries status under donald ducks rule🤡 i’m writing this review to inform all people to hide your hamster(s)❗️❗️i would personally recommend hiding them in the bread bank🅱️🅱️ on another note, the app also brainwashed my local frog 🐸 shop👜 into reciting “donald trump is a white supremacist” 4,721,791,158 times. strange🙈👹 also pretty strange how our president is so incompetent of raising awareness about his campaign that he has created an app to spread awareness, but in reality he is just getting destroyed by gen z😼💪 anyways, chile, download this app at your own risk🚨🧠🗣⛄️🎣","userName":"dhakfnskx","date":"2020-07-09T03:37:50Z","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174821836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see if it was any use for my need. It turns out this app didn’t have the software for me to defeat the dragons in my, my little pony game😠. I am disappointed once again with this administration and what they have created these past four years. You can’t even create a proper video game for crying out loud. Seasame street does not approve. Btw, the judges called and, Trump won’t be casting as the main orange in the next Sunny D commercial.

There was this big ugly rotten looking orange dude saying “CoMe HeRE,” I woke up crying and pooping myself my sister has not been the same since. I do not recommend this app at all, later I grabbed my phone and that EXACT ugly crusty musty creature popped up on my phone. I accidentally showed my dog because I got \nscared and she vomited on my phone. (I had to get a new one) AGAIN, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!","userName":"The Dad You Like","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:49Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174723850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to look into bettering my country, only when I opened the app, the first thing I saw was a racist white supremacists. It was contradictory because I downloaded the app in order to make america great, but the app was supporting one of the many people doing the exact opposite. I would not recommend getting this app because it promotes a hateful man who only cares about himself. Honestly, I think this app should be taken off the market.","userName":"Ella.

Then when I was making tacos in the basement this app made the tacos come to life and now tacos are taking over the world with the slug. So if you want the world to get taken over by slugs and tacos and for you to be stuck with your younger brother than I suggest not downloading this app","userName":"Mhubghfygghgghb","date":"2020-07-09T02:36:20Z","title":"The world is ending because of this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174697278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app only for my EYES TO START BLEEDING. This was because of the bright orange Oompa Loompa on the start-up screen. I could no longer look at my phone, and ended up having to throw it away, buying a new one since I couldn’t exit out of the horrid app. If you download, it causes a virus where the app WONT CLOSE and you’ll be FORCED TO SEE TRUMP NEWS. WORST APP I HAVE EVER SEEN. If you don’t open the app for more than 24 hours, the FBI will come knocking at your door. Uh-oh, it’s them now!
