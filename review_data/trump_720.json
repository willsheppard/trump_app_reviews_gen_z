Oranges started pouring out of my phone, like MASSIVE oranges. Then it turned into 10 every day. I’m not sure how they popped out, but one of them broke my nose! I went to the doctors and they said that I needed surgery. After I woke up from the surgery, all I could see were oranges and topays? It was strange and I was turned permanently near-sighted from it. Then, roaches stared pouring out and saying they were trump supporters. We had to get an exterminator to get them all out. And the last thing happened today when rats set my house on fire! And then, all of their faces turned into Donald Trumps face. After all of this, I have decided to press charges against Stupid idi- I mean Donald. $6,000 for the nose, $200 for the exterminator, $150 for the glasses, $500,000 for the house, and lastly, $800,000,000 for mental damage against my entire family.","title":"Horrible app just horrible"}},{"id":"6172493462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sm)le","date":"2020-07-08T14:34:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is one of the worst apps ever! Why are we giving a proven r*pist, r*cist and h*mophobic monster more of a platform? If you think he is a good president and he should run again you truly need to re-evaluate yourself. He is trying to silence us by banning apps like tik tok and not showing what’s actually happening with the blm movement and protests. He says make America great again but I would like someone to name one time when America was great for all. Name one. There is not one time in American history where equality for all actually meant something and was real. In 1776 when the colonies claimed independence, there were still slaves!!! How can we claim independence when they were still enslaving people? America needs a better president and people in office who actually want equality for all. This app is giving Donald Trump the attention he craves yet doesn’t deserve. Thank you for being a perfect example that money can get you anywhere Donald Trump. I hate you!\n\n#blacklivesmatter\n#nojusticenopeace\n#defundthepolice","title":"STOP GIVING R*PIST PLATFORMS TO SHARE MISINFORMATION"}},{"id":"6177825170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#savet1kt0k","date":"2020-07-09T18:48:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i'm pressing the middle button of my keyboard to type random things: \n\nin the chat app and it won't work i it was a great day and i is my life and i is a great app for my friends to play it with me haha was the day it is so fun and fun to play it with my friend it just seems to like it to be fun and i just a little kid is so adorable and fun but it's fun to watch them play with him haha 😂 day i day is the day we go go back home 🏠 night i was the day you get married in it omg 😱 omg 😱 morning is the day for harry this one ☝️ i will be fun for you bruh was my birthday 🎁 is your birthday so you want us and i was the way we had it and i just was a fun night i i didn't ototiyooyoyototototot time oooyooooo is my time day off so i'm sorry 😐 is that the last night you got the food 🥘 i is that good night 🌙💤😴 was the way for you bruh was a fun night out there too haha 😂 has always happened so many people in my mind i is a fun day for harry it would  😘 i is a great 👍 is your time of day and a week from a great 👍 i hope 🤞🏻 was fun but we hate to see him in his life again so i don't get mad 😡 it happened and i just means we don't know why it was a fun day in my house and it made us so sad 😭 our season we got our love and the boys we had fun we just wanted you know how we can talk and then it's fun and i just gonna make fun i love 💕 is your birthday 🎁 is your last year for a great 👍 app i was so good 😊 i didn't you think 💭","title":"kill trump"}},{"id":"6177694850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Serena500802","date":"2020-07-09T18:09:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was on my way to show my support and it asked me to pay a 1 dollar service fee. I put in my credit card info and Got taxEd 5,000 dollars for just haviNg the app! I went back in on another phone and read the terms and agreements and realized this app was a front for a trump cult that worships Donald! It also said the 5,000 dollar fees were to be paid weekly and it would go straight to the collective account to raise enough money to fund the bomb they have planted inside the core of the earth. I would be happy to fund a worthier organiZation with the money I had raised for my fathers heart surgery but am against funding the end of the world. I am now unable to get my payments back and have resourced to selling everything in my possession other than this phone to pay for my dad’s surgery. This app has ruined my family’s life and I am now on the streets with my four kids and my addict husband. If I could give it zero I would. Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a good day","title":"This app scammed me"}},{"id":"6176987741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEF","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:21Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"He asked me for my number, Donald trump is a married man and should not be asking other women for their numbers! Also, when I deleted the app, I heard a loud, “BANG!” Outside. It was Donald Trumps private jet coming to my street. It wasn’t him though, oh no, it was his wife. She immediately asked me for my number, I gave it to her out of fear of just seeing her come out of a falling plane like a professional, it seemed like she has done that 1,347,578 other times. Once I have her my number, she then went to see if I gave it to trump. Once she saw I didn’t, because I knew he is married, she then apologized for the commotion, and left. I am still extremely confused on how her Jet was still working even after it had been crashed. It took so much money to fix my street though! We shouldn’t be paying for it, the person who did it or the person and his or her significant other should! I rate this a 0/10, and I would do 0/5 stars if I could. This app is horrible and a scam! Don’t download it!","title":"Horrible App"}},{"id":"6176983380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Laura2478974336875333","date":"2020-07-09T14:40:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app in an effort to support our great, totally not structurally racist country and as a display of my indisputable nationalism. Upon downloading, there were quite a few glitches in an app that should be a reflection of our great country. One, the content was extremely biased. If this app is supposed to represent America, the greatest nation in the world, then the app should be representative of the range of Americans that exist within the scheme of the greatest nation. Two, I thought that the app was too dependent on the political views of Trump and his futile efforts to project his political standings onto that of the American citizens. Third and lastly, I think that this app is a sick example of a gross humanitarian concern that has delayed the progression of America’s actual greatness. Nationalism and false pride will not let America become great, only an acknowledgement of the country at its present state will allow us to move forward. If we’re not constantly aware of ourselves, then pride will be our downfall.","title":"✨✨no one asked for this✨delete it cheeto✨✨"}},{"id":"6176878034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"barron trump 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T14:12:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app two years ago and it just recently installed. once I open the app they asked for my phone number right away which i thought was lowkey weird but i was like yolo and gave it to them anyways. Ever since I gave them my phone number my phones been acting up. I begin to text messages from old random number saying racist things such as that I should go back to my own country like i was born in ny babes. A strange car keeps parking in front of my house and taking pictures of it. And my cat clover has been missing for a week and she never left before in her seven years of life (if you see a black cat with blue eyes and a black collar with daisies on it plz contact me) I tried deleting the app but when I did a virus popped up and now every time i open my phone there’s a video of trump laughing at me. i mean im kinda creeped out guys like trumps stalking me and stole my cat.

The app took several days to download even though i have lots of icloud and phone storage.😡 When i first opened the app it asked me for my phone number in which i thought was completely inappropriate considering our terrible person: a man who should be in jail... excuse my language, our wonderful president is in a married relationship!! I couldn’t even manage to believe the orange 🍊 man that doesn’t give his citizens their basic human rights would ever cheat when he is in a married relationship. AnyWAYS after i put my phone number into the app it wiped my WHOLE phone. 😱 I imagine that the awful man who runs this country and quotes hitler himself would NEVER do such a thing so i got a new phone entirely just to get this app again! must have been those stupid liberals☹️☹️. 🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 MAGA!!!BUT IF I COULD GIVE THIS APP A 0 STAR RATING I WOULD!!!!🤪🥳😼🤩🧚🏽💞","title":"TERRIBLE!!!! 0/10 rating                  chocolate shop"}},{"id":"6176067753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mary_313124","date":"2020-07-09T10:24:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app you know to see my non racist homophobic president and everything was doing fine until I opened the app immediately seeing it glitch, as I was wondering what was happening...

Then this weird looking fox runs after her. I then proceed and order a ticket to move out the country after I’ve been seeing a lot of weird people showing up to my door and giving me death threats.
