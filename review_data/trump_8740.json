I am as sick as Chinese virus patient that this app doesn’t work like it states it does. I do hope my President’s team fixes these issues before they are fired. Trump is a GREAT president. The first ORANGE president. He cares so much about our people!! I just want to follow his campaign but sadly I cannot so I guess I will just have to go to TikTok to find out news about him.","rating":1,"userName":"Trumpiteer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:51Z"}},{"id":"6177384264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","review":"✨This app couldn’t be worse. ✨You aren’t even allowed to join without giving a phone number. 😾Also, the app is staged in a manner that only trump supporters are entitled to see trump information🤡Instead of staging it as an all around source, it is filled with things about ‘😹making 😹America😹 great 😹again 😹’ and other trump praising lines. 👹Do not recommend this to anyone who wants unfiltered and unbiased news👽","rating":1,"userName":"🐉🐲 dragon lover 🐲🐉","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:32:53Z"}},{"id":"6177381219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Propaganda","review":"Throughout school I learned how everyone is equal and everyone should be treated as such. This app promotes propaganda that people who are part of the lbgqt+ community are less. This app promotes ideas that people who are trans do not deserve rights and are less than another. This is completely unfair! The president of the United States and namesake of the app is using the party divide to his advantage by using the words “lying democrats.” Apple should only endorse apps that promote love of everyone! Do not let this app keep brainwashing kids!","rating":1,"userName":"blue hair libral","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:57Z"}},{"id":"6177339732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"your mom✨","review":"this app is HORRIBLE. when i opened the app i was met with a cheeto and was instantly disgusted🤢 i can’t believe such things exist this should be a sin to society. Also, the app would keep crashing a numerous amount of times and it even crashed when i tried to download it😾 the nerve. the app also keeps asking for my location and number when i decline to give it out something needs to be done about this ASAP just take down the app in general 😌🤭✨😻","rating":1,"userName":"jmoney$haw","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:19:53Z"}},{"id":"6177336970","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😩🙄🔥🔥🔥👩\u200D💻","review":"This app took 3 weeks to download. Once it finally downloaded and I was able to access resources to understand information for the Trump 2020 campaign, I discovered the overall design for the app was soooo bad. The circle ‘T’ icon has triggered my vertigo and I ended up throwing up all over my floor, bathroom, and cabinets. I was not expecting to experience this LEVEL of nausea! I think as a public health safety precaution this app should be taken down before it triggers all our vertigo!!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Nausea inducing","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:19:05Z"}},{"id":"6177316586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"don’t get this app, waste of your time!","review":"okay so i got the app to be more educated and “ in the loop”. The app downloaded surprisingly quickly but as soon as i opened it it stayed on the loading page for 20 MINUTES. the problem had nothing to do with my internet and once it got past the home screen, it glitches and closed the app🙄. So naturally i waited AGAIN. 20. MINUTES. and THE SAME THING HAPPENED! this app is AWFUL!!!!!  i hope the donald didn’t waste very much money on this🍊❤️🍊","rating":1,"userName":"yourmom201905","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:13:28Z"}},{"id":"6177180189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"my cat is now dead😔😭😭😭😈","review":"as soon as I opened this app laser started shooting out of my phone my house is destroyed and burned down to the ground in my cat got hit by one of the lasers and now it’s dead. Trump needs to fix this he has so much money he can get over here and buy me a new houseAnd cat. But if he doesn’t that just shows how conceited and rude he really is but even if he did I still think he’s conceited and rude. see how this works. also Donald Trump is a white supremacist. OK thanks for your time byeeee! ❤️","rating":1,"userName":"Critque #bulls**t","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:34:18Z"}},{"id":"6177158529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bugs and Crashes","review":"As soon as i logged on to the app, i see a spider in the corner of my room, first sign. The second sign is that I hear that Donald got into a car crash. Then the screen loaded, only to take me to a facetime with donald!! I wish you could spit through cameras :(. he told me that i got a d in social studies, when i really got a c. next, i saw him die in the hospital. the nurse told me his funeral would be on a few years, and to call back then. this is the weirdest game on the app store.","rating":1,"userName":"doehrms","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:09Z"}},{"id":"6177149276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"CAUSED DEATH TO A NEWBORN BABY","review":"as you can see by the title, the app is very dangerous. i went to open the app while holding my newborn sister in my arms when we saw the most horrific sight. there was a large awful looking orange man that sent my sister into a SEIZURE 😤😤😤. the seizure caused trauma and brain damage to her and she died 10 minutes later. i will NOT be using this app again nor do i recommend it to anyone else. i thought this was supposed to be for a presidential campaign not a scary game. smh #dontsupport #stillsoftish #savebarron🙄🙄","rating":1,"userName":"livinlikelarry505","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:25:36Z"}},{"id":"6177127569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS WAS THE WORST APP IVE EVER SEEN🤬😡","review":"i was really excited to look what our president had planned but i didn’t know this was a horror app because i saw this really ugly fat homophobic racist orange man looking at me i was frightened anyway i got so scared that i fell on top of my lego dream house you we pay for this orange. after that i wanted to keep looking at the app i got over my fear and opened it again but all of a sudden there was dora the explore theme song playing \ni was jamming out until my dog at my croissant so this app was a nightmare","rating":1,"userName":"roblix girl that is annoyed","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:19:34Z"}}]}
