I feel like this app is just a scam they are just trying to take out money away when this orange Cheeto already has a lot of it !! he also doesn’t even use it for América he uses it for power -.-  this app was so slow and didn’t not work at all it took like 4 hours to download and I thought maybe it’s just my internet so I tried to download the app tiktok (amazing app) and it downloaded in less than a minute. when it finally download it did not load and took up so much space up !!!

Well it all started when I downloaded this app. *rewind rrrRrrrRrrr* I downloaded this app, because I heard it gave you free Cheetos. Who can say no to that? But no, I was wrong. Once I downloaded this app, a orange hand grabbed me by me throat through the screen, choking me. Unable to breathe, I tried hard to fight it. But it pulled me into the app. I woke up, confused, to see a whole bunch of people shouting “BLUE LIVES MATTER” (they were white btw) I got up, trying my best to understand the situation, that’s when I heard a familiar scream. AHHHH it said, it sounded like my son and daughter, who I may or may not actually have but for the sake of this review I do. Donald Duck was kidnapping my children! I rushed, scream, cried out. But then I tripped and bumped my head and woke up back in my room. However I still can’t find my kids. Please. Bring me back my kids 😪😓","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:14:09Z","title":"I want my kids back"}},{"id":"6177231577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"EmoEmmeWemmeM&M","isEdited":false,"review":"Immediately when I downloaded this app my phone crashed. I thought it was nothing but it kept crashing all day. Even when I went into different apps like instasnap and chatgram my apps were crashing. It was really really weird. All I wanted to do was educate myself on how our president is OBVIOUSLY running our country so flawlessly. But I was unable to do that. And Before you say it might be my phone... I know it is not because I have a new iPhone. (The XR) and I have only had it for 1 year. And my phone has never done anything like this ever. And on top of it all.... when I tried to delete the app, really weird things started happening. I heard extremely racist and sexist words in my mind. And a voice was telling me not to delete it or something really bad will happen to me and my family if I do.\nPLEASE save yourselves and DO NOT DOWLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:48:55Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6177177205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Collette Wood","isEdited":false,"review":"i got this app because me and my family used to support trump, so i wanted to see what his plans where for his election and the coronavirus. let me just say it now, everything is a spam, it barely has any information on it and he doesn’t even have good plans for the future or now! he is just so irresponsible and a jerk. now me and my family do not support him at all. do not get this app, it’s pure trash and everything in it is fake and just a spam. by the way trump don’t mess with gen-z:) trying to take away our tik tok when that’s all where on because where tired of the politics and riots, or racism you can’t control. good luck trying to stop us, we know what’s right for this world because we have almost lived through everything that can go wrong in the world and it’s only been a few years. #canceltrump2020 #bantrumpfromtwitter","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:33:26Z","title":"Terrible!"}},{"id":"6176838794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Crazycake337","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened this I was greeted with a horrible photo of a discussing man, and honestly found it very offending. Even after I waited months for this app to download it kept interrupting my viewing with adds to donate to an organization that wanted to stop using cars to travel and use whales instead.  On another note my friend had this add and she was using it so much that she just couldn’t look away, this caused her to be hit by a car. So thanks for taking away my best friend😞😖.  Oh and another thing I have seen what this app can do to the mind. I know that many trump supporters have this app and I have seen that because of this app they have gain a strong sense of entitlement and seem to think the murder of innocent people is something to turn a blind eye to. So in conclusion I must say that this app will cause nightmares for many and sometimes even death.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:02:04Z","title":"Worst app ever✨🎊👏"}},{"id":"6176808631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"zuko's left eye 👁👄🔥","isEdited":false,"review":"This app took all day to download. Then when it finished downloading I opened the app to see a very demonic looking Cheeto puff man. The app then proceeded to start chanting words that I could not understand. My imaginary dog then starts to levitate and start chanting with it. It was like a scene straight out of supernatural. Naturally, I tried to close that app to make it stop but it would not allow me to do so. Instead it started saying “ if you don’t vote for trump you will die!!!” I honestly thinks he need to get a better threat because I would rather end my self then vote for the Cheeto puff man. My friend then ran upstairs to see why I was screaming. I started to show her what was on my phone but then she went into shock. When I finally figure out how to close out the app I find out that everything on my phone has been wiped. I do not recommend this horrible app to anyone.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:54:05Z","title":"Terrible app"}},{"id":"6176045356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Spac3Unicorn101","isEdited":false,"review":"I was looking for a way to support my TOTALLY not racist or homophobic or misogynistic president so I downloaded this app. BIG MISTAKE!! This app took DAYS to download. When it finally downloaded, I opened it and guess what? My entire phone got hacked!! My whole camera roll was replaced by pictures of trump!! He may be TOTALLY not racist or homophobic or misogynistic but he’s definitely not a looker💅🏼I mean, why would I want to look at an old, crusty, orange? So of course I wanted to delete the app but then I see through my window that trump himself suddenly appeared in my backyard!! He was screaming something about making America great again. Lol does it look great to you? He spent no longer than two minutes in the scorching Arizona heat before cursing at everything claiming to be in hell. Honey, if you were in hell you would be sitting on the throne and Satan would be bowing at your feet😌✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:16:51Z","title":"🚫❌DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!❌🚫"}},{"id":"6175972724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Teen with a brain✌🏻😙✌🏻","isEdited":false,"review":"I live in California 🎡🎢🎠and I am a curious teenager 💁🏻\u200D♀️🙋🏻\u200D♀️who just lovessss 😘hearing the news about the country and what was happening to all people living here.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? i don’t want my private information in the hands of the government, i’m disgusted that they even asked. but i let it slide because i will do anything for 😍daddy donald, so i enter a fake number and continue on my way. but as soon as i am logged onto the app, i hear a knock on my door. i answer the door and immediately vice president pence comes inside my house and kills my family!!!! i love ❤️donald but this is just TOO MUCH😡😡😡🤚🤚after that i tried to delete the app but for some reason there’s no delete button!! it’s stuck on my phone and will not come off no matter what i do!!! in conclusion, this app was a nuisance to my life and i will NEVER forgive vice president peenis or donald ever again.

Turns out, it was Harry Styles dressed in a Barney costume! After I convinced him to sing the Barney theme song with me he agreed to resign from his position as head of the fbi firm to run away with me to the Lost City of Atlantis. We rode whales through the deep abyss to finally reach our new home only to find out it had been destroyed. The app was listening to us the whole time and overheard our plan to run away, so they what us there and destroyed what we loved most in order to force us to work for them again and do their dirty work for them. Please, save yourself and DO NOT download this app under any circumstances 😚","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:30:20Z","title":"Do not trust it :/"}}]}
