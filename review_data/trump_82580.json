THE APP GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS. the cheeto then chased me around my house until i finally snuck behind it and locked it in a cooler. i traveled near and far to every technology store and no one could help. until one day i met a creepy old man a bus stop saying he could help me. he wore a large coat and i could barely even see his face. he took me to a lair of some sort in his house and told me to set the cooler on the table, so i did. but that’s when he locked the door as i turned my back to him in order to set the cheeto on the table. i heard the lock click. he had locked me in there for two weeks until i used my last toe nail clipping to carve a hole through the large brick wall. i then managed to slip myself through the hole when DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CAME IN. i peeked through the hole i created, after i had wiggles myself outside. he then saw me and unleashed the mini cheeto, that use to be my phone. i ran and ran, while trump and the rest of his cheeto army ran after me until i hopped on a boat barely making it away. TRUMP HAD KIDNAPPED ME. this never would have happened if i didn’t download the app. i’m still on the run from this man so DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want to have the same experience as i did.","userName":"noo bruhh","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178034417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤡✨🍃","date":"2020-07-09T19:55:21Z","review":"This is for Trump 🤡you big f*t white n*sty smelly f*t b**ch. 🤢Why you tryna ban TikTok? 😪That’s my only source of living 😳you trifling dirty 🤬white racist 🧚🏻a** big f*t b**ch.🙅\u200D♀️ oompaloopa body 🍊a** b**tch👹","userName":"jalsnekkgnc","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178017967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible horrible app","date":"2020-07-09T19:49:52Z","review":"This app is very offensive too all besides white males \nSave Barron trump","userName":"smartliberalwoman12","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177998662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"literally the worst","date":"2020-07-09T19:43:35Z","review":"the app made my phone ✨glitch✨ and 🧚🏻crash🧚🏻. 10/10 would not recommend.","userName":"not a fan of the 🍑","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
