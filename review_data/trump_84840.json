BIG MISTAKE. it took me to a screen with our unproblematic, handsome, non racist, non homophobic, lovely cheeto of a president standing there waving at god knows what. can you believe that he asked ME for MY phone number? who is he to think that he deserves such a godly cluster of numbers? i immediately deleted the app. a week later i kept seeing big black SUV’s following me around everywhere. i began to get suspicious of my situation and actually ended up approaching one of the cars. suddenly, Hotch and Reed hopped out of the SUV and pulled me in. they told me that the trump administration was after me because i deleted his app. they explained that they did not want to work for this god awful man, but that it was the only way to earn money these days. they continued to explain his plan for my execution that should have taken place yesterday, but did not due to unforeseen circumstances (i created an army base as my home and my soldiers are trained to fire there Minecraft Tridents and any orange looking man with many body guards.) i am now living in my luxurious mansion with my husband Rodrick and his brother Greg Hefley!! if i could rate this app 0 stars, i would, but unfortunately 1 is the best i can do. please take this review into consideration and DELETE THIS APP!!!","userName":"Dogs+Wifi=❤️👌🏻","date":"2020-07-09T09:42:56Z","title":"do not get this app!! ✨","isEdited":false}}]}
