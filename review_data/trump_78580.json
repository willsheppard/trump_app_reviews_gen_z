When I downloaded the app the first red flag was my phone got softer. I don’t know how to describe it, but within a few minutes after downloading my phone was noticeably softer, and sort of slimy. It left a residue on my hands, it was quite filmy. I didn’t think much of it at first, but after a while I was able to bend my phone and ring out the juice. That wasn’t the worst part, after about an hour my phone was getting very hot and started to burn my hand. But that’s not even close to what happened inside of the app. To sort of outline the user experience, when you first open the app you’re greeted with a video or a horse giving birth. It’s quite graphic and uses a lot of close ups. There is a narration of Trump sort of describing what’s happening, and giving his opinions. (Spoiler: he really, really likes the video.) Trump goes on to tell an anecdote about him riding a horse and becoming so enthralled with the experience that he actually legally married that horse. But to get back to the user experience, the thing that I thought was odd was the fact that it asked me to send photographs of my feet for “presidential records.” Of course I obliged, but then the app asked for more “exciting photographs.” I drew the line there and didn’t go through with it because I was already wildly uncomfortable with sending pictures of my feet in the first place. After a few weeks of using the app on a daily basis, the issues with my phone didn’t go away. It was still slimy and squishy, but I started to develop this rash on my hands from it. The rash at first was typical inflammation and a little itching but after about a week I started getting these large blisters filled with pus on my hands. Every 6 hours or so one would pop, so I had to make sure that I had tissues near me at all times. I went to the doctor and they are confused by it, and they said they have never seen anything like it. I used to be a trump supporter, but after this experience I will not vote for someone who gives me rashes on my skin. Looks like I will have to vote for a stupid liberal. Trump, you took the L big here.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173532807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:57:21Z","title":":(","isEdited":false,"userName":"Still Musically Lover","review":"please don’t take tiktok. it’s like another home there and someone og is need it to escape our own lives and make new friends. but if you do, karma will get you trump ❤️like literally. so please, i beg you not to ban it.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173517086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:50Z","title":"WORST app!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"😂😭🤗😝😜🐼👀👍🏽🦄","review":"This app made my phone glitch so bad.
