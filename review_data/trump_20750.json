It keeps making my phone crash and it’s really sucky 😔 I’m afraid it also has fake news and will make the people who trust it stupid.

The app simply didn’t have anything going for it. It has poor marketing and it is a terrible and childish way to advertise a campaign. Also Trump deserves to be taken out of office immediately.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178309705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:30:36Z","rating":1,"title":"WORST ALL KNOWN TO EXISTS","userName":"msnsndnssnskns","review":"why would you make an app about a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, rapist, ugly ~orange~ . not only is he ugly, but his coo chile STANK . i won’t support a president who says he would date his daughter 👁👄👁 . and all u dumb trump supporters ALWAYS justify his actions. all he cares about is white supremacy, he even retweeted about white power. and you blind supports wanna justify that 😳 .

It took forever to download and don’t even get me started on how it promised me that my dog would start talking if I downloaded it. So I did. Worst mistake ever! If I could I would give this app a 0 out of 5 stars. Now before all the round tangerines come download the app, don’t! Lana Rhodes won’t show up alright ! It’s a scam!

Constantly crashing, I always get notifications that I don’t want like “grab em by the pu**y”, and “PRESENTATIONAL HARASSMENT”\nI don’t know if this app is even worth downloading, maybe it’s the Chinese or Russians trying to hack into our systems and control our minds.
