Then my 😿was itchin and burnin just like our lord and savior peaches says and it stunk so bad the stench killed my pet crocodile. I then felt the thing that crawled out of my phone come out of my🐱. Out of a moment of desperation and the stench of my 🐱becoming so horrid I fainted and the animals behind my house all came to help me but the stench also took their life's. When I woke up I called animal control and by the afternoon they were gone the itchin and burnin that I felt did not stop but since peaches said it was normal and I not believe in taking showers I let it pass but I was on my last straw when roaches started crawling out of my 🐱. Thanks to Donald Trump I lost my best friend Mr.Whiskers, got stds and killed a whole forest of animals. PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF THE APP store it is a danger to ANYONE who downloads it.","title":"Gave me herpes and killed a whole forest of animals😷🤒","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:07:10Z","userName":"end ggle clssroom","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173386904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"All🥶of😳this😑drama😤going🤮on🤭is😓because🤬i😐kissed💋nessa🤢when🙄we😬were🤥both😠single🖕","title":"I hate trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:07:06Z","userName":"donald trump is a dumbutt","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173385931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"bdjdnsosjan 🥺🤑🥺🤧😽😻😽🦄😽😿😶🥳😿🤰🏽🙄🐱🥳🦄🥳😿😿⛓😿🥳😶🤣🐱😃🦄😁","title":"😿🐱🤩😺🦄🥰👋🏼💪🏽🤧😶😸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:06:45Z","userName":"69 year old 🐱","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173385820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app to keep up on everything that Trump was having planned and the second I opened the app it said and I kid.you.not.

They had a whole section for how to get free icecream. So I clicked and it asked for my address, so I gave it to them and then it said “just kidding, no icecream for you”. I feel attacked because I was looking forward to free icecream, but no icecream for me sadly. And also, my mom made my soup today, but it’s so hot outside, so I’m like... why would you make me soup. But I also have a sinus infection, so I guess I get it. But anyway. This app told me to send it a picture of me for my profile picture, and then it said “error, you look overweight”. I am deeply offended and I feel disgusted. I’m not overweight. Obese maybe. But not overweight. And it said I \nshould do my makeup, so I did and then it said that “it looks like I was going to a cheap wh*re show”. Really disgusting app of you ask me.","title":"A REAL REVIEW FROM A REAL PERSON","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:06:08Z","userName":"It's gooooooooooooooooooooood","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173383200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Trash trash trash trash trash trash","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:05:49Z","userName":"trash only if its trash","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173382499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app made my phone lag and glitchy the orange rapist we call our president does not deserve a full app.BLM,LGBTQ matter Hispanic lives MATTER .","title":"Disgusting oranges🤬","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:05:34Z","userName":"orange rapist hater🍯","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173382285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When the app took my phone number and didn’t send a code.

It first of all took days to download. It says it only takes a small amount of storage but they ARE WRONG. it’s took half of it up like SERIOUSLY 😒. Not to mention the app it’s self is pretty glitchy and it made my ENTIRE PHONE GLITCH. It gave me a virus too. DO NOT GET IT, IT WILL GIVE YOU A VIRUS TO YOUR PHONE!! Not to mention a picture of momo came up expect no momo was a little to orange 💔 for his regular color. Oh my sister said it was just trump. Mb. Oh and my sister thanks to this app’s  stupid music which is so bad. And the music is HIGH FREQUENCY DO NOT GET IT IF YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE EARS. IT WILL HURT YOU AND YOUR PETS. My sister and my dog have to have hearing ads now. THANKS ALOT STUPID CHEETO GUY. trump calls him self a president idk why he’s not even good he’s terrible no one likes him except for boomers and not even the good kind the ugly, old, fat ones. And way we can’t blame him. HOPE THIS HELPS :))","title":"This is the worst 🤢🤢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:05:24Z","userName":"paris espinoza","isEdited":false}}]}
