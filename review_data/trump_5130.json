She kept yelling at me saying I was on private property. She then jumped on me and bites me, now I have an undying urge to not mind my own business. After her biting me she roundhouses my 4 yr sister and uppercuts my dad into the roof. I was not trying to be rude but I accidentally pushed her out of the window and she got hit by a police car. After I tried to delete the app the FBI showed up n accused me of being an alien spy from mars. Now I am hiding from the law.... long story short don’t download the app it is very outrageous. Thank you for your time.","title":"Instructions very unclear","isEdited":false,"userName":"mrs.

As it was downloading the app, it had asked to take control of my screen. So I pressed ok and my screen went totally black so I couldn’t see. After my screen turned back on it then proceeded to flash Red ,white and blue for at least 20 mins. When the little light show was done I opened the app for it to then ask me to put in my credit card information. I put it in and proceeded to check out the app when i get a call from my bank the all of the money has been taken out of my account all but $0.69 cents. So disappointed don’t try the app.","title":"🕶🕶🕶🕶🕶🕶✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿","isEdited":false,"userName":"my mom374747","date":"2020-07-08T17:45:07Z"}},{"id":"6173101635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Ok..where to start. First I am not a trump supporter and I hate this man with a burning passion. He is racist and homophobic and doesn’t believe in equal rights. I honestly don’t know what trump even made an app. I hope he doesn’t become president for another 4 more years. I could name many many reasons why I don’t like him because he is a cry baby that always just wants his way and just rambles on and only wants to do what he wants to do and fires people just because he feels like it. He is just a terrible “president” in general. I only did this because I am trying to help take down this app on ny behalf of tiktok.","title":"Worst app ever dowbloaded","isEdited":false,"userName":"Awsomenes2016😎😎","date":"2020-07-08T17:33:19Z"}},{"id":"6173079173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i’ve always been a HUGE trump supporter so when i saw he had an app i had to get it! i laid down in my trump 2020 blanket and prayed that all the black lives matter protesters went to jail while the app downloaded. then, horror struck. a ferocious pack of lions wearing mags hats stormed through my door. they ripped of my family’s heads and destroyed my room. i jumped on the lions back and rode it till i arrived at the white house. i was then kidnapped by the president himself and tortured for days in his bunker. he carved “fake news” into my left arm while screaming racial slurs. i write this review with my last dying breath, please don’t download this app.","title":"this app is a disaster!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"ellabutz","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:03Z"}},{"id":"6172955765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was sooo excited to get Mr. Hot Cheeto’s app 🥰.

I haven’t even been able to stay in the app for an full 5 minutes before it flashes like crazy. This app is so buggy and so not worth all the time I spent waiting around for it to download. You really need to put a flash warning on this app because many other reviews say it flashes too. I wasted my time with this app and other people as well. Hopefully people will read the reviews before trying to download this horrible app.","title":"Horrible app do not waste your time!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"JustTryingToHelp☺️","date":"2020-07-08T15:01:07Z"}}]}
