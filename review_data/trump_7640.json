When I downloaded this app, I was expecting trumpets! Instead, I got a weird looking Oompa Loompa man?! Even worse, I heard this app sells all of your information to RUSSIA!! It also makes your guns, and confederate flags disappear! I’m honestly shocked that Apple would support an app like this, it’s taking away our constitutional rights! Also, the moment I downloaded it, a mask appeared on my face, which caused me to STOP BREATHING!! I swear, if you download this app you will regret it.","title":"Scam!!!!"}},{"id":"6177646567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:53:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"no approval it succ","rating":1,"review":"once i opened this app my pet frog jumped on top on my phone to hide what was on the screen. my pet horse then told me to buy the trump dump app and now i’m addicted! instead of getting this waist of space get the trump dump app. even my pet dinosaur said she loves it!! the bad thing about this app is that is created a virus on my tv and rick roll started playing. i decided to get wendy’s and they were out of stock of the bigmacs because this app bought them all and waisted it! very bad, i recommend you don't get this app.","title":"⚠️ DO NOT INSTALL I REPEAT DO NOT INSTALL ⚠️"}},{"id":"6177615744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:43:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"SpanishBren","rating":1,"review":"You see I downloaded the app and my one legged godfather K’nuckles finally came home riding on a whale. He was wearing a MAGA hat. I couldn’t believe my eyes. He was coming to take me and not just take me his whale ATE ME! I haven’t seen daylight since then. I can only image this turn of events is from downloading the app. I must be on the coast of Florida, bear Mar A Lago I smell Cheeto. I have be struggling to keep hold of it’s uvula as I do not speak whale to ask it to let me free. I warn you DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP or this may happen to you.

However, when I opened the app all I saw were violent Neanderthals screaming incoherent phrases 😵, not our glorious leader spreading the values of America 🇺🇸. I think the devs made a mistake labeling this app 😬: it should be called “Paleolithic simulator” and not “Official Trump 2020 App” - this is an unacceptable mistake! 😤 I guess if you’re wondering what the world looked like a million years ago in the absence of morals, empathy, cultural understanding, and scientific logic this is the app you’re looking for! 🤷\u200D♂️","title":"Paleolithic era simulator, not official Trump app?"}},{"id":"6177433394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:47:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lebron 🥱💯🔌🍃","rating":1,"review":"I’ve honestly never witnessed such an abomination. This app is honestly just ghetto overall and should never be observed by any living organism. This app genuinely makes me gag and want to projectile vomit every time I open it. please remove it from the face of the earth before i launch myself into orbit. This app radiates the same odor as my cats booty after she takes a dump. Pretty wretched if you ask me. Sickening even. I can feel myself begin to perish slowly each time that I lay my eyes upon the horrid icon that is this app. #neverthat #vomit","title":"THIS APP MAKES ME GAG VIOLENTLY"}},{"id":"6177398754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yuckyorangecheeto","rating":1,"review":"this app is HORRIBLE. if I was able to I would give it 0 stars. upon opening the app I was greeted by an absolute CHEETO and I later discovered he is both a racist and a rapist. anyways the Cheeto must have startled my phone because it began flying around my room and ramming itself into the wall attempting to clear its memory of the HORRIFYING picture. I now have several holes in my wall that I can not afford to fix. i do not blame my phone, as I would have done the same thing. It’s this app. It’s brainwashing us. that’s a no from me. yeah❤️","title":"YUCK"}},{"id":"6177371209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:28:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sarah Helstrom","rating":1,"review":"Just tried to download this to learn more about this year’s presidential candidates and my goodness this is a poorly built app. It crashes every two minutes. It’s incredibly difficult to navigate. It pings my phone with notification nonstop. When I leave it running in the background it makes all of my other apps super slow. Do not download this app if you can help it. Get your info on candidates from reputable news sources, not partisan applications that don’t even work.","title":"Glitchy UX"}},{"id":"6177241435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:51:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lime.69","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to support our 🍊president🍊but the first thing it asked me was for my phone number.

As soon as i entered they asked for my phone number i am 2 years old i think it’s extremely inappropriate for the president to ask for my number when i am significantly younger than him. after i put in my number they kept texting me asking for feet pics. my feet r super tiny. that’s disgusting that he would ever do that. this is why i support kanye west for president 2020. please do not download he tried harassing me when i am a tiny child","title":"don’t download"}}]}
