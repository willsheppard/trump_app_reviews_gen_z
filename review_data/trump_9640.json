It gave me nightmares 😭😭. Then also somehow THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN IT DID AFTER I CLOSED THE APP. The orange then came to my house LOOKING DISGUSTING. It said “don’t 🍊 vote 🍊 for 🍊 the 🍊 orange 🍊 disgusting 🍊 Cheeto 🍊 puff!” AND I THINK NO ONE SHOULD. 😭😭 save yourself and don’t download this app. 😪 unless you want to rate it 1 star 💗 #blacklivesmatter #taketheorangeoutoftheoffice #genzisstrongerthanyouthink!"}},{"id":"6171418976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"News? Nope","date":"2020-07-08T09:02:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bev86","review":"The fact that this app is in the news category is as insulting to anyone with a working definition of the word news.  I would imagine that Trump supporters would be insulted by how this app underestimates their intelligence but they HAVE heard him speak and still are going to vote for him so I don’t have much hope that this pathetic app will even phase them.  Uninstalling immediately because I don’t want this app or administration having access to my phone."}},{"id":"6165283511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Delete this app!!!!","date":"2020-07-06T19:29:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"User#42628919919283773","review":"I downloaded this app to see our orange 🍊wonderful president.

I, of course, did so because I’m willing to support our beloved Cheeto pedo...Oops! I meant president! Anyways I put in my phone number and as soon as I did the lights in my house started flashing and I heard strange noises. I decided to ignore them but they started to get louder. Eventually heard moaning that sounded like it was saying “Black lives matter.” I was terrified. Maybe if I delete the app these sounds will stop."}},{"id":"6145975448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-01T22:48:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Marher25","review":"Really sketchy app, it has so many bugs and will get you a virus into your phone that you won’t be able to get rid of, once you enter the app it will ask for all your personal information and hack into your accounts DO NOT GET THIS APP also paranormal stuff has happened since I downloaded this app I keep getting nightmares with this crazy Cheeto puff corn hair monster and it has haunted me for so long and can’t get rid of these horrendous nightmares I repeat DO NOT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6145889011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Delete this app 2020 🇺🇸","date":"2020-07-01T22:13:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"maritzavv","review":"So I downloaded the app because many people have been saying they seen Cheetos flying in their rooms so I’m a Cheeto lover and decided to get it since I love Cheetos, as soon as I open the app i saw a big orange with the American flag behind it, I DROP MY PHONE BECAUSE I GOT SCARED AND NOW ITS CRACK 😡 and not only that I’ve been having Cheetos nightmares and that the big orange won the 2020 election 😤 THIS APP IS A CURSE I DONT RECOMMEND and if  I could I would’ve gave it 0 stars rate 🤬p.s I don’t like orange Cheetos anymore because of this app!!! 🤢🤬"}},{"id":"6141251138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Gave me a virus Bad quality hard to use don’t recommend stupid and paranormal","date":"2020-06-30T19:56:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bella__b","review":"As soon as the app said open my dog started  barking like crazy for no apparent  and my younger brother started cry after falling off the couch and then hurting his finger this app is not recommended and please be careful I’m deleting this app also gave me some sort of virus and my phone started getting really hot and glitching just wanted to inform anyone trying to get this app DONT The virus almost broke my phone"}},{"id":"6138618136","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"-10/10 do not recommend","date":"2020-06-30T05:50:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Edit4life","review":"water🌊\nearth🌏\nfire🔥\nair💨\nLong ago⏱the 4 Nations🌎lived together👩\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦in harmony🎶Then, everything changed when the Fire🔥Nation attacked.
