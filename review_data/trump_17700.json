This is one of the worst apps i have every gotten. Not only is it annoyingly slow, but it’s also super hard to find the stuff you want. Worst app here.","userName":"Aless7777777","isEdited":false,"title":"✨absolutely not✨"}},{"id":"6177124391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:42Z","rating":1,"review":"this app was TERRIBLE! it made my phone glitch, cause my all my apps to malfunction, AND deleted all of my music. now i know what your thinking, “how do you know it was the apps’ fault?” because as SOON as i voted the app out my phone was fine. it took a while for everything to go back to normal, but my vote to GET RID OF TRUMP helped my phone eventually😌💃🏽✨","userName":"bonfire bonnie","isEdited":false,"title":"this app causes MAJOR problems"}},{"id":"6177012992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:48:10Z","rating":1,"review":"The app spams me all the time. It really does spam a lot though. The sky has a never ending mind but it was just because you didn’t happen and you have never had any more friends. Yes please do you want to know what about me and I have to go get my car now I. If you read it up to here.

There were no such pictures. 0 stars.","userName":"WhereRTheN00ds","isEdited":false,"title":"I Heard There Were Nudes"}},{"id":"6176966132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:30Z","rating":1,"review":"I’m all for supporting a candidate but I feel like we all know politicians aren’t 100% perfect, on both sides. With that being said this app only posts articles and videos praising Trump and it doesn’t actually show you any of his policy. The app isn’t worth it and it forces you to sign up to his text chain where he constantly asks you to donate. Don’t download.","userName":"collin_shotwell","isEdited":false,"title":"Superrr biased"}},{"id":"6176956292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:32:55Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to remain up-to-date on the various events and news surrounding Trump’s campaign. However, upon opening and putting in my phone number, the app crashes. I restart my phone and bam! The same exact thing happens. Very disappointed. Expect better things from a boy worth billions.","userName":"ReviewerThatCares","isEdited":false,"title":"An app much like our president.. malfunctioning"}},{"id":"6176933161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:47Z","rating":1,"review":"This app was one of the slowest and underdeveloped apps I’ve seen. I open up the app and it immediately showed a clown at the center of the screen. Idk if that meant it was out of service or was completely dysfunctional as an app  or that there is someone uneducated and willing to put orange makeup on with a wig. It shocked me so much that I had to delete the app before it gives me a virus.","userName":"Pinto.Bean.03","isEdited":false,"title":"What kind of f****ery is this"}},{"id":"6176927085","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:11Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is a complete disaster. Not only does it glitch out whenever you try to open it, it functions like a app for kids from 2007. In addition, you cannot use the app without signing up for constant nagging emails that, after examination, actually use psychological tactics and often downright lie. Will never use the app again.","userName":"platform bed","isEdited":false,"title":"Complete Disaster"}},{"id":"6176922660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:24:02Z","rating":1,"review":"It’s not good it glitches way to much for me and I hope it gets a 1 star review and it gets taken of by apple I hate it and I think it should be taken of and it will give you some type of virus on your phone and IT WILL GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES SO DONT DOWNLOAD IT BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN😨😣🙁it’s a very bad app and if there was a 0 stars and that meant it was the worst app ever I would give it that🥱😐😑","userName":"maxattck321","isEdited":false,"title":"Hope Apple takes of"}},{"id":"6176912996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:33Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with MY PRESIDENT but I’ve found that it’s been taken over by tik tok?? I don’t know what that is but this app has really became an awful thing. It crashes all the time and it always has information on it that contradicts itself. I don’t understand.
