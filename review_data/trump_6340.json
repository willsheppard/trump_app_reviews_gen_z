I downloaded this app to support MY president, but there were SO many glitches and bugs in the application 😖. The app kept randomly closing when I was trying to register for an account. Unfortunately, due to the unfortunate technical problems, I was not able to create a profile to support MY president. As an American and as a CHRISTIAN, I have to say this is unacceptable. Had technology been this “advanced” in Abraham Lincoln’s day, he simply would not have allowed this to happen. You have LOST MY VOTE, Mr President!!! 😡","date":"2020-06-25T21:57:32Z","userName":"ev1222"}},{"id":"6177908575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"App doesn’t work","review":"As a reformed republican I downloaded the app so I could stay ~informed~ but I had to give the app my phone number to login. Now I get texts from our orange dictator all the time and I clicked unsubscribe but somehow I was also signed up for other orange lists so I had to unsubscribe from multiple lists. The app is rated #1 for news which is concerning, because when I open the app there is almost nothing worth reading. The only redeeming quality about this app is the comical surveys that they are constantly churning out.","date":"2020-07-09T19:14:10Z","userName":"reformed-republican_MN"}},{"id":"6177899943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"A disgusting app made my mommy angry","review":"I downloaded this app to get ”educated” the first thing that popped up when I opened it was a fat ugly cheeto my little sister saw and started crying her eyes out then my mommy came in and through some rat poo at me she saw my phone and then smashed it up into tiny pieces and ate them up I am now writing this on a Home Depot fridge, after that I got flung into mars where an alien threw me back to Paris and and then Paris threw me back home at my house I saw that my house turned into a monster this app made my HOUSE turn into a MONSTER and it ate my ears and fingers and nose DO NOT DOWNLOAD ✨👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T19:11:21Z","userName":"radiooo rebelll"}},{"id":"6177888874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"disgastung","review":"i waited a YEAR for this app to download so i could support our orange corn.  but then i went on with my pet rat sally whilst wearing my pink wig and rolling up to the party.

Whoever programmed this must be an amoeba because they have no brains. I would say a monkey but I don’t want to insult monkeys. I have never seen an app as useless or as poorly designed as this one. At all costs please do not get this app. Upon opening the app I thought I was in immediate hell because my phone started feeling like a hot coal. I had to immediately undownload it. Since doing that and leaving this review it has been back to bliss ever since ✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:33:39Z","userName":"worheoqoe"}},{"id":"6177734475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WHAT THE HECK?","review":"i love our dear lord and savi- i mean, president, but what in tarnation is the meaning of this app? i can barely see anything, my little old man eyes cannot view anything! thankfully my smart phone was set up by my grandson so i am able to write this review, but i just wish our lovely president would make it so us elders can view the app properly.\n\nbut my grandson also downloaded it and said that strange things were happening due to the app. his liberal, hippie parents (my fascist son that i disowned and his communist wife) disappeared! maybe....... maybe this app is cursed.","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:01Z","userName":"grandpaw willie"}},{"id":"6177428167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","review":"I need to control my 𝓪𝓷𝓰𝓮𝓻✨ with this app, I downloaded it and it took about four days to download, after that I tried multiple times opening the app and all that appeared on the screen was 🍊 𝓸𝓻𝓪𝓷𝓰𝓮🍊 which really really scared me , after all of that chaos it finally let me open the app but what I saw traumatized me for life....I saw cheetos nudes which was really really scaring😔but you know it kinda was my fault because i always keep an eye out for selener👁👄➖  and to top everything off i’m pretty sure this app is cursed😾😾 anyways don’t download it🥰","date":"2020-07-09T16:45:35Z","userName":"🥰✨👏🏻"}},{"id":"6177395829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁","review":"I downloaded this app and it took 5 weeks to actually download. Once it downloaded it crashed multiple times, and then my phone turned off completely. I would not recommend getting this app because it’s absolutely terrible and for all I know I could have a virus!! The set up of this app is terrible and there’s no way to work it!! I will definitely be looking into it more and I really hope it gets deleted do to the complications. Anyways if Trump wants tiktok deleted than this app will be gone too, bye luv. 😈❤️🕺💥","date":"2020-07-09T16:36:18Z","userName":"Sweetheart is kat"}},{"id":"6177372100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING APP","review":"This app took 6 days to download. After I got hacked on my phone and got a call saying women are useless objects. It was stated disgusting and disturbing racist, homophobic and sexist comments saying things like the n and f word. It was trumps voice and saying inappropriate things about a certain women’s parts whom I don’t know the women but am personally disturbed by the comments of this. Please delete this app I am EXTREMELY scarred for life. This racist, sexist, and homophobic man should not be on the App Store especially saying such awful, despicable things. I would give negative 5 stars if I could.","date":"2020-07-09T16:29:11Z","userName":"Hailey Turbuon"}}]}
