Every time I went on the app it would glitch whether it be kicking me off the app, freezing, or just clicking things I did not click. I had to restart my phone because the app would not unfreeze. Not only that but this app took up half of my storage once it was fully started up. Very disappointed in the quality of this app and will not be downloading again."}},{"id":"6173496100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:42Z","userName":"wiggle you're stick-o","rating":1,"title":"This app killed my pet shunikwa 😭","review":"I was enjoying my day eating a sand and a which when suddenly I saw this app on the AppStore I was like yassss Donald Duck 🦆 made a app I’m downloading it right now 😌 once I downloaded it I went on the app and my pet shunikwa started to talk said the app would kill someone I was like non sense      😌🤚and I opened it it was a bunch of fortnite players making a cult singing 🎤 (r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️) and also the fishy on me song and it ended up killing my pet TURTLE SNORE ROAR WIGGLE SNIGGLE!!

The second thing is that it took almost 4 weeks for the app to download and when I put in my phone number that’s when my social media accounts were getting hacked. This app deserves to be deleted so other people don’t have to deal with stuff you can’t bring back meaning my photos."}},{"id":"6173433669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:23:24Z","userName":"👁👄👁🌞🌝","rating":1,"title":"Horrible application","review":"This app literally kept making my phone glitch keep in mind I have the iPhone pro max there shouldn’t be any problems right? After downloading my phone became slow I am even thinking about going back to the store to get it checked out I have data and WiFi please be careful when downloading. For being so rich you’d think the application could’ve been better but honestly it’s horrible. Please save yourself and your pocket and don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6173422866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:19:45Z","userName":"cheeto is bad","rating":1,"title":"worst app in the history of apps😾","review":"this app is horrible!!!! i took sooooooo long to download and i think that my software messed up because of it. all i wanted was to support the cheeto god but nooo because this app was being extremely difficult. once it finally downloaded snakes and cheetos started falling from the sky and they took over my house, bit my parents and siblings which caused them to turn them into Oompa-Loompas, and ate all our food. i managed to escape just in time but this app is horrible.

This is a strategy they hope works based on constant exposure to the stupidity and bias that is behind these calls. Without entering your information you are not allowed to further proceed into the app, preventing those who would like to view the app for purposes such as comedy or to gain more evidence of presidential narcissism from viewing the app."}},{"id":"6173329962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:47:11Z","userName":"sugie mama","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"As soon is I downloaded this app my phone 📱 started to grow until it was 20 times larger⚙️that normal!

It’s impossible to delete and once downloaded it controls your phone. It makes you think you can do anything but it deletes other apps, texts your contacts, etc. I lost many friends and family members because the app texted to vote for Trump. I would never say that because he is a racist and terrible president. Please don’t vote for him or get this app. Apple needs to take this off immediately! \n\nSent From TikTok!! 😈"}},{"id":"6173278763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:30:39Z","userName":"Worried Son","rating":1,"title":"Yeah Yeah singing challenge","review":"This app brought terror into my home. I downloaded it to catch up on recent news. it took hours. And when I opened it I got a message from Donald Trump that killed my grandma 😢 this orange skinned guy we call Donald trump is so terrible for killing my grandmother. My family was mortified by this act 👿 Of course no one ever supported Donald trump but we would never expect such a horrid act to be put onto our innocent family. büttthœlês🕳 are🤯nøthïng😡to🙂be🤣łàughed🤬at💅they’re 📈just😻part🤠of😱the👩\u200D🦱human🦶body 🧠\n\nWritten with lots of love,\nSomeone Special"}}]}
