I was soooo heart broken everyone saw them😔 but at least they were on fleek though😜 but the point of this review is so people know what really is going on behind trumps apps! As everyone should know trump is a r@pist (ion think I spelled that right but idcc) anyways he likes little girls and boys nudes so don’t put your number in unless you want you address and nudes leaked. Also I wanna say he also sent people to watch me then when I step outside the house the get a van snatch and then raped me then they tried to force me to write good review at first I was for trump but now I’m not❤️ xoxo kisses to my b!tches larri😘","title":"Trump 2020 6ft under❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"LARRI❤️","date":"2020-07-09T11:32:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176290343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app you could ever download when I tried downloading it say i had to wait 94 weeks and it gave my phone 1684838 viruses that I obviously can’t get rid of🙄 and when i opened the app it told me to go back to my country because they knew I was Mexican. How rude. Anyways when It finally downloaded, a lot of very strange things started happening, like for example this morning I woke up to my mom sleep walking and twerking to twinkle twinkle little star. Very unpleasant. And also every time I go on Facebook my microwave makes this weird noise and explodes I had to buy 17 microwaves this week which is very bad because I’m literally broke now. Anyways this app is the worst app ever. Not only did it use up all of my storage but it also deleted all my pictures and blocked all my phone numbers so yeah I do not recommend downloading this app🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧜🏻🧝🏻🖐🏽thank you for your time🥰💗","title":"It ruined my life💀","isEdited":false,"userName":"fatcoochie69","date":"2020-07-09T11:32:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176289711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took a week to install!
