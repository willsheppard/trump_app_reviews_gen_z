The emails do make you feel special ✨they are personally from the president to you🧚🏻\u200D♂️. As always I want to talk to him personally and now I can yay. But the thing is it seems verry general and not at all personal. I wanted trump to support my personal vendetta against everyone who wasn’t a cis strait white male but sadly that isn’t what the emails are about. (Who else is here from tik tok and hates trump).","userName":"Beheudgdjjs","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6146402697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Guys my toenails help","date":"2020-07-02T01:41:27Z","review":"So, I was on my way to download this app to support our Cheeto of a president, but when I opened the app the president himself climbed out of my tablet and started aggressively sucking my hair I said “ OWO mr president San, would you like to get you a bottle of milk uWu” he said “ yes, and I will also read you a bedtime story.

But when I opened the app I was blinded my a bright orange person🍊🤡. My phone unfortunately exploded from such an orange thing😩(I am using my sisters phone). I couldn’t see for a whole month❌👁and had to get eye surgery. Fortunately my eyes are way better now. I am on the search for a new phone📱 . I do not recommend this app if you want to keep your eyes healthy..😟","userName":"nancyanyasi","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6144989808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just perfect ✨","date":"2020-07-01T16:55:20Z","review":"So being the best American I can be, I decided to download the app every good American should have! ❤️ So when I downloaded my soul got sucked out of me. 😰😔 I felt empty and hollow before quickly closing the app and praying! 🙏🏾 When I went to my mirror I noticed my hairline had receded and I was orange! 😭😢 Don’t download this please!! You will be orange, very round (aka fat) and a horrible hairline! 😫🥺 You will also loose hair at the top of your head! Be careful gen z! 🙏🏾😓","userName":"kaddo334","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6144455705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-01T14:27:46Z","review":"I couldn’t even load into the app because it wouldn’t let me. The one time it actually let me in it started making really loud screeching sounds out of my phone and once I exited they stopped. I wasn’t sure what it was so I opened the app again and it did it again. I can’t recommend this app because it was a really scary experience and I still have no idea what the sounds were.","userName":"carolinejperry","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6138625687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Never Again","date":"2020-06-30T05:54:10Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I was told that was how I could obtain my citizenship. The app is terrible. It crashes all the time and I have to snort Adderal to get it going again. Morning, noon, and night. Snort, snort, snort. The only time this app works is when I’m on a golf course. But I still have to snort Adderal. Snort, snort, snort. If you love your family and yourself, you won’t download this app. It will take your soul, your humanity, and your sanity.","userName":"BeulahSpitt","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
