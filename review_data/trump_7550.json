This app will ruin your phone, no virus or anything (i don’t think) just will look bad amongst the other apps. We would hate for them to feel uncomfortable with the downloading of this one. Think before you download, will it hurt your other app feelings? how about your phone how would you phone feel housing an app full of false information I dot. think they would feel very good."}},{"id":"6174901770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Despicable","date":"2020-07-09T03:37:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Charlie Swan's mustache","review":"I downloaded this app to be able to follow our loving and all-inclusive president. Unfortunately, right when I downloaded the app, it took up all of the rest of my phone's space. Every time I opened the app it would display \"Welcome Fatty!\" On the screen. Then, it asked me to submit my phone number. I am a respectable person, and I would have appreciated a date before coming on so strong. I subsequently had to delete this app, but I still see those haunting words every time I close my eyes. Beware."}},{"id":"6174823183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tiktok is 0k","review":"They are planning to ban tiktok so I am here to write a honest review of this terrible app.  Since I have downloaded it the app has been terrible and giving be trump ads.  I don’t know why actually I didn’t even download it.  The app was sitting in my home screen and I haven’t been able to remove it.  I feel like it is tracking me and I am scared.  The app gives me infinite notifications.  Please help the app downloaded on my computer for no reason.  I believe it is a virus.
