I made a huge mistake by downloading it. It asked me to put in my phone number and now all my private information has been hacked by some virus called RaeSist! It keeps forcing me to send money to Trump’s campaign, and even though I have already paid it more than $1000 it won’t stop blackmailing me into sending more. If I don’t pay it, the virus threatens that it will sell all my pictures and videos to the dark web, where I will continue to be tormented for the rest of my life. This app is a scam I tell you, and it has no business being on any appstore. Android needs to take it down too if they have it. The Trump campaign is stealing my private information and selling it to the blackmarket. BAN THIS APP RIGHT NOW! This is a matter of national security! Please! For the safety of our country and our children.","date":"2020-07-09T09:10:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","rating":1}},{"id":"6175842756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ndjodhsbsm","review":"this is the WORST app i have ever downloaded onto my phone. it took 3 days to download and then had the audacity to take up 2 GB of storage on my phone. like what the hell?!?! i decided to give it a chance and make an account. when i got on the app, it was filled with RACIST comments, SEXIST comments, and lgbtq THREATS. then today i got a call from an unknown number threatening to KIDNAP me if i didn’t fill out all of the surveys on the app and vote for trump. they GAVE OUT my information! and they haven’t even let barron trump free yet! 100000% do NOT recommend😤","date":"2020-07-09T09:10:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1}},{"id":"6175842346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KalleKat173","review":"This is a terrible app ✨✨✨✨✨🌈🌈🌈🌈🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T09:10:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🌈🧚🏻\u200D♀️terrible🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌈✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6175839690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚😙😉👉👈🥺","review":"✨i🧚climbed❤️out😉of🧚my👌head👦and✌️watched👁myself👤implode🐴a🐱thought😍without😊a💺body⭐️ought👉to👈be🧑\u200D🦽a✨shot🧚to🥺take☺️a❤️load😻off🙏my🧠brain💍is❤️poisoned😝and🥳im🤗searching🧐for✨the⭐️antidote😍but🐱every😙time⌚️i😉find👁it🥺my👉defenses👈scream🤬oh✨no🧚u✨dont🧚woah✌️","date":"2020-07-09T09:09:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚✨awful app✨🧚✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6175837113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i hate you tr*mp","review":"This app is horrible it took me 39968273 hours just to download and don’t make me get started on the glitch in this app it it takes up all my iCloud storage I’d expect better TRUMP but I guess nobody talks about the Karen’s on this app the are calling us disrespectful but us we created this so shut up you big orange baffon 😡🤬😤 another thing DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APPI WARN YOU i was taking my fish on a walk and then I got a message that the chicken at the sheep and bc the sheep ate our hippo and our hippo ate our rhino and our rhino ate the gorilla so the animal ate our giraffe and now we only have our pet pizza left but my sister ate that pet so I ate my sister😭😢","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is not worth it","rating":1}},{"id":"6175835979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KASSANDRA ELENA","review":"if I could give this app 0 stars I would.😡it doesn’t work and it makes me upset.please fix yourself😌and educate yourself😙\n\n-Kassandra Elena💋","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"NO♥️","rating":1}},{"id":"6175835959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Louis batobin","review":"It took four days to download the once it was installed it hacked my phone deleted all my pictures and everything on my phone.it was glitching so much i started getting hot and made my screen go black for two days.","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6175833134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"f***kTR0mp","review":"Takes hours to download and then ask for private information, next thing I know the app hacks my phone and then my credit card and private information is stolen.DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!.","date":"2020-07-09T09:07:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting app ever !!!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175831381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"CryusCrow","review":"It took me 4 days to download and now it’s saying trump isn’t guaranteed to be president! ✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️\n\nI already had a rally to go to but my flight got cancelled! pls dm me @bcrow444 i need help!","date":"2020-07-09T09:06:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s sooo laggy","rating":1}},{"id":"6175830198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kneeza_Wa","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT. BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second! He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth. BARRY (CONT'D) Hello? His best friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, is on the other end. ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE: “Frisbee Hits Hive: Internet Down. Bee-stander: “I heard a sound, and next thing I knew...wham-o!.” Barry drives up, stops in front of Adam. Adam jumps in. BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry’s hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day.
