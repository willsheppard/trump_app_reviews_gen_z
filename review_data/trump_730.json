I started flipping out and yelling at her swiper! or no swiping! Over and over again and she looked at me with fear in her eyes because I had just discover her weakness. For a moment nothing happened and then she started yelling at the top of her lungs and I could see shadows scattering all over the ceiling it was something out a horror movie but I then I realized what had to be down. I had to delete the app immediately and so I did and everything ended automatically, so overall the app was complete trash🥴","rating":1,"title":"I don’t recommend it","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:16Z","userName":"marlene pantoja"}},{"id":"6174214003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"The app can not make America great again, everyone was getting this app so I thought, “ maybe I should get it.” Well that was the worst decision I have ever made. My momma taught me not lie so I must stand for what’s right. I will not lie for this orange anymore. Trump told his bodyguards to run me over and I believe that if trump himself was in the 🚙car all of that weight would have killed me. ✊😢  When I wouldn’t subscribe he ordered 7 ft tall peppa pig 🐽to come to my house and step on my 🐱cat. After she peeled the cat off of her shoe she swallowed it whole. She then left with a blank cold face, later that night I was peacefully sleeping until I heard my closet door creak. I thought it was peppa so I looked at my closet and she wasn’t there so I covered my head back under the blanket and when I lowered the blanket again TᕼEᖇE ᕼE ᗯᗩᔕ I screamed for my life but I wasn’t quick enough he then proceeded  to swallow me whole as peppa did to my cat. Please do not download this app every time someone does a innocent black person gets killed.","rating":1,"title":"Namtiddies speaks out","date":"2020-07-09T00:07:26Z","userName":"bts.is.zaddy"}},{"id":"6174154767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"When I first got the app, I was like oh what’s this- then I saw a wrinkly cheeto man there- I showed my dog, my dog ended up in the vet cause she was traumatized. This app is also creepy 💀it’s asking for my phone number, oh hell nah I can’t give that info to an Oompa Loompa- because when I was watching Charlie and the chocolate factory (a few years ago) I saw him there and now he’s asking for my phone number?!!!! oh honey no. Anyways, who wants an oompa loompa app on their phone like it’s lowkey pointless 🤷\u200D♀️. Like what it is useful for?!??! But I stan with the reviews here, they are true- this Cheeto man do be scary and creepy like ew 💀.  Also this cheeto oompa loompa is just dumb for having an app that is useless and works for nothing. Like he has done many things bAd and even has he’s own app 💀 wow, I’m just wondering who wants this app it’s trash honestly. There are many other reasons why this app should be removed, just read the other reviews and I’ll see. Well bye I guess ✨😌 and don’t get this app it is just trash 🗑","rating":1,"title":"I- there was a Cheeto man 😱🙄💀","date":"2020-07-08T23:45:41Z","userName":"tati is a clown"}},{"id":"6174140744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i saw oompa loompa shrimp on this app! i threw up so much that my stomach almost digested itself and i had to go to the hospital. there i was trying to get some sleep and i got a notification from this app saying and i quote, “come look at pictures of a rapist!” when i opened the app, i saw trump on top of a little girl. i was horrified and i fell out of my hospital bed and had a seizure. then the fbi rushed in and grabbed me shoving me into a van. they said i had seen pictures i wasn’t supposed to see and i had to be terminated. the one who looks like a frog shot me in the arm bc he had horrible aim and they decided to leave me to bleed out. when they left, barron trump suddenly blasted a hole in the wall and untied me. we barely escaped in his helicopter and he dropped me off on one of the galápagos islands. he said he would be back but it has been 2 weeks and i suspect donald (president, father of 5, oompa loompa, cheeto, rapist) is behind this. i am now stuck on an island with tortoises for friends because of this app. i will never download again!","rating":1,"title":"SHRIMP","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:26Z","userName":"granmutter"}},{"id":"6174063993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded the app and all a sudden my phone starts uncontrollably shaking on the screen and then this black sfuff starts bleeding into my phone and then my phone started smoking and it blew up just like that Samsung from four years ago🥰 but that’s not even the worst part since I had to put my info in including where I lived they started sending me snakes in boxes I think I got like 5 again not that worst part they for some reason didn’t think these 6 foot long snakes 🐍 were enough so they sent my 13 containers filled with moldy ranch that had several dead cockroaches in it😭🤮but the thing that really put me on edge and made me mad about this app was that it wanted you to join his MAGA cult😭😭😭his maga cult told you to be just like the president and stand for what he did I DONT WANT TO PUT CHLIDREN IN CAGES OR PUT DOWN THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿no one should have to worry about there safety because of their skin color!

But then I learned that he had a secret! TRUMP IS A VERY EVIL WIZARD!!! I learned this from hacking into the CIA and learning all of the government secrets, like where Area 51 really is and who killed sonic the hedgehog. (It was the egg guy, but he was funded by trump) After I got in and learned all of this, my laptop exploded! And then he put a bounty on my head and the mandalorian came to kill me with baby yoda, but instead I told him everything and we had a nice cup of tea and he protected me from all the other bounty hunters. Anyways, I learned that trump created mrs corona by sacrificing all of his hair, and that’s why it looks like that. I also learned that trump was a carrot who was turned into a human my his teacher. But then, he betrayed his teacher and turned HIM into a carrot. We lost touch of him and we don’t know where he is now. I just hope that he wasn’t eaten by some kid. There are many other things he has done, but I I told you I would have to kill you.","rating":1,"title":"Read at your own risk","date":"2020-07-08T20:53:07Z","userName":"weeblet707"}},{"id":"6173568387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app it’s so bad it was kicking me out every time I tried to go in and there was pictures of an orange person and I got scared so I called my mom and she said delete that we don’t wanna see an orange person in you phone I heard about the app on tiktok and I couldn’t wait for it to download but it took a whole week to download and the picture of the orange person scared my sister and the name of the app is like trumpets 2020 so I’m scared Bc we don’t want trumpets 2020 as our president also the app was only in English they didn’t have any languages available so it was just bad it started kicking out and adding a weird song🛣🛣 so I don’t think this app should be in here I’m sorry trumpets 2020 but tiktok lives matter and it asked me for my PERSONAL INFORMATION so I think he’s going to rob me and come to my HOUSE to STEEL MY BROOM AND I DONT WANT THAT this app probably got CORONA VIRUS TOO SO LET ME JUST SAY BYEEEE TO IT TIKTOK LIVES MATTER IDC💅🏼🤩🛣🛣🛣🤩🤩🤩💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼🥵💙😘🤮🤮👉🏻💰🔥🤚🏻🥵🥺😍🥺🔁🤣🖕🏻🛣❤️💅🏼🤩💦🤦🏻\u200D♀️😴🤩⭕️😘😍💦💙😍🛣🥱🛣🥱👉🏻🤩","rating":1,"title":"Reason why this APP should NOT be in HERE","date":"2020-07-08T20:09:21Z","userName":"lexy_j_R"}}]}
