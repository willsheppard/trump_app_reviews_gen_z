But the second I opened the app it started asking insanely personal questions, like my home address, names of my relatives, just stuff that isn’t necessary. Hesitant, I filled it in just because I wasn’t going to let that take away my patriotism! Although, after I got through all that chaos it asked me to pay for a monthly subscription! I tried to get around it but it kept bringing me back to the screen, I decided I might as well purchase one month because it was only $18.99 a month. But after I purchased it, I went to look at the app and it barely had three features. Donate to Donald, find Trump rallies near you, and guest services. And the quality was absolute crap! It kept glitching over and over. I was absolutely outraged! This app can’t possibly be by my beloved Don, he would never ask for this of us. Now this app made by who knows has my debit card information, my home address, and my family. I am disgusted and very concerned for my wellbeing and my family’s. I’m absolutely distraught so please, I beg of you, don’t download the app and make the same mistakes I have. It’s not Donald, it’s the Chinese that caused the virus. 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷","title":"don’t download, dangerous","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179016270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"affirmative69","date":"2020-07-10T02:01:19Z","review":"Ass","title":"Howdy","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179015882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AAANNNNAAAAOOOOPP","date":"2020-07-10T02:01:10Z","review":"OK SO YOU MAKE A USELESS APP AND YOU DELETE TIKTOK TRY TO DELETE ROBLOX WHATS NEXT?

But I was greatly disappointed VERY quickly. My plan was to worship the whoopie coushin Trump and tell him how much i love him!!! 🤪However, almost immediately after I opened the app, my entire family started to turn orange!?!? I was so disturbed that I had to throw my phone away! This “app” is a complete breach of privacy and I cannot believe that I wasted my time on it. I would very much reccomend doing literally anything else instead of downloading this app. Approximately \n-4.69/10.","title":"Disappointment","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179014008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emousername","date":"2020-07-10T02:00:31Z","review":"mr. brightside - the killers\n\nComing out of my cage\nAnd I've been doing just fine\nGotta gotta be down\nBecause I want it all\nIt started out with a kiss\nHow did it end up like this?\nIt was only a kiss, it was only a kiss\nNow I'm falling asleep\nAnd she's calling a cab\nWhile he's having a smoke\nAnd she's taking a drag\nNow they're going to bed\nAnd my stomach is sick\nAnd it's all in my head\nBut she's touching his chest now\nHe takes off her dress now\nLet me go\nAnd I just can't look, it's killing me\nAnd taking control\n\nJealousy, turning saints into the sea\nSwimming through sick lullabies\nChoking on your alibis\nBut it's just the price I pay\nDestiny is calling me\nOpen up my eager eyes\n'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside\n\nI'm coming out of my cage\nAnd I've been doing just fine\nGotta gotta be down\nBecause I want it all\nIt started out with a kiss\nHow did it end up like this?\nIt was only a kiss, it was only a kiss\nNow I'm falling asleep\nAnd she's calling a cab\nWhile he's having a smoke\nAnd she's taking a drag\nNow they're going to bed\nAnd my stomach is sick\nAnd it's all in my head\nBut she's touching his chest now\nHe takes off her dress now\nLet me go\n'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me\nAnd taking control\n\nJealousy, turning saints into the sea\nSwimming through sick lullabies\nChoking on your alibi\nBut it's just the price I pay\nDestiny is calling me\nOpen up my eager eyes\n'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside\nI never\nI never\nI never\nI never","title":"buggy and almost ruined my phone","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179013127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"S0ulStruck","date":"2020-07-10T02:00:13Z","review":"This app gave me multiple seizures I was air lifted to the hospital -10000/10 would not recommend 🗑.
