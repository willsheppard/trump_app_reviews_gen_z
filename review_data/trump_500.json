As a queer person, I’ve put up with a decent amount of ridicule in my life but this was the harshest thing I’ve ever experienced. This app took away the rights my fellow lgbtq people. It made my lovely trans people unable to serve in the military, it made it basically impossible for any of us to adopt, and it made it extremely difficult for us to access healthcare. Also, it consistently committed hate crimes on the whole community, threatening to kill us, beating us whenever we showed our face in public, and bullying us to the point of self-hatred. And don’t even get me started on how it treated qtpoc. Constantly telling them to “go back to their country” when the app itself married a product of immigration and is the biggest international leach I’ve ever seen, it’s the biggest hypocrite ever. ✨🧚 Congrats on reading till the end, hopefully in the future we can get an app that respects other apps that don’t look and think exactly like it ✨🧚","title":"The worst think I’ve ever experienced","userName":"b.gallag","date":"2020-07-09T10:01:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175612876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I started downloading this app at the beginning of my pregnancy and it just finished when my quadruplets were born. As you can imagine having four new baby’s is really a time consumer so I don’t really have time to use the app. When I had a second of peace on the toilet taking a dump I finally had the time to see what my woman loving, non racist, non homophobic, and possibly a little fruity himself president was up to. It asked for my phone number so I willingly gave it, but now I keep on getting these weird texts 90% of them being political. I can only assume this app is taking my data and selling it. 😭 On the app it keeps showing me videos of “white power” and i’m a cheeto supporter so obviously I agree, but even I think that’s a little to far. Not only that, but every now and then i’ll get a notification from the app saying horrible threatening things like “we ❤️ only straight white men” and “all lives matter.” I would say please fix these problems, but i’m deleting the app and I really only care about myself just like our wonderful leader","title":"Horrible","userName":"Anna🤭","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174381580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was trying to figure out how the app works, but then it asks for my mobile number. He’s trying to stalk every woman! 😭 Watch out for this Cheeto or bunkerboy. He’s going to steal your phone number and use it against the authorities so he can kill you. :( Such a mean Cheeto. His words are so hilariously stupid because I can not understand a word he says, not even translators who are doing sign language. Anyways, he says mean things to me and my friends and we are scared of this Cheeto. Then my worst nightmare came! I put in my number and then it showed cheeto’s face! AAHH HE’S SO UGLY! 😭😭😭😭 Omg, I got my turtle. My turtle said “trump 2020 🤩🤩 but on a gravestone ✨✨🙈”. My turtle died and he’s possessing me to believe he is a trump supporter. :C HE EVEN SAID TRUMP WAS A MEAN THERAPIST. I MEAN, TAKE AWAY “THE” in therapist and that’s where yo find out he’s a scary rxxxist. My turtle is so possessed he even says “Kanye is a traitor 2020”. Help me defeat my home screen. So much terrible reviews of trump stalking our home screen. Thank god I deleted the app. Who knows if he is going to appear on my home screen, that’s my worst nightmare.","title":"Rallies and protests","userName":"Ellie_8898382","date":"2020-07-09T01:04:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174335645","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First, I open the app only to find the most vile, foul, horrid, offensive picture of a big Cheeto dipped in mayonnaise showing off his naked Oompa Loompa body 😭 I have suffered tragic side affects form this app, even after taking my glasses off because I had seen enough. My eyes have shriveled up and fallen from their prospective eye sockets. I now have extensive debt from medical bills and surgeries I had to replace my eyes due to the death of my previous ones caused by this app and the nauseating photography of Cheeto. But then again, the darkness was preferable to seeing those atrocious, abominable series of pictures once more. I now go to therapy daily to deal with the trauma. I no longer feel safe since this tragic incident where I was visually assaulted and attacked. I am now in a support group for individuals who have suffered from similar experiences caused by Cheeto man. Everyday I live in fear of being visually harassed once more by Cheeto. This is a warning out of concern for other potential users, please safe yourselves from the plague and disease that is this app.      😔✋ #survivor \n\nXoxo Gossip Girl","title":"It’s a no for me","userName":"Sir McThickumz","date":"2020-07-09T00:49:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174071869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as soon as i opened the app i saw a very disturbing picture of a giant wrinkly carrot. so then, i closed the app because wrinkly carrots are not appealing whatsoever. then i went to take my pet fish stanley on a nice little walk through the sahara desert. i should've deleted the app as soon as i saw that ugly wrinkly carrot because then it suddenly made my phone shoot lightning out of the charger port, causing it to strike my poor fish. i am devastated. and now, i have to walk all the way back home which is 12,000 miles away BY MYSELF. so, then i started my journey home and the app decided to make my phone into lava and then it set me on fire and i had to run into the pacific ocean to stop the fire. then i realized that i can't swim so then i began to drown as i thought about my fish stanley. so now me and stanley are dead. (i had to write this review after i came back to life just to throw up a bunch of seaweed, sand, water, AND STANLEY). i just came to warn the people of america to not download this app!!! it is extremely dangerous and could ruin your life!!! thank you for listening.","title":"this app is a monstrosity","userName":"j b¡zzle","date":"2020-07-08T23:15:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173809218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"HORRIBLE APP!!

I downloaded it hoping to educate myself and really, truly, show my support to our beautiful, completely fair, sweet president but no such like I had. The app took nearly 4 hours to download and when I opened it there was a nasal screeching that started and wouldn’t stop. IT MADE MY EARS BLEED! I suffered through to still support my big orange goddess but then it started glitching and wouldn’t stop showing me puppies dying and older men preying on children😭. Truly terrifying. It was so strange and I tried to suffer through with bleeding ears and developing blindness for almost 2 days but there was nothing I could do to fix it. I finally decided to delete the app but as soon as I did these secret agent men surrounded my house and started shooting tear gas in my house, doing the Electric Slide and shouting profanities😔 I had no choice but to hide in my bunker the way our great president Donald Javion Trump did and that’s where I’ve been ever since. 0/10 would not recommend this app but I still faithfully support my president❤️","title":"I just wanted to support our big orange goddess!!!!😭😭","userName":"TrumpLover13","date":"2020-07-08T21:07:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173616734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The first thing you see when you open the app is this bloated orange who is an escaped rapist! And this app tried to STEAL my information. It asked for my mobile number! It’s incredibly inappropriate to put a known racist/rapist welcoming this app. I would be ashamed to have this on my phone again. It’s a disgrace to America. This app disrespects the flag’s guidelines. You can’t put the flag in the app! It’s terribly offensive. This app should be banned. Once I signed up, it attracted a virus to my phone. The next thing I new, my phone was being spammed with a naked orange. It was so disgusting I didn’t touch my phone for 30 days. I deleted the app and the virus went away but I can never free my mind of this curse of the nudes. If you do not want to see Trump getting a spray tan I advise you not to download this app. Why this app is still on the App Store with less than 2 star for I do not know but it shouldn’t be because I have never been so scared for my safety. I might file a lawsuit. SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH ME APP STORE, TAKE THIS APP DOWN. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE TRUMP NAKED.

I was so excited to support bunker boy!!! however, that happiness soon faded when it took a whole WEEK to download. After those painful and crushing days of not being able to support President Cheeto, I finally was able to open the app. But what came was a shock! I could not believe it when I saw Shane Dawson’s leaks on the front page! Of course this IS news, and this IS a news app, think about the children! I can not believe sir orange, who swears to protect all kids (even a little too much by removing them from their parents, even if he loses a couple! it’s the thought!) would just have THIS on their front page! To say I was shocked was an understatement, so I deleted the app. However, the next day it came back! Why the hell did it come back? I deleted it again, but this time it wouldn’t let me! It started wiping everything off my phone, and when it forcefully opened, all my personal info was there! Why does trumpet need my LOCATION? absurd. Do not download this app.","title":"stole my identity!!","userName":"xXCommander_CakeXx","date":"2020-07-09T14:34:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
