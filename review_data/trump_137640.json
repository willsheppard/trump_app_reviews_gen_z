WASTED OF SAPCE!  DONT DOWNLOAD IT. This app doesn’t even function right. It’s not worth downloading. I say don’t even open the app. You’ll see horrible things. It took 2 months to download. I had a lot of free space on my phone. I’m not one of those people who just want it taken down. I’m not a trump supporter, but I was interested in what this man was talking about. The app is honestly not worth the download. Made no sense what so ever. ❤️"}},{"id":"6179879078","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:08:00Z","title":"Trash","userName":"behdvrvvt","review":"Imagine being sexist and racist.
