I downloaded it to show support but the app itself is so awful I physically can’t even comprehend the horrific nature of it at this point.

I was mad at the app so I ate my phone.","date":"2020-07-08T22:23:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"전 유리"}},{"id":"6173920727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WOULD RATE IT A 0!","review":"horrible horrible app. i downloaded this for my dog. i booked an appointment so they can walk her for a cheap nice price. i instantly regretted it. donald trump pulls up to my driveway. vroom vroom get in me car with a dog leash and animal treats. however he took my dog on a walk and dragged her across the driveway. then when he came back he turned more orange. bad app. do not recommend. 🙈🤢","date":"2020-07-08T22:18:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"rosecocodaisy"}},{"id":"6173912771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nope","review":"I opened up the app and my phone literally melted in my hand so now I’m typing this review off my computer that is slowly melting because when I saw that disgusting horrific awful photo on it it just literally burned because the little orange with the Chito puff of a PP is not the move 🎼Donald Trump is a white supremacists if you vote for him you are a white supremacists🎼🎹🪕🎸🎯🎺🎷🎲🥁🎷","date":"2020-07-08T22:15:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ynffhkcf"}},{"id":"6173900385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS AWFUL!!!","review":"When I got this app I got a cold chill down my spine followed by a ring a my doorbell, I opened the door and a bag of Cheetos were at my doorstep .
