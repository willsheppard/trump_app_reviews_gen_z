It gave viruses to my phone and my phone started glitching! This app also demanded I give it an offering of orange colored foods every 45 minutes! After all my cheetohs and oranges were gone, I ran out of things to give it. So in return this app bit me and slapped my mom and kept it moving. I have not seen this app in 3 days.","date":"2020-07-08T21:22:30Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173747842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨To all trump supporters✨","userName":"donald trumpie","review":"UR ORANGE president is taking your info based on this app and SELLING IT TO SEX TRAFFICKING which we know he has a lot of experience in🙂🙂🙂🤚🏻 as soon as u open the app and after a few visits to the app you get a vERY bad virus 😳 so please keep an eye out for selener 👁👄👁 Dont support a RACIST AND RAPIST 🙈✨🥰 He will sell u and take ur money but anyways FREE BARON TRUMP😔!

I don’t know what is going on but this is unacceptable Apple I will never download another app again #Tiktoklivesmatter","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173741192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!","userName":"Professor Lilli","review":"Every time I get on the app I saw an orange with a wig on? It was so confusing😔 the app itself glitches non stop and sent a virus to my phone. I get spam calls 3-4 times a day and it’s so annoying. It’s almost like this app in run by an overpaid racist, sexist, homophobic, privileged white man. What a shame. I had high hopes for this app, unfortunately it let me down, just like the United States “ equal rights “ statement.","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173725842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🦋🧚🏽no💕","userName":"🧚🏽👁👄👁🧚🏽👙","review":"This app is absolutely terrible. He legit kicked me in the forehead for saying Trump 2020! I’m so hurt I ‘REALLY’ looked up to him. And now I’m sad that my ‘most awesome, reliable president’ hates his own supporters. He even set a age limit which I really hate cause I thought EVERY could support him😔he kicked my baby down the road and ran him over with A TRACTOR and posted it in this app! I’m truly disappointed in him. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","date":"2020-07-08T21:05:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173722941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","userName":"AleRO893","review":"I am appalled at how this app has chosen to treat OUR President. How dare they? The app crashed multiple times upon download and even took near 2 hours to download. I was downloading this so as to be able to keep up with the latest news on our PRESIDENT and yet I have gotten nothing but crashes. I will NEVER redownload this app and I caution everyone else to not do so either.","date":"2020-07-08T21:04:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173717978","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!","userName":"DorkyMcDork","review":"I downloaded this to support MY very not racist, homophobic, and sexist president and instead this made my phone glitch out. I had opened the app and it crashed, tried it again and my phone got frozen. My cousin/wife (yee haw my lovely Karen) told me to download the app again. I deleted it and downloaded again but same thing happened. Fix this app before I get my guns out.","date":"2020-07-08T21:02:45Z","isEdited":false}}]}
