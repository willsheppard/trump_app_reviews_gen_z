But my god, this app is terrible!! The minute I opened it it was glitchy and made my phone crash. My friend also tried it and the same happened. If you don’t wanna spend hundreds of dollars to pay for a new phone or to fix it, I reccomend not getting this app. APPLE PLEASE CONSIDER TAKING THIS APP DOWN!!! I’m so disappointed in America and this app smh."}},{"id":"6173955322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ouid420","date":"2020-07-08T22:31:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disgusted.","review":"I open this dreadful app just for it to ask if it can send me notifications??? WHY THE HECK WOULD I WANT TRUMP NOTIFICATIONS.  \nThe news is not credible, I would never ever trust this app.  Donald Trump is a white supremacist, full stop.  I will support literally any other candidate.  Trump is a disgusting pedo and rapist, if he was a black man he’d be out of office and behind bars.  But this is America, and if you have enough money and skin light enough anyone can be free."}},{"id":"6173950091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"biggest gabe itch","date":"2020-07-08T22:29:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed as fellow trump supporter😔✊🏿","review":"I love trump merica 2020 snowflake 🤠💯🤪❄️ but i was displeased when me and my lovely son abor shawn 🥰wanted to get tickets for a rally :( we purchased them and they cost so much !🙄 And we never received the tickets after waiting months this app is fake😭 !1!1!1! in case ur alsO a trump lover rate it a 1 star to let mr trump know!

Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline."}}]}
