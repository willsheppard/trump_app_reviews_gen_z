Why is there an app made for a president who is a rapist, don’t believe me? he raped a 13 year old girl now in 2020 he has 45 rape allegations against him he is disgusting in an interview he said “is it bad I’m more sexually attracted to my daughter then I am my wife?” He talks about woman like they are objects and THEY ARE NOT OBJECTS NOR SHOULD THEY BE TREATED LIKE THEM. Trump is racist, he does not like people of color which is absolutely ridiculous because almost every single thing on this world is made by someone of color not just white people, just because someone has a darker skin color than you DOES NOT mean they are any different AND  NOR DOES THAT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO STEREOTYPE SOME BASED OFF OF SOME ONE ELSE OF THEIR COLOR ACTIONS. The color of your skin does not define you. Why do we have a president who is a racist and rapist in office, “make America great again,” it was never good, America’s laws are made by white men that PRIVILEGED we live in a society where you get treated differently based off the color of your skin That’s absolutely disgusting everyone should be treated equally. People of color are being told by white people to  “go back to your country,” first of all go back to yours the native Americans were here first and Christopher Columbus came here and raped the woman and killed the men and claimed that he found America which IS FALSE. ITS TIME PEOPLE OF COLOR GET THE RESPECT AND EQUALITY WE DESERVE.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173811380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:31Z","userName":"16387401944","rating":1,"review":"Trash \n\nTrash \n\nTrash \n\nTrash","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173811116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app broke my phone and the year!!!","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:25Z","userName":"trumpatized","rating":1,"review":"I first downloaded this app to get more involved in the politics of my nation. When I first opened the app the screen on my phone went black and I swore I could see the agent watching me through the code. I then proceeded to exit the app but it wasn’t working so I restarted my phone and 2020 happened. Now I never open the app but whenever I go in the bathroom I swear I can hear the faint call of grab her by the p**sy through my dark screen like the void is\n trying to luer me. As I write this I feel terrified that the police are gonna storm my home even though I’m white and take me to there trafficking ring.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173810857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:18Z","userName":"illlyyyyy","rating":1,"review":"This app this just horrible.It glitches my phone really bad","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173810243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:03Z","userName":"Brievera","rating":1,"review":"Let me just start by saying I DO NOT recommend this app to ANYONE!
