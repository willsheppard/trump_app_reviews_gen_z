Now I am unable to wash the orange stain off of my body. The app shows inappropriate pictures of a Cheeto. It’s disgusting to see that someone who is okay with mass genocides wants to have access to our phones. This app is useless. I would give it -10 stars due to my safety and life being put at risk.
