ANNOYED. i am  Enraged w a capital E. this app is harmful and hazardous. vv dangerous to our mental health in my opinion. it has caused me so much mental distress and worry in the event that others just like me might download this monstrosity🥺 i give my condolences for anyone who has suffered from this treacherous virus😔✨👀😔😔😔😔😔","title":"PLS READ: MAY CAUSE BLACKOUTS OR EXCESSIVE VOMITING"}},{"id":"6175673413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:12:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"traumatized daughter","review":"This app is the worst it took almost 3 full days to completely download and when it finally did wouldn’t even allow me to open the app.😤 I am absolutely outraged. A week later it finally opened and put a virus on my phone and completely crashed and overheated it. 😰I have to write this review now from my tablet as I now have to get a new phone. 📱This app is definitely not worth the trouble.😡 They found my number and are sending me pictures of Donald Trump in lingerie.🤮 Completely disgusting. My daughter plays games on my phone and when that text popped up she was absolutely traumatized. I can’t believe an app like this is still up in the App Store. It’s a complete disgrace. Donald Trump is stealing your information to benefit to his campaign.🤭 If you download this app well good luck. I hope you won’t have as bad of an experience as I did although it will probably get worse. 😭","title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6175625068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:55:33Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Egbarden","review":"This app took 8 days to download :( . Not sure why I downloaded it in the first place. Also when it finally downloaded it took up all of the storage on my phone. I also got notifications after sayin “Do not allow” and the notifications suggested drinking milk and consuming dairy products, when I’m STRICTLY LACTOSE INTOLERANT. I was deeply offended. I’m also vegan and after the multiple all beef burger patty adds I was heartbroken. Why has such a “great” president created such an awful app 😭 oh wait. This requires immediate actions. Please get RID of this app. This app is a disgrace as well as the person who’s app this is. Don’t only get rid of the app, but the person too. Thanks for your time. Also be warned! If you get this app you may experience death threats, (like my mother did) offensive content, (like I did) and tracking through your phone without your permission like my father did. 0/10 I DO NOT RECOMMEND.

I love to spread my educational how great America is and how these leftists are ruining it every day by asking for basic human rights. I am disgusted to find that when I opened the app my screen left orange dust on my fingers. I was so confused on how this can happen! “This is an app,” I told myself, but no, it was more than that. My phone began playing sweet home Alabama on full blast and froze with Trump’s nudes on the screen!! My daughter walked in and asked why that man didn’t have a no no zone. Little did she know he had one it was just very small. My daughter zoomed in and now is blind. She will never get to hate on people of color or objectify her own gender. Thank you, Trump. You blinded my 6 year old daughter. You lost a vote! 😞🤚","title":"MY DAUGHTER IS BLIND NOW!"}},{"id":"6174846672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:21:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🧚sparkle🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app because I hate Sleepy Joe Biden and want Terrifying— oops I mean Terrific Trump to win. I was immediately asked to put my phone number in and of course I did it because I want the president to personally have my cell phone number on speed dial in case he needs any expert advice from me.... oh wait I just remembered that he doesn’t need to listen to an expert’s advice because he’s perfect already! Anyways once I started using the app I began to have long lapses in my memory where I couldn’t remember anything. Mysteriously, large letters written in blood saying “trump 2020” and “maga” were also appearing on my wall after my memory lapses. I became certain that the app was controlling my mind when I heard Donald’s voice speaking directly to my brain telling me that windmills cause air pollution. I immediately deleted the app and all my symptoms went away. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. he is trying to create a ZOMBIE ARMY!!!","title":"MIND CONTROL APP"}},{"id":"6174765220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:56:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"⭐️⭐️⭐️Suzy⭐️⭐️⭐️","review":"I downloaded the app because I support my great leader SO MUCH! Which is why I was surprised when my phone started glitching like crazy! First it was small things like my phone would die before it got to 1% or my screen would sometimes go completely red and glitchy when I opened the app. However, as a day passed it got worse! Photos and videos started to disappear from my camera roll! Apps started to get randomly deleted! Music from my playlist would randomly start playing on full volume! My phone would turn off completely for many days and it would overheat to the point where I had to go to the ER because my hand got a 3 degree burn! The app also gives LOTS of false information! 90% of the information on that app is false! And it took up SO much storage on my phone! Once I deleted the app, everything went back to normal! DO NOT download this app!","title":"TERRIBLE APP SO MANY GLITCHES"}},{"id":"6174688783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:33:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"PizzaLikerSeamo","review":"When my wife first downloaded this app we were a really happy family. Then a few days later my wife started to come home late because she was running “office errands” and “working late” and she started to hide her phone more from me. Eventually i started suspecting something so I followed her and she went to the Trump Towers?? there I saw an ôrgy of men and women. it was honestly sickening. I stayed there for a while and spied on them and it turns out Trump messaged my wife through this app (because it steals your data) and convinced her to go to the trump towers to participate in a ginormous òrgy of trump supporters??? ew. a few days later my wife brought up divorce and my kids agreed to emancipate from me and Trump adopted my kids and now Trump is their dad?? Now i have nothing, no family, no kids, no wife, and it’s all because of this horrible app. I hate trump. i hate my wife. goodbye.","title":"Beware: this app will steal your wife and kids!!"}},{"id":"6174520630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:45:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"my name is deborah","review":"I downloaded this since I’m a fellow trump supporter but this was just unacceptable. Makes me second guess if I even want to support this man anymore. First off let’s talks about the notification spams. WAY TOO MANY!! I swear my phone keeps going off every few seconds with notifications from this app. I can’t look at any other of my notifications without having to search through the sea of these ones. Secondly, let’s talk about how slow it is. The app just overall doesn’t perform well. There’s glitches every few minutes to the point where I want to scream in frustration. Lastly and most importantly, the disgusting inappropriate adds I have seen on there is horrendous. I am appalled that the man I see fit as our president is allowing such ads to be on this app. And what’s even worse is that there are so many of them! They just keep popping up! PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP.","title":"This app is trash!!"}},{"id":"6174481316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:34:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"McKanZA","review":"When I opened this app my poor eyes were flooded with invasive questions. Like what my phone number. After I put in my number to support our good ol president. ✨🧚\u200D♀️ I was flooded with text messages, voicemails, and phone calls saying Trump 2020 and 🤮Trump saying “sexy” things. The pedophilic racist obese Cheeto ball had the audacity to call me unspeakable words. I was HORRIFIED. The app also cause my phone to heat up to astronomical levels that I had to put it in my refrigerator. It was super slow and crashed. Even a snail could move faster than this app. I had to buy a new phone after this. I suspect that I got at least 10 viruses from this app. Absolutely a horrible peace of work. If I could give 0 stars I would. \n\nI also got flooded with pictures of the orange tan spray cheeto’s nudes... 🤢🤮 my poor eyes were a victim to has disgusting body and his microscopic wrinkly balls. DISGUSTING. \n\nI need to some holy water to purge this out.","title":"DiSGuSTIng 🧚\u200D♀️ ✨"}},{"id":"6174306695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:39:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"girl-who-WANTS TO PLAY-moblie","review":"TERRIBLE APP apon download I got trumps spray tan routine AS AN AD !
