I was happy. I had just moved away from home; ready to spread my independent wings. I open the app and immediately my phone starts to ring, I get a knock at the door, my tv turns on, my microwave starts going, and my hairdryer exploded. I’m very calm under pressure so I answer the call and start walking to the door. When I answered the call it was Trump himself telling me to sacrifice myself to him. I thought the call was sketchy so I hung up but I was flattered that Trump called little ole me. Anyway I ask the person behind my door “Who is it?” They replied with “orange”. I wasn’t going to be fooled by this old joke so I said “Orange you glad I didn’t say orange?”. I heard a deep sign from behind the door. Haha, I won. Better luck next time, bucko. I open up the door to a man selling oranges. (They were old and brown so I declined the oranges) He said “YOU’LL RUE THIS DAY. RUE IT!”, That sentence sounded awfully familiar but I decided to close my door anyway. So, I walk to my microwave to turn it off, but to my surprise-it wasn’t there. “I swear I just heard it”, I said to myself. I tried looking for it but I couldn’t, so I walk to the bathroom to address the hairdryer situation. I open the bathroom door and there it is. My hairdryer in the microwave. “How did that get in here?” I said. The microwave has a humongous hole through the top of it due to the exploded hairdryer. I decided to take the hairdryer filled microwave to the garbage outside. As I go downstairs out of the corner of my eye I see the orange selling man take off his skin. He sees me see him and I start to bolt. Thankfully I always keep my car keys on me so I ran to my car. I drop the microwave to get rid of the weight. But then I hear the man with ripped skin stop at the pile of junk. Then I hear him breath in. He has become stronger now. Faster even. I never turned around and beelined for the car. I scrambled to get the keys in the car but I eventually do. I get in the car and lock it just as the man tries to get in. I’m safe now. But as I look at the man I realize something. He looks...familiar. I gasp “MR. TRUMP!” I slammed my foot on the gas while I hear the president scream “REPENT AND SACRIFICE YOURSELF FOR ME” and I drove off running over his foot. I head back to my hometown only ever stopping to get gas. It’s been two months now and I’m back in my hometown...hiding. I have nightmares every night of him ripping off his skin, breathing in the microwave/hairdryer, and running towards me as I get in my car. Every day I have daydreams of my old life. My old life where I had freedom, freedom to live without fearing for my life of that sick, old, orange fleshed, man. I live in dumpsters and ask people for food. I always see missing people papers of me. But I know that’s just the president trying to get me. In conclusion, don’t buy this app.","title":"Tragic things happen when you get this","date":"2020-07-08T23:29:50Z","userName":"b000p","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174109113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Can’t believe this is even an app worst app to ever exist","title":"worst app ever","date":"2020-07-08T23:28:50Z","userName":"coco_eupgoria","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174107467","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i saw a very scary image and it made me barf all over the place i think i’m going to have nightmares about this tonight","title":"absolute trash","date":"2020-07-08T23:28:12Z","userName":"hfvvfg","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174102855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app & and the next morning my dog left a note saying that he's gonna go live with bunker boy??? i need a new dog now thanks alot","title":"my dog disappeared???","date":"2020-07-08T23:26:33Z","userName":"psycho_b","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174090606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Donald Trump is a white supremacist. if you vote for him again, your a white supremacist🙏","title":"disgusting🤢","date":"2020-07-08T23:21:56Z","userName":"mmesecher","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174083872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I mean I went on it thinking it was an app to promote the conservative lifestyle... but it was filled with racism and fascists 😔😳","title":"Eww","date":"2020-07-08T23:19:25Z","userName":"😳😔😡😬","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
