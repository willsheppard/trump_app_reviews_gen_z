Just plain black. I cannot see anything and i have tried downloading it a few times. It will just log me out or just be black the whole time. Really needs to be removed from the appstore","isEdited":false,"userName":"bmora2489","date":"2020-07-09T14:08:18Z"}},{"id":"6176821452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible.","review":"My phone kept continuously crashing and giving me ads even while not on the app. When trying to leave the app it would crash as well. The app gives off virus like traits and that isn’t safe.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Flawj8","date":"2020-07-09T13:57:30Z"}},{"id":"6176775891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I don’t recommend!!!","review":"The app was very laggy and I couldn’t do anything fix it. My WiFi was just fine, but the app was not. Occasionally it would work, but it was always so glitchy playing weird music and showing creepy pictures. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"aubrey_couch","date":"2020-07-09T13:45:27Z"}},{"id":"6176765529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible!","review":"While the design, organization, and features in the app are awful, it is the actual information from the app that is awful. Everything is biased!! Leading questions, targeting viewers to feel special, etc. That’s fake news if I ever heard it.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Glee4231","date":"2020-07-09T13:42:39Z"}},{"id":"6176742099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t get this app Pleaseeee!!!!","review":"I just can’t seem to figure out why some people like this app. Supporting a president like this? No. I wouldn’t recommend it at all. He has done no good to this country and now there is an app just for him. I don’t see why people would think abt downloading this. DO NOT DO IT.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Peyton❤️❤️","date":"2020-07-09T13:36:34Z"}},{"id":"6176730089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible App!!!","review":"It crashes my phone every time I try to open it. It finally opened and I went to sign up for the app and it was asking for my location! You shouldn’t need my location for me to support the Trump 2020 presidential election. Anyways horrible app in general. 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"Dokate","date":"2020-07-09T13:33:23Z"}},{"id":"6176728715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORTH ZERO STARS","review":"The app took three FULL days to download and it’s nothing like I thought it would be. It asked me for my phone number and I think that’s unacceptable. It also told me that I couldn’t use the app at all to support my- “ DEFINITELY Non racist,homophobic, favorite president”. 0/911 would not recommend.","isEdited":false,"userName":"11Could_beGayer⚡️🌈","date":"2020-07-09T13:33:00Z"}},{"id":"6176710486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"If I could give this app zero stars I would. Once I downloaded the app, it took hours for it to finally download. When it did download, however, the app didn’t work properly, and was way too confusing to use. Please do not get this app. \n\n -sincerely, kyinzleigjh 💕","isEdited":false,"userName":"Reese Gibbons","date":"2020-07-09T13:28:14Z"}},{"id":"6176702682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app do not purchase","review":"This app was very bad! 😤 as soon as I opened the app everything started glitching and completely wiped my phone. 😡then it wouldn’t turn back on and when it finally did it was all orange 🍊 0/10 would NOT recommend!","isEdited":false,"userName":"leofiwlbifkdj😡","date":"2020-07-09T13:26:10Z"}},{"id":"6176664945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"I decided maybe I should support trump but as soon as I opened the app it asked for my phone number which I think is just a way so that the president can contact me and control me and I don’t feel comfortable giving my information to a pervert homophobic racist pig 😡🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"natalieseg34","date":"2020-07-09T13:16:12Z"}}]}
