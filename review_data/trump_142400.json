Cheeto Puff is. i mean seriously, you don’t get better than orange skin. anyway, i saw this app and i screamed as loud as i could in a public area, “TRUMP IS SO AMAZING HE MADE A MOBILE APP FOR HIMSELF!!! SO HUMBLE!!! I MUST DOWNLOAD THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!” then everyone around me started clapping and cheering and i was given the key to the city. alas, that is the only good thing that came of this app. this is actually a horrible app. as soon as i logged in i was asked very personal questions, and i’ve seen some other reviews about this. i was asked my name, what i was wearing, they asked for pictures of me from the side and front, but i thought “it’s okay, it’s trump!! why would he EVER do anything bad or rude or sketchy or dumb??” anyway, it started messing with my life after this. i got ad after ad about trump, which would not have been a problem except it was covering my entire screen to the point in which i couldn’t even use my phone, and i had to buy a brand new phone without any of my old pictures, apps or anything so that the app wouldn’t download onto my new phone. but then i realized it was probably some stupid blue haired liberal democrat person who had messed with the app, because trump would NEVER do anything like this. he’s too smart to not find anything wrong with the app. he’s never done ANYTHING wrong and handles everything PERFECTLY. so i downloaded it a second time and now all my furniture sings “trump 2020” which again would be fine except i haven’t slept in five weeks and i keep seeing things. anyway, TRUMP 2020 (i hope you guys know this is a joke i’m PRETTY convincing when it comes to pretending to be a trump supporter. i promise i hate him.)"}},{"id":"6179307963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app has lot’s of glitches","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Arirec","date":"2020-07-10T03:46:14Z","review":"The app kept kicking me out, and when I was finally able to get in it just glitched in me and froze.
