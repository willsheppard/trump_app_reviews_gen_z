Now I feel my phone dripping orange fluid from time to time with the words make America great again and have to clean it all the time, this app is really so messy literally and figuratively absolutely do not recommend.","title":"Worst app on the face of the planet of the earth, almost like the president himself","userName":"thebunmer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:50:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177378748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had high hopes that’s this app was going to change the world. Needless to say i am scared for the rest of my life. I open the app the find our great and powerful ✨wrinkly orange✨ I had to go to the hospital to get a new pair of eyes sadly 😞 I knew it wasn’t a good idea to show others the app but me and them had to face our worst fear together. Unfortunately the second i showed my friends to app they have never been seen again. I worry about them a lot yk. They just weren’t strong enough to stand all the racism this app accumulated. I hope you do better and realize this app need to be taken down. 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","title":"🍊ORANGE 🍊","userName":"vhvguigxkbclohdoxgcfjjnk","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:12Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177313472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give 0 stars that would have been my very first option. I opened the app and all of the sudden this man popped up on the screen and started screaming at me through my phone and said if I didn’t vote him he would kill me!😰😭 it was a terrifying experience but it got worse I went down to my basement to get a snack and there we was TRUMP WAS IN MY BASEMENT!!! I tried to run away from him but he chased me around my basement and yanked my leg when I tried to climb up the stairs 😱. Lucky I pepper sprayed him and the orange fell to the ground😹. I would not recommend this app unless you want horrible trauma to happen to you😕.","title":"Absolutely horrible ✨","userName":"haleyls","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:12:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177206202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I love Trump and I wanted to download a trustworthy app. I think this app is a scam. Every few minutes a pop up ad will show and will ruin my experience! It also shows his face too much which is not to my liking! I do not appreciate it when apps ask for my person information like my mobile number as well. He is also asking for money quite often. I AM BROKE SIR NO! I believe that another app should be made that he does not run! This is absolutely distressing and I want this app deleted! I will be calling my office in the morning so they can file a complaint and possibly sue. I <3 you Trumpy pooh, BUT THIS AIN’T IT!\n\n<3 Karen","title":"Horrible!","userName":"BlockHeads Lover","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:41:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177131184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to get this app but it took like a week to download and upon opening the app my phone was taken over with pop up ads for self tanner. Not only that, but the app itself has the most god awful layout i’ve seen in my entire life. The font is way to big, the color scheme is absolutely horrid. The app takes way too long to load and when you finally get it open, if you have the patience, all you see are pictures of Mr. Cheeto in his nightclothes. Very unprofessional, sir. If i could rate this app no stars, I would. deleting this app would be the 🧚✨best✨🧚 decision the app store could make.","title":"Worst app ever!","userName":"Janice473828","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:20:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177011809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app ever. I downloaded it and they threatened to steal my identity and turn me into an alien if I didn't vote for trump. They kept sending me fairy comments like for example they said, “You snapped🧚✨💞✨next time make it your neck✨💕🦋”. It was very insulting and disturbing. I tried to delete the app after but when I tried my phone glitched out and all I was left with was a grey screen that gave a warning message saying “if you delete this app, I will take away your parents”. So to sum it all up, don’t download this app. The outcome of downloading the app is different for everyone but I don’t suggest it.","title":"Oh to see without my eyes 👀","userName":"Fellowtiktokee","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:47:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176934705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first wanted to ✨d o w n l o a d✨the app,, see our local cheeto😽.

I downloaded with hopes and ended up with disappointment. Not only does it continuously spam me even though I turned my notifications off, I find endless adds about it every where. It also keeps saying random stuff like “kill people pig” and “Harry Styles must die”. Enough is enough. What type of sick cult is this and who is behind it? I believe this app should just be banned, I feel like it’s WATCHING me. Not to mention whenever I’m on it my device glitches and shuts down. What if it gave me a virus. this app needs to be shut down IMMEDIATELY. It is just dangerous, and scary.","title":"Trump?

Everything seemed fine when I first downloaded the app, that was until my phone started severely glitching. It started off by simply getting stuck on apps, but then turned to my phone shutting down and completely not working. I took my phone to try to get it fixed and was informed that I had a virus. I was also told my phone had been hacked and my information had been stolen. Less than a day later I started getting calls from random strangers and eventually had my credit card information stolen. Please do not get this app!!","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","userName":"tally rose smith","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:58:51Z","rating":1}}]}
