It’s a shame that the info presented in the app is a scam (no mention of BLM, minimization of COVID, and TRUMP’S WRINKLES ARE SMOOTHED OUT). I really wish I could rate it with negative stars but alas. It was worth downloading and seeing but I think I’ll be deleting it soon!","isEdited":false,"title":"Really great initiative","date":"2020-07-10T04:51:31Z"}},{"id":"6179501002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"jennyjosif","review":"My😌vâgáīñās🍑name👅is👑roñaldõ🥵and🍄theres🧚🏻nothing ❌you🌮can🌝do🐟about🤠it🤡","isEdited":false,"title":"And that’s on Ariana Grande","date":"2020-07-10T04:51:21Z"}},{"id":"6179500988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🧚✨✨No❤️","review":"This app was very confusing to use and was an all around trash product😍❤️❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-10T04:51:20Z"}},{"id":"6179500836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Queen candy 2000","review":"For all the Trump 2020 MAGA supporters, PLEASE take this review seriously. The other reviews might be crazy but this is real. If I could give this app 0 stars I would. The app took hours to download despite the fact that I was connected to my WiFi and then when it down loaded it asked for my SSN, my phone number, my address, my bank info. And this was just the first part of getting into the app. After that it started asking me for a bunch of personal things that were unnecessary, that I had to answer to get further into the app. It asked for my zodiac sign, my eye color, my shoe size, if I wore braces in 2016, and these were harmless so I answered them. It asked if I have Netflix(I do) so it asked for my email and password. It asked for my phone passcode. Then it ask for my parents information, anything personal about them this app asked for it. After making it through the 100 part questionnaire(took me two hours but I had a food break). It finally brought up terms and conditions(TaC), which should have came up before the unnecessary questionnaire. Unfortunately for this app I actually read the terms and conditions but if you don’t and just click agree I have bad news for you. In the middle of TaC the fine print states, “you have to give up your 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th amendment”. There other statements like these in the TaC that us Americans should not agree to. And because the app already has all the information on you, agree to this is almost like selling your soul to the devil (no getting out of it). I have deleted this god forsaken app and I hope I saved some of you from downloading this app or even from getting as far as putting in all your information. I can’t believe Trump’s app did this to me. Don’t be like me!! Just don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Sorry for this long review but PLEASE read!!!","date":"2020-07-10T04:51:17Z"}}]}
