They also said that they’ll throw my dog into the dumpster and throw the dumpster in an ocean. They keep on saying “EAT THE RAT🐭😡😾” and idk why. Also there’s a lot of orange 🍊 and it gives me a headache which can cause me to have a seizure.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:41:02Z","userName":"Installmarc","title":"AWFUL APP"}},{"id":"6172728194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have spent hours trying to figure out how one could design an app so poorly. It has such low functionality and extremely bad quality. Although I can not say I am surprised. Bunker boy has had a terrible term of presidency so I am anything but surprised to see that his app is just as terrible. My best wishes go out to Barron and Melania. Hang in there😛","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:40:00Z","userName":"yeah😛","title":"Awful app"}},{"id":"6172705760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I wanted to listen to an 🍊 talk I would be watching the show annoying orange. The app itself kept on crashing and wouldn’t let me log in. The download itself took hours and restarted many times. The only reason I downloaded this app was to learn about my president, but I couldn’t even do that.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:33:40Z","userName":"SWhiteB","title":"Absolutely horrible 🤮"}},{"id":"6172700319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst is never freaking loads and it took forever to download.

It also uses so much storage and non-stop spams me with notifications. I clicked on an add and bought a trump 2020 hat and my credit card got hacked. I am so mad, this app cost me thousands of dollars because of the virus and the credit card hack. Also it’s just a really low quality app that is hard to use","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:24:04Z","userName":"catladiesforlife","title":"TERRIBLE DO NOT BUY!!!!"}},{"id":"6172661006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is very brutal and can not be seen by anyone. It has very unsuitable content, and my little sister is now traumatized. ✨ my dog stole my phone, opened the app, and he died because of those terrible images. Why would anything like this ever be allowed on the App Store.😾 we need to seriously take this app down before anyone else sees it. 👁👄👁 xoxo 😘💋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:21:06Z","userName":"doing gods work ✨🙈","title":"Killed my dog ✨✨🙈"}},{"id":"6172619007","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took about 8 weeks to download , when I finally got the app I saw this orange strange looking thing waving I don’t know who that man is but ,, when I got the app someone came barging in my house took all my stuff took my dog and killed it , took MY SHOE, they took my toilet 😔💔, ugh install this app now 😡 anyways BLM , ACAB, stream black swan,Stan BTS , Stan stray kids , stream god’s menu , stream more&more","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:09:15Z","userName":"yadira 🦋","title":"WORST APP EVER 😡"}},{"id":"6172594609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app and it made my phone go slow!! Like I couldn’t do much because nothing would load!! It also asked for a phone number, I gladly put in my cute number, but I got messages all night none stop and also during work!! Which made me get in trouble because the vibrations wouldn’t stop.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:02:29Z","userName":"SadSh1t","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6172587609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This was a terrible app it’s so laggy and it reeks of white supremacy and racism. Every time I open the app the FBI agent in my phone starts screaming uncontrollably until I close the app. Leaving this app on my home screen reminds me everyday in the horrible America we live in because of Trump. Overall a bad app I would not recommend the app should be deleted 🥰","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:00:35Z","userName":"Pancakes for pigs","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6172533585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was using the app to support our president (TRUMP 2020🇺🇸) when suddenly my email was flooded with trumps campaign ads. Like hundreds within the span of 1 minute!! It also took over my social media. Everything on my feed is now stuff about how amazing trump is. I hate it","rating":2,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:45:32Z","userName":"Zaqxswr","title":"Tried to hack my phone?!?"}}]}
