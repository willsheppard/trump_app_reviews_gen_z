So without even thinking twice I jumped into my App Store and download it, but it took 2 hours!! And while it was downloading it played the national anthem and my phone was completely inoperable!! Do you know how annoying that can be? My ears were bleeding .  and I think I’m deaf!!! Also it doesn’t help when my phone blew up and caught my house on fire when I tried to open the app!! So now I’m homeless and deaf!!?! All I wanted was to show my support and this is how he repays me?! Rude!!!!

I was shocked when all the English suddenly changed to “wing wong li kong pow tian tian di”. Obviously I thought that this was an ancient language so I went to get my history textbook but suddenly my phone began to emit radioactive particles that made my left hand become superhuman! I punched a hole through the wall and went to the bank. However on my way there Nikola Tesla appeared and told me that I was a liberal sheep and I told him the best comeback which is TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 of course 😼. I ripped off his pants (trousers for my brits) and proceeded to jerk him with my superhuman left hand. His nut flew into the bank vault door and I used the app to detonate his coom. I used Nikola Tesla to rob 26 more banks.","title":"This app made me white 😳🤩"}},{"id":"6173215207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:09:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MissHaileyy","rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible. even if i did like the man-which i don’t- it’s bad. it’s hard to navigate, the setup overall is just horrible. it has outdated news and glitches several times, and even wants personal info like your phone number. it’s incredibly biased and only talks about joe biden and blah blah blah. like Jesus, are you obsessed with the guy or something?? i don’t like him either but wow, even i don’t talk that much about him. it’s incredibly childish, especially when he talks about Biden’s racist past while ignoring his own. but besides that, the app kept closing on me anytime i tried to click the links. i kept having to restart it, and it absolutely drained my battery life. do NOT recommend, absolute trash of an app.","title":"God Awful"}},{"id":"6173198828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:04:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"_aa.m.yy_","rating":1,"review":"as a wonderful american that i am, i wanted to download this WONDERFUL app😽as soon as it downloaded after 3 days i couldn’t believe my eyes ! 😖 i was alone with my brother that day and we heard a loud knock at out door! of course i went to check it out and it was our PRESIDENT himself with frog ninjas ! i was so in shock 😢 they came storming in and the frogs took my brother away ! ☹️i stayed alone with our cheeto puff president 😻✨he almost RAPED ME 😔i stopped him because i pepper sprayed him😝he told me if i ever said anything he would cut off my tatas himself 😥 time passed and my brother came back with BRUISES 😾 i was so mad that i killed all his frog ninjas and my beloved cheeto puff president left running🙈i immediately deleted the app !

However, after downloading for about 4 hours, the app requested my location, the ability to send notifications, my phone number, address, my social security number, and so much unnecessary information. This app lowered my battery by 62% JUST in a couple minutes. This app CONSTANTLY asked for money towards the Trump administration and made many racist comments and assumptions towards the Democratic party. As a Republican, this app was unnecessary, asking for ridiculous amounts of money from supporters, shared false information, and even encouraged violent behavior. This app would get 0 stars if it could.","title":"Not at ALL what I expected it to be."}},{"id":"6173129941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:42:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kendog247","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app the see what this president is doing but instead I saw a bunch of pictures of a round cheetah with corn silk on top of his head. Not only did I see a random orange man had infiltrated the app but I the app also glitches so bad. The glitch cause the president brain along with all his supporters to COMPLETELY leave their bodies. Before downloading this app make sure to abide to al the following safety precautions: squint your eyes so you see as little as possible(to make sure the horrendous looking orange don’t permanently damage your eyeballs, put a helmet so the “president” can’t brain wash you, and lastly just don’t download the app we ALL already know that he is a racist, rapist, fascist, homophobic, xenophobic idiot","title":"Delete the fat Cheeto from the white house"}},{"id":"6173071846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:23:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"rigatoni65","rating":1,"review":"When I got this app it took almost over a month to download, not only that but when I opened it the screen said “ALL LIVES MATTER” I wasn’t home at the time. And when someone else saw it they proceeded to get a group of 10 people to beat me up after work. Now because of this app I have to pay for a medical bill that’s over $70,000 and I have a broken neck, ribs, and toe. I’m in so much pain and it all hurts so much, and because of that but I can no longer leave my house because every time I do a bunch of bees start attacking me. No matter what I do it won’t allow me to delete this app. I went to the Apple store and they gave me a whole new phone, the app was already on there when I logged into my phone...","title":"🍊🍊🍊"}}]}
