In fact there was only ONE and it’s called clowns. I mean it is a good show don’t get me wrong but it lacks flavour. It’s always the same plotline for every season: this orange is president ans says a bunch of lies and the rest of the blind clowns following and agreeing what he says. Also the sign up for this app is very long. It asked for my address and my race like WHYYYY. I also found that there is a meet and greet with the cast every month or so so I bought tickets but I felt bad because I can’t go since I had to walk my fish and oh yeah I live in England .","userName":"Carol baskin 💖✨👁👄👁","rating":1,"title":"Great entertainment app","date":"2020-07-10T09:08:46Z"}},{"id":"6180207452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I open the app I saw this scary looking clown saying racist comments to me  and he wouldn’t leave me alone he kept talking about making america great again it was horrifying. Even after I closed the app he kept on talking and it was getting so intense that I then began to turn my phone off just so that I wouldn’t have to hear that clowns voice.","userName":"wasulola","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-10T09:08:45Z"}},{"id":"6180205598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i can’t paste the bee movie script and i’m upset. no stars. 0/5 and do not try again.","userName":"Chickcie","rating":1,"title":"nope","date":"2020-07-10T09:08:05Z"}},{"id":"6180204444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"XD","userName":"dragon9720","rating":1,"title":"XD","date":"2020-07-10T09:07:41Z"}},{"id":"6180203845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I am not involved in whatever these kids are pulling, this is just an absolute terrible app!
