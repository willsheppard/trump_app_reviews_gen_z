And I don’t know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn’t a Trojan virus that exposed them to FASCISM. I came home from work just the other day and they were saying things to me like “GRAB EM BY THE P^SSY” The app somehow managed to hookup to my printer and started printing out the court documents from when Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein went to court for r^ping a child! I was horrified! Is this what we’re exposing our children to? How can I know they’ll ever be safe again?","date":"2020-07-09T00:21:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"SamMarsh1198","title":"This app is a VIRUS"}},{"id":"6174240363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I had one of the most difficult times using this app and I could barely figure out how to navigate it. It kept opening and closing and opening and closing and I wasn’t even pressing anything. Once I actually got it to stop acting up, the menu was very tiny and I was not able to read anything on the screen. From what I did see, it wasn’t very helpful and I don’t think anybody would benefit from this app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:17:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hejaudveks","title":"Very confusing"}},{"id":"6174228181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I open app my ear bleed because of cheetos man tan tan!

As soon as I opened this app I got texts from an unknown number spamming me with racist things as well as pictures of bunker beotch naked it close to naked 🤢🤢🤢 the people who created this app are SICK. I’ve been getting strange and threatening calls and texts since I downloaded this crap. I’m not sure why they’re doing this or who they are but this app needs to be taken down!!!!! I’m so upset that this is happening to me.

While its appearance was short, I was still able to see the image. Though this app may have originally been created by king donnie T, it has now been overtaken by Kim Jong Uns communist minions, often referee to as Kpoop stands. I suggest immediate removal of this app from the app store as it has the potential to turn good young trumpies into full blown chinese commies. Please remove this app. #endbts #endkpop #stanKWmillerforcongress 🤬🥰❌❌","date":"2020-07-09T00:03:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ppbondo","title":"this app is chinese propaganda"}},{"id":"6174180401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This 😌 one ✨ is 💅 for🤷\u200D♀️ the 💯 boys 🎾  with 💍 the 🚴\u200D♂️ booming 🏅 system 👧 Top 📈 down 👇 AC 🇦🇨 with 🥣 the 🤒 cooling 🥶 system 💉  When 💋 he 🤴🏻 come 🏃\u200D♂️ up📈 in 👗 the💎 club 🥳 he 👨 be 🐝 blazin 🔥 up 📈 Got 🍉stacks🌾 on 🌚deck⛴️ like👯 he 🤴🏻savin’ 💸 up 📈 And 🕷️  he 🤴🏻  ill, 🤢  he 🤴🏻  real, 🥺  he 🤴🏻  might 💅 gotta 💇  deal 💍 He 🤴🏻  pop 🎈  bottles 🍾  and 🌇  he 🤴🏻 got 🎁 the 🌾 right 🤛  kind 🎩 of  🍳 build 🏠 He 👨\u200D🦲 cold 🥶  he 👨\u200D🎨 dope 👀  he 👨\u200D🚀 might 😜 sell 📈 coke 🍹 He 👷\u200D♂️ always ✅ in 🤵 the 🤣  air ✈️  but 💡he 🤸\u200D♂️ never 🙉  fly 🛸 coach 🎢","date":"2020-07-08T23:54:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lemony Peachy","title":"this app will steal your microwave!"}},{"id":"6174180207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Okay so I downloaded this app thinking that it would direct me to the most juiciest orange farms in my area.
