Very unacceptable. I should be able to feel comfortable with my 3month old going on this app. All the other reviews were talking about nudity and so many other disgusting things. Of course I thought the president would be better than that so I downloaded the app anyway. I was so shocked and so scared opening it😪now I understand the other reviews! The only reason you should download this is to leave a one star🙄","title":"Wish I could one star this😬🤢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:06:44Z"}},{"id":"6173702931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Cat fish22","review":"I tried to download this app to show my love for oranges when I started to feel dizzy i called my mom and told her that i felt like I was going to faint so she came to my room and I fainted I woke up in the grocery store and I was so confused so I screamed for my mom.

I downloaded it as a platform for educating myself but it was downright terrible. So much misinformation and I heard it actually killed people. As soon as I downloaded it my phone started crashing every thirty seconds and I got a virus on my phone that wouldn't go away. I finally located the name of the virus and it was called dtrump2020. Avoid this virus at all costs- it caused my friends whom I text to be killed and kidnapped. What kind of app creator would let this happen?! It's absolutely ridiculous.","title":"Don't download","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:49:59Z"}},{"id":"6173633640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"hijijijhjdjhsy","review":"When I first opend the app the T started ✨𝓼𝓹𝓲𝓷𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 ✨ it flew through my phone and sliced my sisters leg. We called the police and the said “sorry we have more important things to do like killing innocent colered people”. I was furious then I decided to try the app and the second I signed up an ugly hideous creature popped up. It was orange and had horrible fangs and for some reason a wig.

It also leaked all of my private information such as passwords. Words cannot describe how much i despise this app. Not to mention after i tried downloading this app, a bunch of white suprematists arrived at my home bringing guns and gross trump merch! They were all olde white men who tried getting inside my pants. I tried calling the cops to make them leave but the cops joined them. They only left after THREE DAYS! I truly believe this app cursed me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!","title":"AWFUL","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:18:48Z"}}]}
