First of all, it took 4 days to download, deleted all of my data and made me buy a new phone. That is unacceptable😡. Second right when I got into the app it asked me for my PHONE NUMBER. I immediately felt attacked and harassed😭. You can’t just ask someone for personal information like that. To top that all off it asked FOR MY NAME AND ZIP CODE. I can’t risk someone coming to kill me and my family at night. Also my name is very personal and I feel very offended that you can just straight up ask me that. This is how I would describe this app in emojis: 👁👄👁no❤️🤮🤡. I highly DO NOT recommend this app and if you think about downloading it just think of the personal information that is going to be asked.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177074124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:49Z","title":"Trash","isEdited":false,"userName":"NIKKI THE BEAST YOU KNOW IT","review":"Complete trash I don’t even know how he became president he is a ra_ist you can fill in the blank.

I opened the app so ready to see our 🍑beautiful🍑 country’s leader and found it wasn’t even Obama. But I was asked instead to fill out a an extensive form with consents and to send it to my friends. I figured why not. I got the end and I got a “May the odds be ever in your favor” notification from the app. Then these men came to my house and told me I had been picked for the 2020 annual Hunger Games. I was told that if I voted for trump in November my name would be taken out and I could stay home. I did the gracious thing and put my three fingers in the air waving goodbye to my family as I got into a government van. I was then asked to share the app and to give it 5 stars. I have since escaped from my captors and am living off of gas station Oreos and polar pops. Doing the only thing I can think of I am giving this app 1 star for ruining my life. I am now running from town to town as a wanted criminal please do not download UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES","rating":1}},{"id":"6177072852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:27Z","title":"🍊","isEdited":false,"userName":"samuel s smart","review":"FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS","rating":1}},{"id":"6177072145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:14Z","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"swishswishswish","review":"I hate this app. It make my phone break and I had to get a new one.\nSomehow🤣our😭little😙sister💗pigeon🤪has💕been✌️the💚nickname😑pigeon👑and😌its🌻honestly😁not👄cool⭐️\n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\n\nwhy⁉️don't⌛we🔪just👽relax😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅radio📻 would👿you😼like💕AMMMM👹or🤪 FMMMM👺\n\n👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽\n\nThere’s💅alot😘of🤠people🧍in😳Ãmęrîçärghårh👄in Ãmęrîçärghårh😍300😛million🤯in Ãmęrîçärghårh\n\nHave🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄","rating":1}},{"id":"6177071640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:06Z","title":"TikTok is fun","isEdited":false,"userName":"samsam-11-","review":"🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴🏴","rating":1}},{"id":"6177071489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:04Z","title":"This app is spooky help","isEdited":false,"userName":"big boy donny t","review":"So I downloaded this app out of curiosity and as soon as I opened it a pale orange tint began spreading on my skin.
