He decided to join this terrorist group called the Akatsuki or some bs and I have sworn my life that I shall be the one to kill him and avenge my family. I ran away from my village and trained under this snake who wants my body in pursuit of power and my best friend who is also definitely in love with me, decided that he’s going to chase my sweet asset to the end of the earth and I just cannot believe how dumb this bih is to be doing that for my toxic booty but....we did have our first kisses with each other so......we kinda have a connection. Later we fought in this war against one of my predecessors who came back to life with the power of necromancy and actually ended the world for some time but this alien lady was like, “hi sisters”, and effed him up bad and then we won or something? Idk but I ended fighting my bf(f) and we host lost our fapping arms but that fine cuz we got each other...also there was this pink trash was also there tryna get me back. Useless and annoying b. Thinkin’ she could do sht. Foolish. Anyway, revenge is calling and I shall end trump like how I ended Danzo.

Trump from office after he was impeached - he clearly broke several American political committee laws, as well as international law. Paul Ryan's book discusses how inept of a president Donald Trumps is, and Bolton further elaborated how incapable Trump was in the oval office. Many others (late senator John McCain, former republican president George W. Bush, senator Mitt Romney, a variety of cabinet and military personnel that were fired by Trump) all denounced the presidents idiotic behavior. Why do American republicans insist on worshipping this failed racist? This man that evidently does not care about any American citizen? Even his own niece, Mary Trump, is set to publish a book detailing how much of a cheating sociopath this man is. He can't quote any scripture from the bible, he had peaceful protestors tear gassed, pepper sprayed, shot by rubber bullets and beaten back for the simple purpose of taking a picture in front of a church he doesn't attend, scowling and holding a bible UPSIDE DOWN. Even the military advisors that attended this with his denounced this behavior, and the bishop of this same church was dispersed by police. How are so many republicans still convinced this is a Godly man? He clearly does not care about American citizens!","title":"Trump should have been impeached","userName":"jeeticus","date":"2020-07-09T01:12:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174958400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ya I know y’all missed ya ya know y’all ya ya know ya ya boy ya ya know ya boy lol 😂 ya know what y’all are like talking like that I wanna ya know y’all love 💕 y’all don’t wanna talk about to it like a is day a week or a week before it starts happening so that’s what it you like and it’s you gonna I wanna was like that one ☝️ is was your not gonna was the time to tell y’all that you are the living person that is not a big enough to do for me to and get to me do and then we can go get out to do it so I gotta is that I want you I wanna talk about to be friends and with you guys and I know ya I ya know I love you 😘❤️ was that a good day night you got sweet love y’all love bye 👋 I was like gonna go get over everything that I you gotta is my the time I wanna go get to go home 🏡 was my favorite thing in life and I’m not tired 😴 this world 🌎 I wanna was the a good way for y’all and to be me a again but and I’m gonna die life I wanna was so sad 😞 I gotta I love 💕 it all the songs and you were so lucky 🍀 is a was right I love you and miss you sweet 👧🏿 is your mom day you and I got a lot lot going on and I don’t want to do that stuff so I’m going off the bed 🛌 was the night you you were just talking and I’m I gonna is the night.

Later that day she started getting shorter and shorter.😫 She didn’t know what was happening so she went outside and jumped in her orange🍊 shaped car. She kept driving till she wen to Jupiter. At Jupiter she saw her GUARDIAN ANGEL!!!! Her guardian angel said “Do u wanna fight💅👁👄👁???” She said “Bet😫😬👅👑🐝🥰” so they fought. She was about to loose when she quickly showed the app and her guardian angel started screaming. “AHHHHGH!!!!” She then won the fight with the power of the app and turned into and orange 🍊 tomato Cheetos oompa lipoma herself. The blob fish fell all the way from Jupiter to the ocean.

It looked like a really cheap spray tan! I figured I might have had an allergic reaction to something, so I took a benadryl 😇.  After a few hours, the reaction hadn’t gone down 😰. I decided it would go away on its own as I shed my skin when I returned to my true form, a snake 🐍. But then, it was time to take my daily birth control pills. To my surprise, every time I tried to digest one, I would regurgitate it 🤮. I suddenly got a chill down to my bones. I again looked in my mirror, to discover the word “murderer” written in Lobster Blood! 😳. When I tried to clean it, Donarld’s voice came to me: “I..am...” At first I couldn’t make out the mumbling, but each time he repeated it, it got louder. I finally realized he was singing the gummy bear song 🤬. I cannot put up with this any longer. In addition to this, my phone has been glitching like crazy, and every time I use the app, my battery drains at least 10% every 5 minutes on there 😡. I resign as Presidarnt of the Donarld Turnip Fan Club... I’m done 🤧","title":"worst decision EVER","userName":"🌸 angry fan 🌸","date":"2020-07-09T17:34:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176947055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Decided to download sort of on a whim just to see what was on here; I had pretty low expectations to begin with and I was prepared to see some pretty toxic stuff, but good god I have no words. First of all, the load time to open the app is utterly atrocious. I honestly don’t understand how an app of this level of content can load so agonizingly slowly and unresponsive. Further, the poor loading times are supplemented with frequent crashes which just adds to the frustration.\n\n    Once you finally open the app, there’s about as much toxicity as one would expect (mostly just a sequence of various levels of falsified or outright incorrect propaganda). The app involves an in “game” point system which... is different to say the least. It’s   certainly different but I can’t say it’s a very good look overall, quite the contrary in fact. Finally, after a bit of research I discovered that the app also just flat-out steals data from your phone (without user authorization I might add) which is an issue in it of itself. Overall, the app is simply unintuitive to use, steals your data, and of course has the added downside of supporting the Trump campaign which is a major detracting feature in my book.","title":"Repulsive, just utterly repulsive","userName":"Mr Obwama","date":"2020-07-09T14:30:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175956775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app caused my phone to continuously glitch after downloading and after that, NOT ONLY did it DELETE ALL MY DATA including photos, contact information, music, and every other app I had, but it also found my personal info. Such as my home address. THEY DO THIS SO THEY CAN KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!! IVE BEEN RECEIVING TONS OF BAGS WITH  A TRUMP 2020 STICKER, FILLED WITH DOG CRAP ON MY DOOR STEP! 😡😡😡I AM EVEN MORE OUTRAGED THAT THEY KIDNAPPED MY DOG AND ATE ALL THE FOOD IN MY FRIDGE.  When I tried to contact them in order to call them out and figure out why they done this, they laughed and called me a “Fat wh*re” and that I “deserved to starve”. So they had me fired from my job, stole ALL my money from my savings, and everything I had left in my bank account so I wouldn’t be able to purchase any food. Since then, I’ve been living under a bridge with a few kind trolls as roommates. I rely on strangers leftovers found in trash bins and cockroaches found in my roommates belly button in order to survive. So I decided to write out this review before I pawn my own phone so I could buy something to eat, it’s been two weeks since my last meal and I’ve gotten desperate. I hope you guys take my wise advice and avoid downloading this monstrosity of an app. It literally ruined my life💔💔💔","title":"I am now homeless 😔💔","userName":"home123less456","date":"2020-07-09T09:48:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173308843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t know where to start, this app is the worst first of all it took all my space left and made my phone glitch. I just got this new phone and it messed it up. At first I downloaded this app to try to understand trump supporters which it would be impossible but anyway so I downloaded the app and it’s just horrible there’s a lot of stuff that is wrong with this app. I suggest you not to download it also please don’t vote for trump, he’s a liar a racist, and a rapist he is also a liar and has gotten the us in a lot of trouble. Chile anyways the people who MURDERED breonna Taylor Are still free because the system is corrupt and TRUMP should fix that  but he doesn’t care about black lives, he says “make America great again” but what he actually mean is “make America WHITE again” he only care about white people that’s why he is racist so please I advice you not to vote for him if gen z had the right to vote he would of been out already but the old people are deciding do our future and I don’t understand why anyways I’m still not done but I don’t want to waste more time please don’t download this app it will mess up your phone and give you a virus and also don’t vote for trump #ANYONEBUTTRUMP anyways ACAB have a nice day whoever read this, x","title":"Worst app","userName":"just here because of ig","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177130073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so basically i just wanted to support my local racist fat orange 🍊 buttt when i tell you what happened next you simply wouldn’t believe it! i fainted from looking at the creature on the screen. at first i thought “its huge but its so beautiful, its a mammoth ofc! anddd it has blonde hair and ya know it does stuff with its hair, it does it’s lashes, it ❤️’s wearing mascara, it it just ya know, it’s cutesie.” but thennnn I REALISED IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT IT WAS A VIRUS 🦠. we call it the orange virus. it infects your phone and the people around you with the demigorgen from stranger things, it takes you into the upside down and throw up 😋 right into your mouth 👄. after that bob ross will appear and tell you to paint 🎨 but you hear voices from behind saying PAINT YOUR INNER ARTIST 👩\u200D🎨 so you turn around and sister james is no where to be seen, so you think you’re safe but NO! not with this app. so you go to you mirror and out of nowhere you hear HI SISTERS! and you scream AGHHHHHH and faint and have a heart attack and go into a coma. then, straight after all your relatives die from the deadly flashback mary virus 🦠 that came from this app. this is all from personal experience and needs to be taken seriously ❤️, please stay safe and rate this app 1 star to warn others of this deadly virus!!","title":"uhm no ❤️","userName":"gtsreviews","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
