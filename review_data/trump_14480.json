I also noticed that when people would talk I would cut them off saying “fake news”. So when my friend said her dog died I said fake news and she hasn’t talked to me since or invited me to the funeral. I also noticed when drinking glasses of water I held the cup strangely. When eating or drinking anything it tasted Ike oranges and my palms smelled like oranges.","title":"Don’t download","rating":1}},{"id":"6178217501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sami phone","date":"2020-07-09T20:57:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"after downloading this app i accidentally left the app open on my phone that was sitting on my couch. I left to use the bathroom and when i came back i found my cat near my phone looking at it and the app had a video playing on it of trump. He threw up on the phone, had a full seizure and died because of the video. Turns out he was allergic to Cheetos and racism. Worst app ever.

If I was given a choice to rate this thing below a 1 I would.

The installation time took AGES. I was able to walk my pet fish and feed my T.V while it was downloading. Then, once the app FINALLY was ready, I opened it and a video of Donald Trump screaming at me popped up. Not to mention that the app was not user friendly on my device, a nokia 1610. The unprofessionalism and lack of creativity is why this is getting zero stars. 😾😾","title":"DESGUSTANGGG ZERO STARS ❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6178045885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Vbedoya1","date":"2020-07-09T19:59:06Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I thought this app was for funny videos but instead I got taken to a weird page with a lot of Oompa Loompa pictures. This app did not work as I expected and I was very disappointed. Not what I expected at all. Don’t get this, it seems like a fake news network. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was Chinese app a stealing my information. Quite honestly the worst app I’ve ever downloaded.","title":"Serious Malfunctions","rating":1}},{"id":"6178024430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fucyoutrump","date":"2020-07-09T19:52:01Z","isEdited":false,"review":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE! Not only did it take me six weeks to download but it crashes my phone every time I look at the app on my home screen. I wish I could give this app a 0 out of five but I will have to suffice with a 1. The app is difficult to navigate, and cluttered; and on top of that it is very confusing. Nobody should download this app it just messes with your phone and is a waste of space","title":"AWFUL APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6178013062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"someome that rates","date":"2020-07-09T19:48:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"ok so i downloaded this app because i wanted to. shortly after that i started getting a ringing in my ears and it was loud but. not only that somebody pulled my blanket off of my feat!! & it just went downhill from there after that my brothers turned viscous they ran out of they’re room attacking me like i was some piece of meat🥩😱. and then i got really mad every time i looked at the app and it was crazy. but then my little brother were chasing me around the house and they lead me to spray paint in my room that said trump 2020 idk how that got there it just appeared and a lot of other weird things happened but i hope the orange got has a great day😌🍊-xoxo🥰😍❤️💋","title":"strange things happened to me after","rating":1}},{"id":"6178003266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hopesalts","date":"2020-07-09T19:45:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to see what the orange Cheeto of a president was up too but my experiences were horrible. Weird things started to happen in my house once I got the app. My walls started screaming “white lives matter”, my dog was constantly wearing a MAGA hat, and my black boyfriend suddenly turned into a white guy named Hunter who played lacrosse and said the N word. Very odd experiences overall, would not recommend the app. \nDon’t mess with Gen-Z y’all 🥰","title":"I HATE THIS APP","rating":1}}]}
