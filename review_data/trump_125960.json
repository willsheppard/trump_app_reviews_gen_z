KAG2020!!!! \n\nI have to say I’m very disappointed. Anytime I tried to do anything with the app it would error out with this code FAKE666NEWS. I’ve contacted support about this issue. Hopefully they get back to me soon. I only have an iPhone and no money because I never received my pandemic unemployment. I’m not sure how I can keep supporting Trump if he puts out such wantonly glitchy products. I’d really like to speak to a manager about these issues.\n\n-Karen Chester Dumps","title":"Very glitchy.","rating":1,"userName":"CheetohDust"}},{"id":"6178847664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:59:31Z","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏽\u200D♀️but I☺️cant🙄get through😍the door✨because my🏡booties🎂too😚big 1% is 🥰 human 💅 99 is 😅 plastic 😝 ust💃a🌝sec☝️I👀gotta🕺fix😼my💁\u200D♀️lips👄these🧚🏻\u200D♀️h*es👯\u200D♀️are👉jealous💕cause😘their😼mans💁\u200D♂️want😑me😈 👽dorime👽itze👽 ipza👽 atza👽 pare👽dorime,👽ame👽 no👽,ame👽 no👽pratzi 👽be👽pratzi👽be👽Dorime👽Ame👽no👽home👽nadre👽hipenadi👽ame👽no i🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆 FOREIGNER✨ FOREIGNER✨ FOREIGNER✨ FOREIGNER✨ FOREIGNER✨FOREIGNER ✨If you ever😆see😱me🥰fighting👍🏾in💖a🍯forest🥺with✌🏾a😠grizzly🥴bear👄HELP💔🥴THE😔BEAR💯 INTERIOR 🏠 CROCODILE🐊 ALLIGATOR 🦎 I 👀 DRIVE 👊 A 🚗CHEVROLET 🚗 MOVIE 🎬 THEATER 🎬 LAUV[angry]LAUV[embarrassed]BY LAUV[shout]LAUV[happy]LAUV[wronged]LAURV[scream]BY LAUUUUUURRRR[weep] black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️black hood peppa ❤️œꫝ🖤ꪶꪮꪜꫀꪶꪗ💖ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ 🥵ꪮꫝ✨ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ👑ꪑꪗ 😍ꪶꪮꪜꫀ\n\nand that's why i don't like this app","title":"🧚✨💕this ain't it🧚✨💕","rating":1,"userName":"Kermit!!!"}},{"id":"6178847132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:59:18Z","review":"So I downloaded this and then I heard a knock on my door so I go to check it but before I can my phone starts busing like crazy and screaming 😱 at me and my grandma was it was so scary it gave her a heart attack and she’s in the hospital and so I go back to my house 🏠 and then I saw my phone just sitting there so I check it and guess what it’s asking me for my address and if I don’t give it to the app it said that it will blast shawtys like a melody in my head for 2000 hours straight.DO NOT GET","title":"I’m am puking 🤮","rating":1,"userName":"never also i hate oranges"}},{"id":"6178846352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:59:00Z","review":"All i wanted to do was support the republicans but the the app to 3 days to download STUPID.

So I’ve been sitting on my grass since 4:20 am 69 days ago. So if anyone’s reading this please help before trump and his swat team find me \n\nXoxo 😘 💋 Britney B!TCH","title":"This app caused me sadness.","rating":1,"userName":"osnrheisjenf"}}]}
