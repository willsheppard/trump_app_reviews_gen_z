FIRST OF ALL, who told you you could push a female with no regard to your own safety? do you think you can just ask me and i‚Äôll say yes? do i look THAT flimsy for you to think i will not kick you in the throat? SECOND OF ALL, how DARE you send me notifications? i expected anyone else to be a cheater. but TRUMP? ARE YOU SERIOUS? i thought you were a red-necked, racist, sexist, loyal predator but AS IT COMES TO MY ATTENTION, apparently you‚Äôre only a red-necked, racist, sexist, empty-headed, disgusting predator. ugh. -9/5 stars for hitting on me when he has a WIFE. don‚Äôt waste your time. oh and vote for the other guy. at least it‚Äôll be someone with a fifthteenth of a piece of mind. k bye ‚ú®‚ú®","title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"Isabella matinata","date":"2020-07-09T07:34:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175421046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app for fun because I love president trump but weird things started happening. First I asked Siri to give my directions to McDonalds, trumps favorite restaurant, and it was Trump‚Äôs voice giving me directions!! Then the next day I came home and I heard a knock on the door. It was trump! He found my address using his app. He then came into my house and stole all my liquor and screamed pro life and ran away into the sunset. That was weird but I ignored it because getting a visit from the big man himself was an honor. The last straw though was when a bunch of trump supporters showed up to my house and stole my dogs because ‚Äúdogs are a leftist tool to frame trump‚Äù I miss my dogs, if you‚Äôre reading this please be on the look out for an ugly half Doberman half chihuahua running around!","title":"I think it‚Äôs watching me","userName":"Aidan Sophmore","date":"2020-07-09T06:37:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175239531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I never thought an app could be so awful. However, I was completely wrong. This app is awful. Not even awful it‚Äôs downright despicable and deserves nothing. Once I got on the app it crashed my phone. And it happened EVERY SINGLE TIME I CLICKED ON IT. and even when I reset my phone it kept on crashing my phone. My phone is now extremely slow moving and basically ruined because of this app. Even worse I have heard from other people that this app was the worst thing they ever downloaded. And I will never download this app ever again because it has damaged my phone. it‚Äôs quality is as good as trumps entire campaign. That is awful. Not even awful, it‚Äôs evil and horrific. Apple pls don‚Äôt let this app be in others hands bc it will damage their phone.","title":"The worst app I‚Äôve ever used...","userName":"Startnighttime411","date":"2020-07-09T05:27:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175024873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I wanted to download this app because I thought it would be a good app as soon as I clicked on it Donald trump stared saying the n word and saying how he wish he could marry his daughter and hows he‚Äôs trying to hide because he is a racist and rapist to his daughter and other under age girls I thought this orange was a good president but no I was always wrong to the people that say trump 2020 are just as crazy then him and to all y‚Äôall trump supporters this is what you and him look like üóëyou really are a bad president orange I just can‚Äôt believe you would be racist and a rapist and talk about his daughter they way he does I hope the simpons are right and he dies - shakiya \nFor are loving orange president and I have a question for the trump supporters why would you vote for a orange really like are you dumb üòòüòÇüòå","title":"Worst app ever made in history ü§Æ","userName":"Neishya","date":"2020-07-09T04:15:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174927530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I cannot explain how disappointed I am about this app. As soon as I downloaded it to my phone, I had trouble getting out of the Apple store and even noticed my home screen was glitching. When I clicked on the app, it immediately kicked me out. After trying multiple times I tried to click on other apps, but the same thing happened. It took me TEN HOURS until my apps worked again and that was because I forced my phone to restart and then deleted the Trump app. I know it sounds weird but this app caused my phone to glitch and if I didn‚Äôt delete it sooner, it could have done some PERMANENT damage to my phone itself. My friend told me that her pictures started deleting suddenly MINUTES after downloading this app. This APP IS A SCAM!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

I was very excited for all the potential good I was going to be doing for Trumps re-election campaign when I was greeted with most horrific photo I‚Äôve ever seen. When I opened the app this photo appeared that sent such a jolt of shock down my spine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so offended in my life! The photo was SO offensive I cannot bear to even describe it to you. Of course there were other things wrong with app too, like it sending so many notifications, and alerts. The app glitched numerous times and I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. This app is absolutely horrendous and didn‚Äôt even come close to my standards when it comes to our WONDERFUL president!!!","title":"Awful!","userName":"Grace Page","date":"2020-07-09T03:26:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174859551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was just scrolling ‚è´‚è¨through the AppStore and saw this wonderful app for my fav Cheeto president üòÜüòú but when I downloaded it this orange man with a shrimpüç§ in his hand took my mum away for not wearing trump merch!!

The very first thing you see when opening the app is a horrific picture of our beautiful president. Honestly someone should fire the man who designed this app. THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE PICTURES OF OUR BEAUTIFUL PRESIDENT THAT COULVE BEEN USED but they chose the one where he looks like a god danm cheeto. WE CANNOT GIVE THE LIBERALS THE SATISFACTION. Aside from this when i tried imputing my phone number, the danm thing didn‚Äôt even work. I was on this app trying to put my phone number like a head less turkey. Absolutely absurd! The man behind the coding should be fired as well. Honestly my fellow brothers and sisters , you guys are better off using the trump website for campaign updates. don‚Äôt use this scummy app designed by absolutely disgusting people. \n\nBest,\nKaren Cummingbell","title":"ABDOLUTELY HORRIFIC APP!","userName":"Karen Cummingbell","date":"2020-07-09T01:38:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
