Everytime I opened the app I had to wait exactly 4 hours and 33 minutes for it to work. The wait was absolutely excruciating, and it was all for nothing because it was never functioning correctly. Also the graphics of the app are visually disgusting it made my eyes vomit every single time I had to look at it. Also Trump 2020? Couldn’t you be more creative jeez. Besides all of that I was promised that the app would have mini games, which by the way it ABSOLUTELY DID NOT!!! THAT WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. By the way if you were to download this awful app then remember to leave an awful review and rate it the worst because it deserves it for wasting MY TIME.","userName":"nfgvdf","title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:38:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172719607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible it took about 6 hours to download and my internet is really good but I was able to eat some carne asada while I was waiting and when i opened it the app kept on glitching and taking me oof the app so I let it be for like 2 hour while I walked my dog and my pet rock his name is rick and he’s beautiful I recommend you to have a pet rock they are easy to take care of require a little bit of food and water but anyways about the app I opened it a couple hours later and instead of taking me off the app it kept glitching and showing an orange circle I got really startled and my pet rock rick kept in screaming and doing some rick noise so I quickly deleted it it was the worst experience ever.","userName":"lil_darkie","title":"Super bad app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:37:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172654290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am 19 years old, ready to vote this November, and I wanted to explore my options. So, I did the most logical thing: downloaded Donald Trumps official app to try and grasp what he’s about, to see if he was the canidate for me. After downloading the app, I had terrible nightmares of an orange who, when met with science and factual evidence, screamed “FAKE NEWS” and spit a lot when he talked. There is a Bumble bee that keeps flying around my room that screams over and over “CHINA CHINA CHINA!” and I can’t stand it!!! I fully believe that this was all caused by downloading this app. Not only will I not be voting for Donald Trump in November, I am also BEGGING YOU do NOT download this app!!! You will suffer the way I did... probably even worse!!! Stay safe!!!","userName":"angermonth","title":"Save yourself","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:19:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172622652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was sitting at home when my republican self decided to go and download the app so I could learn about my president. I had no idea that this was a thing so I was thrilled to get it. As soon as I hit the download button my phone started glitching. It was almost like this app was a virus or something. I decided to let it be for a while and when I came back an orange hand was reaching out of my phone and trying to take my dog. 😪😖Unfortunately I did not make it in time to help my dog so she got pulled into my phone and is now trapped in there. Sometimes I can still hear the barking from my phone. Anyway I will need a years worth of therapy to het over that traumatic experience. ✨Bark Bark✨\nSkippy?

As soon as I opened the app it started chanting “Go take ur RUMP and vote for TRUMP.” I was horrified and in church so I tried to close the app but it just kept getting louder. Eventually my phone got so loud and was using so much energy at once that it exploded and shards went everywhere. No one got hurt, but I wouldn’t recommend the download of this app. I’m on a new phone now and here to warn you. Please spread the information and let people know how bad the app is.","userName":"emma2578","title":"Do NOT take to church","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:06:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172579509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first went on the app I was excited to support our one and only rotten orange 🍊. But when I opened the app I saw a Cheese Cheeto puff and my phone dropped from my hand and it went rolling down the stairs 😭. My phone broke into tiny pieces and my dust mite pet stepped on one small piece and died 😭🤧. I am currently writing this on my spare potato that I had some where for back up. When I got my phone my parents said not to break it quickly but trump said “you wanna see some real speed 😏” and broke my phone 😔. I am sorry but I can’t support this rotten orange anymore. And I warn everyone to no download the app or else expect bad accident ⚠️. Maybe my dusty(my pet dust mite 😪) and my phone rest in pieces 😭 😭 😭","userName":"Rachel Adams123","title":"The story of the rotten orange","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:58:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172535943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is horrible .  it’s supporting a rapist , racist , homophobic , & just a horrible person in general . why would you want him as a president ?  this is unacceptable to have on this app store . TAKE IT DOWN !! america was never great , everything trump said was a lie. he said he was going to have justice & freedom for everyone but passed a bill saying healthcare workers can decline care to lgbtq + members , he said mexicans are rapist (when trump is actually one) , & he wants police to shoot blm protesters for wanting equal rights. trump is a disgusting person & all he’s gonna do is protect white people. he doesn’t care about no one else.  trump needs to be in jail for what he’s done , not in the office. apple why are supporting this white supremacist ?","userName":"bsumabenwhhehbauanvehqn","title":"delete this app !","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:46:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177898831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is getting a 1 star review because if our ✨orange hot cheeto✨ wants to ban TikTok, we’ll just ban him ❤️❤️ 😻 we treat you 🍊💫 how you treat us ❤️✨ I definitely will vote for trump 2020, but in a grave 💘💘 very childish and much ✨adequate✨ of you to ban TikTok because gen z hurt your feelings and you had to cry about it 😰😰 and I will ✨kindly✨ ask if I can i plz date barron trump because he’s so hot 🥵🥵 plz don’t cry when anonymous takes over your job 💆🏻\u200D♀️💆🏻\u200D♀️💌 i want to sue you for everything you’ve done🥺🥺 but put it aside🙈 this app makes me go blind but ever since I saw that my president is a ✨hot cheeto puff✨ i mentally wanted to rip my eyes😪😞 I feel bad for the Cheeto company honestly having someone impersonating them 🥺","userName":"✨barron trump's future wife✨","title":"✨trash app✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:11:00Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177780674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"to start off I was having a completely normal day then I started getting random glitches on my phone when I was trying to walk my pet tiger. then once I got home my phone completely stopped working. not only that but he is banning a completely fine app and keeping this one which is the one that truly deserves to be deleted I know I’m not alone in this because there are many people that are saying they also got random glitches and I don’t want more people to go through this.

Trump 2020 🧚🏽🌈but behind bars🥰✨. the only 5 star ratings on this app are from uneducated self proclaimed trumpets touting their mantra of “trump 2020” with no evidence of anything beneficial trump has done to our country. this man has done nothing for the USA other than humiliate it as a whole and make it the laughing stock of the world. not to mention he is trying to pull out of WHO. what a moron.","userName":"annah borshion","title":"trash.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:22Z","isEdited":false}}]}
