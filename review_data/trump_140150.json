As soon as it downloaded a portal opened up and out came demons, ghost, even trump himself. That orange face paint he has on, scared me so much. I tried to tell him to put  a shade that fit his skin tone but he wouldn’t listen to me. Then the demon and ghost attacked me and tried to take me to the underworld. Apparently trump was also a ruler down there. Next to hades and satan. I wasn’t about to go down without a fight!! I had my alien brothers and sister help me in the war to save the world/ my life. After 6 months we won. We sent them back to the underworld and the world is safe. you’re all welcome btw. This app made me experience something crazy and life threatening that I don’t wanna go through that again. I’m not downloading this app again.","title":"Crazy experience with this app","date":"2020-07-10T05:03:05Z","userName":"💔XdiamondX💘","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179535710","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Causes other apps to crash","title":"Glitches","date":"2020-07-10T05:03:02Z","userName":"icecube474","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179535597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"no. just no.","title":"i dont like it","date":"2020-07-10T05:03:00Z","userName":"FartyFace","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179535487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"“The fact is,” she writes, “Donald’s pathologies are so complex and his behaviors so often inexplicable that coming up with an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis would require a full battery of psychological and neurophysical tests that he’ll never sit for.”\n\nAt another point she says: “Donald has been institutionalized for most of his adult life, so there is no way to know how he would thrive, or even survive, on his own in the real world.”","title":"The worst","date":"2020-07-10T05:02:58Z","userName":"Kay_and_v","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179535391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i👁 climbed 🧗\u200D♀️ out⬆️of my head👩\u200D🦲 and watched👁👄👁myself implode🧨💥 a thought 💭 without a body🧍\u200D♀️ought to be the shot🔫 to take a load💩 off📴 my brain 🧠 is poison☣️☠️ and i’m searching🔎🔍 for the antidote🥛🧪 but everytime🕒⌛️⏳i find it my defenses 🥊🥅⛓scream😱🤬🙀OH NO😾🙅\u200D♂️🚫YOU DONT😡🚫 woah😳✨","title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷","date":"2020-07-10T05:02:56Z","userName":"WAR TIME BABY","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179535287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"All I wanted to do was show my support for our AMAZING president by downloading his app, but then I was hacked!

Curiosity (which I’m now rebuking) made me download this app, but after looking around a bit; a question popped up. Why? Why does this app exist?

Why would anyone (much less myself) care about the events of the worst Administration to exist, so far?","title":"Like, Why?","date":"2020-07-10T05:02:50Z","userName":"Deathstarkush","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179534906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The flavor was shitty🤩🤩","title":"Yas girl","date":"2020-07-10T05:02:45Z","userName":"gizelle94","isEdited":false}}]}
