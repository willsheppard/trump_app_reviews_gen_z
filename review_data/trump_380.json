When downloading the app it played dance monkey on full volume 24/7, 7 days a week, 30-31 days a month. I started crying immediately. Screw you. And FYI I have a huge fear of dance monkey it is a danger to society and it needs to be destroyed just like this app. Bugs and critters were attracted to the song, so my house them became infested. My family was not pleased with the music as it played all the time, there was nothing I could do to stop it I tried everything. I tried smashing my phone, throwing it out the window, and putting it in rice but there was nothing that could work. In that time my sister graduated the third grade and moved to California with her boyfriend, cheeto infested rats moved into our fridge, and we ran out of food in our fridge. I was looking for help in the app, and I pressed a link and boom… everything bursted into flames except for the bugs, critters, and me. They starting singing dance monkey even louder. It got louder by the second. \nThis is a true story and the world needs to know to never never EVER download this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173667798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:31Z","rating":1,"title":"🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗","userName":"V-chill","review":"This app is just not it. Let me begin by saying my family has a horrible fear of bugs. Once, all of us threw up at the sight of a lady bug. Anyways, when I opened this app, my phone started glitching really bad. It kept turning on and off, starting opening random apps, and started playing this really creepy music. Keep in mind that I wasn’t touching my phone at all, so the app was making all of this happen. This glitching went on for 6 hours. My phone then stopped glitching, but something even worse started to happen. My phone got really hot and caught on fire! It ruined my brand new rug😥. Then, out of no where, my phone started spilling out bugs! I’m talking Caterpillars, ants, cockroaches, spiders, etc. my family saw it and starting throwing up all over the place! My phone was still on fire, and it burned the whole house down. Thankfully, my family made it out just in time. Now, we are living at my grandparents house. I hate it here, it smells like booty hole. In conclusion, my phone is broken and my house I burnt down all because of our ugly 🍊presidents’ app. I do not recommend.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173363875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:05Z","rating":1,"title":"🤢🤢","userName":"elephant3456789","review":"This app is terrible. If I could give 0 stars I WOULD. The downloading process took about a month. The app also encouraged to eat raw slugs if you find them in your house. It also promotes bullying little fish, the poor fish on this app are getting treated awful. Maybe Donald Trump’s can get another small loan of a million dollars to help these fish out on his own app. It’s a disgrace. “All Lives Matter” then why aren’t you helping these fishh!!!!!!!!!! I also must say that there was a creepy orange man on my screen when I first downloaded it, I’m hoping it was a glitch but please fix that cause I had nightmares from it. Also the notifications I received from this app were very inappropriate things like, “These people are thugs” and “Women are dogs” and “Chinese Virus” along with many more but these are the least offensive. So hopefully that can be changed too. There are so many things wrong with this app but the last thing I should mention if you plan on downloading this app is that IT BLEW UP MY PHONE! I’m telling you it actually exploded I had to buy a new one. In conclusion I do not recommend this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173160984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:52:05Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible App.","userName":"donaldtrump'sshriveledpp","review":"As soon as the app finished downloading, I opened it, logged in and all that jazz. What I didn’t expect was, the president coming out of my phone screen and then continuously beating me to a pulp. You heard me right. Donald Trump jumped out of my screen into my room just to beat me!!!!! It doesn’t even end there. For some reason it asked for my address? So I gave it to them like an idiot. Within 5 minutes of giving them my address, they came into my house once again, just to go into my fridge, steal all my food, they went into my parent’s room and took a 72 hour nap!!!!This app has also caused my phone major issues. One of them being that every time I try to get off the app, it takes me back on the app. If I try to leave the app again, they fill my screen with nude pictures of Donald Trump!!!!!! It led my phone to have several viruses and every time I’m off my phone, it turns back on and gets on the all by itself!!!!This app needs to be deleted off the app store. Please remove this off the app store so others don’t have to go through what I went through. 💞✨🧚🏼💫💖","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177572311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:53Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP!😡","userName":"zableploxus","review":"This app is downright the worst app i have ever downloaded.😡 It glitches every two seconds and i’m pretty sure my phone got a virus from it. It pops up ads every other second, and i can’t even read any information. When i do, it’s all biased and fake news, or extremely racist and misleading. 🤯I would give this horrible, joke of a failed app 0 stars if i could!!! Needs to be removed from apple immediately! My phone will never work property again because of this monstrosity of an app. First, my phone screen turned black and orange. It flashed strange pictures and i thought my phone was being taken over by a hacker 😱Then, random noises started playing, mind you i was in a public setting and it was extremely embarrassing. Trump yelling about how we shouldn’t wear face masks was blasting from my phone, even though i thought my ringer and volume were off. I can’t even tell you how badly my phone has been working ever since i downloaded the app. The battery drains in 5 minutes, the internet is extremely slow, and I have no storage. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177429372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:57Z","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP MADE ME GET A DIVORCE😡😤","userName":"msreviewerb","review":"First I would like to start off with how it asked me if I was 17 or older as if assuming I was a brain dead teen and know nothing. Then the app took TWO WEEKS to download forcing me to delete all of the pictures of my wonderful Live Laugh Loving family. When it finally downloaded it used the rest of my storage! To make matters worse, when I opened the app the first thing they did was ask for my phone number! Was that some kind of joke? I’m already married so I can’t think of any other reason why they would want my number. Do not download if you don’t want pictures of your family to be gone. My daughter Maddeigh, who will be a senior in High School next year, is in tears because I had to delete her senior pictures in order to download this app. My son, Zacareigh, is surprised because he thinks that I had the audacity to sit on my phone for the two weeks waiting for this app to download. And my LIVE LAUGH LOVING husband is furious that I almost gave my number to another man. 0/10. Don’t recommend unless you want your family to crumble to shreds. 😭😢😱😨😥🤔😪😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177212587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:43:27Z","rating":1,"title":"TRUMP KILLED ME WITH THIS APP🥴😵🙃","userName":"💫🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨rip✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️💫","review":"I never usually take the time to review anything but my experience with this app was too awful not to share. I wanted to see what the app includes because i’m on the email and text list but was hoping I could get all of my information from one spot but upon downloading it I quickly realized that was a mistake. My phone glitched and powered off and I thought it just died but then it immediately turned back on and the only thing on the screen was a shadowed figure. it sounded like trump and all he said was “time to kill these mf’s” and then a strobe light flashing started happening on my screen and then because of my epilepsy I had a seizure and passed away. I can’t believe he would use all of the information from our phones listening to us to figure out what could kill us and actually do it... I’m so shocked by the fact that he actually killed me and because of his I have decided that I will no longer be supporting him or his campaign... so unprofessional for him to kill people that are just trying to download his app :( would rate it 0 if I could","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174839541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:18:55Z","rating":1,"title":"This is the worst app ever 🙈💞🌝","userName":"Jparker765394","review":"Corn dogs and chicken and I have to get some food for my kids tomorrow night so I will go get some stuff done and I’ll be home by five or five so I will go to get a quick call you can just go to pick it it will go to pick up some food I don’t have to go get to the park I don’t have any good food and I will be home around two and I can pick y’all I’ll pick y’all around five minutes late I don’t have to get to the bed yet but I’m gonna I wanna was the time I wanna go get home I wanna is a time for me your brother and your sister are going crazy and you have a good time to talk to him about the kids I don’t have to get a picture and then we go to pick up some food I don’t have any idea where I’m goin you want me a lot more than I wanna was the way it I wasn’t sure what it it would do if I was just going crazy I just don’t want you guys going out there I don’t know if y’all want me or you guys want me just to get you something to go get home I don’t have any yet if you wanna I don’t want you guys to come get home and I get home I don’t have any money to do it I wanna is","isEdited":false}}]}
