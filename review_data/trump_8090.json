I downloaded this app to see what my “amazing” president was doing. I saw a orange getting spray tanned.🤢 The app was very glitchy and you barely learned anything on there  it is like school.🥱 There was this one Cheeto that kept popping up but who ever installed there wig did a bad job. The logo is very basic and is like they put no thought into it. This has no right being number one for news. I didn’t learn or get any information out of it.‼️✨🦋🤩🧚","title":"Trash","userName":"jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174080796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I went on the app it took a while to load so I took a walk I watch the whole movie of titanic I watched endgame I came back to my phone it was still loading I went to go check on my dog and my dog was missing a couple minutes later he came back with Burger King I asked what you get and he said a big Mac the big Mac was too hot for him so he put it in the microwave and then it was too cold so I just threw it away and it was still loading when I got into the app I saw Cheetos fingers","title":"Never again","userName":"jesse08amaya2008","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174080277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has DESTROYED my livelihood by not only causing me to get the Rona but also making my dog barf in my bed from being around my phone with this app on display. The look in my dogs eyes said 🤢 and I couldn’t agree more with her. After showing this app to my father and mother they both agreed to getting a divorce and my cousin then proceeded to drive off a cliff. All of these events happened in the span of 5 mins and I refuse to give a high rating for an app that KILLED my cousin. The only good part about the app was deleting it.","title":"No❤️","userName":"Risa1245544","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174059829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this app to a cheeto with corn hair .this is one of the worst views i have seen, i then proceded to show my family and turns out it we got a deadly disease and now my entire family is in the emergency room fighting for our life.

I thought... what could it be? My libtard father was in the next room, so that couldn’t be it. My Alexandria Ocacio Cortez podcast was playing loudly, but he’s used to that. Then I looked down at my phone... it was the trump app front and center. The very thought of Donald trump sent poor Hillary into a vomiting frenzy. She then passed out and didn’t wake for 3 days, which is precisely when I deleted this godforsaken app. I pray night and day that nobody downloads this app ever again. Amen 🙏🏻","title":"Appalled.","userName":"Skirtsrock5","date":"2020-07-08T23:09:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174041045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The first thing I open the app up to is a crinkled old Cheeto. My eyes have never been this destroyed. I’ve had to get 5 surgeries and 6 eye implants from that old crinkled Cheeto. The next thing I see is a old Cheeto getting a spray tan and my eyes are balling out. I show it to my dog and he deceases then I show it to my cat and she disappears in thin air. I still don’t know where she went... Pls delete this app before people loose more important people in their family this app is a disgrace and this crinkly old Cheeto is a disgrace to humanity.","title":"WORST APP EVER I THINK IT SOULD BE DELETED","userName":"Becca54742362","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174029803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was so bad that just simply deleting it and moving on with my life wasn’t enough. It gave me a virus, exposed me to so many toxic people and tried to oppress me in every way possible. Not to mention the pictures were just horrifying!!!! How can someone be so orange?!???? I literally gagged and then my pet pterodactyl had to bring me a cup of tea just to feel better. Don’t get this app unless you want to ruin your life and the lives of every living thing around you😓","title":"The worst app ever......
