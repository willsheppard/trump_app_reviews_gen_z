A lot of the times I click on it it has to reinstall on its own and the app itself is extremely slow.

The second I opened my app, my phone started going crazy! It’s like it possessed my phone. Then my pet snake started hissing at me! She eventually made a strike and hit my left eye! I am now completely blind in my left eye. Well actually it’s gone. But the app did something to my snake. It started playing the weirdest music and it went on from there.

Disgusting. Had to wash my eyes out with Clorox bleach but that didn’t hurt nearly as much as the pain I went through during my brief experience on this app. Please for the love of god do NOT download, you will regret it. Parents, please keep a watchful eye on your children’s’ devices, and if one of them has this app on their phone you might as well throw the whole kid away.

This is obviously a clickbait app that uses “TRUMP” as a way to get the attention of music goers 🙄. People were saying it was an app of really bad trumpet players and thought the videos i saw were funny! I downloaded it to find NO TRUMPETS 💔!!!! IT WAS ALL A LIE! I did more research and found that the people who were spreading those videos were actually liars and apart of this “TRUMP” app. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING!
