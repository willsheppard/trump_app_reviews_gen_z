After waiting an hour, my phone finally turned on and i had so many apps open that i didn’t visit. My Chase app, My Paypal account, Life 360, etc. Any apps with my personal information were open!!! Don’t trust this app unless you want to risk getting hacked. Plus trump is tied to sex rings and is using immigrant children. Trump is racist and a rapist. He sexualizes his own daughter🤢 and treat women news reporters poorly."}},{"id":"6173503936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Such a bad app design","date":"2020-07-08T19:47:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nopgun","review":"It crashed immediately after it took almost an hour to download and was blank every time I tried to open it, it gave them my phone number without my knowledge and now no matter how many times I’ll block the benumbed they won’t stop giving me links to trump merch, I’m pretty sure it gave my phone a virus too it’s been working really bad ever since I downloaded it, I also got emails and it said there was a login to both my twitter and Instagram accounts without me giving it any information DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6173434190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"stan twice","date":"2020-07-08T19:23:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"vixtoriia","review":"stupid orange oompa loompa \n지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, o"}},{"id":"6173408484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It made my hair turn into spaghetti noodles 😿🙀🍝","date":"2020-07-08T19:14:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"NoodleHead:(","review":"First of all, it took way too long to download. I even tried to download it again after the first attempt. I thought maybe it was because my storage was full, so I deleted Wattpad 😿😿😿. With high hopes, I tried to download it again, but it made my phone shut down!!!🙀As I tried to turn my phone back on, I noticed my reflection on the black screen. My hair had turned into spaghetti noodles!!!!🙀😾😿 I’m very upset. This app has turned my hair into noodles, and now I don’t have any friends."}},{"id":"6173378979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😬😬😬","date":"2020-07-08T19:04:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mt.iwannahawk-Sligo","review":"This app was a waste of my time, I downloaded it expecting to be informed but then it ask you for wayyyyy to much information and I’m just not okay with that. Don’t download this app.. creators please fix everything. Start at the beginning and then scrap the idea and apply your knowledge and skill in a more constructive way. Don’t use your years of app development knowledge to serve a Cheeto. This said Cheeto wouldn’t ask you for a pastrami sandwich. Or ask you to bring him a branded bottle of water, before acknowledging your talents. Do better, don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6173367765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Would give 0 stars if I could","date":"2020-07-08T19:00:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Britt wherever","review":"Downloaded this so my parents could follow the campaign. Absolutely a terrible app. Not only is it glitchy but half the time it doesn’t even open. I was really hoping that this app would help my parents decide to vote this September but it’s so bad that it’s not even worth the download. All in all a terrible app and not useful whatsoever. Stick to the internet campaigns even if it’s charged 9$ every time some opens an ad. I don’t wanna take money away from the trump for his paid advertising but this app is the worst!!"}},{"id":"6173349379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Call Spencer Reid","date":"2020-07-08T18:54:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Wallpaper fanatic23456789","review":"If I could rate this app 0 stars, I would. This app personally attacked me as it grew arms and legs and beat me. It did not even offer to pay the hospital bill. I’m currently in the hospital typing with my left big toe as both of my arms are shattered. I attempted to call the police, however, they were unresponsive as I am a black transgender woman. The oppression in this country is astronomical. I turned to the only person I could think of, dr. Spencer Reid. This kind man with a heart of gold (unlike mr. Trump), paid my hospital bill and is helping me learn to walk again. Spencer Reid for president 2020❤️"}},{"id":"6173343273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t become slow and dumb","date":"2020-07-08T18:51:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"pipercanty:)","review":"DONT GET THIS APP. When I first got this app I thought it was gonna be super easy. ‼️❌WRONGGG❌‼️ I had to wait a whole day for it to download. Which makes sense cause trumps people are slow in head I’m not surprised that the app controlling them is even slower. Which is really sad cause trump supporters are already at all time low. Does that mean this app is at a Negative all time low????   YESIR!!!!  so in conclusion this app is slow, the people using this app is dumb, and Trump is slow and dumb. Don’t get this app if you don’t want to become slow and dumb!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173330091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely awful","date":"2020-07-08T18:47:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Juicy Fruit Box","review":"I got this app so that i could see events and stuff for our oh so great president so imagine how I felt when i was failed and greeted by a glitchy screen, my cat even died after seeing the app and this app offers so much false information and glitches.  I regret getting this app, not to mention how long it took to download in the first place!  I swear I've been waiting for 10 days for it to download.  Im conclusion this app is a waste of time and i know have to go buy a new phone because the glitch was my phone broke 😡😡😤."}},{"id":"6173316924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"sad snowflake","review":"i was very interested to see what trump had to offer on his app, but upon opening, i was met by a furious and offensive trump calling me various slurs??? i was beyond offended, i was appalled, but thought maybe it was a glitch. but then i looked out the window in my living room and there he stood, trump and his goonies. they started to march up and down the street yelling the same slurs! i went back to the app and it was a just a black screen that said in white writing “the time is now.” the time is now for what?? i am scared and appalled that this happened and i beg you all, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}}]}
