I accidentally opened my fridge outside in space, i saw yellow dogs and purple apes. This app overall made me squash my toes on a concrete block before 12am and after the lights turned on. I can’t believe how awful my cape ripped in the desert on my way home in Antarctica, i had to cross the ocean and climb the shelves. It also made me gain weight.","userName":"MIAH KARSON","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:59:46Z","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174576566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Beautiful app for all.

I opened the app and all I saw were Cheetos hung by their Cheeto feet. I am traumatized forever. I will never look at Cheetos the same way after this. My children also have the app and they opened it up to Donald trump stabbing Bobby Cheeto and Timmy Cheeto saddest thing ever. Please spread the word of this Cheeto killer by the name of Donald J Trump.","userName":"buttnakednj","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:47:53Z","title":"Wow","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174483499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of helping our economy, but all I saw was an orange cheeto going wig shopping and then proceeding to work out NAKED 😩🤮 and the cheeto was old and moldy too 🤬😠 HORRIBLE customer service as well!

Who I saw staring back at me was so frightening I quaked. The orange man looked nearly out of this world. His body was so orange that he blended in with the rotting mango peel on my kitchen counter. I had never seen a man so scary, so extraterrestrial on planet earth. I do not recommend anyone else to submit themselves to this terror. Do NOT download!!!!!!!","userName":"mango girlllllll23","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:30:57Z","title":"The orange monster","isEdited":false}}]}
