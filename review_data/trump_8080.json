I found out Iâ€™m positive for chlamydia, and my dog coughed up a whole vacuum. My parents disowned me and my beliefs and I now live on the mailbox down the street. Yes, all of this happened RIGHT AFTER getting the app.\n\nMy computer also ran away, my hamster turned into a casket. My whole world is in chaos. Do not get this app unless...unless you want to rate it based on what otherâ€™s have said. Hehe, if you know what I mean.","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Zaorek"}},{"id":"6174350427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Big Cheeto man locked me in a Banana","review":"I can not explain the horrified state I was in when I opened this app. Right from the start I saw a video of Trump locking up his son Barron and throwing bananas at him. I felt personally offended that he wasnâ€™t throwing Oranges to match himself. So I immediately clicked off of it and deleted it, but to my horror I found that my house had turned into a banana. I am currently trapped and am in need of assistance. I am left eating my way out. If I donâ€™t make it out then my dying words would be, donâ€™t get this app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:54:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Google classroom hater- LAL"}},{"id":"6174348262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The most DISGRACEFUL and DISAPPOINTED app","review":"I wish I could give this -6 stars because every time I go to this app I have to see this racist, homophobic, sexist,self centered, xenophobic, and just crazy man campaigning for president and I am just wondering why anyone with common sense or a person with a moral compass would want him in the first place let alone for the NEXT FOUR YEARS! \n\nBut the app is horrible. It crashes every two seconds and does not give any information to why Trump isnâ€™t already out of office. Such a disappointment.","date":"2020-07-09T00:53:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ih8t trump"}},{"id":"6174334010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad app","review":"I opened to see naked Cheeto boy and I got sexually assaulted by a giraffe in a walrus costume dressed as Herbert The Pervert cardi b then gave me a live performance (my ears are bleeding) the titanic came crashing through my house big chungus stole my phone (typing on a microwave rn) my sewer system i was living in because of titanic incident was bombed like Hiroshima pikachu doggy styled me I am now living in a time capsule cooling down warm pancakes in my router I am very mad that this app forced me to this situation 1 Star on yelp and that is final also a triangle sung Indian pumped up kicks and stole my wheelchair","date":"2020-07-09T00:49:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"404 review not found"}},{"id":"6174333492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!!!

It constantly crashes when I try to load it up, and in the 1/1,000,000,000 chance it does load up, the screen glitches and shows me an image of a repulsive, disgusting, horrific looking figure, orange in colour, monster!! If I could rate this app lower than a 1 I would. This app is truly the most scum, vile of the Earth thing that can exist, and needs to be taken down before anyone else suffers what I have had to go through!","date":"2020-07-09T00:18:23Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"getlostbud"}},{"id":"6174228469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made me projectile vomit","review":"I do not suggest anyone downloads this app. First time I opening it I projectile vomited orange Cheetos I never even ate. When I opened the events, it teleported me to trumps sex chamber when he rapes little children and I was terrified and tried to help the kids but by the time o reached them I was teleported back and given the corona virus. Now Iâ€™m dying and canâ€™t move my toes. Also, my hair all fell out and Iâ€™ve started growing trumps Pubic hair on my head. This app is a public health hazard. Please I beg that no one uses this app for their own safety.","date":"2020-07-09T00:12:50Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Rochygkwndgiems"}},{"id":"6174208104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"just horrible","review":"i downloaded the app on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. i was bored to say the least and was looking forward to learning more the cheeto man himself and his little cult. however as soon as i opened the app i was greeted with a naked puffy cheeto cartoon. my kids were around so this was not what i was expecting. apparently this app is not what i expected itâ€™s just a bunch of nude pictures of a puffy cheeto at different angles. which i did not wanna see. anyway i will be deleting this app bc itâ€™s fake news and steals your info!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:05:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"tessss tickleee"}}]}
