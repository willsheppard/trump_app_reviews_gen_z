I will have ✨nightmares ✨for the rest of my life😔. I’m not sure if I will ever be able to see agin😞. I am hurt and offended that our insta baddie trump asked for my phone number🙄. I get that being          orange is hot and all but I don’t give my number to just anyone😤. As I stared down an incredibly spicy Oompa Loompa 🍊I realized this man could use some wrinkle cream😳. Like I get it being fine and spicy🌶 is hard🥵, especially when all eyes are on you because you can’t shut your trap🤭. I also noticed that he could use some jergens natural glow tanning lotion on his eyes👀 ( really helps even a tan)👍 also just wanted to let everyone know that after using this app I am saddened to say my fish is depressed🐠😢. I am very upset with how our insta baddie of a president treated my fish😡👊. JUST A REMINDER HE IS ✨DEPRESSED✨!!!🤬👊👊","isEdited":false,"title":"Insta baddie🧚🧚"}},{"id":"6177826783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:48:40Z","rating":1,"userName":"user9362554","review":"i wanted to download this app for our lovely 🍊𝓅𝓇𝑒𝓏𝒾𝒹𝑒𝓃𝓉𝒶🍊 but as soon as i opened the app, his nudles appeared on my screen. when i went to go puke after seeing his      🍒𝒷𝒶𝓁𝓁 𝓈𝒶𝒸𝓀🍒 he was doing a handstand in my toilet. so i had to put in his mouth, to which he puked back in mine. it went on like that for a whileeee. but finally he did a back handspring, roundoff, backflip into the SPLITS out of my toilet. he got up and looked at me and said \"tag youre it\". so i chased him out of my bedroom with a toilet called a jail cell, and he hid in my imaginary son's room. so when i went in there, he was attached to the ceiling. he fell on top of me killing me. when i was life flighted to the nearest hospital, i was 🍉𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓋𝑒𝒹🍉again by his manager. you dont wanna know what hapoened after that. dont get this app unless you want these things to happen to you.","isEdited":false,"title":"✨orange man✨"}},{"id":"6177813193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:44:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"Ya Homiegirl","review":"Took 73 hours to download and took up all of my storage. Now keep in mind, I have the newest iphone with the best storage plan, and this app RUINED it. I didn’t mind at first because I wanted to know more about Trumps policies but almost seconds after signing on to the app, I got a bunch of notifications that my information was being stolen. I wasn’t worried about this until a few hours after downloading the app my doorbell rang and when I answered it Trump was standing there and body slammed me to the ground. My elderly mother then came in to check on what was making all the noise and he tackled her onto a table breaking the table in the process. I thought this was a little unprofessional, but nobody is perfect so I went with it. Unfortunately he then bit off my ears, nose, and toes. Don’t think I can support this app now","isEdited":false,"title":"Ray Ciste😌🧚🏻✨"}},{"id":"6177579278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:32:10Z","rating":1,"userName":"Mahari.","review":"This app is SCARY!! When i opened it i saw this oompa loompa lookin cheeto on the front. I fell off the Eiffel tower and on top of a SUV that looked like a soggy chicken wing. The car was also playing the peppa pig theme song on replay. It then drove into an elephant. I was then flung all the way to JUPITER. Where i then found a talking blobfish. I showed it the app and it picked me up and threw me back to earth. I landed in my back yard and hopped on the penguin and flew to the hospital i was then greeted my a female cactus. I showed her the ugly cheeto i had on my phone and she stabbed me with her apple 87 times. I jumped to new england to see if i could find my elephant lollipop. I didnt find it so i bought a new one and teleported to Jones barbecue foot massage. It was old and run down. There i found a lotion bottle putting barbecue sauce on his toes. I screamed and it came running at me with a swing in his mouth.","isEdited":false,"title":"SCARY APP!!! terrible"}},{"id":"6177555435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:33Z","rating":1,"userName":"ThEvIpeR2014","review":"Everyone be warned for those who download this app may never return to their correct state of mind! Anyone who downloads this app will slowly start to go insane but not in the way you think..👀 First you will start to see patches of blonde hair beginning to grow 👩🏼 once your hair is fully blonde, you will then begin to start get easily irritated by very little things. After that your eyes will start playing tricks, and everywhere you go all you’ll see is TRUMP 2020 🤢 once your past that stage..it’s game over 😵 you’ll turn into a narcissist who only cares about themselves and tweet about dumb stuff 24/7! And the worst part is 😬 𝕪𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕟𝕒𝕞𝕖 𝕨𝕚𝕝𝕝 𝕓𝕖 𝕂𝔸ℝ𝔼ℕ 😱 \n\nFurthermore if you wish to stop this process from happening all u have to do is leave a 1 star review and delete the app before it’s too late 😳","isEdited":false,"title":"🆘⚠️It’s a trap⚠️🆘"}},{"id":"6177134912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:21:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"definitly not a liberal ☺️","review":"I literally downloaded this app to see how horrendous it was because I’ve heard horrible things. And they were correct because the app was horrible, slow, crashed, and looked ugly. So I go to leave my first review, which should be somewhere unless he’s censoring us, and then notice something. It literally tracks your location even when you’re not using the app. Like um. Why is king orange the fascist tracking me??? This man really has all the Karen’s worked up about China collecting data but then as the president of the United States, king of freedom and privacy, tracks all his followers locations and other data that he really doesn’t need to collect?????? I’m confused and also nervous that he’s gonna track my phone!  please get rid of this app it is a threat to American freedom and our way of life ✨✨","isEdited":false,"title":"please take this app down"}},{"id":"6176992328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:42:37Z","rating":1,"userName":"7266389283563892","review":"I got this app just to see what it was for and it wasnt bad untill writings started appearing on my wall all adding up to “trump 2020”.I just thought it was my little brother pranking me but soon my vision started getting blurry ONLY when I’m on the app.I thought I was just getting tired but the next day I started get voices inside my head to be racist and sexist.I was very confused😣a little after words I’ve never even heard of before just started playing in my head over and over and I couldn’t fall asleep to save my life🥱it did that for a while until a well uhmm “bad”word started playing over and over and I could never unsee it what picture poped into my head when i thought of it🤢🥴thats when i deleted the app right after and I do NOT recommend this app unless you want the same experience I had😬😣","isEdited":false,"title":"..."}},{"id":"6176786142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:48:10Z","rating":1,"userName":"marinasa57","review":"i downloaded this app to see if i change my perspective for trump. when i downloaded it took forever i had so much storage on my phone. once it finished downloading i opened the app and it was glitching like crazy🙄 it asked so many personal questions that wasn’t necessary. once i put it it all my personal information a few days later i saw that they stole my information! this app messed up my phone and when i was going to delete it, it wouldn’t let me delete. when i went back in i saw that it already put vote for trump so i quickly canceled it. i wouldn’t want to vote for him because he doesn’t do anything for this country. and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! it’s not worth it. unless you want your personal information stolen feel free to download it. but if i had to choose do not download it.","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!"}},{"id":"6176535226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:41:14Z","rating":1,"userName":"qaddfgh","review":"I downloaded this app a few days ago to see what Trump supporters look at for their information and to see what information Trump puts out for his supporters. I am a politically curiously person, and while I don’t support Trump in any way, I do like to view information from every source possible. When I put in my email I specifically unchecked the one box so that I would not receive any texts or emails from his administration. However I am now receiving both texts and emails- and I never even gave them my phone number. Creepy! Also not to mention, about 1/2 of the time that I try to use the app on my iPhone 8 it crashes. So overall this app was a waste of my effort as I can hardly use it and it somehow has access to information I never allowed it access to.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible and steals information"}}]}
