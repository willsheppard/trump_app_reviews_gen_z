It said Latino detected must build wall. I said that doesn’t make sense and that I’m black. The the notification changed to I’m a big racist idiot and hate black people. I started to think the app was spying me so out of fear I ran out of the house. The most terrifying part was that when I walked outside there was a orange with a suit on.

I was pulled out of my home and encaged in a metal box where they removed my clothing and belongings. When my trial finally came it was too late the damage had been done and my neighbors who themselves are trump supporters burned my house down and stole everything I had. I’m living on the street with only my phone and what’s in my wallet.","title":"Horrible App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Angel Soft"}},{"id":"6174788285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:03:48Z","review":"I don’t know what it is but right when I open up the app it started glitching! I tried to delete it and re download it but it continue to glitch. This is very upsetting because I really looked forward to using the app. I am ashamed to think that software developers for this app could not make it at least usable. Horrible experience on this app.","title":"Glitchy","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"angel_the_feen_"}},{"id":"6174724193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:44:17Z","review":"this app is sooo slow literally had to wait 20 minutes for it to open like what?? also it threatened to come to my house and kill me and my dog and that really scared me. another reason why i’m giving it one star is because it called me ugly and said i needed to lose weight. cried for an hour about that. overall i hate this app. thanks trump for threatening my dog and i and then insulting me.","title":"worst app EVER!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Chl0e15853"}},{"id":"6174707614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:39:14Z","review":"so what happen was i was eating food then my pet chicken comes and eats my food then a Dinosaur came alive and stole my credit card so then I had to get my monkey to stop him then the monkey gave my credit card back then I went to the store to buy a mc Donald’s happy meal then I went home and my monkey killed my Dinosaur I hurry up and call the ambulance and they helped my dinosaur then I grounded my pet monkey and ate my Mac Donald’s food","title":"MY PET DINOSAUR DIED FROM THIS APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"gaushahah"}},{"id":"6174703967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:38:09Z","review":"This app is a waste of the brain cells used to design it. Not that they used very many of them. The design is trash and it causes glitches and battery drain. It overloads you with notifications and adds, which are excessive even for a “news” app. I expected better from a world class politician like Donald J. Trump but was shockingly disappointed. Ten outa ten, would not recommend.","title":"This app is a waste of...","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"thats wack yo"}},{"id":"6174684412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:18Z","review":"So as I was sitting on my couch my cat crawled across my phone magically pulling up this app. At first I was suspicious but I decided to download it to see what it was all about. As soon as I opened the app I was disgusted 🤢🤮. There’s was this horrid man on the front page and I had to delete this app because it terrified my poor cat 🐈. I would not recommend to anyone. Especially if you have cats or are Cheeto intolerant.","title":"My poor cat 🐱","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Minion1008"}},{"id":"6174676011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:29:50Z","review":"I signed up for information on the Trump 2020 campaign and I thought this app would help with keeping me up to date. all I recurved were notifications of them taking my money without permission and glitches all the time. My battery has never been worse when I have this app open. Would not recommend this app to anyone, not even a LIBERAL!!!!","title":"I hate it here","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"PickMe2020"}},{"id":"6174670959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:28:21Z","review":"This has to be the worst app that I’ve ever gotten 🤬🤬🤬 The second i downloaded i saw a huge slimey hot Cheeto and the Cheeto started going crazy on the screen!!!
