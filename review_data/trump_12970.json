After I downloaded it, my closet caught on fire. I then opened the app just to find out that my social security and credit card numbers had been stolen. Every second I spent on the app after that, acid dropped from my ceiling onto my head. This app does TERRIBLE THINGS and it should be taken down immediately. Not to mention how much it glitches and the insane amount of ads.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174715248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Would give zero stars if possible!!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:41:33Z","userName":"Xavier Callan","rating":1,"review":"This app provides an ABsolutely preposterous way to praise our misogynistic Cheeto of a president. When i downloaded it, it immediately crashed. Since it kept doing this whenever clicking on the app, it continued to crash, so I deleted it. After deleting it, my phone ran incredibly slowly and it began to lose around 2% of battery per minute, which it did not do before. 😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174711545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT USE THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T02:40:27Z","userName":"alfred f jones 3","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app my screen completely shut off and I wasn’t able to turn it back on. Had to go and get it fixed and once they fixed it and got it on again I found that all of my apps had been deported to Mexico even tho they don’t speak Spanish!  My grandmother is also crying because the app made my phone come alive in the middle of the night and touched her inappropriately..

But I believe Aang can save the world.","isEdited":false}}]}
