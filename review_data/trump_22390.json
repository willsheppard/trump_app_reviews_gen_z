Really reminded me of times where I haven’t had the freedoms to dictate my own health care options. And the graphics just kept glitching like when I look at images of SCOTUS and kavannaughs face sometimes looks all predatory. Do not recommend.","userName":"mnmnd","date":"2020-07-09T13:37:57Z"}},{"id":"6176727887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i’m appalled","review":"this app is just like trump it’s slow takes up space and is just ugly. if i could give it a lower rating i would but it won’t let me. if you’re thinking of getting this DONT. it will take up all the space in your phone and doesn’t even give u info about his campaign.","userName":"cc 🧚🏻🤪","date":"2020-07-09T13:32:47Z"}},{"id":"6176727049","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!","review":"When I got this app  it asked for all of my information.

I barely escaped.","userName":"bwkdnwbfjs","date":"2020-07-09T13:32:34Z"}},{"id":"6176724650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I was walking my pet fish and left my phone at home.
