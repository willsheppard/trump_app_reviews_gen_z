Donald trump owns it. Anyways like he’s a racist and this app is just terrible and traumatic like I downloaded it and I saw Donald trump now thanks to that I have to go to the eye doctor AGAIN like ugh I already have glasses I don’t want to go blind. Like don’t be showing an Oompa Loompa when u open the app like 💀 ANYWAYS don’t download this app cuz he is racist and a rat. And Ik none of this makes sense but I have to right it so his app can get removed. U ban TikTok. We ban ur app. Gen z won’t let it go.

Then, Otis the cow from Back at The Barnyard jumped through my window and proceeded to l i c k my bare iris. I didn’t think things could get any worse, until Peppa the Pig joined this fiasco by tying me to the dining room chair, blindfolded me, and screamed “Somewhere Over The Rainbow” into my ear until the break of dawn. Don’t get this app!","date":"2020-07-09T16:17:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177278660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"so immaculately ✨🧚\u200D♀️horrible🧚\u200D♀️✨","userName":"omg🧚\u200D♀️✨","review":"i was soooo excited to be able to keep up with our cheeto’s stupid plans for 2020 and what other dumb stuff he is upto however the app only kept on showing me pictures of an ugly orange on the app, and the things on the app were incredibly dumb like whatttttt…. Anywaysss the app was completely slow like the cheeto himself, and would not stop showing me lies and FAKE NEWS, anyways I am so ✨sad✨ to see such a dumb app be even dumber thank you. ewwwwwwww trump 2020, the app has made me believe this only further✨","date":"2020-07-09T16:02:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177148604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","userName":"Suzie2978","review":"Although I had great service and all my other apps were working, this app would not seem to work! It had terrible vulgar ads pop up on my phone that I wish my eyes could unsee. Whenever I open the app, I can’t click on anything. I was really exited that I was going to have this app to support our beloved president, but I was sadly disappointed. I hope and pray that this app is removed for the safety of the youth. The only right thing to suggest is for it to be taken down immediately!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:25:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177138857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No stars","userName":"PicLab Potato","review":"Absolutely horrible app! It contacted every contact in my phone with nude pictures of Donald trump, spamming my family and friends day in and day out! It caused me to lose my job as my boss received one of these photographs. Every time you open the app it glitches and shuts off your phone. The few times I’ve been able to access it, there are terroristic threats towards third world countries - I am so confused how this is still on the App Store? I would give it no stars if I could, this is endangering America","date":"2020-07-09T15:22:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177084958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"stinky poo poo app","userName":"Ricecake2003","review":"the very first thing that happened when i opened the app is it asked me to allow notifications!!!!! now this seems like an invasion of privacy!!!! i mean, giving anyone a choice about what to do with their personal property is just wrong!!! if the PRESIDENT gives you a choice of notifications when you open the app, then how do we know that he will protect our god-given rights to tell other people what to do with their bodies!! no choice in here!!! give me notifications or give me death!!!! rump2020🍑","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177083325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disappointment","userName":"Kat22578","review":"I had been very hesitant to download the app, apparently along with all the other reviews I had come across. I finally downloaded and almost immediately upon opening up the app I chose to delete it again. The first thing I see pop up is a picture of Trump and “keep America great” which is not the best opener for him at the moment. Do better. This should be taken down and trump should stick to his live conversations that show how he truly is rather than hiding behind an app.","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177048677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible! frightening!","userName":"𝕂𝕡𝕠𝕡𝕋𝕣𝕒𝕤𝕙101","review":"If I could give it zero stars I would. It was really glitchy. I read the terms of service and privacy policy and then after I accepted they said they would keep my address and put it on an insecure website! This steals your information!! It was also very glitchy which I found sketchy, and a picture of a man with a spray ten appeared while my children were looking at my screen! They were frightened and I am sure they will have nightmares. I do NOT recommend this AT ALL.","date":"2020-07-09T14:57:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176959083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"EWWWW TRUMP","userName":"pennzz_07","review":"so i downloaded the app and all i saw was an orange creature with the ugliest hair i have ever seen and then i realized it was our president you know the racist sexist one anyways, once i realized i was on the trump app i had no idea when or why i had downloaded the app i realized at some point i had been brainwashed to download his app, so right away i deleted it came here and wrote this review the world needs to know about the brainwashing he is doing. Anyways, bye now i hope none of you had to go through this traumatizing experience.☺️","date":"2020-07-09T14:33:38Z","isEdited":false}}]}
