The only time this app worked, I looked outside and there was a big orange man in my front yard chanting “build that wall” and “all lives matter”. He then stole my children, rode off on a horse, and told me he was taking them to “the island”? If anyone knows where that is, please let me know!!","date":"2020-07-08T13:55:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very Disappointed"}},{"id":"6172324105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"k-degree","review":"Chile anyways... this app made my phone glitch so BAD LIKE LITERALLY I COULDNT USE MY PHONE AT ALL. I almost ended up buying a new phone smh. Anyways this app gives false propaganda and is feeding our children horrible views and ideologies🥱🤬. It’s sickening to see stuff like this now especially in 2020. Lordt please get this app off of the App Store please🥶. Not to mention I keep seeing a Cheeto man show up😡 I hate it so much.

The joke that is our president has an app for re-election, now I don’t know about you, but I’m not a fan of toupee wearing oranges running a country. Mind you, a “free” country. Not just “free” for straight white people, so I’m good, get him out of here. Do not get this app, it’s just going to waste your time, and probably make you angry at the end of the day.","date":"2020-07-08T13:29:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever got on my phone"}},{"id":"6172252531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dhiffiffificucuc","review":"This app broke my phone😭how you may ask?

I am not a radical liberal but I have a college education and I know what’s factual and what isn’t. Trump wants your private information so he can sell it later to turn a profit. That’s how he stays rich— buying your data and selling it the highest bidder. The worst app ever. I can’t believe Apple allowed this divisive app to be allowed on their App Store. Shame on Apple and shame on trump.","date":"2020-07-08T12:56:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Propaganda and forced release of my info??"}},{"id":"6171915671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stan obama for clear skin","review":"So like I downloaded this app and then my phone started glitching like a lot and I don’t think supporting a racist homophobic sexist pedophilic Cheeto puff is the right way to go. Uhh no❤️🙈 hehe I don’t rlly even like it here so I was just wondering like when will America be great again?? This app is so bad. Like I have multiple issues with the app and the person it’s for. Dysfunctional and disgusting✨🥰 just like the Cheeto puff \n. Anyways yeah this app burnt my toe and ate my cat. So I hope you get that glitch fixed bc I will never be downloading it ever again. Spreading a false narrative and taking away minorities rights. The hypocrisy and tyranny is ✨nasty ✨ so do not recommend this app whatsoever and I’d like a refund for my troubles and traumas \n\nTrump 2020❤️✨ but on a GRAVESTONE✨💓\n\n😋 its a joke 🤗","date":"2020-07-08T11:51:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"fAkE nEWs"}},{"id":"6171882021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"m_y_n_a_m_e","review":"I downloaded the app to support the best president we have seen in decades but when I did information started to go missing from my phone and a lot of my pictures were being posted online without my consent. He is stealing our personal information and using it against us. This app has also leaked my address to Democrats and now I have ppl at my house all the time. My kids hate me now.","date":"2020-07-08T11:41:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It stole information from me 😡"}},{"id":"6170175980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pøssum","review":"I CANT WALK DONALD WHAT DID YOU DO!? I downloaded the app so I could actively support our amazing Cheeto puff president. As soon as I open the app the overwhelming amount of colors on the homepage caused me to go into anaphylactic shock and i passed out. When I woke up I couldn't move my legs!!! it's almost like they walked away:(( Downloading this app literally caused me to be confined to an electric wheelchair. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TAP DANCE NOW?!?!?! Look, I love you Donnie, I really do, but this app is just too poorly made. Do better 😔","date":"2020-07-08T00:52:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I AM UNABLE TO WALK ❌❌"}}]}
