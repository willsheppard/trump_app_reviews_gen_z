I immediately began violently retching and suffering from severe nausea. I had no clue what could have happened! However, on further investigation, I realized that it was Cheeto Man’s ugly mug staring at me the second I opened the app that was causing me such a visceral reaction! Luckily, deleting the app remedied my problem and now I feel MUCH better! If it were possible, I’d give this a rating of zero out of five stars."}},{"id":"6174477535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Gave my family seizure👁👄👁","userName":"wnehrjne","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:31Z","review":"As soon as I opened the app my cousins started having a seizure 💩and when I left my room everyone was having a seizure even my cousins chihuahua dog🐕and then the dog threw it’s self out the window 🥵and then they were chanting “TRUMP2020 ON THE GRAVE”and then I went outside and the dog was levitating 💀chanting the same thing 🥰when I finally looked down at my iPhone to see the Cheeto man🤮 my eyes haven’t been able to see 👹since I had to make my brother write this review👨🏽\u200D💻"}},{"id":"6174441647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This should be taken off the App Store.","userName":"Addy.221","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:42Z","review":"This app glitched my phone completely. It created a ugly orange virus that left homophobic, racist, and sexist comments everywhere. People were defending the app, saying that it was taken out of context, but we all know that it wasn’t. In conclusion this app is horrible and shouldn’t be offered to download. Apple has really gone downhill ever since this app came to be, and I’m awfully disgusted that they would allow something like this on there. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! IT GIVES YOU A VIRUS!!! AN ORANGE, RACIST, HOMOSEXUAL, AND SEXIST VIRUS!!!!"}},{"id":"6174425591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"fake news  💕✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️","userName":"a proud goldfish owner","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:53Z","review":"as soon as i downloaded this app, i immediately began to sob. it made my brand new phone crash repeatedly. i was locked out for a day but during that day i was able to walk my goldfish- the same one i had to walk during the last trump rally. too bad i couldn’t put those tickets to use! 🧚🏼🌿✨. i do not recommend this app to anyone simply because of the sheer sadness it brought me. since downloading, i have been plagued with dreams of cheetos taking over the world. it felt strangely real.  this app is filled with bugs and is not user friendly in the slightest. for someone who is in charge of our country, i wish he had a better app for me to reserve tickets for his rallies! hopefully this time i don’t have to walk my goldfish✨"}},{"id":"6174406052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Couldn’t get past the sign up page","userName":"laur9994","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:56Z","review":"I was excited to download this app and so disappointed at the lack of attention paid to the UI. The header banner info on my phone were in black text on a dark background, so basically impossible to read while using the app. And the app scrolls way further than the amount of content on the page. It’s like they took 5 minutes to put the whole thing together. I’m not surprised..."}},{"id":"6174386748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"AWFUL HORRIBLE AWFUL","userName":"Funnytaco100","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:06:10Z","review":"i downloaded this app on february 30th 3024 and after i downloaded it the birds that work for the government came to my orphanage and burned it down. all of the giraffes died, and it stole all of my bread. this app caused my great great grand mother to die of ajxnsnwowofudbwmnia, so sad. she was only 2 years old! this app ALSO caused my dinosaur to have a sub dural hematoma and collapse, their last words were “bürúah some times i don’t wanna be happy” 😭😭😭😭😭 so sad. such a shame. they had their whole life ahead of them. anyway bye"}},{"id":"6174383939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"👁👄👁","userName":"cody.sw","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:05:15Z","review":"I downloaded this app because Mr. Cheeto man said it was the replacement for TikTok. When I opened it I was immediately greeted with Mike Pence’s phat glorious scrumptious booty. But that’s the only good thing it has! No Barron. No Bernie. Just the smelly Cheeto man. I could barely get through the log in process before the smell Cheeto man stunk up my phone. Now I have to get a new phone! Thanks a lot smelly Cheeto man. And thanks a lot to the smelly Cheeto man’s supporters for making the smell Cheeto man smell worse! This was not fun. Guess I’ll have to vote for Kanye this year :/"}},{"id":"6174375798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just stop","userName":"some black girl","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:02:49Z","review":"First of all I had to download the app twice. The first time it blocked me because I checked the “African American” box when it asked for the ethnicity just terrible. Second off the next time I downloaded it idk what they did, but within two hours of downloading the app ice came knocking on my door claiming that my parents were illegal. When they saw that my parents were basic they took me. Please help the trump supporters are coming to bleach my skin in 48hrs #freetiktok"}},{"id":"6174341729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disgrace.","userName":"CwistinGrace","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:51:39Z","review":"🤮As soon as I opened to app I kid you not, a reeking, smelly, slimy stench arose from my screen. I thought that something had grown mold until I took my phone outside. I sat on the sidewalk and turned my phone on, and the stench arose. When I turned it back off, it had magically disappeared... 🤨 Weird, right? I continued to turn my phone off and back on again and I had figured it out. It was this darn spanking app. I hope to see it banned in the future. Thank you for listening.❤️"}},{"id":"6174332890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"this app was disgusting","userName":"luci00019","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:48:43Z","review":"this app is terrible🤢so ineffective and every aspect is very disturbing. it kept glitching, it was so boring, and it contained racism, homophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, and sexism. also,, I DONT WANT TO BE SEEING TRUMPS NUDES. it was so disturbing. children can see this!! it makes me sick. i hope no one has to use this app ever again. i’m so disappointed in apple for even letting this app be available. i hope to never have to see this again. please don’t let this stay. so disappointed in this company😳"}}]}
