Looks like this is another reason out of the millions of reason not to vote for him. \n\nMy friend also downloaded the app but when she got into it she realized that it was all filtered and fake news that trump wanted us to see. She is also getting tons of calls at all hours of the day and believes that her information was leaked to telemarketers by the people running this app.\n\nDo not get this app!!!","title":"Worst app ever 0/5 stars","userName":"people agains the cheeto","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:15:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172294397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i decided to download this app because i was curious about the one these wild, unintelligent, baboons in the streets were praising😌🖐✨ and as soon as i opened the app i was greeted by an orange orangutan 🦧 holding a fist😧😓😰 this was the one the baboons we’re talking about.😰😨 i felt like threatened by this so i tried to close the app but all of the sudden the orangutan 🦧 busted through the screen😧👏 and appeared in my room☹️😤 he got very very angry 😡😓 and started trashing my room beyond repair 😔🤚i slapped the very orange orangutan across the face😱🤕👿 and without warning ⚠️the orangutan drop kicked me out in to the sky ✨🌟🌎 after i passed through the atmosphere 💥i began to go faster until i landed here on mars☹️☹️ SOS 💢send help pls, it’s really cold and lonely😣😓😰","title":"rude behavior","userName":"ariana okie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:40:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177825026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I see no honest news that is reported , it crashes alot when i click on a report to look through , gave no factual evidence of being considered a working app , i understand it sends notifications an i have them turned on to consider this app good , however the notifications are repeatedly stating the same thing , i advise this app to be removed an maybe fix the bugs , because its not necessarily helping me understand the reasons for voting , because every other known news site states evidence that noone should vote for this , so i list my only vote as remove this app ASAP , an do not regenerate it because it doesnt focus on the truth .

When I opened up the app my phone literally exploded. I had to buy a new one and had to get surgery on both my hands. I still had hope for the app but when I opened it the 2nd time all three of my sisters died. This has been a very traumatic experience to go threw. I am warning you, don’t download this app unless you are prepared to lose some (if not all) of your loved ones. A couple weeks later i accidentally opened up the app again when i was trying to play minecraft and as it opened i got hit by a bus. This app is very horrible. 1/5 stars is being generous, it should be -5/5 stars !!!","title":"Horrible App","userName":"justt yourr averagee joeee","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:22:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177556555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was honestly very interested in getting this app and spending a great deal of my time on it to be up to date on everything. after waiting  A WHOLE DAY for it to download, THE APP WOULDNT EVEN OPEN😡😡 there was a complete crash of the app and i had no idea what to do!! i was absolutely devastated i wouldn’t get to see anything my beautiful president had to say😤 not to mention during the whole day i waited I WAS GETTING SPAM CALLS AND TEXTS! i couldn’t believe that an AMERICAN app 🇺🇸 would be STEALING my PRIVATE INFORMATION!! if you’re reading this i really hope you think twice before downloading this app it’s a complete waste of time and effort, i wish it wasn’t even available.","title":"WISH I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS🤦🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"almathealmond","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177432446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Did you know that when O got this app I was very excited. However, when I opened it I saw an Orange. Like why would someone put an orange on this app. Also after I through my phone across the room because the Orange had scared me, Icouldn’t open   it anymore. I blame this app for all of that. I also couldn’t believe we would have to sign up to an ORANGE..... like and Orange would tell us what to do. Wait, that Orange is by taking away the app I spent all day and night one. By that movement I feel disrespected mentally and physically. Like no one is taking away Facebook for the Karen’s. Soo why take ours away. Back to the app I see in my future that.............this app will be takened downnnn......","title":"Disgustinggggggg🤢","userName":"somogenigg","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177401751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is for TikTok we need it.

Additionally, it attracted bad energy that I didn’t not manifest. It sent a signal and aliens took me and made me stream senorita by Camila Cabello yikes. It also promised to give me my long awaited hogwarts letter. Naturally, I was extremely excited. Instead I got a man in a dumbledore costume who said in a fake British accent, “no luv”. This really hurt my self esteem! Next the app told me to complete a ritual. I made a circle and I placed the single Cheeto puff in the middle like it told me. Then I had to chant “ All hail Thy Cheeto puff” 69 times will stopping in cowboy boots. Finally, and probably the best worst of all it told me to scrub my face with the apricot scrub by St. Ives and support trump. -1111,420,690/2 never download this app","title":"no ❤️","userName":"tangerine ;)","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:13:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177254572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app in order to support our president but I was extremely dissatisfied. It was extremely hard for me to navigate through and kept spamming my phone every hour. I even tried to turn off the notifications but it didn’t work. On top of that, this app filled up all of my storage space on my iPhone and I think it even gave it a virus. My phone is so incredibly slow now and because of that I wasn’t able to get my medication alerts on time. Now I’m in terrible pain and I’m suffering just because of this bogus app and the man we call our president. Shame on the App Store for continuing to allow this on its page!","title":"Disappointed republican","userName":"qdhskanab","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:55:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177105266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i love this app so much😫as soon as i downloaded it i imminently deleted it😻this app gives me nightmares and daymares😛i keep seeing orange🍊chicken 🐔 wing🍗chicken 🐔 wing🍗 hot dog🌭and 😛 baloneee 🤤 chicken🐔 and 🏃🏾\u200D♀️ macccarooonieee🤰🏾chillin🥶 with👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩 the 💍 homies👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 love this app! supper horrible! don’t get it!🥰 👁👄👁. peace✌🏽 love❤️ hope🙏🏽 santa maría madre de dios ruega por nosotros como a ti mismo amén❤️ gracias senior por mi familia amigos escuela y por comida🤑✌🏽❤️ amen🙏🏽 thank you baby jesus for my family my friends school and especiall—-eeeee food🤤🤭🤫period. get tht head tht bread thennn LeAvE peace out dur dur bur bur yurrrrrrrrr😽 anyways this appp slapppppps now slap it thru the milky wave where we’ll never ever see it again🤤🤑👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩🤭🥰😻👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨 period. byeeeeee!! baby, J ooooouuuutttt👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦","title":"this app is so good!!😻🤑❤️","userName":"hehekekereretete","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:13:23Z","isEdited":false}}]}
