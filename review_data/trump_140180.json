The whole screen turned orange and a terrible nagging voice that made no sense came over the speakers. The words ‘ all lives matter’ started scrolling across the screen. I finally got out of it and I thought everything was fine but when I logged back in my lock screen was changed to a make america great again banner. I think the chinese have hacked this app and are making changes to our phones without our consent. Guess we’ll have to go over there and shoot em."}},{"id":"6179532369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kanekiobsessed","date":"2020-07-10T05:01:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE NOT WORTH IT","review":"I downloaded this app like the good little privileged white Catholic cis straight male I am in order to actively help put down people that are different than me and it didn’t work!!!!!
