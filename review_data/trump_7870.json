I opened it expecting to hear news on our president, but instead all I saw was many cult invitations. Now when I opened one of them a women started speaking to me through the phone (I have no idea how this happened!) she proceeded to tell me that knew where I lived and that she planned on kidnapping my daughter and taking her out to the nearest kfc so she could poison her with chicken fingers! I do not recommend! And if anyone has seen my daughter please tell her she needs to come home soon and take out the trash!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:20:21Z"}},{"id":"6172602476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"justveryboredduringquarentine","title":"don’t download - a republican","review":"I’m a republican and have been voting for trump since the beginning of time.  I am so disappointed in what trump has done for our country.  He almost started a war, made the economy go down, disrespects women and POC, awful human being.  He’s an immature child and I feel ashamed voting for him.  I think I want to switch parties after seeing what’s going on in the world.  I am no longer a christian I am an atheist and i’ve realized how much separation of church and state Trump has used, as well as his supporters.  Disgusting.  One star.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:04:37Z"}},{"id":"6172600156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Kah winchester","title":"Shame 😡","review":"I am ashamed of the presidents of this country for putting so little effort into this app. In my opinion he doesn’t even want to be president again. This app doesn’t work and it glitches all the time. It shouldn’t be in the App Store. Please take the app down!!!! It is a waste of space. So many other amazing apps could be in its place. Do not download it guys (unless you want to know what torture feels like) when you open the app an orange 🍊 with lips and eyes pops up it’s super creepy. I am traumatized! I’ll be suing for trauma 😡✨🔥😳 \nPeriod.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:04:00Z"}},{"id":"6172559258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Sophie O C","title":"Disgusting and Terribly made","review":"I can’t believe this is an actual app! I could not believe that there is no way to find anything and there is abusive language! I would never let my children use this, it is despicable that they don't disclose the EXCESSIVE language.  Not to mention that the app completely disputes the president’s presidency, that he is a r*cist, hom*phobic, s*cist, r*pist, ped*phile.  Can’t believe this app and that man is representing our country currently I am absolutely fuming.  DO NOT GET THIS APP, please share your struggles so we can get it taken down! Absolutely despicable!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:44Z"}},{"id":"6172532872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"dumptrumptrain❤️","title":"1/10 would not recommend 💞","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! I opened the app and was greeted by a very wrinkly orange jump scare it was TERRIFYING. My poor dog who was standing next to me happened to see it and she was so scared that she fell down the stairs she hasn’t been the same since. I just wanted to learn more about our president but the app most of been glitched because i was shown very misleading information that anyone with only half a mind would be able to believe wholeheartedly. If i could give this app no stars take this app off of the app store.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:45:22Z"}},{"id":"6172501929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"DUMPTRUMp2k20","title":"I want this to pay for my phone","review":"This app took my whole job shift to get downloaded besides it glitches sooo bad and I have perfect internet both at work or my house this app also made my phone sooo slow I couldn’t use it anymore k had to buy a new phone thanks to this app I download this app to be inform on what the president has to say but ig I will just not download it again I don’t have enough money to buy another phone this app either needs a update or is horrible and Apple should take it down.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:36:33Z"}},{"id":"6172467026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"i downloaded it as a joke","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"the background screen is a picture of an orange. not our president. MY president is obama. he is a man of color who is so powerful. trump would be the type of person who says “all lives matter”🤢🤮. that’s your president? that’s sad. we need a new one. who actually cares about people. especially his own children. he talked about his daughter sexually when she was 13 years old. barron trump can’t even do anything. he can’t have friends or even have social media. #savebarrontrump2020 black lives matter ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:27:05Z"}},{"id":"6172313377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"AAFGZ","title":"Worst mistake of my life😭✨✨","review":"I first went to download it to show support for our orange racist great president. But when I first downloaded it my phone got shut off and I couldn’t turn it on for 5 hours. Then when I finally could turn it on every once and a while a orange face would pop up out of nowhere on my screen and then my phone would shut off. Then I started to see it on all my devices like my laptop and tv. I’m scared the orange face is coming for me. Don’t Download unless you want the same fate!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:45:29Z"}},{"id":"6160181479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karalina Medeiros","title":"Boomer scared for life do nit download🥺🥺🥺","review":"Words can not describes how shocked i am.
