First of all, when I downloaded the app (to of course support our president) I was asked tons of questions about my personal information that I’m almost positive will be used against me in the near future. After I had to sign to give up most of my basic rights as a citizen of the USA my phone was completely hacked and had hundreds of viruses. Now, not only does the government have all of my personal information, my phone is hacked, and I no longer have any rights, but now I’m continuously getting alerts on my hacked phone telling me I’m deported, even though I was born in the US. So I would not recommend downloading for your personal safety.","userName":"Lilianna B.","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6176677902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:19:40Z","rating":1,"review":"I was very excited to download this app because I’m a great American vote en that is proud of my non racist president of course. It’s great. But when I downloaded this app it let off a highlitched screech that then caused all my dogs to howl. 😱 then it hacked my phone, computers, TVs, everything! It displayed a message: “to stop the howling, pledge you allege ve to President Donald Trump”. ofc I had no problem with that because I already pledged my allegence, but then all my devices self destructed. I wasn’t very happy. I had just got a Nintendo Swith Lite and it’s in pieces. I’m very confused as to why daddy- I mean- President trump would ever do this to me. I already answered all his surveys the way he wants and even sold my soul like it says to do in the surveys. Why would he hurt me? DO NOT download.","userName":"ayishaaaaas","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download!!"}},{"id":"6176244994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:19:13Z","rating":1,"review":"I expected a welcoming atmosphere but what I got was the complete opposite. I felt a bit uneasy about giving my phone number away for this app but I did it anyways and I really should’ve trusted my gut. I got calls saying that if I didn’t go to conversion therapy and stop my transition than I would be forced out of this country. I was stunned. This went on for a while and one day, as I walked up to my house after going to get some food, I saw a note on my door. \n\nIt said: “You’ve got one more chance to go to therapy before you lose the other one.”\n\nI ran into my house after and upon that I saw one of my dogs laying on his bed, completely lifeless. I am truly terrified for my life, I never expected this to turn so bad.","userName":"W a r r e n","isEdited":false,"title":"This app killed my dog !!"}},{"id":"6176094931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:32:48Z","rating":1,"review":"After signing up and registering that I was black (one of the colored ones) I was sent an email entailing that Donald J Trump himself signed stating that he would like the one and only N word pass. This is just outrageous. Also when I clicked no and returned to the app I had multiple notifications pop up calling me a porch money. If only I could post pictures. One notification even told me to not refer to him as my president but as Massa. When I clicked “no” a van pulled up outside of my home and burnt it to the ground while they tried to hang me in the tree in my front yard. This app has caused nothing but pain and misery for me and my family. Now I am battling homelessness all because this Cheetos looking yt man wanted to be invited to the bbq.","userName":"KarenGodLover","isEdited":false,"title":"Just completely horrid"}},{"id":"6175896484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:28:12Z","rating":1,"review":"This app was a cause of multiple deaths reasons of stupidity, seconded Hand embarrassment, and trauma so please BUT in all seriousness it was our first orange president so I’m looking to the future when we’ll have our first pink,purple, OH AND BLUE president how exciting will that be and yet your trumpets will probably yell racial slur at our blue president like “GO BACK TO SMURF VILLAGE” with is another reason of death did you know a blue man was killed because your trumpets thought he was to threatening to the red how sad 🇨🇺😭💕✌🏿✌🏿🇨🇺💪🏻✨✨✌🏿💕🤞❤️✌🏿 but I must say it must be a struggle be racist, sexist, homophobic, and ugly all at once like man PICK A STUGGLE, anyways I got to get back to running the nation be your to busy golfing to it knowledge the movement that’s going on your country so xoxo, the in most hatred Barron  Trunp","userName":"Miley g smileys","isEdited":false,"title":"TEUMP 2020✨🧚🏻💕 on a gravestone"}},{"id":"6175770869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:45:57Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and one of the first questions it asks is if Im white. I thought this was weird but I would do anything for that sexy man. I clicked no (I’m a Hispanic 4 trump 🥰) and the app glitched and I couldn’t reopen it? I deleted it and re-downloaded it and when I logged in (I used my phone number) I got a text from Donald Trump himself saying “this is America. Learn speak English.” I’m not sure what this means? I’m starting to think those liberals 🤮 were correct when they said he might possibly be slightly racist or something. \n\nEdit: 20 minutes after posting this he told me to take it down and then threatened to deport my mom. But she was born here... I’m starting to think he doesn’t understand how the government works...","userName":"tumblr saved me","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download!!!"}},{"id":"6175707465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:18Z","rating":1,"review":"if i could i would give this app negative stars. i don’t see why anyone would want to support Trump when he is ruining America. he runs by the slogan “make america great again” when he is doing the exact opposite. i am disappointed in apple for allowing Donald Trump, a well known white supremacist, racist, and rapist, his own app to campaign more of his terrible deeds. i am also disappointed in what this country has become, we’re supposed to be the land of the free but some people can’t even walk outside of their house without fearing they’ll be killed. this app needs to be taken down immediately because we cannot support people like Donald Trump that are responsible for making people feel that way in their own country...","userName":"Lauren Luedtke","isEdited":false,"title":"WHYYY... just WHY"}},{"id":"6175408696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:32:53Z","rating":1,"review":"This app literally took 69 weeks just to download! Not to mention that calls I got from the “trump team”, they harassed me, threatened me, and even called me the f slur. The team told me I was going to get killed if I ever leave my house for being part of the lgbtg+ and if they ever see my little sister they will do the same thing they did to George Floyd (she’s mixed btw). Lastly on the told me on the phone was that if I didn’t vote for trump they will take my parents from me, IM NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE! I came home the next day and my parents where GONE. Now I have no way of getting them back or how I’ll be able to take care of my sister by myself. My life is ruined because of THIS APP! AND our world is ruined because of Trump!
