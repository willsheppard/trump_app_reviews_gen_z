Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."}},{"id":"6177718996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:16:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Bad app","userName":"jjd3911","review":"This app made me break my legs"}},{"id":"6177716686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:15:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"yffdxgnc","review":"This s app dose not have a purpose 🙄"}},{"id":"6177710587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:13:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TIK TOK","userName":"ironhoofs","review":"Lol I’m trying to keep tik tok from shutting down"}},{"id":"6177641642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:52:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"trash","userName":"maddie zig","review":"why is this even an app"}},{"id":"6177626002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:47:09Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"awful","userName":"sammy jones the 21st","review":"please get rid of this app"}},{"id":"6177620497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:45:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"die","userName":"heyo idc","review":"you see the thing is tiktok is great and i can't not go on it so hehe"}},{"id":"6177616077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:43:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst President in History.","userName":"neelloki","review":"Nuff sed.
