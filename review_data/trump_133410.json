But on that night when I got it, I went to bed like a normal human being and slept. What I didn’t know was that the app will haunt my nightmares.Trump was suddenly in my dream, orange and boiled as ever, and he was wearing simply a diaper and looked like a giant baby. He then began started to stomp and puke all over me till I vowed to say, “I love trump!” and right after that, his corn hair began to fall all over me. Once I woke up, I realized the app was behind this traumatic experience as my friends revealed they had similar nightmares of orange giant baby trump tormenting them. Don’t buy this app if you don’t want trauma!","rating":1,"userName":"lola and logan","title":"Trump manifested me","date":"2020-07-08T19:47:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173502482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Idk what app this is but it’s not good !!!!

I waited a weeks for this to download, and once it finally did download I open the app and my phone glitched so bad I had to get it fixed by a technician! It cost me 1,000 dollars! I know what you’re wondering why didn’t I just get a new phone? This phone has so many important memories of my dead rat. My rat really reminds me of 🍊 so I couldn’t bear losing those pictures! I tried opening the app again because I was still determined to show my support no matter what! But once again my phone glitched and started playing a song that goes, “I like big butts and I cannot lie!” I was petrified! What’s worse was that the song was sung by 🍊. In the background I heard a child screaming, “Help! I’m being held captive by this pedo!” But since I’m a stupid 🍊 supporter I didn’t care and continued to think he was a good president! I closed the app and tried to open it once more, this time is what probably developed my PTSD. It was a picture of 🍊 nudes! My only comment is, “Small”. A few days later a get a text from 🍊 himself saying, “Give my app 5 stars or else I will poop all over your house and I will hack into your pictures and delete every photo and fill your camera roll with my poop and vomit!” I was so scared! After deleting the app the fbi broke into my house and pointed guns at me while chanting, “ 5 STAR REVIEW, 5 STAR REVIEW” and then left. I had to buy new windows and and a new door which cost me another fortune. After leaving this review I think they may come back to shoot me down so if I die I just wanna tell my family I love them. I just wanna say if 🍊 is reading this then I just wanna say before you send your FBI agents to come get me that I have already gone to visit your family and I have told them of all the horrible things you have done and they said that they have officially disowned you! If anyone else has complaints to tell his family go to the nearest orange tree farm and speak to them there. Overall I just wanna say don’t ever get this app! It was a huge mistake! It may even cost your life downloading the app!","rating":1,"userName":"Remember meee!","title":"Near Neath Experience","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173499740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off the app glitches a lot and it’s very hard to use\n2nd the app is very difficult to understand \n3nd the buttons are very small to click\n4th the words don’t name sense\n5th this app looks like poop","rating":1,"userName":"hellooloo","title":"Very bad🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173498998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded & automatically felt like i was being summoned. my fishes started drowning & my snail started walking. after this happened for ab 5 mins, an earthquake occurred 😱. it was scary. if i had the option to give this app -0287438/5 stars, i would. so disappointed 😡🥵🤬🤯🤔.","rating":1,"userName":"Nick Guss","title":"the worst app ever ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173498668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I DOWNLOADED THIS APP AND WAS BROUGHT PURE DISAPPOINTMENT IT TOOK MONTHS TO DOWNLOAD AND THE MUSIC BRUNG SO MANY BUGS AND BAD SPIRTS I HAVE NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER WANTED TO PUNCH AN APP LIKE THIS ONE, WHO EVEN MADE THIS?!?!
