I known it’s this one because it was perfectly fine right up until i downloaded it. I plan to delete it after i reserve my seats for the next trump rally thing. Hopefully i don’t have to take my cockroach on a walk the day of, that would be such a shame. Anyway, I’m very unhappy with the app. Not only did it give my phone bugs, but it’s also hard to use. It’s very confusing. Do not recommend downloading!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:39:26Z","title":"Do not get","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174682447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Pi=3.14 Pi Day=3.14","review":"I have never been more disgusted and violated in my entire life!!! This awful experience started immediately when I open the app, and was met with Donny’s hairy man dangler staring me right in the face. At that point, I was put into a state of shock, which was only worsened when the first horrifying image was followed by something even worse. This app has the audacity to support Trump and I can’t accept that. How would I know that this app affiliated with him?!? There was absolutely no warning and I am appalled, truly appalled. A big no no from me.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:31:44Z","title":"IM APPALLED","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174648580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yeehaw buckaroo","review":"This is terrifying. 10/10 do NOT recommend. This app is so bad. They shouldn’t have this app on the App Store. When you open the screen just displays a picture of Donald’s trump dead body at his open casket funeral. That’s right. The Cheeto expired. It’s so insensitive and messed up that they would keep this app up. All the conservatives that keep saying trump 2020 need immediate mental evaluations. I can’t believe his own followers don’t know that he died. Maybe they’re just in denial that their cult leader is gone for good. Rest in peanuts 🥺😭🥜🥜","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:21:54Z","title":"I’m scared","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174548002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"HelenRice1980","review":"This app made my potato go crazy and than Alexa just turned on “my potato flew around my room” and it was on repeat for hours. I finally I got back enough brain cells to realize I could unplug it. All of a sudden my dog started eating my hamster and than I realized my hamster had been dead for years!! My dog than ran away and I haven’t seen him/her for year. Him/her name was here and so I have just walked back and down my neighborhood yelling “here” idk why he/she hasn’t came back and ever since that day I haven’t supported trump!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:53:19Z","title":"Um... no💄🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174524899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"irisgoddesviris","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app, each night I’ve heard tapping on my window, every time I look I see Cheeto man there dick out, and I’m unable to sleep because the image of what I saw scarred me so deeply. Although I my therapist tells me this image isn’t real I think it’s a sign. I don’t trust my cat anymore, I think they’re with him. I’ve moved to an upstairs room thinking that will help... but he still shows up. I might have to change therapists, I think she might also be on his side. Somebody save me from this nightmare.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:45Z","title":"I’m scared","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174488073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Grace Emilienne","review":"I swear there’s something wrong with this app. I haven’t left my house since quarantine started so I know the following issues haven’t been caused by not following social distancing. first of all, i swear i’ve gotten every possible STD known to man from this app. This means I got almost 376 million new diseases just by using this app. On top of that, I contracted the coronavirus as well. If you want to live to see the election day, I urge you not to download this app or vote for Trump.\n\nAnyways vote Biden 2020 y’all😎😎","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:36:30Z","title":"If you want to survive the pandemic, don’t do it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174460444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"marlon fish","review":"I can’t believe what downloading this app lead me to.😱I took my son,Nemo,to his first day of school ever however he lied to me and went out with his friends and was captured by orange people!🤯🤬 I set out on an adventure to look for him and On my way I made a friend, Dory. ✨We almost got killed by Trumps attackers! 😰😳 finally we got to our destination where my kid was enslaved by the leader of the orange humans, TRUMP!

The app is just atrocious. Worst color scheme I have seen in all my 600 years of living. And then the actual content! The “app” is full of #FAKENEWS. Trump ur rlly bad at marketing. Any boomer who gets this app despite all of these warnings deserves the millions of VIRUSES this app gives. Viruses include but not limited to COVID-19, dumbness, narcissism, bipolar disorder, racism, sexism, xenophobia, dementia, common flu, and many more!!! Americans, be warned! This “app” is dangerous to our wellbeing. It MUST be taken off the App Store for humanity’s sake. 🥰🥰😍😍","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:15:43Z","title":"Calling this an app would be a disgrace to other apps","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174413785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LOLaRitolina","review":"i downloaded the app so that i could stay informed on what the best president in the history of the united states was doing next to help our country. as soon as i opened the app, a photo of the lord cheeto himself popped up on the screen, causing my phone screen to shatter. as displeased i was with this result, i continued browsing through the app, hoping maybe i’d find some redeeming quality to help me regain my faith in him. fortunately, i didn’t find anything. he’s still the biggest POTUS of any POTUS in american history. trump 2020✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️ on a gravestone.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:17Z","title":"mike oxlong","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174370640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Roast yourself harder","review":"I downloaded this app to see updates of our great American president, but the second I did, I suddenly had my recently aborted baby shoved back up into me! I was so horrified, because I had eaten it for dinner last week. Not only that, but I couldn’t use any of the features because my Apple account has my name, and it was too feminine so it knew I was a woman.\nI then got sent a personal notification by the Cheeto man himself telling me to ‘get back into the kitchen or I will grab you by the p*ssy’\nJust horrible.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:01:12Z","title":"Unbelievably horrible","isEdited":false}}]}
