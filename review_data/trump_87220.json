When I saw that I could download an app to get updates and to learn more about trump’s regime, I was beyond delighted. However, when I opened the app, things began to go wrong. First, I entered my email, then I began getting emails asking me to rate trump’s appearance on a scale of 1-10. I finally responded and gave him a humble 5, because I felt the need to show our president some respect. However, that 5 apparently wasn’t enough. The emails stopped coming, but then I began getting text messages all comprising of the one line “you should be ashamed of yourself.” As the shame sunk in, all of my app logos turned into trumps face, looking horribly disappointed at me. The longer I looked at the little army of trumps, the angrier they appeared. I went to alarm my family not to get the app, but all they would say to me with hatred in their eyes was “you should be ashamed of yourself.” I went into my bed and cried, only to realize my tears were now orange. A Cheeto materialized in front of me and told me “that’s what you get,” then floated away. I was now feeling alone and scared, but thankfully my cat came and cuddled with me. However, when I looked into her eyes, they were oranger than I remembered. Upon closer inspection, I realized that trumps face had spread from my phone apps to the eyes of my loved ones! I hurriedly rushed to a mirror and saw with increasing horror that in my eyes lurked the face of our very own president. But the longer I looked, I realized that it wasn’t just my eyes. My entire body was changing rapidly to match that of Donald trumps! Thousands of Cheetos materialized around me, leering down on me as I began to panic, ominously chanting “that’s what you get. That’s what you get. That’s what you get.” I had a sudden vision of trump in the whitehouse, looking at my low rating of his appearance, tears falling from his eyes. Then, I felt myself being pulled away from my mortal body. I was now just an image of trumps face. With horror I realized that I was now one of the faces residing in some other unfortunate soul’s phone! I knew I had to save them from this fate, so I hurriedly wrote this review with my brain. Please, whatever you do, don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t do it","date":"2020-07-08T20:18:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"🙁😏🤓🤨😭🤯😰🥵😏😛😋"}},{"id":"6173589253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app exposed my location to bad people.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💅🏼","date":"2020-07-08T20:16:35Z","rating":1,"userName":"guccigrocies"}},{"id":"6173580735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App gave my dog cancer","isEdited":false,"title":"My fog now has brain cancer in various spots of his uterus","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:37Z","rating":1,"userName":"[USER]597"}},{"id":"6173579607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"took 3 days to download and when it did it didn’t load. wouldn’t waste my time","isEdited":false,"title":"awful","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:13Z","rating":1,"userName":"hhhggggfffff"}}]}
