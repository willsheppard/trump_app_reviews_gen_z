I am speechless at how TOXIC this app is🙀 It called me a fat bumblebee trash can when i downloaded it. It’s soooooo toxic soooooo toxic. If you support this app you are a racist, homophobic, sexist mosquito bite. Don’t support the the cheeto bunker boy he is such a witch! And has done nothing good for this country and the people. Imagine wanting to ban tiktok because you are a insecure piece of bread crumps. SOOOO TOXIC. Anyways i suggest you do your research on the black lives matter movement and stop being a white supremacist!❤️Have a great day and spread hummus not hate!😠🤨."}},{"id":"6174655355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:23:53Z","title":"HORRENDOUS","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cpj713","review":"This app is terrible if I could give it a zero star rating I definitely would. This app completely started glitching out my phone and I have no idea why. It also ate all my chicken nuggets which I am very sad about but back to the point this app is not a good app and I do not recommend downloading it and if you download this app because you actually support trump and not because you saw a video about you giving it one star then you’re a loser."}},{"id":"6174633626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:38Z","title":"Don’t get this app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"clairewilliams22","review":"This app has a terrible color scheme. The colors are so boring and bright... it’s hard to look at. The font is so harsh and sharp too!! Very uninviting unpleasant to look at for more then a second. Aside from the quality of the colors and font, there are only like three colors!! Why only three?? I’m honestly shocked and disappointed by the blatant lack of respect for viewers’ interests. Will be deleting the app immediately. 0/10, would not recommend."}},{"id":"6174616104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:12:44Z","title":"Horrid","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ƖơƖ","review":"This is by far one of the worst apps I have eve downloaded. It’s not only communist but it proves how much of a failure this president has been. This is abominable. I was not keen of Obama, however, looking at this mans progress I have to say is that this app is another reason on why I won’t be voting for president trump. Furthermore I realized it makes your phone glitch. I’m not sure why but it lags everything and perhaps it should be taken off the store or at least fixed."}},{"id":"6174595441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:52Z","title":"Do not get this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gen-Z Ashley","review":"Unless you want your phone to get hacked, do not download this app. Within minutes of downloading this app (since I wanted to see the latest updates on Mr. Donald Trump), all of my social medias, email, Paypal, Venmo, etc. got hacked. My phone literally went into overdrive and then when I was able to delete the app, I noticed that my phone had been reset to factory settings! This app is a disgrace, and for that Mr. Trump will not be getting my vote. I urge you all to follow suit."}},{"id":"6174591657","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:05:50Z","title":"No thanks ❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Shane Dawson is ugly 🤩","review":"As soon as I opened the app I saw a big fat orange PIG 🐷 dancing to the song Toxic by Britney Spears 🤭 in front of the White House, it was so scary that my eye balls MELTED and dripped slowly down my face as I screamed in pain. My dad heard me screaming so he ran into my room to find me eye ball less 😭 and a dancing pig on my phone, my dad then proceeded to bash my phone into the ground with his foot to make it stop. So thanks to the app I don’t have any eyes and I am phone less, I am currently typing this review on my grandmas computer."}},{"id":"6174571226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:04Z","title":"This app gave me chlamydia","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trée 😣","review":"I said what i said and it is all Trump’s fault. I hate this man and for all the medical bills he has costed me with this measly app. The app sent a flyer in the mail for promotion where, to my surprise, was a can of expired baked beans. I was furious as i was allergic to beans, especially the baked kind. As i rushed to my nearest local dumpster i stepped on a used condom, hence how I contracted my chlamydia. Remove this app or ill send the makers of the app some of my stem cells so they too can enjoy the itch that is correlated with chlamydia."}},{"id":"6174549150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:53:40Z","title":"Poorly run app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen M Tompson","review":"Whenever I tried to run this app on my phone it would always freeze, and it would never load. It even messed up some of my other apps and would freeze them as well even if I tried to force close it, which makes me think it’s data mining!! Would not recommend this app to anyone, especially anyone afraid of their info being stolen or their constitutional rights being taken away"}},{"id":"6174508842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:42:15Z","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mylemondrops","review":"such an ATROCIOUS app I’m truly disgusted by the image that first appeared when I opened the app for the first time I quite literally spit out the alligator meat I was snacking on😿😳I don’t want to scar you too much but it looked like a Cheeto had been combined with a 90 year old pig💀I know truly terrifying😭😭😭anyways it’s an awful app I’m dissapointed but not surpised😼👁👄👁 trump 2020 but on a gravestone🧚\u200D♀️✨😌always go listen to #DreamwithHarry for clear skin or else the scary pig Cheeto gremlin will be at the end of your bed at 4:20AM eastern time😋😎😹"}}]}
