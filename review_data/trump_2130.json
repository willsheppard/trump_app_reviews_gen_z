And I was so excited to download this app and learn more about what my orange Cheeto puff is up to with our country. Then all the sudden pornography came up and my family was around me and they could hear the video playing. It scared my grandmother of 96 years, that she had a heart attack and died right in my arms. I terribly miss her with all my heart. I can’t believe she died because this app and I don’t understand why pornography came up on it when it isn’t pornhub.😓😔✨ My family has suffered terribly from this tragic death, we’ve had to go to therapy.😫😰This has to be the most disgusting app I have EVER downloaded🤕🧎\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T15:55:46Z","userName":"Emma🥶™️"}},{"id":"6172707437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨🦋🧚🏼\u200D♀️ what an app 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🦋✨","rating":1,"review":"this story contains graphic content. \nmy sister is apart of the lgbtq+ community along with her friends and ever since trump has been talking about no healthcare or adoption for the lgbtq+ community it has been a nightmare. my sister isn’t getting the healthcare she needs because all of doctors we have gone to are trump supporters🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨and won’t  give us the help she needs✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️ so my sister is going to DIE due to the fact no one is helping her thanks to the 💖✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️trump administration 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💖 now her and her wife can’t have a kid EVER because no one will let them adopt because they are so far up trumps ___ that they won’t let them have a happy life. so now not only is she going to die after not getting the proper healthcare she needed, but she is going to die unhappy because trump couldn’t \nlet her be happy.","date":"2020-07-08T15:34:08Z","userName":"Jayhen."}},{"id":"6172696438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"review":"to the people that are actually writing reviews and are saying nice things i honestly think you were dropped as a baby. Because you must have something mentally wrong with you to actually vote for this cheeto puff. yes to the person saying we’re immature because we actually have a sense of humor get your cheeto voting, stanky smelling, boomer self out of here this if for gen z. if his wittle feelings got hurt cuz we have the power to absolutely destroy his rally and he has to ban tiktok we will get rid of his app so nobody can download it. now for the person mocking us because we said “trump 2020 but in a jail cell” that’s absolutely hilarious  and his own daughter and many other people have claimed he has raped them.

About an hour later after that incident, she was wacked with a hot dog wiener, It wasn't even beef, it was turkey flavored. After that, once Trump came onto stage, he specifically pointed at her and mocked her deflated pattys and breasts. Everyone laughed at her and started to treat her deflated pattys as punching bags and whoopee cushions. During all this her breast implants plopped onto the floor ( to be fair she doesnt know how to properly fold them into her flaps ) anyways as i was saying, her implants fell which someone them proceeded to steal. She was left humiliated.","date":"2020-07-08T15:22:05Z","userName":"Heartbreaker2.0"}},{"id":"6172481113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP CAUSED ME TO GET THE CORONAVIRUS😔😔","rating":1,"review":"I love my big orange cheeto and while always vote for him but this app is not it❤️tiktok lives matter❤️✨this app crashes all the time. also it took all my information and hacked my accounts😡I am so mad I had to deactivate my Apple Pay before they could use anymore of my money😑and I went to the rally’s, they absolutely ✨sucked✨worst experience I’ve ever had. #allcountriesmatter #allappscantmatteruntiltiktokdoes pls loose the election nobody wants u here🤩🤩😻this app was a threaten to my life because of it I got the coronavirus😔😡also right now I have $9,000 worth of trump merchandise in my cart at check out!! am I gonna buy it??thats a secret I’ll never tell🕵️\u200D♂️🤑\n\nwhen Hannah Montana said “everybody makes mistakes” she was talking about ✨god😻🇺🇸when he made you🙃\n\nyou remind me of a therapist🙃❤️✨just remove “the”🧚✨😀","date":"2020-07-08T14:30:51Z","userName":"tiktok lives matter❤️"}},{"id":"6172377277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app hospitalized me 😿","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app hoping to see a platform where i could see my idol president speak out against liberals 🤢👺 but i was shocked to see it glitch and start showing weird orange faces and flashing lights. this triggered my epilepsy and i started convulsing, when my dad saw that i was convulsing it triggered his anxiety and he got an anxiety attack. when my mom saw this she got a heart attack and passed away. when my father saw this his heart couldn’t take it and he also passed away due to his heart condition. my grandparents who had been staying with us stepped into the room to see my parent’s corpses and were so devastated that they called the ambulance and took their own lives. i saw all of this on the cameras that we have. after i was taken to the hospital i caught COVID-19 and am now in a hospital bed. 😿😿😿","date":"2020-07-08T14:02:58Z","userName":"KSofiaDelgado"}},{"id":"6172011090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","rating":1,"review":"Worst experience of my life with this app. First of all it took forever to download and I’m right next to my WiFi that’s high speed, it’s ridiculous. Also, It’s bland and I held higher expectations for someone who could afford to build a great app but it looks like I was majorly let down. most apps use eye catching colors and if not they provide me an actually use since it’s taking space up on my phone. To make an account caused so many problems. In fact, I tried to read the terms and policies and they wouldn’t even open to show me. I refuse to keep an app that won’t even let me read the terms and policies or privacy policy. Ultimately, My vote for you has been lost. Thank you for showing me that your app is terrible and that trump is overall not the choice that needs to be made 💛 good day","date":"2020-07-08T12:20:04Z","userName":"Manny is my nickname"}},{"id":"6177625197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Violation of Principles.","rating":1,"review":"As a voter in the upcoming election, I was curious to see how many of Trump’s policies line up to his media portrayals. Unfortunately, in reading the privacy policy upon download, I found an immediate violation of principles. This app, much like the Cambridge Analytica team, has the ability to collect your information OUTSIDE OF THIS APP (worse than the offense of TikTok) and use it for Trump’s campaign. This is a violation of every user’s privacy and online property which little to no notice. Not only that, but all it serves to do is crash my like-brand-new device and ask for money. What a sham. If this candidate, who is against handouts, is going to continue to ask for free handouts, then the nail is in the coffin on my vote. Little to no useful information and an overall joke. I would give this -5/5 if I could.","date":"2020-07-09T17:46:52Z","userName":"ifindthem"}},{"id":"6177619369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚\u200D♀️💅It’s Brittney💅🧚\u200D♀️✌️","rating":1,"review":"So i downloaded this app to support \nour amazing president and i was so upset about how I opened the app and all I saw was weird oompa loompa cheeto alien looking thing who turned out to be our president!
