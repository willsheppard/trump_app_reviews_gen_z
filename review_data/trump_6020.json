Soon, my screen wouldn’t even work. I would click on apps and try to type and it just wouldn’t work anymore. My screen kept glitching and going black for no reason and took a long time to turn it back on. This went on for about a week and I finally decided to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me. I kept pressing delete but it stayed there. I finally had to go get a new phone without the app on it and it works fine now. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","userName":"Mikey Stup","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6173550265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","userName":"MindlessLlama","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Yee yee"}},{"id":"6173500239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so bad… 😙😙It took 15 minutes ⏰ to download 📲 it crashed my phone 🔥 … This app made my phone glitch 👾 out so many times 🕰 to the point where my phone started making weird noises 🧟🧟🧟🧟and I deleted 💁🏾\u200D♀️it and tried to download it again📲📲📲📲📲 so I could vote for my president 👨🏻\u200D🦰👨🏻\u200D🦰👨🏻\u200D🦰👨🏻\u200D🦰👨🏻\u200D🦰👨🏻\u200D🦰and yet every time I did it The app would literally shut down my whole phone🙇🏾\u200D♀️🙇🏾\u200D♀️🙇🏾\u200D♀️🙇🏾\u200D♀️🙇🏾\u200D♀️🙇🏾\u200D♀️..that’s what i get for voting for a immensely colossal fat orange 🍊 🟠🟠🟠🟠🟠man and he looks gross 🤢🤢🤢and he’s endeavoring to run this country and it’s not proficiently adept at all \n#NoMaam","userName":"LittyLala","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:46:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"hot mess"}},{"id":"6173467335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to show support for our great president. It took several hours to download,  despite the expensive Wi-Fi I pay for. When the app finally downloaded, my phone burst into flames. Now... you may be wondering how i’m writing this review. I had to buy a whole new phone, which took the last of my life savings. I downloaded the app on this phone, and had to wait longer for it to download. This time, my new phone didn’t burst into flames, but it gave it a virus. Thanks a lot, President Dookie Spray Tan head. You have lost a loyal supporter.","userName":"Bob Bopturdson","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:34:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"waste of technological progress!!!!"}},{"id":"6173455097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do not under any circumstances download this app. I wanted to support the best president of the United States but it turns out this app stole my money. Right after I gave it my information, the app crashed and my phone froze for a whole minute. When it worked again, I checked the app and I couldn’t get back in. Out of curiosity, I went to check my bank account and I had $500 thousand dollars missing. I am now looking into a way to fix this terrible problem and struggling even more than I was. PLEASE DON’T DARE SUFFERING THE SAME FATE AS ME. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. 🤬","userName":"Protect LGBTQIA+ Youth","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:30:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨horrendous and absolutely terrible✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6173352340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app my phone literally shut off! a lot of tragic ads kept popping up, because of how surprised it was to see Mr🎃🐷🍊and so I did what any normal person would do DELETE THIS APP! And as soon as I did that my phone has been back to normal every since, maybe my phone isn’t used to trash and I forgot to mention it took FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD I was just perplexed because I could’ve sworn I had some pretty good WiFi but I just guess this app is really that terrible I don’t understand how y’all thought of the app anyway!?

Upon opening the app, i was greeted by his name and a picture of himself, and that alone made me cringe, and puke. After that, it was constantly crashing and it kept asking me for money, even though I didn’t have any to give, it was so persistent. Not to mention the actual mechanics and look of this app is complete garbage. Waste of time. Do NOT buy. 🤮🤮 I cant decide what i hate more, this app, or Trump himself. Who am I kidding, nothing could be worse than Trump.","userName":"Candyxo11","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app. Do NOT get this."}},{"id":"6173281202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app thinking that it would save my family from this terrible place we call America, only to find out that my grandpa had been diagnosed with cancer right after the app downloaded. I thought to myself, how can this happen? After a few moments of digging on the internet, I learned that Obama’s app has performed miracles! I downloaded the app and spoke to Obama about my misfortunes and he told me to vote Biden 2020, right after we spoke, I received a phone call from my grandparents only to find out my grandpa was cured from cancer!! Thank you Obama🥰 #biden2020","userName":"brad whos name is chad","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:31:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Garbage app👎🏽"}},{"id":"6173193253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Can we just talk about how long this took it almost took me about a month to download this i’m trying to save our TikTok and our precious lovely TickTock it is almost like it’s the best app ever but this app I almost threw up by seeing it and this quality is probably the worst quality ever and why is there apparently China is stealing our data from our phone and they are planning on deleting TikTok account and they are creating this app to just take over TikTok but this app is the worst one I have ever had my life to download and of course yellow head is a 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😈","userName":"this episode dumb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:02:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app so dumb"}}]}
