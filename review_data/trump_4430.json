THE APP DID NOT DELIVER! This app is trash. I couldn’t have it open for longer than 3 minutes before it crashed. After it crashed, my phone restarted. Now my screen turns black every time I try to open the app. This has been the worst experience I’ve ever had with an app. Trump let us down! I am also very angry that you need to type your phone number to login. He is tricking you into signing up for his text alerts. I don’t like that he is deceiving us! I would give 0 stars if I could. Trump should do better!! SET AN EXAMPLE AS OUR PRESIDENT!!!!","rating":1,"userName":";)456"}},{"id":"6176803738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🙄✨👏😷Really😷👏✨🙄","date":"2020-07-09T13:52:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is officially done when the app was done downloading after 22 months I was done but I was like what ever but when I I first opens the app it hacked my phone and changed all of my contacts to a shrek I was fine with it but when I went back to it there was a death note that said he was going to get the ginger bread man if I did not watch ever single episode of Bill Nye The Science Guy so as I am watching the 256 episode I get a notification that Berry bee was kidnapped by Winnie the Pooh and shrek’s crib and he got help by sandy cheacks but that is not the point but what ever  I would give this app a 0/5 if I could  should not recommend 🤬🤬🤬","rating":1,"userName":"Ariana193873728"}},{"id":"6176473489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ZERO STARS PERIODT","date":"2020-07-09T12:24:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"All I wanted to do was support Daddy Trump but he tried to scam me!!!!!!!

The app took 30 weeks to download and after I signed up it leaked all of my text messages, calls, personal information, and it replaced all my pictures with videos and pictures of Almonte, Anonymous, and Bill Nye. When I tried to delete the app I was then threatened by the one and only Walter...WALTER!!! I do not recommend this app because it is full of bs, bs, and more bs. This has happened to me and I don't want it to happen to anyone else.

Every time you open up the app it starts to glitch sometimes it will stop but only for a minute or two and then it will glitch again. And when it asked me if I wanted notifications or not I requested no notifications yet I am receiving constant notifications and when I mean constant I mean every five minutes it’s like the app has taken over my phone and is demanding that I pay attention to it. I tried to delete the app but it just started deleting my other apps instead. Under no circumstances should you download this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"userName":"gabbyrainbow"}}]}
