When I got it, I was addicted. I was in love with this app. Suddenly I started feeling the random urge to say ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù whenever I saw anything related to BLM. It was super weird how every black person was a thug. I had the weird urge to grab women by the p**sy and completely disrespect them as humans. This app was very good at the start but idk it was kind of weird after a while.","isEdited":false,"title":"Started out good but then","rating":1,"userName":"dj02030"}},{"id":"6177572091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:49Z","review":"this app is horrible! i downloaded if for a total of 5 MINUTES and then next time i open my phone all my data was gone!!!!! all my ATLA photos erased from my phone and all my saved articles on women‚Äôs rights vanished! the only thing that remained was the horrible app! i already knew the government tracked my phone but because of this app they have complete control of my phone! i demand justice for my phone! #trumpruinedamerica","isEdited":false,"title":"lost all my data!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Maya_h8"}},{"id":"6177511190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:10:43Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I got fed up with the left trying to make out honorable president look bad, but once I opened it I saw that you can‚Äôt access anything on the app without entering your phone number! And with 5G nowadays, I don‚Äôt trust anyone with my phone number. ESPECIALLY sketchy looking apps. There was no information, no links or anything. Just a spot to enter your phone number, probably for data mining and stealing my identity. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SCAMMY APP!","isEdited":false,"title":"Very sketchy app","rating":1,"userName":"Anonymous Cracker Barrell"}},{"id":"6177505932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:09:03Z","review":"I was reading through the comments and saw so many 1 star ratings and I told myself the app couldn‚Äôt be that bad. Well...i was wrong. This app is completely ridiculous. It made my phone crash constantly. I even took my phone to my carrier and they said there was nothing physically wrong with my phone so they said i must have some sort of virus. Also keep in mind none of this happened before i installed the app!!","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE!!","rating":1,"userName":"baylee yoder"}},{"id":"6177468520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:49Z","review":"I downloaded the app to support our very smart ü§ì and handsome ü§© ‚ú®Cheeto‚ú® but I had to wait almost a week for the app to even download. It‚Äôs unexceptionable, considering how much our lovey ‚ú®Cheeto‚ú® knows. When I finally opened the app I was mortified üò± My phone got hacked by cheese dusted, google eyed, twig shaped, SMURFS!!! It took 2 weeks to even recover from this horrible incident. I definitely do not recommend this app and will never be downloading anything like this again üñï","isEdited":false,"title":"A helping hand üçÜ","rating":1,"userName":"Cheese Dusted Smurfs"}},{"id":"6177457507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:54:36Z","review":"This app has so many glitches in it and is a horrible way to promote Donald trumps campaign. It‚Äôs like someone asked a toddler to design the software and anyone with thumbs could have don‚Äôt it better. Not only does it glitch it but it put viruses on my phone and put me in several call and email lists that have nothing to do with the trump administration. Over all I‚Äôm horribly unsatisfied and very upset with the usage of this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Not worth the download","rating":1,"userName":"remieeeejayy"}},{"id":"6177419643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:43:06Z","review":"I downloaded this app very excited to stay updated on all of trumps rally‚Äôs and what not. Unfortunately it then made my phone very glitchy and caused it to shut down. On top of all that my grandma died and then got brought back to life only to die once more after the app took control of my phone, showed a pic of Trump to my grandma and caused her to have a heart attack! From there she couldn‚Äôt be revived due to the ratchet picture of Trump. May she Rest In Peace. :(","isEdited":false,"title":"RIP grandma","rating":1,"userName":"fjdnsnsnsnja"}},{"id":"6177403353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:38:27Z","review":"I got this app in high hopes of learning more about the trump 2020 campaign. However, when I tried to download it, the progress got stuck on 69% for A WEEK!!! After it finally came through I opened the app expecting this to be a perfectly normal one but. After a few hours my skin started turning lighter and lighter and so did my hair. I also started growing a massive man part.... I WAS SLOWLY TURNING INTO A HETEROSEXUAL WHITE MALE. BY DAY 4 I HAD COMPLETELY BECOME A KYLE. I NOW HAVE UNCONTROLLABLE URGES TO DRINK WHITE CLAWS AND CALL WOMEN DISHWASHERS. DO NOT GET THIS APP YOU WILL BECOME YOUR OWN WORST NIGHTMARE","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"userName":"azulas bottom"}},{"id":"6177386953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:33:41Z","review":"I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes when I opened this app to find a nightmare awaiting me. My child was sitting next to me and started crying hysterically because of the scary man on the phone. I‚Äôm repulsed. My son then continued to plead with me to get rid of it because it was scaring him. How can we go on with this if the children are scared to look at this, in the words of my son, ‚Äúorange muppet man‚Äù!? I don‚Äôt recommend this app for anyone. Expect nightmares after opening.","isEdited":false,"title":"Scarier than five nights at Freddie‚Äôs","rating":1,"userName":"lakemongoose"}}]}
