Living in Georgia AND being a distant relative of Herbert Hoover (an admirable republican U.S president; 1929-1933) I am a natural conservative and have always swung right. When I heard about this application he created for the citizens of his party I was ecstatic! But once I downloaded this app and created an account, things started to go downhill. I started feeling.... weird. My hair started slowly falling out, my bones were getting stiff, I couldn’t focus, it was terrible. I thought, there’s no way it’s connected to President Trumps app right? That’s until a package arrived on my door no longer than 2 weeks ago. And what was on the package? Trumps administration logo. Although I had my suspicions that Trumps app was causing me the pain I recently experienced, I was still excited at the sight of the package and eagerly brought it inside to be opened. After all, once a Trump supporter always a Trump supporter, right? Wrong. Because you will never guess what was in that package. \n\nA bag of Cheetos.\n Whaaaat? A bag of Cheetos? Someone must be messing with me! Why would Trumps administration send me a bag of Cheetos in the mail? I was just as confused as you are....\nNaturally I ate them, because I am an old fat white man ( I’m sure you could’ve assumed that based on the first sentence of this review). But man, those Cheetos were my second biggest regret, close behind the time I got high on bathsalts and took my ginny pigs eye out with a spoon. \nShortly after eating the Cheetos, I had an intense heart attack. Luckily my 9 year old mistress (10 next month) drove me to the hospital in time. Things were going fine and my doctor saved my life! She was a very sweet blond young woman with gorgeous blue eyes who stuck by me the whole time. She kept me in that hospital for almost a week, doing everything she could to keep me alive. Finally, when it was time for me to leave, I knew I had to express my appreciation for her. I said to her “Doctor, please take off your mask. I want to see your beautiful face. I think I might be in love with you...” \nAfter a light giggle, the doctor pushed her long blond curls to the side and started to pull down her mask, revealing..... her nose... a little extra mustache hair.... and..... no lips?\nI turned to my mistress and asked her the pressing question we all had in mind... “She has no lips. How will she get a kiss kiss?” \nIn which my mistress responded, “Very ugly, no kiss for her.” \nI did not disagree with my mistress,  as for when the doctor took her mask off completely, my mistress went into paralytic shock. This doctor was no doctor at all. \nIt was in fact, Kaitlin Bennet.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177996090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:42:44Z","rating":1,"title":"dixie damelio 👁👄👁","userName":"vvxem","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177995759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:42:38Z","rating":1,"title":"the app is ass😘","userName":"trixieeeee.","review":"i came here to see what other bs our orange headed pig had to say about america and the app was garbage. confusing. not functional. disorganized. would. not. recommend. if i could give a lower review than 1 i would💕🧚🏽🦋🥰","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177995392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:42:33Z","rating":1,"title":"girl bye😃😃.","userName":"slenderman😀✨✨","review":"Ladies up in here tonight\nNo fighting\nWe got the refugees up in here (no fighting)\nNo fighting\nShakira, Shakira\nI never really knew that she could dance like this\nShe make a man wants to speak Spanish\n¿Cómo se llama?

It proceeded to tell plans of deleting some app called tiktok, how it made roblox shut down for some time and hating twitter. I had to call it a very bad orange app for it to finally go away. Once i opened the app there it was AGAIN telling me “you cant get rid of me b_____”.
