Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.

Then later on in the day, I opened it again and my brother’s friend’s cousin’s stepmom’s uncle caught on fire while taking a 💩. I didn’t think anything of it but then I opened it a third time and my goldfish got diabetes :((. I tried to use the app again but my phone started making a loud noise as if it were a rocket about to take off and then it completely exploded into tiny, itty bitty pieces. I think it’s also very inconvenient and nobody should have the unfortunate experience dealing with it. It should be taken off the App Store immediately especially since many other people have had similar bad experiences. -8382/10 would not recommend ://","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever :’(","userName":"Bsiselwmbra","date":"2020-06-29T01:55:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134046842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i don’t even want to get started on the amount of notifications i got from this stupid app. as soon as i went on the app, i could not breathe. when i had exited the app i suddenly could breathe. i went on again in hopes of a better outcome. but this time i had started bleeding from my nose. don’t bother with this app (you hear me republicans?) it will only create a curse on yourself and america and we already have a big curse due to 2020.","rating":1,"title":"✨trump sucks✨","userName":"erinsattler","date":"2020-06-29T01:53:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134037992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok I know what your thinking, what the app made you poop your pants?
