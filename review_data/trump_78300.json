It looked similar to trumps. There were no buttons, just an orange. I tapped all over the screen until it changed. A question was displayed that asked, \" Are you alone? \" I immediately got super suspicious and somewhat scared. But I was in fact, alone. So I answered truthfully and pressed \"Yes\". Nothing changed. I guess I must have clicked wrong? I pressed \"Yes\" again. And again. And again. Nothing. \"Alright what the hell is going on with this app?\". Suddenly my house lights flickered. In a matter of seconds, they shut off. I almost peed my pants. I was extremely anxious and scared, I didn't know why they turned off all of a sudden. I thought the best thing to do was to delete the app in case anything was going on. So I immediately looked at my phone... but it was shut off. The battery couldn't have died, right? It was at 69% before I downloaded the app. I held the power button to turn it on. But nothing happened. Then I heard something in the kitchen fall. A small object, like a fruit. I quickly dropped my phone, turned to look at my door, and ran. I went straight to the kitchen to check out the noise. I looked everywhere to find what small object fell, but everything was fine. I stood in complete darkness looking all around me. I knew something was going to happen. Out of a sudden, I felt a pain in my back. I jumped and looked back to see what hit me. And on the floor, was an orange. A small orange the size of my palm. I blinked to see if it was real. But now, there were two. I blinked again, three. Again, four. And soon enough, there was a pile of them. I backed up quickly, but they rolled closer to me. \"No.. No... NO!\" I blacked out. \nWhen I woke up, I was on my bed. I checked my phone to see if the app was still there. It was gone. I immediately hid my phone under my pillow and closed my eyes. I felt a pain in my arms and legs as I lay flat. I didn't even bother to look. Soon after, I dozed off. In my mind was this question: What the hell just happened."}},{"id":"6175263831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:36:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app. 🙄🙄😒😒😒😒","userName":"little miss stink 🤪😼","review":"this is the worst, stinkiest, most terrible app i’ve ever had. so boring and it’s called trump 2020 🤢🤢🤢🤢 worst. app. ever!"}},{"id":"6175228976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:23:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","userName":"snehshbsiabs","review":"do NOT get this app . your dog will get hit by a train and your great grandma’s step uncles dog will die of heart disease if u get it. i’m warning u"}},{"id":"6175218867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:20:03Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No","userName":"al😱🤓😫🤓","review":"Just no sorry I didn’t like the app"}}]}
