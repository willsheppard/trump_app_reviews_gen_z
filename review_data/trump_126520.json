BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS.

JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations.

It sounds obvious, but this generation is seriously lacking the boy bands many of us grew up with in the '90s. This revival is much needed and allows for us to meticulously discuss who is our favorite and why. Do I love Harry because he has a gorgeous head of hair? Or do I love Niall because he's so sweet and playful? The struggle is real.\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n2. Their backstory is touching. In 2010, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo artists for the UK's X Factor. They didn't advance in the \"Boys\" category, but then Simon Cowell decided to put them together as a five-piece boy band to compete in the \"Groups\" category. They went on to place third in the competition and wildly grow in popularity over the next four years. They started as strangers, and now they're brothers — it's a beautiful thing.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n3. Their music is catchy. Perhaps the most blatant reason to love this boy band is that their songs are good, and their music videos are even better. The upbeat jam \"Best Song Ever\" truly is the best song ever, while \"Story of My Life\" will evoke emotions you didn't even know you had.\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n4. They're not too young for you.Because you are just listening to their music, not actually dating them. So who cares about age? Most pop stars at this time are in their 20s, and let's not forget another popular British band, The Beatles, which introduced the world to four twentysomethings in the 1960s.\n\n5. They're REALLY CUTE. As a follow up to number 4, it's just undeniable how adorable they are. A true fan will see the beauty in each and every one of them, but if you just have your eye on one or two of them, that's fine as well. We are empowered women, able to admire the pleasing aesthetics of men without feeling a little creepy. It's fine. Just think of them as puppies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n6. They're British. That accent just makes any person instantly ten times hotter, and we're of course extra interested in anything European... Anything to feel more connected to the royal family.\n\n7. They love their fans. There's nothing better than obsessing over pop stars and knowing they care about you as well. Too many celebs don't thank their fans for their success, but 1D always does. Every concert, every award show — they have their producers, managers, and stylists, but in the end it's the Directioners who made this band what they are.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n8. They're really good friends. You can just tell the friendship is real, and it's so heartwarming to see a musical act that doesn't have drama. That just makes any person feel good. Keep it up, boys.\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n\n9. They have good style. Who doesn't appreciate a man who can dress well? They're not your typical boy band with matching outfits and choregraphed moves at their shows, but when it's time to get fancy, these young men impress.\n\n10. Their concerts are a spiritual experience. You may be surrounded by hoards of screaming teenage girls and will probably get stuck getting in and out of the venue for an hour, but their shows pretty much have everything you would need in a performance.\n\nThey sing the classics:\n\nThere's powerful ballads:\n\nAnd there are theatrics:\n\nRelated:\n\n13 of Our Favorite Celebrity Photobombs\n\n30 No-Makeup Celebrity Selfies That Are Totally Gorgeous\n\nThis is What the Game of Thrones Cast Has Been Up to Over the Summer\n\n10 Times We Couldn't Believe Our Eyes During Beyoncé and Jay Z's On the Run Tour\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images, GIFS via Giphy\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

I received this iPad as a gift from my husband for our 43rd anniversary.We are proud Americans and we give our full support to president Donald j. trump🇱🇷. my granddaughter showed me how to install this app, but as soon as I did a white box popped up that prompted me to plug in my iPad because it said I only had 10% battery remaining. I was extremely wary of this message, as I had just received the iPad yesterday and it could not possibly be out of battery. I have used Nokia cellular phones for over 10 years, and I have had no problem with the battery life, so why should I have issues with a much more expensive Apple product? I believe this is due to the fact that this product, the trump 2020 app, has downloaded a virus onto my device. As an American, I pride myself on being strong willed and independent enough that viruses have no effect on me🇺🇸🇺🇸so I ignored the message and opened the app, with hopes that I will be keeping America great by doing so. much to my dismay, the screen turned black and the buttons stopped working 20 minutes after I opened the app. I am on the way to Best Buy now, and I hope they can help me. I think their geek squad is the top of the line 😹😹!  President trump claims that all lives matter, but clearly he has not taken the battery life of my new iPad into account when making this app. I am confident that this app is worse than the fake news snowflake “Coronavirus”"}},{"id":"6178236573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"struggling tik tok refugee😌✨","userName":"Shane YÆW BÜŸĘÆSŠ","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i immediately opened the app and was unpleasantly surprised.

Charli Damelio for president 2020😹😹😹 btw i hate u trump 🙃🙂 🔪 u shouldn’t have taken tik tok away from me u ugly orange COW! good day 😜😜"}},{"id":"6178235681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"⏰","userName":"ranchula","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"0000/10 would not recommend"}}]}
