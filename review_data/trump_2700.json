Downloaded the app thinking it would help me sign up for the next rally. Instead, a bright light flashed on my screen, and then my phone froze. Now I don’t remember the last four hours of my life. Or what I think was four hours? I’m looking at my calendar on my phone right now. It says July 9, 1862. That can’t be right. So it messed with my calendar app somehow too. I’m looking outside. There is nothing. No buildings, no cars... Wait. There is someone. A fat little sickly-orange man is standing on a distant hill. Leaning forward slightly. Staring at me. He’s crying. Wailing. I can’t make out what he’s saying, but it sounds like “Maga.... magaaaa....” He stops. It is quiet. There is nothing. \n\nThere is nothing.\n\nSomeone is behind me.","rating":1,"title":"App doesn’t work right"}},{"id":"6177300635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dillones","review":"An absolute DISGRACE of an app. After careful consideration, I decided to download this app after attending one of Mr. Trump’s cult gatherings to further accentuate my admiration for him. I would even go as far as to say that Mr. Trumpet’s values and polices are absolutely gorgeous, and so I thought that this app would exonerate said values and polices. However, the app failed to so. And to my dismay, the overall layout and aesthetics of this unruly app are truly un-American and one hundred percent unpatriotic. Not only that, when launching the app, I was in utter shock after I was presented with the most unattractive, ill-flavored, hideous, ghastly, revolting, disgusting, disfigured, monstrous, deformed, reptilian-like, photo of Mr. Trōhmpt. For these reasons, I most certainly was displeased with my experience and would absolutely NOT recommend this app. Period.","rating":1,"title":"🍊👄🍊"}},{"id":"6177264622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:58:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"PickyGamer22","review":"I was just getting the app to support my best friend President Orange when I come to find out that the app stole my pet rocks friend's giraffes cousin!

First of all, it charged my card immediately 15$ for a red Trump 2020 hat that I never purchased. One can say I was outraged. This embarrassment of a representation of our country his horrifying, and frankly crude. Second, after 20 min. of using this app the devil appeared and sucked my soul straight out of my body. OUTRAGEOUS! I went straight to the World Wide Web to research how to reclaim my soul, but I could find no helpful remarks. Finally, a ghoul popped out of the screen and made me drop my new iPhone 6s. This fool of a ghoul claimed he was president, but I was like “nooo” derenn j Trump is president. So now I have a lot of confusion. To conclude, only fools would get this app.","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"}},{"id":"6177069500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:03:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur mom 🙈✨","review":"THIS APP GAVE ME NIGHTMARES!! I suffer from a deathly fear of clowns 🤡, and whenever I see one, I immediately freeze 🥶 with terror 😱 and pass out 😵. Right when I opened the app, a picture of cheeto 🍊 bunker boy showed up - WHICH TRIGGERED MY FIGHT OR FLIGHT. 🔪 ❌👹. I was so scared that I fell out of my chair and cracked my head open 🤕. Trump refuses to pass affordable healthcare so now I am broke 🚫💰 from paying the hospital 🏥 bills. I can’t afford to see my therapist anymore, so every night 😴 I wake up screaming 🙀 from nightmares of the president throwing Cheetos 🍊at me, forcing me to hide in his bunker 💣, etcetera. My waking hours are also haunted with his clownish face 🤡🤡🤡. Please remove this app from the App Store, because then I will rest easy knowing no one will suffer like I do.","rating":1,"title":"I am now broke and suffering from anxiety"}},{"id":"6176994634","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MusicalMia9105","review":"I downloaded this app to gain more awareness of what Donald Trump would be trying to accomplish the next presidency if he won the election. Instead, before I could read anything, the app took a countless amount of time to load. On top of that, my phone started to slow down so I didn’t have much of another option besides to just delete the app. I recommend not downloading this, it will only take up your time. Since then, my phone has been continuously taking a long time to load my other apps. I’ve had to use a vpn/ hotspot to get my phone to work. I believe this app has downloaded viruses onto my device. Please don’t download this app and make yourself more aware by using different sources.","rating":1,"title":"Needs Improvement"}},{"id":"6176812501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:55:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Angela2104$","review":"When this app finally downloaded (it took DAYS and I had to delete every single picture of my dead grandmother from my phone to get enough storage space😢😢😢) it caused my other grandma to die.

I downloaded the app to support our lord and savior daddy Donny trump and after a few days of using the app I noticed my thumbs were starting to turn orange... I wasn’t sure what to do so I contacted a a doctor who told me I wasn’t covered enough by my health insurance to talk to him. The orange slowly started to move up my arms and it eventually got to my shoulders, neck, and chest. I started blurting our phrases like “ALL LIVES MATTER” and “WHITE POWER”, I had absolutely no control over it. After this happened I immediately discontinued use of this app. The orange color started to fade and I started having coherent thoughts again. This was a very scary thing to happen. I will not be using the app again and I would like to speak with the manager.","rating":1,"title":"BEWARE 😳🤭"}}]}
