When I looked at my fingers, I noticed they had an orange substance on them similar to Cheeto dust. I went to wash my hands and after scrubbing for 20 MINUTES the substance did not come off fully. I accredit this to Trump’s fake orange tan. If you like having clean fingers, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:55:14Z"}},{"id":"6173775677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jen Zeee","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"review":"First if all, the app took almost three days ti download and in those three days, it wouldn’t let me access any other apps!

But then, I opened it this morning and a bunch of oranges started falling from my ceiling. They kept hitting me in the head and I got knocked out. One of the oranges exploded and the juice went in my eyes. Then, a guy with a box came to my door. It was for me! I opened the box, and A BUNCH OF ORANGES START FLYING AT MY FACE!
