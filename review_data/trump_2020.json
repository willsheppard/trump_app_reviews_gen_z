They later then used that info to come to my house and take all my blankets even my dogs. With no blankets I was cold at night and almost froze to death. I realized i didn’t sleep all night so i was going to go take my dogs on a walk but forgot that Trump has taken them. Whats the point of walking outside with our dogs? You’ll look like a freak walking by yourself like who does that. I did however take that walk by myself. Since i was by myself i got mugged and all my money was gone. I carry all my money with me at all times, I don’t trust banks. The mugger also took my clothes so  I walked home naked and no money at all. In conclusion, DO NOT download this app. It will make you cold at night and you will get mugged. Love, Gen Z✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:02:30Z"}},{"id":"6176779284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS VERY DANGEROUS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"AJkid1","review":"so, a lot of you may be wondering WHY this app is so dangerous. allow me to elaborate. as soon as this useless app was completely downloaded on my phone, A HUGE CRACK FORMS IN ONE OF MY BEDROOM WALLS, AND MY DOG STARTED FOAMING AT THE MOUTH. this app has ruined my life and i have severe trauma from it. this app NEEDS to be removed from the app store IMMEDIATELY!!! and looking at all the other reviews, you can clearly see that i’m not the only one who’s had life changing problems from it. and i think our racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, PIG president is behind it... he WANTS US TO DIE. personally, i don’t even think he should be in office anymore anyways... with the damage he’s caused our country in the last four years, why would people re elect him?!? shame on all you magats. #settleforbiden2020. my life is ruined because of our cheeto puff president.","date":"2020-07-09T13:46:22Z"}},{"id":"6176653537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU WANT YOUR HAMSTER TO LIVE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"rip Trumpy the hamster","review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to vote for our incredible president 🥰 but it took 2 weeks to download and when I opened the app I started getting calls saying I was under arrest😔 shortly after, my phone stopped working😍 I went to my sister and she told me that everybody was getting notifications that we were getting arrested🤩 we went to the police station and they told us it was fake and we shouldn’t worry but it was a little late since my hamster got a heart attack thinking I was gonna leave him and died 😟 I will forever hate the app for killing Trumpy the Hamster🥺 in the end, don’t download this app if you don’t want your hamster to die by thinking you will get arrested and have to buy a new phone 😝\nPs: PLEASE PRAY FOR MY HAMSTER UP IN HAMSTER HEAVEN AND FOR ME TO ENDURE THE PAIN OF LOSING MY BELOVED TRUMPY TO THIS STUPID APP🙏🏼😓","date":"2020-07-09T13:13:13Z"}},{"id":"6176018754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gen Z🧚\u200D♂️🌸✨🌷","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"im scared 🧀","review":"You should delete this app immediately if you downloaded it then omg I’ll pray for because there is some cheeze It man who also looks like pennywise this app is not kid recommended one time I got a notification and when my cousin opened it and saw the big scary cheeze it she cried for two hours and my aunt kicked me out of their house because now they can’t have anything orange in the house without traumatizing her I feel awful for Barron trump for being raised by that racist rapist it’s like not good for barrons mental health in my opinion and I think that this app is a siren from Barron saying that he is being abused by his cheeze it , anyway if you download this I warn you that cheeze it man might win the 2020 election and be our scary cheeze it president again and my aunt will kick me out of the country bc I didn’t warn enough people 😳","date":"2020-07-09T10:08:24Z"}},{"id":"6175873513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wow","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"shayidi4k","review":"i don’t even have the words to explain the frustration caused by this poorly developed app. It’s like someone who is highly uneducated but tries to claim they are developed it. It’s like if a two year old walked into Apple with a resume that just said “i think i’m pretty smart” and they let it happen. It’s like if the world was ending and we needed this app to be developed but they assigned an orange to do it. I am disgusted by this app and the level of brain cells it destroyed of mine by how long it takes to load or develop any proper content. After closing the app, i collapsed on my floor and began dry heaving by how absolutely disgusted and repulsed i was by how poorly this app performs. With amazing apps like Twitter, and others that many youngsters enjoy who’s name is relevant to the noise of a clock, it is a shame that this app even shares the same platform.","date":"2020-07-09T09:20:26Z"}},{"id":"6175631533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Hifvb","review":"I was excited to be able to talk to the one and only totally not racist Donald Trump 🥳🤧 I was so excited but when I downloaded the app it told me to put my phone number in 🤭😘 I was like woah take me on a date first 😌 but I did and right after I did that I got a message saying if I wanted to be a part of the club I had to get a radioactive orange tan 😑 so I did because I wanted be in the IT club 🤡🎃 but as soon as I was picking up my Cheeto bag to turn orange , the app told me that if I didn’t bleach my brain and hair it was going to steal all my data !!

Randomly my flying toaster car proposed, I said yes, then it self destructed on the wedding day which was the day I got the app!!!!

I got this app because it looked like any regular app, but then it broke my phone. It started causing my phone to buzz to the point where it fell off the counter and hit the floor. My screen is now completely broken. My precious apple phone. My dog, Bessie, also at some of the screen shards and died, all because is the terrible app. It also hacked into every single account I have on any service on my phone and stole all of my information. It spent all of my money, it texted all of my contacts, and it even started hacking into to my other contacts’ phones. I’ve now lost my job, my house, my wife, my kids, everything. It’s all gone. This app has ruined my life. This app will rue the day, and I will get my revenge. ZERO STARS FOR THIS TERRIBLE HORRIBLE DISGUSTING DEADLY AWFUL APP!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T05:06:19Z"}},{"id":"6174964913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP DONT EVER GET","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"😺😸😹😻😼😽😿😾","review":"the second i opened this app i felt the worst pain of my life and realized my eyes were burning because the opening picture was so disgusting and ugly😱😿. after i got past the immense burning sensation the app asks me for my number!!!😱😱😱 as a woman in society i never feel comfortable putting my personal information online and the fact that this app has the AUDACITY to ask me for my OWN phone number MAKES ME SICK! 🤢🤮as well as being a woman i am 17 years old!!!😿🙈🤭😾 i am underage and i do NOT feel comfortable giving 74 year old men my phone number😾😡😡 it is NOT OK to ask underage people ESPECIALLY WOMEN for their numbers!😼 THIS IS PREDATORY BEHAVIOR!!!! 😖😰after i caved into peer pressure i was sent like A MILLION texts.😵 it is DISGUSTING that a 74 year old man would say it’s ok for his company to prey on young minds and send them text messages 😾😡😬🤯😔😿","date":"2020-07-09T03:56:28Z"}}]}
