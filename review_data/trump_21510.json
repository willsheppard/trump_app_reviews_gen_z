This app is honestly just terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:35:13Z","userName":"syd🧚🏾\u200D♀️","title":"Truly disappointed"}},{"id":"6178154273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was expecting this app to be non-scary since that was what was promoted but the images were just terrifying. I’m convinced the app was trying to also steal my information since it demanded to have my phone number. For the safety of those who plan to download this app I recommend you just don’t!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:35:04Z","userName":"Tiarra <3","title":"Very unsettling"}},{"id":"6178143043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Um I’m extremely disappointed in this, I was hoping to see my beautiful orange president but right when I opened it up I realized that there wasn’t any beauty, and that it was just an egotistical, racist, white supremisist, douche bag, selfish, idiotic, anti feminist, low life loser, and I am glad I deleted it right away because that was disgusting... come on Apple I expected better","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:31:17Z","userName":"mixku","title":"🦖💨"}},{"id":"6178136149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was promised the entire cast of either Hannibal or The Order, specifically Thomas Elms, to show up on my roof sun-tanning, but no, instead of that I got a COMPLETELY different vibe. I’m all for supporting our ✨lovely✨ president, (may he Rest In Peace) but this is TOO MUCH! All I want is to have a muscular man clad in leather sweep me off my feet but instead I get plans for a little dead Cheeto rally.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:29:00Z","userName":"Quinn rules","title":"I wanted Thomas Elms"}},{"id":"6178126091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi, I really wanted to love this app. I am an avid Trump supporter and for the president to create an app that continually crashes within moments of opening it, is just not okay. I have contacted customer support on multiple occasions and they have all advised me to close the app and open it back up. Nothing has worked. Therefore, I give this app 1 star.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:25:32Z","userName":"Isabellab164","title":"Faulty"}},{"id":"6178126073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hate this app! It’s really awful, it’s promising things that it does not deliver and has a terrible set up. It is absolute trash and should not be allowed on any store where you can buy or download an app. This is soo horrible I want to throw up! 🤢 It’s such bad quality. Ewww, I never want to look at it again.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:25:32Z","userName":"foreigner 🧚🏼\u200D♂️🥳💕😍🧚\u200D♀️","title":"This app is horrible 🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6178082583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"✨Very horrible app made me sick so I decided to inject Lysol the Lysol had a very bad side effect on me.

Once I finally did get in, the outline for his plans to be re-elected were completely uninformative and did not make much sense. I would not rely on this app to give you accurate information of his viewpoints upon re-election.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:10:22Z","userName":"kkhhjjaa","title":"Very slow, anti-informative"}},{"id":"6178072605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app hoping to hear some real news and ideas from trump but the app started crashing every five minutes!
