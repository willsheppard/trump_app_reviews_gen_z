As you can see gen z’s presence is scaring him so he has to blackmail us into voting for him but that’s so funny considering we’re literally not afraid of anything. Of course i deleted the app right away but now whenever I press another app that same face keeps popping up nearly putting me into cardiac arrest each time so he’s not only blackmailing me but also trying to kill me! also don’t vote for Kanye."}},{"id":"6172221802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app almost caused my death","date":"2020-07-08T13:19:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"👎Bad bad bad","review":"I was suffering from an odd illness so I decided to go to the doctor. My doctor who is an educated female who has a higher IQ than the current president, said that I was losing brain cells. She then asked me the normal questions about drugs and chemicals and I answered no and then she asked me the final question and it was “Has this been happening for the past 3ish years?” to which I answered yes. She said that a large amount of people are reporting the same issue and it is due to the idiotic leadership of Donald Trump and the false and malicious reporting from his team. In conclusion, DO NOT download or use this app unless you want to lose brain cells."}},{"id":"6172162370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"One Star From Me","date":"2020-07-08T13:03:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Aubrey Joseph","review":"I got this app to let every single one of ye Boomers know that Donald’s Trump and his policies had ruined my life. I was SO excited to join the military and serve my country so that I could get the tuition help I needed to get an education and support myself financially. But lo and behold I could not, because my biological sex was not that of which I chose to express myself.  And it gets better, because now my right to be treated at a hospital is no longer guaranteed, so you’re keeping a perfectly able young person from serving in the military or getting proper medical help all because the way I express my gender makes you uncomfortable."}},{"id":"6171943574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app Kills","date":"2020-07-08T12:00:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"fdp!","review":"This app gave me a virus. Poor layout, and the people on it seem hateful towards my community (specifically people with an actual skin tone who aren’t white nor orange). Will not be using EVER again as you can tell. And I regret downloading it. Also It caused me a car accident, tune in for part 2.\n\nEdit: This is PART 2. Okay so I was driving home and I was buckled and all. I had the app opened and I was Looking at the latest feed. When I wasn’t looking up I ran into 2 birds, a deer, a bunny, AND ANOTHER CAR. After swerving, I hit a tree! All because of this stupid app. I am currently trying to remove this virus from my cellphone.

Trump is a disgusting racist, white-supremacist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, child raping, narcissistic, capitalist, psychotic, delusional, fascist, and down-right horrible human being. He never deserved to have the highest office in this country, and he doesn’t deserve any recognition of the people. He has failed this country. His incompetence to handle the coronavirus has led to the deaths of 130,000+ Americans, is doing nothing about the racial injustices in this country, refuses to take accountability for his actions and so much more. Dump Trump 2020. He doesn’t deserve to be president. He doesn’t deserve anything. Period."}},{"id":"6177826746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Poopy app dump trump","date":"2020-07-09T18:48:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dks(dwightkurtschrute)","review":"Don’t support ✨rapists✨at all but especially ✨racist homophobic rapists✨🙀😹😹😾😾😾😾it gives small pp energy🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 I came home the store one day and my family was gone and my table had a note on it saying “ when you vote for the orange🍊you will get your family back- government❤️” The next day trump emailed me and said if you don’t vote for me I will send you back to your country.

Not only does it spam my messaging system but also forces the phrase “Trump 2020” in my face and down my throat, with weird hallucinations of me seeing real life Cheetos popping up everywhere. I tried to delete it and wipe it from memory but things got worse. The Cheetos keep showing up and even worse theres now a bunch of flying pigs circulating my airspace. DO NOT GET THIS APP unless you want the rest of your life to be forever haunted by Mr. Orange and his minions."}},{"id":"6177765063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad app","date":"2020-07-09T18:30:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"m~a~b","review":"We are trying to delete the worst app in the planet with this disgusting orange non- human this man wants to take away tik tok go all of the children/ adult because he is down right a hater he is like instead of taking away tik tok he need to take of that wig he already sending the children back to school and putting them at risk of catching COVID-19 this man is sick and he needs help pls help us take this awful/ disgusting/ disrespectful orange looking thing down us as a nation us as the USA we need to stand for what we want and what we will get so help us take a stand to save TikTok #savetiktok plsssss 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 it would mean the world to us TikTokers. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🥺😭"}},{"id":"6177759527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible and badly made","date":"2020-07-09T18:28:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"duo killed my family","review":"I downloaded the app looking for news but noticed the cluttered and overall messy design was very difficult to work with. after having it download for 3 weeks i expected a lot of a better app. after using it for a while my phone started glitching and everything was hard to do. it reached a point where i couldn’t even close the app it wouldn’t let me. before i knew it the app crawled out of my screen and murdered me and my family while burning down multiple houses while saying racist homophobic and sexist things along with the words “Trump 2020”"}},{"id":"6177724434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trash app 🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-09T18:18:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Real Niall","review":"This app is just awful, it started by taking forever to download and when it finally it did it was crashing my phone, so I thought let me just delete and download again, No!
