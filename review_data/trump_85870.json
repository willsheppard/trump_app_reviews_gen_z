I was so wrong! The problems started when the app didn’t download for almost a full three weeks!😱 I after it had finally downloaded, I called down my little sister to come see (she is trumps biggest fan). I opened the app and saw a flashing screen! This triggered her epilepsy. After she got done having a seizure, all she could say were the words “CHINA”, ALL LIVES MATTER”, and “WHITE POWER”! 😔 I was shocked! All of a sudden, the app sent a notification. It was directions  to an unknown location. I thought that maybe this place could fix my sister (she was now walking like a dog). It took over a day to get to the location. It was a mansion covered in Cheeto dust! I was not going in! I started to put the car in reverse and in my backup camera I saw two Oompa Loompa looking figures! 😖They pulled me and my sister out of the car. They told me I was getting a spray tan. I told them I didn’t want a spray tan, but they forced me to get one! As I stepped into the room where I was getting my tan, they made me eat so much I gained 200 pounds! They stuffed me full of McDonald’s and Diet Coke! They told me it was finally time for my tan. I stepped in front of where I thought it was going to spray the tanner, but instead Cheeto dust shot out!😭😭😭😭 I then saw a small hole in the door where the Oompa Loompas were peeking through. I tried to run over and put my finger over the whole, but I couldn’t move that fast because I was so fat! When I  finally made it, and I placed my finger over the hole, a bucket of orange paint poured over me! I put on my clothes and ran out as fast as I could! I had to leave my sister behind.😢 I got home and saw Donald, himself, peeking through my windows! I looked just like him, now fat and orange! He saw me and starting chanting a curse that made my house started shaking and things start flying! I then remembered the app.😱 I deleted as fast as a could! Everything went back to normal, and my sister even came back! We aren’t voting for Trump this year for these reasons. #settleforbiden😍🧚🏽🌺💋❤️🙈✨ Please don’t download this app love! Yeah❤️","rating":1,"title":"Tragic Story😿😢😣😰😱😩😓","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:16Z"}},{"id":"6173185558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"f**K donld truMp","isEdited":false,"review":"One of the worst apps I have ever seen","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-08T17:59:57Z"}},{"id":"6173182684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mills;)","isEdited":false,"review":"i keep seeing this orange man and i thought this app was for people who are sick in the head but i guess it’s worst 😨 i also keep having nightmares about that orange 🍊 man, help!!!","rating":1,"title":"help","date":"2020-07-08T17:59:02Z"}},{"id":"6173178430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Erykah123","isEdited":false,"review":"Full of fake news and nasty men","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever used","date":"2020-07-08T17:57:40Z"}},{"id":"6173166143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Not this old lady","isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible app. Totally useless.
