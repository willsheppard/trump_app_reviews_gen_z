It asked me for my social security before downloading, and it took 4 days to download! It made my phone SUPER slow.  Once I FINALLY got the app, the second I opened it I got 5 adds in my face! So annoying. The adds where about spray tans and wigs which I do not need. Once I finally got through all the ads, a hissing cockroach started attacking my phone!!! It wouldn’t leave it alone until I threw my phone and completely demolished it. I also had my house infested with rats when I downloaded it!! I couldn’t even walk 3 steps without stepping in rats. 😡 This app also gave me 25 VIRUSES!!! 25!!!!!! ON MY PHONE *AND* ON MY MACBOOK SOMEHOW?!?! This is OUTRAGEOUS. I do NOT recommend this disgusting app, unless you want a bunch of viruses. This is the most futile piece of despicable garbage I have EVER laid my eyes upon. I had to literally buy a NEW phone because this filled my phone with viruses. Also when I broke my phone, roaches and ants came crawling out!!! SO DISGRACEFUL. SO DISRESPECTFUL. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. APP. It’s SO disappointing. I think this app also gave me 8 different STD’s!!!!🤮 WORST APP EVER.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"😡😡😡⚠️Disgusting!!!

I tried again a few hours later after my phone had finally reset. But once I opened it, all I could see was news articles that had a lot of mistakes. It was telling me things that were blatantly untrue. I could tell they were untrue by just leaving my house and looking at the world around me. That has to be a mistake though, right? Our president is a trustworthy person who only tells the truth, right? He would never deceive us, right? He would never try to convince me to believe in something morally corrupt, right? So, I thought this had to be another gen z prank. A bunch of stupid kids telling lies about our rightful, one true leader. But once I finally got my head out of the Fox News butthole and did some actual research and actually paid attention for once, I found out that’s been going on for the entire presidency. Once I tried to delete the app, flashing lights started popping up along with the message “You will never be free.” Then I was immediately taken to the Illuminati FAQ page. Someone should really look into all this.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’ve Been Bamboozled"}},{"id":"6176768991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yomamasahoee","date":"2020-07-09T13:43:36Z","review":"When i downloaded this app I was astonished. I couldn’t believe my non-racist, non-homophobic, cheeto- i mean handsome president had an app. But later on i would come to the realization that this app was a scam! I’ll start my story at the very beginning, I was washing dishes because I know my president would be happy that women are back in the kitchen instead of at work. When my fellow dishwasher texted me and informed me about this app. I was so excited, I loved our cheeto-puff. However, once it fully downloaded my phone started glitching and eventually blew up! Yes blew up. It was all i could afford seeing as my lovely president believes women should be paid less than men. Then when I turned around a man with a giant gun and a Trump 2020 hat led me to my parents house. Where I saw my mom and dad being threatened! My fingers hurt from writing because i’m still currently being held captive, but I’m at jail now, and i’m trying to type with the new phone the prisoners made for me but it’s hard when your hands are cuffed. Anyways at this prison they make us vote for trump 50 times a day to rig the system. But that’s all! I still love my lovely cheeto-puff president. Just don’t download this app...","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6176654450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Arreanah","date":"2020-07-09T13:13:28Z","review":"So I was just being me and I downloaded this app then I went on it and somehow It was yelling at me through the screen and it was being very mean to me and telling me that I don’t belong on this app and the Trump 2020 that Biden will lose and that I’m a bad person.

And when I thought everything was all over I saw Tucker Carlson and Trump himself carry Barron Trump on a plank and they had these white suits on and they asked me what I thought abt ANTIFA and then they said I was in a cult when they were the ones in the cute little white cone head costumes, they were calling themselves “the klan” so I decided to summon my queer horse and he saved my life by crushing “the Klan” and we saved Barron Trump. But then Barron told me that we had to save his mom too so we went to the White House and she wasn’t there then Barron told us to look in the bunker and we found her there she was traumatized and then we found out she was an illegal immigrant and was hiding from trumps cult so we helped her get a visa and we lived happily ever after😋","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6175467244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"starrswurld","date":"2020-07-09T06:55:45Z","review":"to start off, i was SUPER excited‼️ to get this app, but from the start i was astonished 😱to find that it took DAYS 😭for the app to load. not only this but, when it finally opened i rushed 🏃to get on the app because i was so excited😆, but i was greeted with my phone 📱catching on fire 🔥and flying out of my window🏚. i kid🧒🏻 you not, the next day after getting my phone 📲fixed i went to get the mail 📬and remembered that i reinstalled the app and gave it another try🙂, but this time my whole house 🏠flipped upside down🔃, plus➕ my mailbox 📫 blew up in my face 💥burning all of my college 🎓 letters📩. regardless i was happy 😀my phone 📞was alright so i continued to open the app and walk 🚶\u200D♀️inside my upside down 🔁house🏠.
