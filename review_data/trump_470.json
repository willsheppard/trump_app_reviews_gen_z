When I got it, it took at least 3 months to download but I just thought that was because so many people were on the app but I still had high expectations because of the things our president is able to do to kids if you know what I mean:) as soon as I opened it it asked for my number, so ofc I just trusted the process and put in my number. After a few weeks I finally get a text talking about the rally coming up and to get your merch but I already have all of the merch. This is when things got weird. I would starting getting texts like “who is the best president in the world?!” Or “if you vote for Biden, I will come slaughter your family”. It was really strange and freaked me out. It was happening to all of my trump supporter friends too. I started to question why I was supporting him and finally did some research. The things I learned were awful. Anyways I am now a democrat and will be voting biden💕✨😊🧍🏽\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!","userName":"CREEPY TEXTS","date":"2020-07-09T13:34:43Z"}},{"id":"6176553090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I first downloaded this app to get some merch from my fav pres. then I downloaded it and it deleted all my apps!!😱😡 Then I re downloaded twitter and found out trump is a racist homophobic pedophile😰I can’t believe I was so blinded before! Then the people on this app tracked me down after I deleted it, 😑they took my sister hostage until I re downloaded it, but I couldn’t download it again I just couldn’t🤕. So I got my kitchen knives and BB gun and went out to get my sister back🤫, my brother tagged along. We finally found them downtown in a huge white building. We came in through the back and stole some employees uniforms. We were scared we would be recognized by our skin color but turns out no one cared. We got up to the jail my sister was in and broke her out!🥳 we ran down the stair and the trump employees chased us with laser guns one hitting my brother in the leg!!😫😫 we drove home and got away from them finally. Finally done with this app! Do NOT DOWNLOAD!😳😳 unless you want a loved one kidnapped 🤭and all storage deleted😥 also they killed my fish after all this!!😭😭","isEdited":false,"title":"Outrageous!!😑🤬","userName":"Rina1979","date":"2020-07-09T12:46:10Z"}},{"id":"6175365846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!! I downloaded this app because I support the president of the United States of America, but when I downloaded the app, a notification popped up that said “go home, sweaty. We only want 10s to support trump.” Needless to say, that wasn’t going to stop me from being a good citizen of the United States so I persisted though I was conflicted. MY president didn’t want me on the app, but i wanted to support him anyway. It made me think about the lengths I should go to support the people I love... am I wrong for continuing anyway? This was a really hard decision for me quite honestly. I was consumed with the decision; i couldn’t eat, sleep, I couldn’t even endanger my loved ones by visiting them without a mask. Pretty soon I was Barely recognizable. Everyone around me was gravely concerned. I didn’t know how to support the president. I took my confederate flag down and abstained from saying all lives matter as I could no longer call myself a true trump supporter. \nIf you download this app, you WILL have to make sacrifices. Sacrifices I wasn’t prepared to make. \nGod bless you all.","isEdited":false,"title":"Would not recommend","userName":"Vincehor","date":"2020-07-09T06:16:15Z"}},{"id":"6175052680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Wow! I can’t believe people even download this app! The layout is very busy and confusing overall! Also the main reason I wrote this review is out of anger. The majority of teens and even adults have TikTok! TikTok is the best app for multiple reasons: teens can ask for help and advice from others teens, relatable content is posted, many other types of videos have kept us teens entertained during this pandemic and especially through quarantine. And your going to take a 12+ app away from kids/teens just to punish China? Grow up! Just because your’e the president doesn’t give you the right to do mindless things. You need start acting like the president and not like a child. Lead by example for once instead throwing a temper tantrum when you’re mad or you don’t get your way. Maybe put yourself in someone else’s shoes to see their perspective for once. But you’re probably to busy taking trips, playing golf, tweeting, and firing people. I sure hope Donald trump doesn’t get elected this year because it’s just going to be ANOTHER 4 years of complete CHAOS.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!","userName":"NatalieZamora","date":"2020-07-09T04:24:17Z"}},{"id":"6174989129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"disgusting. tragic. violating. these are all words that describe my experience with the Trump 2020 app, yet none can describe the unimaginable anger it has festered in me after this experience. now, whenever i am unlucky enough to be reminded of this disgrace of an app, i feel the equivalent of what a dog feels when it sees the mail man. rage. anger. depression. i naively downloaded this app with an image of happily connecting to others and perhaps even becoming c- closer to trump-senpai 0///0👉👈 however these dreams were ripped from me the same way daddy trump rips families apart. now, i am the shell of a person. i understand the meaning of a 1000 yard stare. i am applying for a veterans discount as we speak. \nto all reading, i urge you not to download this app. it will take everything good and pure inside you to run it through the meat grinder of life. once, i was a beautiful snowflake, but now a dog has peed on me, leaving me yellow and uncomfortable. i can only hope to save another wayward soul from cursing themselves with this software. you will no longer be able to have kids after this app. please heed my warning.","isEdited":false,"title":":(","userName":"ahshfjjfndnbshshjdjjdnd","date":"2020-07-09T04:04:10Z"}},{"id":"6174876124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"My wall and my floor were actually fighting about marshmallows because the flavor of the shape was actually not Diet Coke. And then my floor was all like I didn’t know you had three arms? And my wall was all like yeah❤️ I am an alien I think you should catch me outside how bout DAT! And then my pet slug sent me a SNAPCHAT text not like I real one but the CHAT ON the SNAPCHAT and he was like would you still love me if I was a worm 🐛? And then my head actually fell off and my wall starting calling me toothless and I really didn’t appreciate that actually. And then did you know that 4+4 is 8 and 5+5 is 10 but 1+1 is the window on the right side of the car? But ALSO we can’t forget about how one time when I was like six or something and I was watching this show called liked dinosaur express or something like that that’s actually when I learned the word hypothesis. And then the dinosaur was like I have a hypothesis that I was actually supposed to be in the video. She didn’t wanna say anything at first bc she thought ppl would say that she was lying but she finally had to tell her truth.❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","userName":"canadianfencingqueen (tiktok)","date":"2020-07-09T03:29:41Z"}},{"id":"6174783855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I am at a loss if words. Not only by downloading this are you willing to give your ring (left) pinky toe. But, also they (the random officers that show up to your house) steal all of your rugs, curtains,  floor mats and towels. When i came home dealing with the loss of my left ring toe, i had intentions of crying in the middle of my kitchen with a slurpee in my hand. But i came home to more disappointment. I have windows completely surrounding my house. So i had to cry on the hard tile floor drinking my desperation flavored slurpee with my neighbor’s watching me. While crying for hours, i got a notification that i had gotten a VIRUS! Typing this makes me so infuriated. And what makes it worse is that i ran out of my icy, liquid concoction. Dont even make the same mistakes i did. Currently, my liberal dog is spitting on me and yelling at me. I didnt even do anything wrong! All i did was make fun of indigenous people, told a person who suffered from dwarfism to go back go willy wanka, and call a dude with a pink shirt on a bigoted slur,  but i didnt DO anything. *sniffles* i didnt do anythin’ 😩😭","isEdited":false,"title":"Words don’t describe my anger","userName":"Ratatataaaa","date":"2020-07-09T03:02:26Z"}},{"id":"6174780278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This horrible app is so glitchy and buggy my grandpa suffered from a stroke and a heart attack when i downloaded it to his Nokia. It’s as if an autistic epileptic 5 year old with dementia programmed this while choking on Tyson dinosaur chicken nuggets and falling down 23 flights of stairs in Bangkok, California. I downloaded the app on my Samsung Smart Fridge and my cat was literally kidnapped by a gang of obese armadillos. I tried to shot at them with my Nerf N-Strike Elite Renegade Blaster but unfortunately due to their bullet-proof armor this did not stop them. I hope this issue is resolved immediately as for I do not have to money to pay for my cats ¥100,000,000,000 ransom. To point out one specific issue of it it won’t let me order a burger from Panda Express and have it hand delivered by Mike Tyson (CEO and Founder of Tyson Dinosaur Nuggets (P.S. I need dino nuggets for when my mommy make me a swag meal)). Due to this issue I hear by declare that I, Xx_Lil_Pussy_Destoryer_xX, will be deleting this app as for it is very glitchy and buggy and does not accommodate for my needs that are special. Thank you and Goodbye.","isEdited":false,"title":"VERY GLITCHY AND BUGGY!","userName":"Lil Jacka the Rappa","date":"2020-07-09T03:01:20Z"}},{"id":"6174193739","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"first thing i get when i download this app is a cheeto-ish orange peen!🤢 SO terrifying i finally get why the app is for 17+.😡 there are so many pictures of a naked cheeto?? i don’t even know why..i was so terrified and i am a grown woman! i also overheard that this app collects your data and all your info! crazy right? someone LEAKED my ADDRESS BECAUSE OF THIS APP🙄. thank our lord an savior i’m still safe❤️🙏. this app needs to be removed from all cellphones! it’s a very dangerous site and young children who praise him would see naked pictures of a cheeto-ish orange peen😐!! do you want that for your children?? i didn’t think so. i feel bad for the many children who praise our president that have to see that💔that cheeto peen is my sleep paralysis demon now🙁. i now have to carve out my eyeballs from the pain from those pictures and have to see my sleep paralysis doctor, family physician, internal medicine physician, pediatrician, OB/GYN, surgeon, psychiatrist, cardiologist, dermatologist 80 times a day!🙄🙄🙄 0 stars if i was able to. worst app EVER! definitely do not recommend😒.","isEdited":false,"title":"thought this was a safe app..i guess i was wrong","userName":"sarah🙄✋","date":"2020-07-08T23:59:52Z"}},{"id":"6174005280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to express my political beliefs and to see what trump was up to. When i opened the app my body turn orange within seconds and i started convulsing as if i was a british girl making a tiktok. When i called 911 the emt’s said they couldn’t help and me and i need to call a preacher to have an exorcism. This makes me very upset bc my whole body is orange and i cant stop saying ignorant things out of my mouth. My hair has turned orange as well and it’s falling out and i’ve gain weight since downloading the app. My mother and dog now hate me and i will be kicked out of my house by tonight. My preacher won’t give me an exorcism bc i refuse to wear a mask #mybodymychoice and now bc of this app i will be homeless. I have no friends, I’ve been fired from my job and my boyfriend broke up with me. I am very upset as an avid trump supporter and i can’t believe he did this to me. If you think i’ll be unsupporting Mr. Trump you’re wrong i’m still brainwashed by him lol😂😂😂. \n\nif anyone is wondering this is complete satire and i actually hate trump.","isEdited":false,"title":"My body has turn orange and i can’t stop shaking","userName":"Musically @johnnaballerina","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:16Z"}}]}
