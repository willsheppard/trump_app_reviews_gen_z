Due to this I passed out and went into a coma which lasted a year! During my time spent in the coma all I could think about was how my dear old president would do such a thing. I had terrible and I mean TERRIBLE dreams and visions in my coma, ones that are way too traumatic to share. Once I woke up and got all of my belongings back I saw the app once again. I decided to give it another shot because as I said prior, I love my president 🙏🏽 When I opened it this time everything appeared to be fine up until I heard a loud crash outside. When I looked out I was met by the sight of aliens and a spaceship! They immediately made eye contact with me and used their powers to shatter my glass window and teleport into my house! (so rude 🙄) Once they were inside of my house they proceeded to ask very touchy questions, one being do you support trump?” to which I answered yes because who doesn’t? But once I answered they looked at each other and said “👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒ 👽” And proceeded to punch me in the face knocking me unconscious! They took me with them to their home planet where I now still reside, writing this review. This is now my new home. I was never able to say goodbye to my family, and now Trump, by hero, my lord and savior, is no longer my president here 😔 Downloading this app has caused me so much pain and 👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜ 😪 Please beware."}},{"id":"6173723497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"where would she said if he would go ✨🧚🏽","date":"2020-07-08T21:04:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"annonymus 🤤","review":"do not get this app. no you are not going swimming 🏊\u200D♀️ is that what meowing fine lol omg is that what diene lolllzzz 😆 horrible app."}},{"id":"6173714861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ew","date":"2020-07-08T21:01:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bidens b*tch","review":"This 😢 app 💔 is 😖 horrible 😡\n \nIt was a late October night... the leaves rustled in the light breeze. I was sitting next to a crackling fire, scrolling through my phone when I came across the app “Trump 2020”. I was intrigued... and in my curiosity I clicked “download”. Then at the very same moment, the floor started to rumble. Everything was shaking, falling, shattering. I jumped up and started rushing towards the door. As I stretched my hand toward the knob, the ceiling collapsed before me. I was trapped... no way out. The shaking became more violent, I could barely stand. As I tried to make my way towards the kitchen, I was thrown into the fire. Pain shot through my body like a bullet. This pain was something I never thought possible. The flames were consuming my flesh and burning me to ashes. My screams were unimaginable. But soon, they were drowned out by chanting. It took all the strength I had left to open my eyes to see what was producing the horrific sound. I then saw my worst nightmare. Right before me was a cult, they all seemed to be wearing Trump masks and chanting “trump, trump, trump...”. I couldn’t stand it anymore, my screams grew louder and louder but so did the chanting. My ears started to bleed because of their shouting. My body began to feel numb... I couldn’t take anymore pain... I wanted my suffering to end. Suddenly, out of no where, a body appeared right in front of me. The cults chanting stopped at once. It didn’t take me long to understand that their chant had summoned the devil himself... Donald John Trump. Fear started to build up inside of me as he drew closer. He bent down and through he yellow and moldy teeth whispered, “я Шрек”. He then stabbed me with his extremely long and revolting nails. The last thing I saw was Trump disappearing into thin air.\n \nI am currently writing this up in heaven. DO NOT purchase this app if u want to live, thank you 😊🙏"}},{"id":"6173694297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Terrible!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:54:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tré 🌲","review":"The first time I opened the 🍊 app, it immediately started blaring homophobic and racist slurs louder than I can explain. My volume would simply not turn down, and after a few hours the roaches started to enter my room. Attracted to the awful, ear-piercing sound, the mounds of roaches climbed and made their way into my room. I got upset, and threw a lit candle onto them which set them all ablaze. They roamed through my house and began to set everything on fire. Attacking my pets and family members, the roaches continued their invasion as my house burned down and my once thriving family members were brutally drowned and asphyxiated by the flaming insects. The roaches seemed to be invincible as the fire had no effect on them. I believe this was because they were chemically bred to be resistant, and set out to attack me and my loving family by the evil trump administration. Once my house and family had been reduced to ashes, the roaches continued to destroy my neighborhood. Families were brutalized and bludgeoned by the absolute absurd amount of genetically modified roaches, and all hope seemed lost. My family is now gone, and I’ve been hiding in the sewers eating rats and molding bread that I ransacked from a store basement. The sewers are safer now that the roaches had been drawn into the overworld by the evil trump app. Every day I wait down here is one day closer to my unescapable demise. I write this review on my last string of life to warn others of the dangers and tragedies of this app. Absolutely by no means download this app, it’s taken everything from me, and soon my life will be so easily dragged from my grasp by the atrocious homophobic, racist, and xenophobic trump administration. All hope is lost, take my word.
