Gen Z is stronger than anything you “Trump 2020” people think you have. Could never find a reason to support🥰 have fun this November! BLM and ABOLISH ICE, thank you very much and hope this app goes before tiktok does!💖","userName":"✨Gen Z cant loose✨","isEdited":false,"title":"💖✨🧚worst thing to ever happen😻🧚\u200D♀️✨not just talking about the app"}},{"id":"6174431034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:19:32Z","rating":1,"review":"First off, the app literally shows pictures of an actual racist and rapist everywhere which is kind of sick and disgusting. He’s not something I want to see because he’s orange and that’s my least favorite color. Speaking of colors, I don’t like the red white and blue theme it reminds me of America which is racist and corrupt. Also, the app is meaningless and useless so I hope it gets taken down soon. Anyways chile I’m goin to the store, y’all want sum😳","userName":"sydkneey","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible🤢"}},{"id":"6174412661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:13:56Z","rating":1,"review":"✨The quality is horrible. It lags like crazy. Most importantly it supports Donald. How could you support someone who is such a bad leader, has such little regard for the common good of others and not just himself. I find it QUITE DISGUSTING to call this man the president. THEREFORE to put the people of the U.S first its best to go ahead and take this trash quality app down while there is still time. Gen Z just won’t stand for it please and thanks!!! ✨\n\n-Love Gen Z❤️","userName":"Gen Z reviewrr","isEdited":false,"title":"Flat out terrible"}},{"id":"6174392850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:02Z","rating":1,"review":"After downloading this app right after I tried opening it my entire phone started glitching and the screen froze every 2 seconds and eventually stopped working!!!!

After she opened it she came crying screaming “THE ORANGE MAN IS GONNA GET ME!” She would not stop crying. When i went to see the app myself the first thing i saw when opening it was a horrible man trying to do a downward dog workout but he was not flexible enough! it sickened me thinking this was in the children category of the appstore. Horrible. Do Not Get. My daughter still has nightmares of him.","userName":"jqjajdjsnsx","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible🙃"}},{"id":"6174250254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:20:30Z","rating":1,"review":"A couple of weeks ago, me (a 78 year old women paralyzed from the neck down) was wheeling around Maryland when I came across The Donald J Trump! 🤮 I tried saying hello because I wanted him to take a picture with me so I could get Instagram clout, he looked me up and down and said “only if you stand up for the picture” then proceeded to spit in my eye!!!!

Trump. I am disgusted to see this childlike and sick behavior to be done by of the leader of our country. I still quite don’t understand the motive behind it, he could just be a sick twisted person.","userName":"allisonfitz","isEdited":false,"title":"Mortified"}},{"id":"6174234113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:14:56Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this app on my 9 year old daughter’s iPad and when she opened it she immediately started crying. I wanted to know what was so wrong so I looked on the screen and it was our president, of the united states of america, naked and asking MY DAUGHTER so send nudes to his campaign email. I am absolutely disgusted by what I saw and what my daughter had to see. If you get this app I highly recommend not opening it ANYWHERE around your children.\n\nsincerely, Lisa Car","userName":"ffuucckk yyoouu","isEdited":false,"title":"I am disgusted"}},{"id":"6174194290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:05Z","rating":1,"review":"Pedophine, racist, idiot, rapist, and literally retarded. Also when I downloaded it I tried to delete it and it wouldn’t delete so I left it there and when I opened my phone it told me it was trying to track my location even though i denied access. I left my phone to charge and when i came back my phone was crawling with cockroaches. 0/5 would never use again, finally got it deleted!","userName":"🄷🄰🄽🄽🄰🄷","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump 20never"}},{"id":"6174188813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:00Z","rating":1,"review":"trump is an orange. he looks like this:🏀🥕☄️🍊🔥🍑🦧💥🦁🦊. he is orange. he is weird. he is as old as my grandma and he has a kid my age. he is not ok. i am traumatized by his presidency. you are weird trump. tik tok will take u down. u can’t win. we’re smarter than you. you rlly think mars is a moon. u are sexist. stop saying sexist things. u can’t ban. tik tok. we’re to powerful. gen z will when. we will always win. we are the future. you are not. we have bigger and better ideas. periodt.","userName":"kiera31907","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}}]}
