So, when I first downloaded this app I expected a lot more from trump because he‚Äôs rich right? Soooo a few hours after I downloaded it I got a text from an unknown number. And it‚Äôs weird because nobody ever texts me cause I‚Äôm a lonely person and don‚Äôt have many friends but when I opened the text, it was Donald trump texting me !! I mean how could Donald trump even know my number? And he‚Äôs in a married relationship with that Barbie !!! And worst of all, his text said ‚Äúhey baby wanna come over to my place to have some fun?‚Äù I was like WHATTTT THEE HELLLLL!!! But then I decided to say yes so that Donald trump could be my sugar daddy and I could steal all his money mwahahaha. So I went over to his place and we had A LOT of fun üòèüòâ. After we were done playing, I walked around the White House and found where he kept the money and STOLE IT AND I RAN AWAY AS FAST AS I COULD!!! AND DONALD TRUMP WAS CHASING MEEE!! But Donald trump had a heart attack and died. So I went home, counted all the money and he had $100000000000000000000000000!! And then I just lived on with life and did a lot of shopping üòÅüßöüèΩ\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è. And I was so happy my plan was a success. Donald trump died, I was rich, and Obama got back into office. I bought myself some Oompa Loompas because I was feeling lonely. And they lived happily ever after. THE END!!
