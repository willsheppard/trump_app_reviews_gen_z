So, when I first downloaded this app I expected a lot more from trump because he’s rich right? Soooo a few hours after I downloaded it I got a text from an unknown number. And it’s weird because nobody ever texts me cause I’m a lonely person and don’t have many friends but when I opened the text, it was Donald trump texting me !! I mean how could Donald trump even know my number? And he’s in a married relationship with that Barbie !!! And worst of all, his text said “hey baby wanna come over to my place to have some fun?” I was like WHATTTT THEE HELLLLL!!! But then I decided to say yes so that Donald trump could be my sugar daddy and I could steal all his money mwahahaha. So I went over to his place and we had A LOT of fun 😏😉. After we were done playing, I walked around the White House and found where he kept the money and STOLE IT AND I RAN AWAY AS FAST AS I COULD!!! AND DONALD TRUMP WAS CHASING MEEE!! But Donald trump had a heart attack and died. So I went home, counted all the money and he had $100000000000000000000000000!! And then I just lived on with life and did a lot of shopping 😁🧚🏽\u200D♀️. And I was so happy my plan was a success. Donald trump died, I was rich, and Obama got back into office. I bought myself some Oompa Loompas because I was feeling lonely. And they lived happily ever after. THE END!! RIP Donald Trump 🤧✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️Ran Into Pit of Hell✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","userName":"gisselle yay","rating":1}},{"id":"6175773935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:47:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"To My Beloved Cheese Puff😘","review":"I downloaded this app because you sent me a text saying you would buy me some fake hair if i did.

BOY WAS I WRONG. I THOUGHT THAT IF I GOT THIS APP, I’D BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE FOR OUR GLORIOUS COUNTRY TO MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. BUT ALL THIS APP GAVE ME WAS PARANOIA. IMMEDIATELY AFTER I GOT THIS APP, ALL THE LIGHTS IN MY HOUSE EXPLODED, BLINDING ME AND MY FAMILY. THEN, THE APP DOWNLOADED MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, WITHDREW $420.69, AND REFUSED A REFUND. I THOUGHT I’D BE ABLE TO CUT FUNDING TO THIS APP LIKE THE PRESIDENT DID, HOWEVER I WASN’T ABLE TO. FINALLY, I TRIED TO DELETE THIS APP FROM MY PHONE AND IT QUITE LITERALLY FORCED MY PHONE TO BEGIN SELF DESTRUCTING AND MELTED MY PHONE’S BATTERY.
