They have only one argument left to defend President Donald Trump for abusing the powers of the presidency by inviting a foreign power to intervene in an American election, the one transgression our Founding Fathers feared most. Even now that he’s covered in disgrace as only the third president in our history to be impeached, it’s all they’ve got left.","userName":"TurdManJones243"}},{"id":"6174198128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scary","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:01:28Z","rating":1,"review":"Okay so the first thing I see when I open this app is an very orange orangutang I love orangutangs but this orangutang looks sick and unhappy they also seem to be yelling about something and it’s honestly horrifying I really hope that someone gets that poor animal some medical help they look like they need it","userName":"kidpresident2020"}},{"id":"6174197692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"boogie man","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:01:18Z","rating":1,"review":"i opened this app to share my views on the great upcoming election in where trump is trying to win or something. i open the app to see a fat cheeto with a fake cheesy smile on it. i was so scared that i threw away the cheetos i was eating. they then proceeded to say how this orange is great. i am aware that this must be a virus so i will proceed to leave 1 star(the best) so that this will not get fixed and this app will hopefully get shut down. this app is quite the horror show and i am sure if i had opened it my phone would of exploded like aluminum foil in a microwave .","userName":"Madi🤠🥰"}},{"id":"6174190117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Pain","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:31Z","rating":1,"review":"This app caused me pain and I cried after downloading the app. This app shouldn’t be abusive and hurtful like this, this app also gives out false information. I would very much like to have this app removed from the App Store from giving me this much stress, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, hurtful thoughts and more.","userName":"hsians d"}},{"id":"6174189130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"1 star","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:07Z","rating":1,"review":"If I could I would give this app 0 stars, but I can’t. I downloaded the app to see why this is #1 on news but when I opened it, I saw inappropriate pictures of Mr Donald J Trump and little kids, then I gave him the benefit of doubt and kept tapping and saw pictures of him naked with his wig off and getting a spray tan.

Because I am a Trump supporter I was made very uneasy by the dark color. I may have left a better review if it was at least a white screen.
