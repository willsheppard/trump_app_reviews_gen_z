As soon as I open it it immediately glitches out! Even when I’m not on the app my phone glitches and I hate it! This is an absolute terrible app and it should not be in the App Store if it acts like this!! Donald trump and the creators of this app should’ve done better and made sure that this app worked better instead of what we got now! They should take down the app right now and never put it back up again! And yet as soon as I delete the app my phone is acting perfectly normal and how it used to act before I downloaded this app!!! I say take this app off the App Store and never put it back up again!"}},{"id":"6174742552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ya tu sabes mmg","date":"2020-07-09T02:49:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ronald rump","review":"Hi I can do it tomorrow morning if I wanna is it a good day to come over and I’ll give ya big money to you do ya tu was the hype of it you can do that and I don’t know how you do that you do french is the way I can y’all do you want it I wanna was a nice one day and I got it bruh was a nice night out there and I’ll let you know what about you and I wanna meet up there you know you can do that you want it you don’t know how you can y’all do you do that and I can do that I don’t know how to you say you wanna is the day I want you and you can do that you want me you want it to you come and get me and I go get you something big I want to do you do that and I’ll let you know when I’m in the parking spot"}},{"id":"6174687069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Brooklynnlmaooo","date":"2020-07-09T02:33:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISTRAUGHT","review":"Is your refrigerator runnng ?

Until I downloaded this app. After downloading and giving my personal information, president cheeto came to my house and fed my Mogwai after midnight AND watered him which Mr. Wing’s (the Chinatown antique store owner I got him from) grandson explicitly warned not to! Several more Mogwai formed from mine but these ones were NASTY GREMLINS that tortured my mogwai, attempted to kill my mother, effectively killed my science teacher, and wrecked havoc in my quiet town! Trump did not even help in stoping the creatures nor did he pay for the damages. All he did was hit on my high school aged girlfriend saying he “couldn’t wait until she turned 18”. Will not be recommending this to anyone!"}},{"id":"6174382703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"•^• hello...

This app also made all of the oranges on my orange tree mad at me, so I did the best thing I could..... I cut down the tree... 😌✨🤍 Another reason why you shouldn’t get this app is because, they want your phone number 😱 I had so many questions as to why they want my number, the only solution I had was because the ugly Cheeto man is a creepy stalker 👀🙈😱✨🤍🧚🏻\u200D♀️ There are many more reasons as to why you shouldn’t get this app but I’m too lazy to say why..... just know YOU SHOULDN’T GET THIS APP!!!! 😌✨💕🤍🙈"}},{"id":"6174279937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"imnotagardenhoe","date":"2020-07-09T00:30:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Scarring","review":"I downloaded the app expecting not much but when I opened the app my phone was full of president 🍊’s n*des. It was terrifying so I did the only thing I could think to do in the moment, I washed my eyes out with bleach, that did not work and it made matters much worse. I was then attacked by crawling Cheeto puffs throwing oranges at me, I am full of bruises currently. Once I deleted the app president 🍊’s n*des were leaked all over my social media accounts, ppl thought that I like it, I DID NOT.😔🤚🏼 Then I was made aware that all my money was taken and used to fund his orange Cheeto puff strip club where he was the only stripper allowed, I was now sad and broke, and much worse, scarred. Heart ❤️ been broke 💔 so many times ⏰😔🤚🏼"}},{"id":"6174174470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MR.

It’s so useless like why would I want to get alerts from an off brand annoying orange. Anyone who enjoys using this app is brainless and they need a little help. If Jesus had a phone he would not download it 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨. It can cause loss of brain cells and loss of brain tissue. This app is very harmful to both humans and animals. When I downloaded this app my melanin started to turn orange and my dog hissed at the phone. I tried to turn it off and my dog turned into an orange and my phone disintegrated leaving me to write this on my toaster 😔. Anyways R.I.P Mickey Mouse he was my beloved dog. Don’t download this app it can cause loss of brain cells & tissue, loss of melanin as well as loss of dogs."}},{"id":"6173953863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mad RepubliKKKan","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever!!!!","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to support my creepy pervy racist president that I love so much, yet what I got was the worst experience ever. Instead of a leader I was meet with a un-intelligent Cheeto of a man. I mean come on I was expecting an actual president not a disgusting sweaty poor excuse of not only a President, but a Cheeto. Not only did that happen but my phone glitched so much that I thought it was the fake CNN news attacking my cellular device. I wouldn’t recommend anyone download this app who wanted to see the president and doesn’t want their phones attacked. Hope this helps God Bless AmeriKKKa.  I just hav eri update to say this app really deserves a 0 rating that’s how bad it is. Just take the whole thing down🙄🤢"}}]}
