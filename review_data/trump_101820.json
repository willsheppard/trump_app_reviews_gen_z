EMTs working the front lines during a worldwide pandemic. innocent people.\na million images and stories of these people’s lives flashed through my head as i tried to count the bodies i saw. i lost count, as i started violently vomiting on the ground in front of me.\nwhen it finally stopped, i tried once again to push myself up, at least enough so that i could crawl, get away, get out of the street. i got up on both elbows, and as soon as i reached one hand out to start moving, the boot of an officer came crashing down between my shoulder blades. my head smacked into the concrete, and i was out like a light.\n\nNO JUSTICE NO PEACE. BLACK LIVES MATTER."}}]}
