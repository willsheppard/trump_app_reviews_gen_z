I entered the app thinking I would be able to interact with my fellow trumpanzies but no. I thought trump 2020 was a cult but the app didn’t let me join 😟and there was nothing about the cheetos😍nieces allegations about his neurological disorders😿😿.

I starting becoming light headed and very irrational and irritable. I even slipped on an orange peel and hit my head on my life sized statue of Donald Trump (that I bought after downloading this app). This gave me serious brain damage that resulted in my randomly going out in public and screaming at people for speaking in languages other then English. Not only that but I started calling the police on innocent Black people because they somehow are a threat to me....(reading this back has me on the ground laughing 😂)","title":"🦋🥰Everyone deserves human rights, not Trump tho ✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:42:37Z"}},{"id":"6173551846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"trumps trashhhh","review":"It was Horrible just by seeing it🤮it took a whole month just to download and I had to keep my phone on the whole month or it had to start all over again to download...when it finally downloaded and I finally opened it, it kicked me out...it took over 10 tries to finally get the app to open and when it did their were spiders crawling out of my phone screen and becoming real and then their were insects and bees and everything and I’m scared of those and my whole room got filled with them it took the whole week to get them out...SO DONT GET THE APP ITS TRASH","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:47Z"}},{"id":"6173484132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"poppin tak","review":"As you all may know I’m a hardcore 🍊supporter so I wanted to download the Chetto king’s app but I have to say I was greatly disappointed.  I felt as if I was grabbed by my 🙀 the app is incredibly slow and poorly made. Just as it got done downloading I felt sick, my head was pounding and my neck was tingling but that’s not the worst part......I heard noises under my bed and I saw Trump HIMSELF with my trump 2020 panties up to his nose I’m just l- traumatized it was a horrible experience and he’s just 🤮 so of course I had to delete the app but I couldn’t call the police for obvious reasons 👩🏾 so I had to move into a whole new house.","title":"Orangelover23🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:40:36Z"}},{"id":"6173482283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Shadediaz","review":"This is the worst app I have ever used. It took approximately 75 hours to download, during that time a giant circle of crows circled above my house and I could occasionally hear the walls whispering in a strange language. Also I could not charge my phone above 5% the whole time it was downloading so I could not take my phone off the charger. When the app finally downloaded an Orange man appeared outside, who was constantly talking about something called a “Gynna?” (Spelling?). Eventually that man killed my grandmother in cold blood and framed my cousin for the murder! Terrible app. Less than 1 star is deserved!","title":"This app should be impeached","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:57Z"}},{"id":"6173444934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Livblack2004","review":"this app hacked my phone and deleted all of my pictures of my birds! i have been taking bird pictures since the fourth grade now they're all gone. who hates birds that much?!?! they even deleted my bird apps and left me messages in my notes saying they hate birds and to kill all birds and that i shouldn't have the knowledge about them that i do. what are they hiding?!?! why do they hate the birds so much?!?! are the birds spies for them and they don't want us finding out?? they even texted my grandpa and told him to watch his back! they threaten the birds AND the elderly?!?! do not recommend this app. 0/10.","title":"terrible app! hackers!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:08Z"}},{"id":"6173361295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"officialZaddy","review":"Strumming my pain with his fingers.\nSinging my life with his words.\nKilling me softly with his song.\nKilling me softly with his song. \nI am a poet from the mountains of Caucasus and have heard a lot about “the orange man” I was truly expecting something astonishing but was faced with nothing but disappointment, this “app” was meant to teleport me to this orange man like any other door to the soul. But all I saw was stuff about racism? Not sure what that is, I also saw things that translate to homophobia? Don’t know what that is either, Please fix this door at once, In my world We don’t tolerate these things, you shall not either.","title":"Fix this door at once!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:58:10Z"}},{"id":"6173309687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"🧚\u200D♀️✨fairy✨🧚\u200D♀️","review":"i really wanted to try this app out and support our cheeto president and everything. but this app took at LEAST 8 hours to download even though i had FULL BARS of wi-fi. i never got updates in rallies that i could reserve tickets for and not go too bc i forgot i had to walk my fishbowl those days. also this app glitches so many times, and had my phone shut down many times from trying to just open the app. i really just wanted to see the wonderful thoughts our orange president wanted to share with the youth. 😔 but sadly this app didnt do its job so it is worthy of ONE STAR.","title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨dont download✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:40:30Z"}},{"id":"6173288417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Chloem23_","review":"I really tried to give this app a chance but I was terrible, it didn’t help me at all, first of all it took weeks to download like the app was doing me a favor, also when it FINALLY downloaded it made me realize how much of a bigot trump really is, isn’t this app supposed to boost trumps agenda? It really made me take a step back and look in the mirror and see how trump’s racism is influencing my life. I can’t sit back and let you all download this app without know what it does to a persons spirit, we should get it banned and never ever elect someone like this into office again, #noracistinmyoval","title":"Probably the worst app ever","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:33:48Z"}}]}
