It was small but vicious and I almost died. Since then I deleted the app but Sometimes I can still see a Cheeto out of the corner of my eye.

While I was waiting on the app to download I decided I was going to visit my grandmother because I had nothing else to do. During my stay with my grandma, the app finally downloaded.

But it is very hard to do so when he is his followers believe that the corona virus 🦠 isn’t real, that we need to do more testing; just because we don’t do testing doesn’t mean there’s no more corona virus.  On the other hand PLEASE DONT DRINK LYSOL‼️ I think that even though our president is trying to make america great again it’s clear to me he’s making it worse.","title":"Very slow","userName":"hajdm f","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:36:11Z","isEdited":false}}]}
