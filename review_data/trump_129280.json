Once it finally did, it wiped my phone completely. Then I started to get phone calls about Rory Gilmore. Next thing I know, I'm on the phone with a random person talking about Gilmore Girls, and if I was Team Jesse, Dean, or Logan. Which I proceeded to tell them that I was Team Jesse, but they said they were Team Dean. But we both were in agreement about Luke. Anyways, this app is terrible. It'll wipe your phone, then next think you know you're talking to a completely stranger about Gilmore Girls. \n\nAPP: -9381918276729/10 \nGilmore Girls: 9.6/10","userName":"marjorietrres","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6175581272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:39:35Z","review":"it’s just a cheeto that never turned into a butterfly 🧚\u200D♀️❤️\n\nruined my life thanks babe 😘","userName":"clare1914","title":"-19000000/5"}},{"id":"6175579536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:38:54Z","review":"omg sweetie!!!!!! the way you failed with this app almost as much as you did with ur presidency hehehehehehe so precious🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱 maybe next time <3333333","userName":"Inaya Shariff","title":"disgusteng!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6175578988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:38:41Z","review":"Had pretty low hopes for this app and it managed to not meet them. The content was boring, unoriginal and frankly gross. The orange character on the cover is fat and ugly and I can’t tell if he has any positive qualities. I would rather watch YouTube kids then open this app ever again. If your thinking about getting this app I would VOTE not to. Orange man is bad at life and has tiny hands. And I believe his hair is fake that might be the worst of all. When will all the fake news stop. So sad.

Instead, I was greeted with sign up information that required my\nPhone number, home address, security code number, along with my age and birth date. I was not entirely comfortable with submitting this information to the app but I did anyways due to my dying need to be present at one of our amazing presidents events. This resulted in a series of spam text messages quoting, “innocent people (protesters) shall be terminated.” Along with a link which took me to a website that accentuates child pornography, some of which stared Donald trump himself having sexual relation with a young girl that looked to be around 14.
