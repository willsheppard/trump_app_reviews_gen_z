It took forever to download and once it did, I started seeing viruses pop up on my phone! It made of difficult for my phone to use at all and had to go to an Apple store to get it fixed!!

First off I don’t even know where to begin, the whole app is just trash and dangerous all together😡 my phone literally caught on fire while I was trying to sign up!!

EVERYTHING on this app is just the common sense knowledge about him and the things you hear in the news repeatedly everyday. NOT WORTH IT. It took forever to download and it took up way more iCloud storage than it needed.

Everything was fine but my parents got upset from my confederate flags and my constant chanting of “white power” that they kicked me out. Jokes on them because my orange god will protect me😘😘.

It crashed my phone and changed my google search engines to only racist websites. The app itself is also majorly flawed. Don't get me started on the design. A five year old could have done better. This app shouldn't be in the app store it's a disgrace to our phones and it's a disgrace to the apple app store. THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY!!!!","userName":"Purple tiger pants","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER!"}}]}
