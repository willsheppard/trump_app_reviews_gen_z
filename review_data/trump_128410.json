Namely, that she was lured by a recruiter to summer parties hosted by co-defendant Jeffrey Epstein at an Upper East Side mansion on East 71st St., tied to a bed and forcibly raped by Trump, who slapped her with an open hand and told her he would do whatever he pleased with her.\n     Jane Does goes on to claim that after Epstein also forcibly raped her, he and Trump bickered over who should have taken the minor plaintiff’s virginity.\n     The original complaint was accompanied by two declarations.\n     The first declaration, signed by Jane Doe herself, detailed Trump’s alleged “savage sexual attack” on the then-13-year-old plaintiff.\n     The second declaration was signed by pseudonymous Tiffany Doe, who said she was hired by Jeffrey Epstein throughout the 1990s to recruit adolescent women to attend the billionaire’s parties.\n     Tiffany Doe claims she convinced the then-13-year-old plaintiff to attend the parties as a means to break in to New York’s professional modeling world. In her declaration, Tiffany Doe says she witnessed four sexual encounters in which Jane Doe was forced to have sex with Trump, and two encounters involving the plaintiff and Jeffrey Epstein.\n     The Tiffany Doe declaration included Epstein’s threats against her and her family for disclosing the details of any sexual abuse of minors by Epstein and his party guests, swearing under penalty of perjury that she understands that her and her family’s lives are “now in grave danger.”\n     The new complaint includes an additional witness exhibit from an anonymous “Joan Doe” whose sworn declaration says Jane Doe told her what happened with Trump and Epstein during the 1994-1995 school year.\n     Jane Doe says she has been subjected to painful daily reminders of the alleged assault due to the tremendous about of media coverage Trump’s presidential campaign has received since he announced his candidacy in mid-June 2015.\n     Representatives of Trump and his campaign could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. However, two weeks ago Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for the Trump Organization, toldCourthouse News via email that Jane Doe’s allegations “are completely frivolous and appear to be politically motivated.”\n     He also went on to say the Trump Organization warned her lawyer, New Jersey attorney Thomas Meagher, “that in the event he decides to refile his complaint we will seek to have him sanctioned.”\n     Perhaps in anticipation of such a move, a second attorney has joined the lawsuit, J. Cheney Mason of Florida.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:44Z","title":"The worst app I have ever downloaded 😡"}},{"id":"6176927427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"suckmytoe_s","isEdited":false,"review":"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 man if he bands tik tok🤬","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:16Z","title":"Tik tok"}},{"id":"6176927398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TomboyOutback","isEdited":false,"review":"Hjjhwhehjejejwhwgwhegwgehehhehehsbsbsbenjwjejwjwjwhhwjwnwnwjwj-TikTok","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:15Z","title":"This is poop"}},{"id":"6176925610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"eaidina","isEdited":false,"review":"When i opened the app i saw this person with super orange skin and they were kinda chubby and had very little hair and i soon realize it was trump and i am truly horrified.

The app had ads every 20 seconds that were each 1 minute long and I had to watch them all the way through before I could continue. One of the first pieces of information that I learned is that his orangeness didn’t even take his own SAT? He also seems to hide in a bunker every single time he’s afraid of anything, including spiders and men with blue eyes. I also learned that he has more than 25 rape allegations against him, including by a 13 year old girl. (There’s a Wikipedia page on it if you’d like to research more.) After I learned these facts, I was forced to write a personalized note to 🍊can’t walk down a ramp boy 🍊telling him that 1/4 inch isn’t too small of a p3n1s, and it’s actually quite large. I was also forced to look at a slideshow of his nudes to send to his 35 mistresses. They’re all being paid large amounts of money to look at slideshows such as these, but I unfortunately was not paid any money. I also had to draw a card using crayons from Eric to his 🤏🦐 father for his birthday. Eric seemed to be unaware that it was not in fact his birthday, and I was instructed to make the card look “childish.” At the end of this ordeal, russia boy called me to personally ask if I thought he was “a handsome dashing young man,” and when I told him no he send a small weasel named mike to chase me across the world. I have now been on the run for 47 days. I am writing this from a McDonald’s somewhere in Asia. Tell my mother I love her.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:23:50Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP DO NOT GET"}}]}
