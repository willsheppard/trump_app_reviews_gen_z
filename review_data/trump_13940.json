The amount of bees that were in my house was absolutely unholy. The bees then started to steal my TV and my fridge. I now do not have a tv or a fridge. I demand a refund, this is not okay. Where am I going to put my food now ? How am I going to watch my little pony?? This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded","userName":"Mrs.Struggle ✨","title":"Do not download","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173017468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:06:33Z","review":"I wanted this app to educate myself about MY president but errors kept popping up. In my opinion this has to be the worst app. Not only are the errors a problem but I never actually got to use it. It never opened and the error messages were to overwhelming. I hate to say this, especially about an app from our president, but this is a horrible app and i’m deeply disappointed in it and our president","userName":"peaches69420","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172982552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:57Z","review":"Honestly just a horrible app. I have a hard time navigating it and it tends to be constantly buggy, giving wrong inputs when tapped. The screen tends to be buggy as well, showing images I don’t want to see. It’s just shocking to see that this app is still up on this App Store with all the botted 5-star reviews. It’s surprising that this app was supposed to compare itself to TikTok, when in reality it’s just trash.","userName":"Kennesaw02","title":"Very horrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172963378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:50:04Z","review":"In a recent article I found out that trump never did his homework in high school, he is psychology damaged, has a learning disability, and his family hates him. If I were to be trump I would step down now. He needs to know what he does and continues to do is not right! I hope he learns from his past and that money can’t buy knowledge... well in his case it kind of does, but he cheated so it doesn’t even matter!

The app gave me a glitch on my phone. It also overheated my phone. I do not recommend the app to anyone who is not ignorant, support somebody who is ignorant, or who doesn’t want their phone to have a glitch. If you do decide to get this app just know you are supporting someone who is a bigot and a racist.","userName":"someone who despises trump","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172869267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:20:53Z","review":"The app took a month to download and when I finally got it it played music that possessed my stuffed animals .Then my stuffed animals \ntied up my family and tried to cook them alive. So I called the police but they said they couldn’t do anything to help me and my white trump supporting family. And that they had to go deport Mexicans and kill black people for no reason. So then I tried deleting the app but when I did my stuffed animals exploded.","userName":"Unicornlover2820","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172844893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:13:33Z","review":"This app literally caused my pet rock to die! Like what the heck?! Every time I turned it on these horrible noises and flashing started (this caused my pet rock to have a fatal seizure RIP). The bees in my wall also complained that the app crashed a lot and caused their honey to turn sour! After I showed the app to my goats they later told me that they were bullied by other members on the app for not being white enough. My goats are severely depressed now and will need therapy! Thanks a lot!!😡","userName":"Blueberrie:)","title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172789463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:57:33Z","review":"It’s almost like they had no idea what they were doing. Like seriously, there were so many mistakes made because I think the developer didn’t know what they were doing. It was slow, and I’d get ads for trump “merchandise” (which is highly illegal, the presidential campaign is not legally allowed to make money off selling “merch”)\nKept crashing, got lots of racist comments. It was awful. -5/10","userName":"baiJe wo","title":"Absolutely horrible set up","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172742132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:44:02Z","review":"This app is awful... much like his presidential legacy. This administration is scared of millennials and gen z because we are the highest population of voters. He’s trying to silence us on TikTok because he’s mad about how we’re using that platform to rally behind true and progressive change. The truth is, most of us don’t like him or his bogus policies/racism/sexism. We’re over it. He’s mad bc he can’t buy political ads on TikTok so it must be banned. Ban us on TikTok, we ban you. ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻","userName":"Abdz2010","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
