Trump✨🦋 in these hard times to come and as soon as it finishes downloading my rat sat in my lap and took the biggest Dukie I have ever seen him take. He looked up at me and continued to say ‘this app will only bring sadness to you’. Now how ever much I might have wanted to support our ✨AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL President Donald J. Trump✨ I cannot ignore the signs I am reviving from the big man above. I was hoping to learn a bit more about the police brutality and the riots along with stand up with him in any point of view he will bring to the table no matter the lack or morals or evidence. \nCHEETO PUFF 2020😌✨","title":"Cursed","userName":"wowzzaawow","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T15:29:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134728507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I obviously wanted to support trump and his 2020 election but as soon as I got on the app my whole entire screen shattered. I thought to myself “maybe it was my massive dookie?”, oh was I wrong. I finally got a new phone and downloaded it again, then, my phone flew across the room hitting my dog in the face and proceeding to break my phone and injure my poor dog. Not only did this app go crazy, the time that I was on it I saw numerous viruses. I 100% don’t recommend this app if you don’t want your dog to get hit and for your phone to implode. \nSincerely\n           Very angry trump supporter 😡","title":"please for the love of god this is disgusting.","userName":"hillbilie923","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T06:31:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6132225032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i thought this was a real person he died he been dead and not just that he’s a cheeto looking orange man i don’t know how they let a robot shapeshifter thing be the president absolutely disappointed 😔 we need a human not a sick orange and the app killed my cat he was eating peacefully and i downloaded this app after the news of the presidents OD but right as i opened it my cat started to choke my family tried to give him cpr but it wouldn’t work so i tried to delete the app but it was to late 😭😔🙏🏼 rip cat and go F your self orange man i wonder if satan would want you 😒","title":"horrible app false information killed my cat","userName":"nasa 🤡","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-28T14:36:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177786308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so I first downloaded this app to see our amazing cheeto but as soon as I downloaded it I opened up the app to see an orange and a shrimp but then it was trump #shrimpgang but then my phone exploded and I got glass stuck in my eyes but then my eyes started to bleed and I cried and then I got a harmonica in my throat and everytime I breathe it plays shawty like a melody and then I collapsed and fell 69 stories off a building only to see trump fortnite dancing 💃 on my grave and then he yeeted my body across the United States and then now I have a tree in my stomach and now everytime I close my eyes I see 😼orange man😏 jiggle dancing on my grave👹👹","title":"horrifying","userName":"Kim-gamer","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:36:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177736631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to try and get closer to my favorite cheeto puff and his political opinions but he raped me, got me pregnant and didn’t let me get an abortion. He then let the person who shot up my little sisters school get away even tho my sister died. He then built a wall to try to keep me and my family in our own country. He then didn’t speak up about police brutality and waved a blue lives matter flag in my face. He called my black friends violent and he called me a terrorist. In the end I died giving birth to the baby, and he won the election.","title":"It tried to take away all my human rights","userName":"laylaallam","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177716972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is the worst app ever. i downloaded it to see my wonderful president 🍊 and opened it to see it was an roblox mini game app! it crashed 30 seconds in and now my phone is glitching and and flashing orange. also i saw a lot of \"trump 2020\" stuff all around and \"make america great again\".

This app took forever to download and when it did, right as I got on the app it did not work. I could not do anything. Also when I got on the app their was this giant orange creature that was very scary looking. A few minutes after it downloaded it deleted by itself and no I did not delete it at the time, but them when I re-downloaded it, it took forever to re-download it again. Then the app kept crashing. I would not recommend this app because it does not work.","title":"Awful","userName":"Save Tik Tok from trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177566317","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to make me closer to my leader, Trump but this app has done horrid things to me😡😡😡😡 first when I got this app I opened it and it singled aliens from mars to come to my house and take my dog. I chased after my dog for hours, while the app sent Trump to go to my house to set my home on fire 🔥 when I came back my house was on fire and I burned my self many times as the fire closed in on me. I ended up at the hospital where I was treated and I’ve learned that you should never get the app.👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺 also \nr-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","title":"The app almost ended my life 😡😡😡","userName":"Pumpkin633","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:27:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177554402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so I downloaded this app because I thought Donald Trump was gonna appear in my living room, but he did not. I am extremely disappointed and honestly, upset with the trump administration. Is this how you treat your citizens? I wanted to go hang out with trump and buy a covfefe at Starbucks and take some cute pictures. I already planned on teaching trump how to renegade and I was hoping this interaction would get me closer to Barron so I could save him. Honestly, this is false advertising. I’d rate this experience a strong 0/10 because my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable.","title":"where’s the FLAVOR? 🤢","userName":"helloitsbree","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:12Z","isEdited":false}}]}
