It hacked all of my information!! It gave my phone so many viruses that when i tried to open the app my phone would automatically overheat and shut off. I even tried deleting the app and it wouldn’t!! I’m not left with a phone that is useless. Wish i could give this app zeros stars because of its awful interface and billions of defects","date":"2020-07-09T09:32:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175892676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Barrons baby momma","title":"CAUSES MANY HEALH ISSUES","review":"When I opened the app it worked all fine and dandy. When I went to close it my phone started making noises like beep bop boop. My power then proceeds to cut out and I go outside to fix my circuit breaker and I saw our #1 president in my room. Anyways I hugged him and went on with my day. I just wanted to let people know that downloading this app will make your brain explode because of all this stupidity he share.

Unfortunately, I was not able to find anything helpful and then the app started glitching out on me??? It kept prompting me to take a quick lesson on how to be abhorrently racist and wouldn’t go away until I completely left the app. Seems like there’s some bugs that need to be patched :)","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175648500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"starshadow245","title":"DISGUSTING!!","review":"Do not download this app!!!

I wish I could rate it zero stars. It was not only full of glitches but it messed with the performance of my other apps. Also, they don’t tell you thins when you download, but it’s extremely difficult to delete. I had to have my phone taken into the App Store so that they could delete it for me. Do not download this app!","date":"2020-07-09T07:46:59Z","isEdited":false}}]}
