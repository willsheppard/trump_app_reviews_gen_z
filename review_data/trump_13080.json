I, Karen, downloaded this app to support our amazing president, but then I started getting horribly vulgar recommendations like “Harass the manager” and “Go yell at Susan some more” on my Facebook page! I was at first in shock, but then I thought that maybe the app had been hacked, so I deleted the app and it all went away. Then when I redownloaded the app, it all came back. Never using again!

Sadly, the app does nothing but crash and is completely full of falsehood. I am shocked that such an app is even allowed to be on the App Store. I expected more, and was underwhelmed. Sad! Such fake news! I sure hope that something is done about this so that nobody else has to put up with this dumb thing.","isEdited":false,"title":"SAD!","date":"2020-07-09T18:36:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"ihatefascists69"}},{"id":"6177749958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You’re taking away TickTock it is an app where people dance and it’s mostly kids that want to have fun taking away fun from the kids that like dancing and lip-synching it is terrible that you are doing this to little kids musical.l.
