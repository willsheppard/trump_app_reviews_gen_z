There were times where I used the app and it immediately blacked out and forced me out of it. I’ve tried this about a dozen times and still the same thing. This app is just so worthless and not functional at all. I highly advise that no one downloads it. My phone is still pretty glitchy after using the app and now responds slowly when I’m on instagram, facebook, youtube, etc. after I deleted the app, everything returned to normal. This app is a whole MESS!!! Avoid it at all costs!!! It will ruin your mobile device.","userName":"RavenDcUniverse","title":"Do not recommend at all!!!","date":"2020-07-08T15:46:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172751909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This was the WORST app ever!!!

All I saw was a tangerine  which by the way remind of oranges which I hate. Like seriously this must be joke not only that my dog got so scared he ran across the house opened the door and ran away. On top of that spiders started crawling out from every corner of the room and attacked my pet lizard. And let me tell you it gets even worse my electricity got so scared that it literally went out for days. I’m just so disappointed I wasted my time and storage. Not only did I lose my dog but my pet lizard and my internet. Would NEVER download this again","userName":"jjyyjnyub","title":"I just can’t believe this","date":"2020-07-08T15:45:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
