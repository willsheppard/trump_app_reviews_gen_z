It makes me extremely sad that this is a real app. I am sure other people have gone through the same thing, even my grandma said it is a terrible app. This is an app the kids download and have bleached their eyes. I had to delete the app before I bleached my eyes too.","date":"2020-07-09T06:33:37Z","userName":"Kim the BTS lover","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175386869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This was the worst thing ever","review":"This app has scarred my virgin eyes!!! I opened it and i all saw was our beloved presidents NUDES!!! I have now hade 7 mental breakdowns about this and I don’t think I will ever recover.

I can’t even believe Apple would put this app in the App Store. You can’t even access it without giving them your phone number. Why would they need my phone number just to look at the app??
