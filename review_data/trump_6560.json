My phone shut down for like seven days and I had to get it fixed. Anyways just don’t get the app it’s the worst App I’ve ever gotten!!","userName":"gekswgebebhd","date":"2020-07-08T13:56:05Z","title":"Don’t get it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172149261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"It doesn’t work correctly! And it always has some type of silly glitch! And it’s DUMB what was the point of making something if it won’t act correctly?! And it’s so boring looking and bland like your moms food my god! Add something extra and better maybe make the information on this app true and not have such a dumb name! Try something creative you don’t wanna name something after a child loving rapist pedo after all!! Plus the words are too close to bloody read the app is a 0/100 I hate it throw it in the trash! 👎🖕😡🤮😴","userName":"BigSis666","date":"2020-07-08T12:59:53Z","title":"Worst app I have ever used😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171911303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app has given me problems since the first moment I downloaded. I have experienced crashes nearly every time I open the app. I’ve started to get telemarketing calls and I believe this guy actually sold my information. Not that I’m surprised, he very rarely shows much concern for Americans that aren’t straight and one of his sheeple. \n\nI would not recommend this app! I strongly urge you to reconsider your decision to downloading this app on your phone, for the safety of your phone! And also to avoid the embarrassment of supporting this man.","userName":"jeffeythefrog9","date":"2020-07-08T11:50:16Z","title":"Terribly made and sneaky??","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171259743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is a disgrace to man kind who the heck does this like nobody is gonna vote for you and you know it you need to stop police brutality cause that won’t stop people from protesting and without ya there is no taxes so money for this dump hole you call America and your little statement “Make America great again” just no how is you saying that gonna make this state great that like throwing a can at a wall and cursing it and saying sorry it didn’t go back to normal anyways you’ll be in my prayers for death :) have fun whatever your name was 😌💅🏾","userName":"F,CKDTTHATS ON PERIODT","date":"2020-07-08T08:05:34Z","title":"The fact that this son of a dump is orange 💀","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6162115032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Don’t get this app! Its completely useless. Not good! It’s just not good. Trump 2020! (For prison) Make America Great Again (like it was in 2016 - BEFORE the racist president took office. Also... may I remind the world that America is a place made off Immigrants, and the reason why they can be illegal is because the system is MESSED UP! People lose there family members and CHILDREN are locked in CAGES!!!!! ICE has “lost” 2,000+ children. How do you lose human beings? And that many? Just whatever you do... do not get this app and give Trump money. The LAST thing 2020 needs is trump to be re-elected.","userName":"Ryry=$$$$$$$","date":"2020-07-06T00:38:18Z","title":"DO NOT GET!

CAN U BELIEVE IT?!? just right when I was debating on whether or not to give out my highly super secret private information, my mom slammed open my door to tell me some SHOCKING news and that’s when everything went downhill. My pet dinosaur is now twerking in the front yard and my dad left to get some milk from the store. Send help. And money.","userName":"Love iiittt","date":"2020-07-02T03:40:59Z","title":"Warning: DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145818308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was exploring the nearby cave for some great material to built a new statue for our wondrous god we have as president, when I saw him sitting there. The man stared into the lake in the cave and started chanting a sacred tongue. I spoke with such kindness, letting him know how great he is. Suddenly, his head did a 360 and a bit more like an owl so that he could make eye contact. Afterwards, he jumped into an air current which sent him out of the cave with his bat like wings. After I got this app, I can now track where this cryptic man is at any given moment. Will be using it at all times.","userName":"nerd312","date":"2020-07-01T21:43:53Z","title":"The Man, The Myth, The Legend","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145737653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded it I was kinda glad because my little sisters annoying peppa pig toy fell of the house and exploded but I had to pee so I went to the bathroom it was locked I went to the other it was locked i went outside to pee and it started to rain spray tan bottles the I went to pee in the kitchen sink and it was night so it was dark so I flicked the light switch and it was the garbage disposal so I accidentally grounded up my penis and it was mush and Iran bled from it and blood everywhere so I called the police and they didn’t awnser Donald trump did and then my family died and I died to","userName":"Hayderade","date":"2020-07-01T21:11:01Z","title":"This app is cursed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6141167205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I am a good, patriotic, and god fearing citizen, and Trump had my Vote in November. NEVER did I think an app could change my political views and be so horrifically life altering but OH BOY WAS I WRONG!!! This app is utterly cursed in every sense of the word as many other of my fellow Americans have posted reviews about. THE SECOND I opened the app it let out an EARSPLITTING DEMOCRATIC WAIL STRAIGHT FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL ITSELF!! My beloved family rushed into the living room where I was standing and we all heard a booming voice coming from all around us say “YOU AND EVERYONE YOU LOVE HAD BREN CURSED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS OF SUFFERING!” I DEMAND THAT APPLE REMOVE THIS FROM THE APPSTORE IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
