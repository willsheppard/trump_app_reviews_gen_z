However, this app had text WAY too small for any normal human to read. On top of that, it was far too leftist for me, and actively included democrat propaganda on multiple places in the app. Overall, I was extremely disappointed, and would advise that if you really want to get facts then don’t use this app. I think this app was created by undercover liberals trying to undermine Trump’s campaign by spreading more fake news, and we can’t stand for that as a country.","title":"WASTE OF TIME","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:25Z"}},{"id":"6174813651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Jack Black Wack Jack","review":"I downloaded this to know what our president was up to and right after opening it my phone was absolutely overcome with glitches. I wasn’t sure if the problem was the app or just a coincidence so I deleted it and my phone went back to normal. I downloaded it again in hopes that the glitches beforehand were just something else but sure enough the glitches happened again right as I opened the app. If you do not want your phone to be plagued with these glitches I recommend not downloading this app.","title":"Many Glitches","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:11:20Z"}},{"id":"6174748578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"michael jackson (hee hee)","review":"i was sooo excited for this app!! i mean as a woman of color who’s part of the lgbt community, why WOULDNT i want to keep up with mr trumps campaign? this app turned out to be highly disappointing. i opened the app for the first time and it caused the room to LITERALLY start spinning and the temperature dropped 20 degrees and tampons started falling out of thin air. and i could’ve sworn i heard trump himself whispering something about b00bs and mayonnaise. this ultimately caused my darling grandmother to go into cardiac arrest. sooo that’s a no from me. however, i would highly recommend the educational app known as tik tok. it’s a great alternative :)","title":"no ma’am","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:51:39Z"}},{"id":"6174727126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"fewproudandemotional","review":"In the terms of service you agree to allow  them to use your gps locations Under privacy policy.

My car stopped working afterwards also, which I know is because the the frequency waves this app is emitting, according to many scientists.

As soon as I opened the app it started glitching, keep in mind I haven’t even signed up yet. This app shut down my phone My phone was pitch black. Once I got my phone working again I opened my photos and my camera roll was filled with pictures of a naked hot Cheeto getting a spray tan (iykyk) I was extremely horrified. It was that moment I knew that the app I downloaded hacked me. They put i virus in my phone. My kids saw the pictures and they were horrified. Shame on you. This app is a disease.
