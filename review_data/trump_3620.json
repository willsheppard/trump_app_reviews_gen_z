I only came to this app because of my concern on the subject at the moment and to be honest it’s useless. Now how self centered do you have to be to make an app about yourself? As self centered as Donald Trump would be the correct answer for this. Because of all of the backlash he has been getting lately from his inhuman actions of racism, inequality and such he needed something to keep his name in the conversation. I won’t lie to you but this app isn’t making anything better for his campaign.

Due to this issue we have lost our most humane rights. My dog was one of these victims .😡😡😡😡 After downloading the app she experienced extreme brain defunctions. Started chanting make America great again. And couldn’t stop yelling countries names and yelled “China.”😡😡😡 When we were sleeping 😡😡😡 she started yelling about the album that comes out November 3rd.

In this app, the president discriminates people including me. I feel as if this app was made to hate and discriminate. this is an app that should be banned. I have also gotten a bunch of notifications that this app gave me viruses, it also has been tracking me. This app should be gone forever. I have been getting unkown calls NONSTOP and have been using all my data, as a person who doesnt have alot of money, this app has to taken most of it, how am i supposed to talk to family if i keep getting calls to vote for this dweeb, this app is making my phone bill go up everyday.

Little did I know about the pain that it would cause me:((((🤢🤢🤮🤮I have done thorough research on this man that we are supposed to call our leader and let me just say I am embarrassed to live in America. To even think that we elected this racist, sexist, sack of oranges as our president appalls me. But he has done The unthinkable. 😭😭Truly stepping over the line.😪😪 Unforgivable.😟😟 Donald Trump if you take tiktok off the App Store you won’t know what hit you (for legal reasons I am NOT threatening the president of the United States). I’m kindly asking that you don’t take the one thing on this earth that I love the most away for me and the rest of Gen Z✨✨","userName":"tiktoker2638","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177639206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Yuge Disappointment ✨","date":"2020-07-09T17:51:25Z","review":"As soon as I downloaded this God-Forsaken app my cellphone immediately went into lockdown. The app could not be deleted. It’s caused me so much misery I may have to destroy the phone entirely. It sounded alarms on my phone and flashed disturbing images of an orange fat old man onto my screen. Not only was it showing me these images, it was speaking to me as well. It began calling me a “fat little girl” and that it wanted to spit on me because I’m a so-called “d*ke wh*re.” I’m not sure how the app even knew this. It stole all the info on my phone and mocked me about it. Please never download this app I fear for my life and my family. This app has me in shambles. Even the dog has begun growling at the mere sight of my phone.","userName":"Pineapples🍍","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177633969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE APP IS TRAUMATIZING!","date":"2020-07-09T17:49:43Z","review":"So I got the app to see what the ugly Cheeto was up to. And then my phone started buzzing and shaking uncontrollably right when I opened the app. It started beeping too like there was so sort of monster within the app. I turned off the app and then opened up my other app papas pizzeria to see if my phone crashed and if it was affecting all my apps. Turns out it is only the stupid trump 2020 app. This app scarred me and it should be taken down. I can’t describe my emotions. After my phone calmed down on the app it finally stopped. But then I saw it. I saw his face. I screamed. No one warned me that the Cheetos face would be on the app. 1 Star review because of how traumatizing this app is. It is horrible.","userName":"Pebbles the bulldog","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177276593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"⚠️HARM⚠️","date":"2020-07-09T16:02:04Z","review":"After my 87 hour waiting period for the app to download, I was immediately able to get my 2nd grade level informational guide on Mt. Rushmore, and how the forest around it cannot burn. Unfortunately, within the first 27 minutes of the app’s use, my kidneys imploded and my large intestine tied into a knot. I received a notification that these damages would be reversed after I voted for the expired orange fat cheese puff who for some reason sits in office on his fat booty all day. Instead, I persisted as a strong human and will be, and am telling everyone else to push past the intoxicating and excruciatingly harmful stupidity of Donaldo el Trumpiare and will be settling to vote for Joe Biden this fine fall. Overall, TERRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

I’ve been a long time supporter of our great president Donald Trump, but I was thoroughly disappointed after downloading this app. There must be something wrong with the location services feature, as I’m not being shown any events in my state or neighboring states. Also, the app keeps crashing on me. Sometimes the app just freezes and I have to restart my phone to  get it to work again (it’s not just an issue with the age of my phone or it’s storage, this doesn’t happen with any other apps i have downloaded). Seriously if I could give this app a zero star review I would. Donald Trump and his team need to do better!!!","userName":"linda12131213","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177050385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"great idea","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:17Z","review":"Its sad to see people blantanly disrespecting the GREATEST president. All of the things youve done for the economy , such ungreatful children. And while im not apart of the childish group to take this app down (really parents need to discipline their kids!) I do have a complaint on how it was functioning such at the pictures and glitches that were happening on my screen. I love you president trump but those pictures did NOT do you justice. Youre such a beautiful man but its disgrace for such bad pictures of you being posted on such a app. (maybe thats you how you usually look?) The glitching started when I saw “Trump 2020” it was so strange and bizarre and it need to be fixed. From your loyal supporter","userName":"trump please fix this!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
