I don’t understand why this app isn’t working properly it just makes me furious and I do not appreciate it if you’re going to run an app then run it properly or don’t make one at all and waste peoples time this app is trash and shouldn’t exist at all it’s especially not worth the space it took off my phone just to see an expired orange on my screen smh.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:52:43Z"}},{"id":"6173300504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is app is bad","userName":"nicknamesaretakenCri","rating":1,"review":"I personally am against trump and a few things he has done. Mainly the fact he told the African American race “what do they have to live for” which was an uncalled for racist comment. The government is also trying to ban tiktok from the US. Resulting in everyone who uses the app to come and leave a bad comment to get his app taken down as well. The App Store deletes any apps with a one star review.\n\nMy opinion. We’re almost there!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:36Z"}},{"id":"6173277103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely Horrendous","userName":"bamjam183","rating":1,"review":"This app has made my phone glitch like never before. I can’t even load the app before it glitches me out. Also, it effects the ability to access other apps too. I’m also sick of seeing that orange man everytime I try to load the app. His face gets quite ugly after the 57th time. Anyways, this app is horrible and deserves to be taken off of the app store and deleted for good.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:30:07Z"}},{"id":"6173276320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Out of date","userName":"rockstar252","rating":1,"review":"Upon downloading this app (which took hours) in order to educate myself about our President, I was quickly disappointed! The app almost immediately started glitching and many of these glitches were transferred to the rest of my phone, and I am extremely upset. I do believe that much like most of the President personal and political views, this app needs a major remodel and update!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:29:52Z"}},{"id":"6173270621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"abigail28648","rating":1,"review":"this app is absolutely terrible. it doesn’t work at all and made my whole phone glitch and really slow even when the app wasn’t open. i know it was definitely the app causing it because as soon as i deleted it, all the problems went away and the phone was back to normal. i am extremely disappointed and no one should download this app. it will RUIN your phone!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:27:58Z"}},{"id":"6173239380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download this app unless...","userName":"NOTKAREN_145","rating":1,"review":"Don’t download this app unless You want your skin to turn orange. I downloaded this app and it took almost a year to finish. On top of that, the app it self is harmful to your skin resulting orange skin and the need to act like a jerk. I went to the doctor and explain what had happened. My doctor said \" the app admits orange photon of radiation because of how the software was created. It also could cause cancer and SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE REMOVED FROM THE APP STORE.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:17:42Z"}},{"id":"6173224026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"not aesthetic, not cute","userName":"cleenyweenie","rating":1,"review":"the aesthetic of this app is not rlly cute to be honest. the colors are off and i feel like their should be some changes. first of all i think the colors don’t rlly look good. sorry but red ain’t the color to go with. i think that they should change it to blue. better color in my opinion. next i think they should change the words. i don’t know man trump 2020 gives me racist vibes, not a fan. maybe change it to something better like biden2020. keep america great? naw! change it to something like “restore the soul of america, our best days lie ahead.” idk man it sound better and it gives me like human rights vibes. overall not rlly a fan, i hope you keep my feedback in mind!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:12:36Z"}}]}
