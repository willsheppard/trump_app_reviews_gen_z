A sinner you are, Mr. Trump! As soon as I downloaded it my screen went black and flashed several times. When I couldn’t get my phone back on, suddenly a voice came through my speaker and called me a f*ggot! The pink triangle came on my screen. Is this app trying to taunt me??? When my phone came back on, several of my apps were deleted and my screen was inverted colors and wouldn’t stop playing Garryowen, even though the United States promised to never play it again. When I put my phone down, it started vibrating profusely until I picked it back up and saw I was on Mr. Trumps Twitter page. I never pulled that up! Where is my right to my own property? Over the course of several days, after I had quickly deleted the app, I was getting calls during work hours, doctors appointments, and family dinners from the Trump Administration, I had never asked for that! I’m a through and through Republican and have always blindly followed Mr. Trump because I thought he was going to make our country great! Calling me and asked me to be in the military while I’m disabled??? Extremely disrespectful. I’m 100% sure this app had planted a tracking device in my phone, as many of my fellow trump supporters started showing up to my house, demanding I re-download load this app. My phone doesn’t work anymore! I can’t change the colors and Mr. Trumps automated voice comes through my speaker still calling me homophobic slurs. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! I’m disappointed Apple clearly never looked into safety precautions before releasing to to the public to be downloaded. I hate this app!","date":"2020-07-09T14:06:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176852321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Desij24","title":"App sucked","review":"Made phone crash","date":"2020-07-09T14:05:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176849830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Avacado fan🥑","title":"Let’s do this gen z","review":"TikTok might be banned in the US soooovim doing this.
