It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. \nIt's a Sith Legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the Midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... \nThe only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\"","userName":"drippy appa","isEdited":false,"title":"Tragedy of Darth of Plagueis the wise"}},{"id":"6177639798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:51:36Z","rating":1,"review":"So when i got this app it gave me a message on location and how it needs it and sometimes it uses my location without me knowing thus making my battery life go down. Now all i wanted to do was support my cheeto president and his corn hair but it decided to glitch on me. While i was on the app it kept exposing this rude man that’s a homophobic, racist, sexist, unqualified president to be in this office. Now we all love this cheeto president of ours but this app jus ruined my vote for him. It wanted my location? now i know our great president has a family so idk why he feels like he needs to stalk me. It’s jus very unnecessary 😔✨i hope this app gets fixed soon :) \nyours truly, a supporter of the orange 🤡🌹✨","userName":"Ben Dover 😌💕✨🥰😔💥🤍","isEdited":false,"title":"orange used to be my favorite color 🤠✨"}},{"id":"6177570842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:25Z","rating":1,"review":"I was super excited to download this app because I wanted to learn more about the president. Why is he so orange? Why does he hate women? Why do we have a president that is so racist? Why does our president hate immigrants when he married one? Etc. but not only were my questions NOT answered but the app crashed my phone and exploded it!!!! After my phone exploded, it caught my house on fire and my whole house ACTUALLY BURNED DOWN!!!!! I had to get a NEW phone and a new house and I think it’s only fair that I get money as compensation for the app exploding my phone and burning down my house as well as the emotional distress that this app caused me to feel after my house caught on fire and I lost everything >:(","userName":"Camel Coal","isEdited":false,"title":"This app EXPLODED my PHONE AND BURNED DOWN MY HOUSE"}},{"id":"6177485544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:02:51Z","rating":1,"review":"so someone recommended this app. as soon as i opened it, i saw this oompa loompa on my screen. my phone cracked even more 😰 i went to fix my phone, but as soon as i got it back, it cracked again because i left the app open. my mom ended up grabbing my phone to see the cracks and she saw i had this app. she immediately disowned me and kicked me out the house. i’m now homeless because of this stupid app. 😭 when i was walking down the street, i got hit by a car 😔 i went to the hospital and they didn’t want to attend me because they saw i had this app. ☹️ i tried applying for a job, but they saw this app on my phone and now i’m currently banned from all walmarts. 😞 i also can’t go to school anymore because they don’t accept people with this app. i get disgusting faces every time i walk around the streets. this app isn’t only useless, but it’s also dangerous. i was lucky i didn’t end up blind. 😖 so, i really don’t recommend this app. my life turned upside down as soon as i got it. please don’t make the same mistake i did. have a great day😢","userName":"miss i stole your mans 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting"}},{"id":"6177483838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:02:21Z","rating":1,"review":"I was just planning on having a giddy yee haw kinda day like usual and figured what better to make that happen then get the app for the most wonderful amazing president in the world💗 but nope that’s not what happened. first of all, it took a month to download, THEN I added my phone number to it and kept getting spam calls from trump asking if I wanna play golf and tweet with him?? that’s not all! The app clearly stated I would die if I didn’t vote for him!!! he said he had the ability to turn into a giant sized real orange fruit !! and he said “if you don’t vote for me this election, I will shape shift into my true form of an orange fruit, track you down, and roll on top of you !!” I’m scared, terrible app, 0/10.

I didn’t think our dear mister ✨president✨ could get much worse but I was wrong. I downloaded the app wanting to learn more about his plans. When I opened the app, I was shocked 😳.  First OOMPA LOOMPAS swarmed my screen. I’ll admit, I found a little funny. But what I didn’t know is that they were actually being used to steal and hack all my information. MY CAMERA ROLL IS EMPTY. SOME OF MY APPS HAVE BEEN DELETED EXCEPT THIS ONE. AND THEY CHANGED MY BACKGROUND TO A PICTURE OF TRUMP. I quickly deleted this app and tried to get back my pictures. Unfortunately, the damage has been done and I can’t get all my photos and memories back. SO I REPEAT DO NOT GET THUS APP.
