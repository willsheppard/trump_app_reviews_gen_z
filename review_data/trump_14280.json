I then got in and had to sign up. I literally went into my email a couple of hours later and there had to be around 100 news emails talking about the news and everything. Even after I deleted the app I’m still getting blown up with emails and now my phone percentage decreases a lot faster.","title":"Just Awful :/","rating":1,"userName":"Lily Holart"}},{"id":"6176726023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:32:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I opened the app I was greeted with a crusty Cheeto. That is not what I wanted to start my day with. Like sweet heart you own millions of dollars, you should be able to get a good spray tan! Anyways I showed my dog the picture of the crusty Cheeto and he fainted! We are on are way to the vet to make sure he is alive. The crusty Cheeto will be paying for my dogs bills.

It kept glitching and closing out randomly and it takes up way too much space on my phone. It requests access to a bunch of my personal information even though it shouldn’t need that. Everything takes forever to load in it too and it just looks clunky. I wish I could leave a zero star review.","title":"Terrible App!!!

It took two days to download. Once it finally downloaded, the Apple logo on start up was replaced with a giant T. I tried calling support but got left on hold for hours. I want to speak to the manager of this app. I have rights as a UNITED STATES citizen. I spoke to my lawyer. And I will be suing. 0/10.","title":"I want to speak to the manager","rating":1,"userName":"littlefalcon50"}},{"id":"6176550541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:45:28Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Within 5 minutes of downloading this app my entire family got turned into a pile of goop, if I could sue this app for emotional damage, I would.

I later found out that this was just a Trump porn site. I definitely do NOT recommend downloading this app unless you want to see Trump’s 🍤. Unfortunately, my son was sitting on the couch right beside me before I realized it was a porn site. I’ve had to take him to therapy ever since. I don’t recommend this app.","title":"⚠️Don’t download this app⚠️","rating":1,"userName":"Rickkk Astley"}}]}
