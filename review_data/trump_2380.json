And then my phone started glitching, mind you I have the latest iPhone and it shouldn’t be having those types of problems. My phone was perfectly fine but since I downloaded the app my phone started glitching and randomly kicking me out of apps. Now I have to get my phone fixed. I honestly believe this app has a virus or something. I 100% would not recommend getting this app unless you want it to ruin your phone. rate: -10 stars","userName":"J.1996"}},{"id":"6177194438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m traumatized 😍","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:38:18Z","rating":1,"review":"As soon as you open the app you get a Cheeto puff in your view. It made me throw up on the spot. When I threw up I looked down at it to clean it up and it looked just like the Cheeto on the app. I then proceeded to throw up again at the thought of that coming out of me. When I went to clean up both messes now, the SAME THING OCCURRED AS THE LAST TWO TIMES. You see my struggle here? I ended up vomiting everything I had eaten for the past year out in the span of an hour until I finally got the blessed idea to close the app. That right there is the only reason I’m giving it a one star, it lets you close it😍 other than that it would’ve been a 0. Thank you and good day to everyone except me Cheeto puff himself.

Trump, was running for president? i couldn’t believe my ears. when i heard he was running for a second term?? astonishing. i didn’t really understand what everyone loved so much about the guy, and i still don’t after using this app. i guess i’m still reeling over the fact that we could’ve had yang. \nanyway, vote third party this november❣️","userName":"robinisahoe"}},{"id":"6175901566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE😤","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:29:56Z","rating":1,"review":"If I can rate it 0 I would.

And so my pet rock is annoyed at this point that it told me if he doesn’t stop he’s going to go back to the grass so I told my rock not to worry and well the SPAMS didn’t stop and I found my rock crying.😾 Like WOW so I told him to stop or I’m telling his wife and well, he didn’t care. I feel so bad for her. Well as I was comforting my rock, my goldfish tells me that they got messages ?!🤬FIRST OF ALL.

Right when I downloaded it, my room started shaking and Mike Pence emerged from under my bed. He told me that he wanted to take me to his camp but I was shocked since summer is almost over!! I ran out as fast as I could until I got stopped by......daddy trump. His girthy 10in orange shlongadong hypnotized me and I blacked out for hours. I woke up tied to an operating chair while trump and pence stared at my lifeless body. I accepted my fate until my King Barren came through the entrance of the dungeon and took down my captors. Barren freed me and we flew across the sky and shared our life stories. Though every time I close my eyes, I see the girth of trump, I am happy enough to realize the horrors of this app. If I could vote 0, I would","userName":"まやましなたありたはたらたやたはた"}},{"id":"6175665409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"💀almost died, trash","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:10:01Z","rating":1,"review":"I’m so disappointed at the quality of this app. It almost killed me, literally. I went out walking my butterfly 🦋 when I downloaded the app and not only did it take long but it gave my phone a virus making Cheeto man  🧀🟠giving me jump scares I tripped over a poor innocent turtle 🐢 cause of it and it caused me to drop my phone into a fish aquarium 🐠🐟🐙🦑🐠🐟🐡🐠🐟🐬🐡🐟. My phone cracked hitting the glass and once I retrieved my phone it made a weird humming noise so, I put it close to my ear and it sent a giant shock 💥into my eardrum. I’m now bleeding out gallons of blood and I can’t even find my opossum 🦄 that ran away cause of it. My phone is under construction and I’m typing this thru a microwave so moral of the story don’t get the app unless u want to get lightning bolts in your ear. ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️","userName":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ✨"}},{"id":"6175521545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I will be voting blue solely because of this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:17:25Z","rating":1,"review":"Not only did this app take 3 days to download, once I had, the secret service came to my house and kidnapped my dog until I promised to vote for him. (Luckily, I had my fingers crossed haha suckers.) The app constantly crashed and called me ugly and fat and yeah I’ve put on a few pounds since the liberal quarantine started but I’ve been doing workout challenges recently so thought I looked good! I’ve been doing a sit up every time my home state was in first place in the Covid-19 competition! This app and its owner have bullied me into voting for Sleepy Joe! He may be “sleepy,” but at least he doesn’t support white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, islamophobia, and more! - sorry, the liberal influence is too strong! I would not recommend this app to anyone.","userName":"tomart26"}},{"id":"6174994194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the sunk the titanic","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:05:44Z","rating":1,"review":"So we’ve all watched the movie the titanic and it was told that an ice berg sunk it but it was actually this app. I was the water, I know what I’m talking about. My under water unicorn was taking a massive popper when it happened and killed my under water unicorn. And to blame it on the poor ice berg like it was even there, obviously it melted before cause of global warming duh. but after my under water unicorn died, I decided to check the app and see what it was and you won’t believe what happened. My fridge started running and then my cat died after his ninth life and then I died. I came back to life, luckily, but this app has such bad luck. I never fight reviews but I just wanted everyone else to watch out before their fridge starts running or if their cat dies after their ninth life.","userName":"helenmeraki1220"}}]}
