It was giving him the wrong idea of trump. It  looked like a great app at the beginning, but I should have known, looks are deceiving. The elephant was going all over the place it’s was first in China. He is still eating ice cream with queen Elizabeth but the sky looked green and it had bugs on the bottom of the cup. Any way not a great app but feel free to download it and experience it for yourself.","isEdited":false,"title":"Un educational app","date":"2020-07-09T05:12:18Z"}},{"id":"6175193436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"bigg rat boi","review":"I’m going home now I have a lot to eat so I’m going home and then I’m going home and I’m eating dinner with y’all I don’t want y’all going home I don’t know why I’m not working I just want you home I’m gonna I’m sorry you didn’t want you and your dad I don’t think I’m so good I’m at home so I’ll talk tomorrow night I don’t want you I want you all my money back to my house I’m so lonely I’m gonna was a nice and one time I had no to go get to the shower I","isEdited":false,"title":"Still love the new one but","date":"2020-07-09T05:10:54Z"}},{"id":"6175179676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"TDF til isss backwardsss","review":"This app is just absurd.

I knew something was wrong when pop up error signs flooded my screen, and then my kids were screaming for help downstairs. God, Gary was back home again. He comes every Wednesday, and tries to give the kids melted ice pops. Anyways, this app has been driving me insane. I can’t believe I mistaken it for Tinder in the first place....","isEdited":false,"title":"Slow, crashes","date":"2020-07-09T05:05:28Z"}},{"id":"6175149817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"sydksolxfkdlnznc","review":"After my grandma looked over my shoulder onto this app the blinding orange light of trump hit her strong. It caused her to go blind. When she was hospitalized they found that the Orange light had caused tumors to grow in her brain. She was clinically dumb. She couldn’t stop repeating the phrases “Trump 2020” and “All Lives Matter”. This has been very hard on my family. Unfortunately she didn’t make it through surgery. This app causes DEATHS!!! Remove it immediately!","isEdited":false,"title":"Death in the family 😓😪","date":"2020-07-09T04:55:39Z"}},{"id":"6175059066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"james daddy charles","review":"Whatever it was for me to get it to my mom I will be sure to check it when she gets there and I get to see my face on the phone and I’m not sure what it would be like to get her and she didn’t get it and she said I was going oto I didn’t know she was so I was just going through my phone she broke up and I forgot she had to go back to and she didn’t want me me she didn’t get to osee it so on my mom she said I didn’t want her to be rude to and","isEdited":false,"title":"U","date":"2020-07-09T04:26:17Z"}},{"id":"6175044446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ethan Briant","review":"Hey if you love facism, racism, and all things awful about humanity you’ve come to the right place. I don’t think Satan himself could have created a more poor excuse of an app/President. And if our Supreme lease does read this review, please do us all a favor and leave!
