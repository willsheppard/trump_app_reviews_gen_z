Every notification, on this app, that I have received has been irrelevant and stupid. I do not care when his kids birthday’s are no matter how many times this app reminds me.

Then it started to give me a lot of spam calls about voting for Trump. It would let me use any other app, and in my email spammed Trump 2020 things. In all I completely do not recommend having this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:09:34Z","title":"💀","rating":1}}]}
