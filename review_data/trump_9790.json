THIS APP HACKED ALL OF MY INFORMATION AND WAS SPYING ON ME"}},{"id":"6173315043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:13Z","userName":"a black muslim preiodt","title":"May god help us all","review":"So I decided to download this app the trump official app and I regret everything making this decision to put it on my device we have other news apps but this is only about trump and the notifications are crazy I’m so annoyed about this so this is not deserve to be in the App Store this app does not deserve to be here so I think it should be removed because we have other news apps that are not going crazy so may God help us all🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢"}},{"id":"6173304779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:38:55Z","userName":"Peppa Pig(●´ω｀●)","title":"✨👄😔","review":"I found out that the app was actually not a donald trump app but was really the zodiac killer app. The app was trying to set you up for you to be the zodiac killer. Also the app took 4 months to download and 2 hours to enter!!! And it crashed 7 times and was their was texting talking about ketchup!

It took forever to download and then once it did. I opened the app to learn more about our 🍊 in office. As soon as it opened I was transported into the land of oompaloompas and they started chanting for me to go back to where I came from and return their leader to his rightful place! It was very terrifying! I feel violated and we should return him to his homeland at once before they figure out how to cross over!"}},{"id":"6173173972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:56:12Z","userName":"Oui Oui Mona Mi","title":"POC LIVES MATTER","review":"Wether its black lives or hispanic lives he still finds ways to make their lives miserable. They plan on putting gas chambers at the border security and labeling them as concentration camps. Child trafficking is happening while everyone turns a blind eye. Black people are fighting against systemic racism which led to many innocent lives being killed. He is not fit to lead this country and we deserve better. #settleforbiden2020 at least he cares for the middle class and the lower class."}},{"id":"6173167074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:54:01Z","userName":"shdufhfjh","title":"This is a really bad app🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥰🤩","review":"This is is really bad app cause when I was using it it started to put clowns on my screen.

He called the corona virus “ki\nUng-flu”. Even though China got rid of the virus faster than the u.s. He let white supremacists protest wearing a mask/being in quarantine, walking around with ak47’s, and screaming in police officers faces and being left alone and call “ upset people” “angry citizens”. But when it comes to the fact that poc and etc. are protesting and rioting for their equality and being peaceful, until the police took advantage of that, were called “thugs”. Make it make sense.🥱"}},{"id":"6173142951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:46:22Z","userName":"Cosette Leon","title":"Terrible app","review":"I came onto this app to find more information about our wilting orange peel looking wack president but I actually couldn’t find any information. Even if you do support him I wouldn’t recommend using this app. It glitches out and makes your phone bug out, not to mention all the terrible quality of the app in itself. I couldn’t find any information on him other than to vote for him. If I could give this app Zero stars I would."}}]}
