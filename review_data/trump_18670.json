I saw this orange man with no life and reason on this app. I’d rather see him in that orange jumpsuit  behind bars. Once I downloaded the app I got this virus named “CHEETOZZ VYRUS” and I saw this Cheeto pop up and say racial slurs so I had to delete the app before it got any worse. Can’t wait till this app is gone!!!"}},{"id":"6176735808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:34:55Z","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed!!!","userName":"isndienxjemxokd","review":"If it was possible to give this app 0 stars, I definitely would. This is not what I was expecting! The app took so long to download, and I know for a fact it was not just me, because the same has happened to others. All I can say is I am so disappointed...I expected the app to be as great as trump! This app is horrible!!!"}},{"id":"6176714796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:29:23Z","rating":1,"title":"Awful","userName":"Sierra0913luv","review":"Every Time I tried to open the app it was either a white screen or a 🤡. Very much NOT what is advertised. It hacked into all of my other devices and slowly integrated itself into my Alexa in which it started screaming racial slurs at me. It wiped all of my data and my google maps only shows me how to get to trump tower now. I need this app out of my life!!!"}},{"id":"6176683480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:21:08Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I have EVER downloaded doesn’t deserve any star.","userName":"fhanuefgedhgg","review":"Wow It doesn’t even deserve 1 star. Completely disrespectful & disgusting. Full of racism, homophobia, bigotry! The list goes on. Worst app I have ever downloaded even mentioned horrible things like grabbing women by their puss***! completely degrading & to think I let my children download this app wow now they have been exposed to this!

(Which he also doesn’t care about) I am very disappointed no loaf loaf loaf for him 🥖😠"}},{"id":"6176622859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:05:07Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE😤","userName":"hskehegpsnegsoabe","review":"This app is absolutely terrible. It took over a day to download and is not what it’s described to be at all. I really had high expectations for this app to support my non-racist and homophobic president but I was let down. It hacked my phone and cleared all my photos and data. Please do not download this app if you treasure your pictures and your overall well-being."}},{"id":"6176588132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:42Z","rating":1,"title":"Don't download 💀💀💀","userName":"MATT BAIRD","review":"This app doesn't work it is going to be the downfall of this country. It literally beeps and when I try to turn off the notifications it doesn't even turn them off. I thought apple devices couldn't be hacked but it is literally happening 😩🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 just try the Biden campaign instead much better."}},{"id":"6176567746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:50:11Z","rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏻cheeto puff🧚🏻✨","userName":"zoexopley","review":"y’all who even invited this guy. he is basically chesters cousin. i mean, we’re letting a walking cheeto puff run the country and get us into very nice situations such as ✨ w a r ✨ and can’t even get a good review on an app because it’s trash. it took 2 days to download. in two days i could’ve registered as a democratic voter. but to sum it up this is the crappiest app to EVER take place on the app store."}},{"id":"6176567646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:50:10Z","rating":1,"title":"DISAPPOINTED","userName":"maddy 🧚🏻🧚🏻❤️","review":"at first this app may seem like a good idea, however in looking at it more, it is not hard to tell that there are MAJOR design flaws. not only are you supporting a cheeto when downloading but the layout of the app is completely useless. not to mention the pricing for merchandise is out of this world expensive. 15$ for a straw i don’t think so."}}]}
