It was at that point that I thought something strange was going on. But like every other Racist Ignorant Selfish Republican, I ignored the problem and just thought it would go away on its own. The app however, only displayed more horrific glitches as I continued to use it. For instance, once I opened the app and the home page was just an image of trump in the nude. Another time, the app glitches so bad, it made my phone burning hot until it actually caught on fire! Thankfully I put it in rice and it was ok. I still however, like most politicians when things get to hard or complicated, decided it was best to just hope the problem would somehow not be my problem and disappear on its own, like a miracle. Things took a turn for the worst next time I opened the app and tried to see where the orange faced, corn husk hair, centaur looking, bunker boy would be holding his next “coronavirus is a serious issue and forcefully reopening the country too soon will result in hundreds of thousands more dead” rally. As soon as I clicked into the app, fireworks started exploding out of my phone and people without masks suddenly showed up on my driveway holding racist posters, anti-women’s abortion rights posters, all lives matter posters, and waving the confederate flag. It was at this point I knew I had to delete the app and leave this review.","title":"🧚🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♀️✨✨No Bueno✨✨🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️🧚"}},{"id":"6172493474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:34:13Z","userName":"noranl1234","rating":1,"review":"Awful app. Do not recommend whatsoever","title":"Bad app"}},{"id":"6172484128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:39Z","userName":"kendallwilliams2k20","rating":1,"review":"This app doesn’t deserve to be here, sorry ;)","title":"Communism"}}]}
