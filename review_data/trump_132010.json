Quality is so poor and it feels like I’m using a laggy android. This app makes me feel very uncomfortable and it should be removed from the App Store. Please don’t let him run for president again we can’t have our country fall into ruins. I don’t even wanna see his face on this earth ever again because this app makes it worst. He doesn’t deserve a platform nor fans so NO TRUMP 2020😭","rating":1,"title":"This app should be removed!!"}},{"id":"6174087686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:20:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ugly Bufoon","review":"This app made me break out in hives the moment i downloaded it, and i regretted it immediately. As soon as I opened the app a notification popped up insulting my MLP socks. My son was around when it randomly started ejecting DVD discs out of my phone and blaring profound music. I will never even come close to this app or the creator of the app ever again.

No❤️ I entered in and when I saw what I saw my eyes almost popped out of my sockets.  My jaw dropped and my face said 👁👄👁. As it asked if it wanted me to allow notifs like are you serious my phone is so warn out I don’t need any new notifs then it’s asked for my NUMBER!!!!!!!! Are you serious have you heard what happens if people have your phone number so scary. Just as I saw that my heart dropped and it skipped a beat. My body took a screenshot looking at the cover. I never felt more scared. Just as that happens I can feel the blood in my veins. My body then shivers.
