Unlike when it usually overheats it let out a almost Cheeto like smell. Over the next few minutes my whole house began to become consumed by these Cheeto fumes. The Cheeto smell had attracted the sewer rats and cockroaches. However, after coming and realizing there were no Cheetos the rats and cockroaches became a angry mob not stopping until they got something to eat. They marched through the house until they found my baby sister. Instead of not finding Cheetos to eat they took my baby sister and my cat. My family was devastated, until this day the emotional trauma is terrible. So, I ended up calling the White House to complain about the app and what it had caused. After hearing about my baby sister and cat they immediately started laughing. The person over the phone then proceeded to tell me that’s what I get for not being a conservative white male. After begging for some change they finally agreed and said that the president would send a surprise to our house. After waiting for a day or so I was awoken by the sound of our front door being knocked down. Police proceeded to drag my whole remaining family down the stairs saying we were resisting while beating us with batons. After that they took me outside on the sidewalk while they cut off my air supply by pressing their knee into my neck while telling me stop resisting as I was laying on the floor not moving. After that they told me they were gonna take my remaining family to jail and charge them with fake crimes they did not commit. They ended up giving my mom, dad, and brother a life sentence because they claimed they had a gram on them. And gave my white male neighbor 1 year for commuting mass murder. Now I am homeless with no family the only thing I have is this Cheeto smelling phone.","date":"2020-07-08T21:40:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173811836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"(:)-/@$","title":"#TIKTOKLIVESMATTER (p.s this app is trash🤢)","review":"this app belongs to the streets\nas amember of the streets we don’t claim we kindly pass it to the highways\nas a proud member of the highway we certainly do not claim\nTHIS APP BELONGS TO SATAN😭","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173786294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kOoLkAy14314838382","title":"Garbage App 🤮🤮🤮","review":"This app is HORRIBLE!!

I also see her in my dreams. I’ve had the same dream every night for the past forty seven years.\n\nI’m at the park, swinging on a swing. it’s a summer evening, the sun is about to go below the horizon. a little girl walks up to me and says, “dad, come back.” I look at my hands and see that they’re wrinkly, and fine white hairs are growing out of my knuckles. I’m old. when I look back up at her, she is crying. “do you even love me?” she asks. I feel horrible. I jump out of the swing and run to her, but I can’t. every step makes my bones ache. I fall to the ground, and crawl to her. she backs away, scared. I feel like I’m falling, so I look down and fall into a 100 foot hole. as I descend into the darkness, Brittany appears. she is old. in my dream, brittany is my wife, and the little girl was our child. “where is our daughter? is she gone? why didn’t you save her?” brittany is screaming, on her knees, for our daughter. I look up and see at the top of the hole, our daughter, disintegrating to ash. I feel immense pain. brittany then begins to chase me down the hole. “where are you going? save our daughter!” then I hit the bottom and wake up in a cold sweat, tears streaming down my face, wishing to see my wife and my daughter again.\n\nI haven’t seen brittany or my daughter in many years. every time I wake up, another year has gone by. I’m now living in the year 2067. the entire human race is gone, and the only thing that remains is me, my cat, the 7-11 across the street, my phone, and my time machine. while living in the future, I’ve created a time machine. I went back in time to the year 2020 to write this review. my time machine will work only two times, if I use it more than twice, it will cause a nuclear explosion, and this earth will be no more. I used it once, to go to 2015, to see my mother, and now I’m using it to come here for this review. please do not download this app. I don’t want you to go through all of the pain that I have. these emojis are be a message. you will understand in the future. 🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦶🦶🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦿🦿","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:13Z","isEdited":false}}]}
