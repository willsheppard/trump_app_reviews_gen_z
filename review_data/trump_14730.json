There was a note from the man himself telling me to get COVID-19 and go back to China (I am white). Also not to mention the oranges were disgusting and contracted a lot of flies which led me to getting some complaints from my neighbors which caused me to get evicted.","date":"2020-07-10T02:24:18Z"}},{"id":"6179033278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Yoyo is ya boy","title":"Worst Ever","review":"Bro why don’t they have negative reviews bro elect Obama not this flat face, his face flatter than that chucky cheese pizza that be tasting like cardboard. It’s not hard to believe he’s a HORRIBLE president. Oh and now what he’s trying to delete TikTok... he crossed the line. I’m POSITIVE MORE THAN HALF of America is not on this “presidents” his side. So if you actually get this app enough bad reviews I think he can’t delete TikTok anymore cuz we don’t go down without a fight. #FightBack","date":"2020-07-10T02:07:26Z"}},{"id":"6178974083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"1223447788999","title":"GROSSSSSS 🤮🤮🤮","review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about trump but that app made my phone crash and took forever to download and then I realized oh wait!!

When I finally was able to open it, it kept glitching and made my phone spazz I had to takey phone to the Apple store and they had to bring out some machine to forcebly remove the app because it wouldn't delete.

I wanted to support Donald trump. But when i tried downloading it, it wouldn’t download for over 3 hours. Very disappointing. When I tried running the app it wouldn’t work. It kept CHRASHING and KICKING me out of the app. I could not get it to work.

Disgusting. Then, I tried opening it to see what all the biz was about and it crashed my phone! I tried three times, checked other apps on my phone, but this is the only one that did it.

Why should i have to wait that long? That’s just ridiculous! I would rather be painting my orange self tanner on or building the wall in my backyard than sitting here to watch it download. Right as it downloaded, my cat started speaking in tongues!!! The first understandable thing he said was, “pat my head to join the Trump 2020 cult”!

Like who does he think he is targeting for votes 14 and 15 year olds, oh wait they can’t vote. On top off that trump continues to only worry about himself and not at all about the US, not only is he racist but he is sexist and if you are gonna ignore the fact that he is an awful person just because he helped the economy then your sick!!!","date":"2020-07-09T23:43:23Z"}}]}
