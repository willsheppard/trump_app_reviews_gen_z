And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don’t, ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or, or where you’ve been. Ever. For any reason. Whatsoever.

When i downloaded the app (which took forever to download for some reason) it kept glitching out on me and the song Friday by Rebeca Black would play nonstop. Also when I opened the app a whole bunch of gremlins would appear in my house and sit in the corners and watch me. I get terrified when they appear so i hide in my closet. I could hear them singing the worst songs possible. Please cheeto man if you see this come get your gremlins🙏🙏","rating":1,"userName":"gremlinhater44","title":"Just no👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6174292878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:35:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the reason I will be a virgin for ever when I opened the app I saw a dorito and a hot Cheeto having sex😳and that’s when it happened my sister turned into my step sister and every women turned into a Karen!!my dog started talking and started changing colors my mom actually made good food and my dad finally came back with the milk and then a big uno reverse card poped up and it got even worse I turned into a girl and my sister turned into my grandpa this is proof that this app is cursed #tiktoklivesmatter✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","rating":1,"userName":"epic memer 69","title":"Cursed app"}},{"id":"6174274372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:29:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app makes me wanna look at the ice age baby instead of me big cheeto. i opened this app and come to see a moldy cheeto puff that seemed very smelly. the smell and looks of the cheeto caused my eyes to burn off and my face to melt. this app caused me to face expensive medical bills to reattach my face. my dog sadly past away because when i dropped my phone my dog went to go see what had happened. i had to go to my dogs funeral with a melted face. now i’m in debt and will never buy any type of cheetos. i am very traumatized.

But I have friends who downloaded it and we’re not friends anymore. Overall this whole app just does not need to be an app anymore. end it was just too many tiny hands...too many tiny hands.

Not only that one I downloaded it and put my phone number in Johanna’s witnesses kept on contacting me. Plus my phone has started to shut down and reboot with chinese propaganda since application was opened. When I asked Verizon to trace the issues my phone was having they all traced it back to this application. I do not recommend getting it unless you support the chinese communist party.","rating":1,"userName":"jhenderson2020","title":"The issues i’ve faced"}},{"id":"6174150164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:43:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Basically when the app opened up it was asking for pop DNA and a survey on your personal info like saying when was the last time you shave your ear balls and asking where your animals live and asking if potato’s should get banned! I was disappointed and grossed out and I just decided if I wanna have no eye sight I better not even think about looking into this app anymore!

I would like to start off this review by saying this app will steal your kpop merch. I opened the app hoping i could gain a better relationship with cheeto lord. Instead of that, I saw a obese carrot running on a treadmill. I closed the app out of trauma. I then saw my door open to the horrific sight of the obese carrot dropping into a split, and twerking while in a split. He then continued to take my merch, and leave. Please dont download this app. You will be traumatized, and your merch will be gone. I dont want this to happen to anyone else. Be safe✨","rating":1,"userName":"chansjuicydrippingthighs","title":"🤏🤏🤏"}},{"id":"6174146124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"EVERY SINGLE time i opened it crashed my phone???? and since i REALLY needed to see the news!!! i kept trying... the ONE time it worked it opened up to a picture of an orange blob???? not sure... i scrolled and then came across a news article that said all babies must be burnt at the stake??? uhm.....so unprofessional.... i decided i wanted to give the app ONE more try.... that was a mistake.... i came across an article that said if i read it i was going to DIE in 24 hours.... its been 20.... i dont want to die.... please....
