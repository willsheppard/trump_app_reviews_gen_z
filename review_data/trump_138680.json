Would not recommend. I’ve had it for a minute and I’ve removed it and added again to see if it changed anything and when it’s not added my phone doesn’t ask for my location multiple times or clock my internet usage etc. I think this is China using a fake app to try and steal info again.","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:47Z","title":"Republican since before Obama.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lalaz1224"}},{"id":"6179701846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was very disappointing to me at least give us some better cover art.","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:46Z","title":"Disappointed","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ratachel"}},{"id":"6179701808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The lag on this app is terrible! I felt myself just aging for the app to download. When opening the app, it glitches. I can’t put my phone number in it. And it’s not responding. My phone started to flash  on and off for no reason! Keep in mind I have an iPhone 11, brand spanking new. Tik tok doesn’t have these same problems! So sad that our president can’t make a better app. It’s utterly ridiculous. 🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:45Z","title":"Utterly Ridiculous","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"emily dorado"}},{"id":"6179701499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the white circles around his eyes make me uncomfy.","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:38Z","title":"🤡🇺🇸","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"uhhh :("}},{"id":"6179701121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Now I’m 100% a very very loyal trump supporter, definitely would never oppose him, and I was thinking all those one star reviews were fake, but I was, dare I say, for the first time proven wrong. This app really did take AGES to load, took lots of time away from me doing various other tasks, such as definitely not reporting Trump’s Very Important tweets. AND after it downloaded it asked me for my name and phone number, which I happily gave for the chance to maybe, just maybe, one day get recognized by Trump, but alas all it did was spam me with what I can only assume are Chinese hackers trying to STEAL MY LIFE AND MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE KAREN!! Not only that, every time I open the app, I hear a VERY LOAD BEEP followed by my phone sparkling, which is further evidence of all the DEFAULTS of this app. I demand an immediate refund for this app!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:31Z","title":"REFUND ME NOW","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ZAnonymousB"}},{"id":"6179701019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Delete this app please","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:29Z","title":"Delete this app please","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"dionacastro9"}},{"id":"6179700963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Stupid app it say rude thing to mean it call me fat and ugly worst app in the world 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-10T06:00:28Z","title":"🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"momo200845"}}]}
