I didn’t even know your body could do that. It was just vomit after vomit. I practically lived in the bathroom. I barely even ate and I was still able to puke so much. I do not recommend this app to anyone below 100 pounds. You could die from throwing up that much.","date":"2020-07-09T03:41:58Z","title":"Flappy bird was better than this app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bid goobs"}},{"id":"6174913303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was at the store at the app just made me phone start chanting all lives matter and you don’t need to wear masks because you won’t get the coronavirus.

It also was offering to live stream the torturing of children in cages at the ICE centers.

Expected more from the 2020 POTUS campaign. I would give this app zero stars if I could. To top everything off, the app has a lot of false/misleading information. I recommend that everyone stay as far away from this app as possible.","date":"2020-07-09T03:27:32Z","title":"Horrendous","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"<3TSwift11:)"}},{"id":"6174868731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"don’t EVER get this app. it automatically turns you into a racist peace of crap whose only response to anything is all lives matter. not kidding y’all the second i downloaded it i became a white supremacists and shouted trump 2020 to people who were fighting for their rights. oh also i slowly started turning orange and my hair thinned to a crisp and suddenly i have small pp energy","date":"2020-07-09T03:27:31Z","title":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"JBHL💋😝"}},{"id":"6174867004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app about a week ago and it’s causing my phone to glitch.
