It doesn’t give me any reason to put this big orange man in office again. I didn’t even vote for him last time anyway because our whole family thought he was crazy. But I downloaded this in hopes to see something that would maybe change my mind, but nope still hate him. Maybe even more than last time.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:34:53Z"}},{"id":"6173079996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nope","userName":"@shawtysince95","rating":1,"review":"Couldn’t even use the app because it asked for my phone number. I’ve never signed up for emails from trump and everyday I get atleast 6 from his campaign and son telling me I need to donate to his campaign. I literally received an email saying “have you stopped checking your emails” “but our records show you’ve IGNORED all our emails.” With caps like who does this? Very unprofessional and disturbing","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:26:19Z"}},{"id":"6173066373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","userName":"minecraftqueen76","rating":1,"review":"Once I downloaded this his app scary stuff started to happen. 😳My house caught on fire😛. My dog ran away. 😔My shoes started walking around will no body attached to them. Ik you may think what does this have to do with trump. 😹😹😹Well my cat walked up to me and attacked me and was chanting “maga maga maga maga” and his eyes turned red and he grew horns. 😭😭😭😔I’m scared. 😳Please don’t download this app. Also there’s a bad virus on my phone because of this app.😱","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:21:54Z"}},{"id":"6172994076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"yikes...","userName":"Himari1875","rating":1,"review":"this app is just a five nights at freddys knock off!!! instead of animatronics there’s donald trump in different outfits and you hide in the white house. now this would be good and fine if the quality wasn’t so terrible and there weren’t so many ads!! the jump scares are sub par and there’s not even a noise. don’t get me wrong, donald has a very scary and orange face but the jump scares really don’t do it for me. :( it’s hard to play this game when 30 second ads pop up every few seconds and you’re taking credit for scott’s amazing concept of five nights at freddys! at least it’s free i guess but i definitely don’t recommend downloading.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:59:29Z"}},{"id":"6172835389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APPPP 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","userName":"bad vides ✨😗","rating":1,"review":"Let’s start of with this my phone doesn’t work the same as it used to it was all fine when I DIDNT get the app until I wanted to try it and downloaded the app my phone is all glitchy and I just don’t like it second when I downloaded this it took a few weeks to download not even a day few weeks what a waste of time therefore I don’t like this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:10:45Z"}},{"id":"6172833983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Stan Twice","userName":"Anime shawty","rating":1,"review":"I know I want it\n입에 바른 소린 이제 그만할게\n'Cause I deserve it, deserve it\n혹시 잠깐 내가 미워지더라도 걱정 안 할게\n'Cause I know you, I know you\n내 눈을 자꾸 피해봐\n네 맘을 자꾸 숨겨봐\n나에게서 도망쳐봐 no no\n감았던 눈을 떴을 때\n문득 내가 떠오를 때\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more more more more more and more\n멈추기 싫어 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\nDo you feel me\n니가 날 위한 사람이라고 믿니\nOnly for me, only for me\n간지러운 말은 굳이 하지 않아도 넌\n'Cause you know me, you know me\n네 귀를 자꾸 막아도\n나를 멀리 밀어내도\n나에게서 멀어져도 (저 멀리) no no\n내가 다시 널 부르면\n나의 목소릴 들으면\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYeah 한 번 더\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more…","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:10:20Z"}},{"id":"6172801063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely horrible","userName":"Onika2020","rating":1,"review":"This app honestly should be deleted in my opinion. The fact that it is so slow, and and has a bad, cluttered graphic designing is the reason why. I don’t really see the purpose of this app when the information on here is just anything I could see on the news. I don’t think that a President should have his own app in the first place.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:00:55Z"}},{"id":"6172790364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP EVER!","userName":"cheyenne McNiven","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app it wouldn't load at first,,but then it caused my whole phone to crash! I couldn't do anything on my phone. I couldn't even make phone calls. it took a week after the app was deleted to finally get my phone back to normal but it still has some bugs.  I might just have to get a new phone...\ndownload at your own risk!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:57:49Z"}},{"id":"6172775950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This App is For Idiots","userName":"MeowCat1","rating":1,"review":"This app is the worst thing that has ever happened and I’m surprised that people would even think to download this app. The creator of this app is Racist, Rapist, Homophobic idiot who had big dreams to run a country that he has completely ruined and at the same time unified most people against him. Trump thinks that he can win again I would like to see him try, Gen Z is coming for you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:53:43Z"}},{"id":"6172729450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"traumatizing!!!!","userName":"sophiacoul","rating":1,"review":"This app is HORRIBLE. I opened it think I would be learning good things about our country and president but instead was met with constant reminders of how awful our government is. I have never been more traumatized and hopeless as I’ve been opening this app. I even showed the app to my grandmother, and she was so traumatized she had a heart attack and almost died!! Worst experience of my life.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:40:21Z"}}]}
