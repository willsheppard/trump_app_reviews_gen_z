I first open the app and I see Donald Trump butt naked dancing to the song “Yummy” by Justin Bieber, which has now scarred me for life. Then after that disgusting view, they then ask for my address, which I thought was normal just in case they decided to send me merchandise of some sort. But no, instead they sent me a box full of dead rats all with Trumps face on it...I burned them. Because of this app I will now vote for Biden 😤🤚🏽.","date":"2020-07-08T23:37:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174131495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"EW!!!","userName":"whyarealluserstaken?","review":"Ok so first off, I downloaded the app and I immediately saw a picture of what looks like an expired cheeto. Then I realized it was huge. Then I proceed to see racist and homophobic and transphobic comments everywhere. Like since all lives matter, why are black peoples oppressed and you help white people do that??? Ummmm... that don’t make sense to me. And then you say “There nobody that loves women more than I do” No, you love their breasts and buttocks. Soooo... once again it is proven that you are a white supremacist. How is it that a women’s nudes are leaked and it ruins her life but a man who’s been accused of rape OVER 40 TIMES can be president??? And burning the flag is 10 years of prison? Rapists get 2x less time than that. Is burning the flag burning your 💫🧚\u200D♂️ heart 💕💖??? No it’s not deal with it it’s not that big a deal.","date":"2020-07-08T23:36:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174131024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"IM HORRIFIED","userName":"fartiebee","review":"He asked for my ethnicity in the form of a survey in which he ordered me to call him massa for the duration of me having this app. This app got into my amazon alexa where it proceeded to play melania saying hello every night at midnight!

On opening the app my phone completely glitches out and sent me directly to YouTube where it started playing the “im a gummy bear” song. Although that song slaps, this is a very crappy app and should be taken down. I’m pretty sure my phone has a virus now 🤭🤗😬🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T23:36:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174130323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"If I could leave less I would","userName":"()yad","review":";;\n\n {Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.\n\nBut she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only \n\nbe broken by love's first kiss.\n\nShe was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing \n\ndragon.\n\nMany brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, \n\nbut non prevailed.\n\nShe waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest \n\ntower for her true love and true love's first kiss.\n\n{Laughing} \n\nLike that's ever gonna happen.\n\n{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}\n\nWhat a load of - \n\nSomebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\n\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\n\nShe was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\n\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\n\nThe years start comin' and they don't stop comin'\n\nFed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'\n\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\n\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\n\nSo much to do so much to see\n\nSo what's wrong with takin' the backstreets\n\nYou'll never know if you don't go\n\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\n\nHey, now You're an all-star\n\nGet your game on, go play\n\nHey, now You're a rock star\n\nGet the show on, get paid\n\nAnd all that glitters is gold\n\nOnly shootin' stars break the mold\n\nIt's a cool place and they say it gets colder\n\nYou're bundled up now but wait till you get older\n\nBut the meteor men beg to differ\n\nJudging by the hole in the satellite picture\n\nThe ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin\n\nThe water's getting warm so you might as well swim\n\nMy world's on fire\n\nHow 'bout yours\n\nThat's the way I like it and I'll never get bored\n\nHey, now, you're an all-star\n\n{Shouting}\n\nGet your game on, go play\n\nHey, now You're a rock star\n\nGet the show on, get paid\n\nAnd all that glitters is gold\n\nOnly shootin' stars break the mold\n\n{Belches}\n\nGo!\n\nGo!\n\n{Record Scratching}\n\nGo.
