He’s going up for re-election soon, and doesn’t qualify. The app is terrible and wants to much unnecessary information. It’s sickening how much of an issue this is. This app is the worst on the App Store. I don’t know why anyone would ever get this. This absolutely disgusting joke of an app."}},{"id":"6171998622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:16:27Z","title":"Bad","userName":"110evelevin","review":"This app is really bad I had purchased 22 donkeys and haven’t been mailed to me and 45 oranges to me and haven’t been mailed to me and didn’t get my orange face like president points and he also is removing tik tok for just making a fool of him self and he is doing that just because he was made fun of and he should just step down from president periwodt"}},{"id":"6171869285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:37:07Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP!!","userName":"PaytonxJanae","review":"I love AMERICA 🇺🇸 but I HATE this app!!!! Our president has done many great things, but creating this app was NOT one of them. Maybe the locking up of those people born slightly lower than us tops the cake, but who knows? He’s just so many things.......\n\nAnyways, I wish I could have attended the rally. I was driving my fish to the park, but DONT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT CHILD PORN LINKS TO HE SENT TO YOUR PHONE 4x A DAY!!!"}},{"id":"6171866053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:36:08Z","title":"PLEASE READ","userName":"Karen Columbus","review":"This app is horrible it made me reset my PHONE. I had to go and find a computer genius to help me fix it. DO NOT GET unless you want to loose everything even your pictures that you’ve had for many years. Please rate this 1 star so we get it off this apple apps so this doesn’t happen to anymore people!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6171839018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:27:21Z","title":"Clownery at its finest","userName":"everytime$$$","review":"If I could give this app 0 stars, I would. This app just screams clownery. It’s terrible. Why is this even on the App Store? The graphics are awful. Don’t even get me started on Trump. This is just complete trash. I don’t even know why ppl support this guy. It just needs to be removed, thanks. I only downloaded this to write a review😂"}},{"id":"6171691732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T10:38:18Z","title":"The worst App and president","userName":"RicoBorges","review":"This president is by far the worst I’ve ever seen. I can say this without regret. I have never seen so much division in our country until now. And quite frankly this app, is no better than him. Completely glitchy, trash setup and very ugly. If I could give it less stars, I would. Let’s vote this Cheeto out in November!"}},{"id":"6171610723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T10:10:28Z","title":"not safe to use","userName":"thiqqcouchielips","review":"this app is absolutely horrible with the design, a lot of misleading information on it and it’s not safe at all. i heard this app takes ALL of your date and info on your phone and sells it to ppl on the dark web where they can steal your identity and ruin your life. 0/5. i’m very disappointed"}},{"id":"6165930067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-06T23:51:25Z","title":"foreigner 💕","userName":"Anna Bortion ❤️","review":"all I wanted to do was support my favorite Cheeto puff, but when the app finished downloading and I clicked on it, Trump popped out of my phone and shot me in the head 👁👄👁 To make it even worse my phone started to shout racial and homophobic slurs at me. DO NOT download this app if you are insecure and will cry easily. Btw my beautiful Melania and Barron, you will be saved soon my luvs ❤️🧚\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6162921999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-06T05:56:09Z","title":"Disappointed","userName":"Peep E.Poopoo","review":"I wanted to download this app to support Trump with the big rump but this app is difficult to use for an older woman like myself. This app is riddled with bugs and glitches I just don’t know what to do with myself. Ughhh I feel like I really wasted my time with this would not recommend. Jealousy is a disease *****get well soon xoxo"}},{"id":"6151221303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-03T06:53:34Z","title":"BAD APP!","userName":"hejehdvsbnamalekfjdnsnqkcncnx","review":"this app is a very bad app. it asks for personal info. why are people supporting this president and it’s merch. i find it very disappointing on how our president is failing to make our country the country they claim to be. gen z, will eventually help take over the world and make this place better. our generation is rising up and will get this cheeto puff out of the office ! ya"}}]}
