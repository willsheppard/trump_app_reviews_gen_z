I was pregnant! I thought to myself this can’t be right?? I don’t have a Uterus. The app must have sensed I was pregnant and wanted an abortion so it high jacked my phone’s audio and started calling me a baby killer. I tried to turn it off (which the app didn’t like). Next thing I knew I was strapped down with Kellyanne Conway pumping my blood with bleach (to prevent Covid-19), while rambling on about the benefits of a Christian education. THEN Fox News broke into my living room and threatened to sing Christian gospel non-stop unless I pledged to vote for Donald Trump. 10/10 WOULDN’t recommend.","title":"CAUSES PREGNANCY","rating":1,"userName":"Nick4cone2309"}},{"id":"6174767313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:57:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"누난 너무 예뻐서\n남자들이 가만 안 둬\n흔들리는 그녀의 맘\n사실 알고 있어\n\n그녀에게 사랑은\n한순간의 느낌일 뿐\n뭐라 해도 나에겐 삶의 everything\n\n아마 그녀는 어린 내가\n부담스러운가봐\n날 바라보는 눈빛이 말해주잖아\nAnd I think I'm gonna hate it girl\n끝이 다가 오는 걸\n가슴이 말해준다 누가 뭐래도\n\n누난 너무 예뻐\n(그 그녀를 보는 나는) 미쳐\n(하 하지만 이젠 지쳐)\nReplay Replay Replay\n\n추억이 내 맘을 할퀴어\n(아 아파서 이젠 맘을) 고쳐\n(다 다가올 이별에 난)\nReplay Replay Replay\n\n누난 나의 M.V.P.\n부러움에 뿌듯했지\n늘 시선집중\n그녀와 함께 있는 난 so cool\n제발 이 손을 놓지 말자 던 나의 다짐은\n어느 순간부터 거짓인걸 알아\n\n아마 그녀는 착한 내가 별\n재미없었나 봐\n날 대하는 몸짓이 말하고 있잖아\nAnd I think I'm gonna hate it girl\n끝이 다가 오는 걸\n가슴이 소리친다 이별 앞에서\n\n누난 너무 예뻐\n(그 그녀를 보는 나는) 미쳐\n(하 하지만 이젠 지쳐)\nMake up, shake up, break up\n\n추억이 내 맘을 할퀴어\n(아 아파서 이젠 맘을) 고쳐\n(다 다가올 이별에 난)\nMake up Shake up Break up\n\n아 아 아름다운 그녀는\n아 아 아직까지 누구와\n진실 된 사랑의 맛을 본적이 없는\n게 분명해\n\n아 아 아쉽게도 그녀는\n아 아 아직 어린 나에겐\n진실 된 사랑의 마음을 받을 수 없는지\n\n누난 너무 예뻐\n(그 그녀를 보는 나는) 미쳐\n(하 하지만 이젠 지쳐)\nReplay Replay Replay\n\n누난 너무 예뻐\n(그 그녀를 보는 나는) 미쳐\n(Uh 그녀와 나의 love) 미쳐\n(하 하지만 이젠 지쳐)\n(Uh, I just go crazy 'cuz)\nReplay Replay Replay\n\n(I I I love you girl)\n추억이 내 맘을 할퀴어\n(아 아파서 이젠 맘을)\n(Uh 마음이 아파서) 고쳐\n(다 다가올 이별에 난)\n(Yo I wanna hold U girl)\nReplay Replay Replay\n(I I I love you)\n\n누난 너무 예뻐 (I keep thinkin 'bout you)\n누난 예뻐(I keep dreaming 'bout you)\n진실된 사랑의 맛을 본 적이\n누난 너무 예뻐 (I keep thinkin 'bout you)\n누난 예뻐 (I keep dreaming 'bout you)\n진실된 사랑의 마음을","title":"BAD APP!","rating":1,"userName":"Fuek triemp"}},{"id":"6174644077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:20:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i was living happily with my wife of 7 years and our three beautiful children when i installed this app. My friend recommended it, said their chicken wings were delicious and usually arrived within 3-5 business days and my son richard cunningham IV was about to celebrate his fourth birthday, so i decided why not get him something special, however when i installed it there was a knock at the door and donald trump himself forced himself into my house and murdered my entire family in cold blood. And on top of that my chicken strips didn’t arrive until two months later and they were soggy.

I opened the app and this weird Cheeto looking thing was the one of the first things I saw, I almost fainted from disgust. The only reason I didn’t pass out and projectile vomit after seeing that abomination is because I was listening to Moonchild (listen to it of you need to be cleansed of the awful images in this app). Anyway I also notice that the Cheeto looking monstrosity had hair (if it can even be called that) that even Brad Mondo wouldn’t be able to save. 0/10 would NOT recommend.

He then started chanting in Latin. My phone started glitching and playing the hit classic I’m a Barbie Girl. He then rose from the ground in peculiar fashion and drop kicked my grandma(she is a heavy supporter) into the next century, we are still tried recover her from but to no avail. Ergo my family was torn apart and I found it abundantly clear that he ate my dog and now haunts my room by putting on old racist cartoons. Crazy enough this has happened before. \n\nUpdate: I got rid of him by pointing out his small hands👁👄👁.","title":"Big b00bz?

I found this very offensive because i am a lesbian transgender non-binary gender fluid male. This absolutely terrified me and so I just had to confront the 🍤🍊 man and when I did he yelled in my face and started to run around naked with his little 🍤going nowhere because it is to small to move😔. He is absolutely terrifying and so I deleted the app and the naked 🍤🍊man disappeared. I am now scared for life but at least I haven’t had a small 🍤🍆for my entire life.

And to make my day worse on top of all of that I sprained my ankle trying to get to the phone store so I’m now in a brace and had to spend 567 dollars on a new phone.

You wanna know why? Oh because I saw the freaking petrifying face of Cheeto land’s so-called president, rotten yellow Cheeto aka, “The tanning obsessed annoying orange 🍊🍊.” And I want to know why someone even thought of making this app. Like why do you hate people so much that you made a whole petrifying app that had the only tanning obsessed cheeto’s face?!

THIS APP IS THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!❤️ Dont ever think you can get rid of tiktok without a social media war.💘If u think deleting tiktok will stop us, I’m here to politely inform u that it won’t luv x💋 Vine, Musically, Tiktok, Byte...it doesn’t matter luv💋 We will always be heard🌝🌚🌝🌚ANYWHO, the app is terrible, many bugs that need to be fixed. Even if they were fixed it would still be a terrible app. It will probably give thousands of people nightmares and I highly suggest that Apple kick this out of the App Store.
