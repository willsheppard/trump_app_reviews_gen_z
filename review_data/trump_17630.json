I thought I was supporting Daddy Donald John Trump😫by downloading this but when I opened it, my brand new phone immediately crashed and would not function properly. I took it to the store and luckily it was still under warranty but I don’t want this to happen to anyone else and for them to have to pay. Do not download!!!"}},{"id":"6178914152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely incredible app","userName":"foidbkotchk","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T01:24:01Z","review":"I think the only thing better than this app is our commander and chief"}},{"id":"6178835139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusting","userName":"bdnskejdvnsks","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:54:46Z","review":"First of all, i wanna day how incredibly long it took to download this app. It took about two weeks!

I’m very disappointed. I love my president the so ever loving Donald Trump! When I found out he had an app I was so happy! When the app finally opened it was so plain! Like it looked horrible!

I recommend downloading this for the totally not only reason to rate one star. Good day"}},{"id":"6178701888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad graphics","userName":"that moment when h","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:03:23Z","review":"Horrible graphics 1/10. I couldn’t even walk around in game without my phone having a stroke.\nAnother thing, the plot is extremely boring. No creativity or interesting events. Worse than fortnite and pubg.\nThe only part I liked was when the final boss, the police, barged into my house in the middle of the night and made me go to therapy."}},{"id":"6178594272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","userName":"✨Anxiety✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:21:21Z","review":"This app is the most terrifying app to exist. I download it get all set up and stuff you know. I get “hey baby, wanna come to the White House later? 😉” I didn’t ask for this type of thing and I am extremely uncomfortable with this app. Not only is the president the most tangerine looking person, he is flat out creepy. I STRONGLY recommend to delete this app as soon as possible."}},{"id":"6178561328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":".01/10","userName":"D111996","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:08:36Z","review":"I’m only leaving 1 star because it’s the lowest I can on here, this app was full of misinformation based on absolutely no science or actual facts, one might even say it’s fake news. And how do you have a Trump app with no 24h trump cam??? How are we supposed to know if he’s actually doing his presidential work??? Very disappointed. No coupon section either."}}]}
