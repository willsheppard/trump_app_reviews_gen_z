Said something like “make america great again” or “white power” I can’t remember which one it said. Anyways i got so scared that I quickly deleted the app but then cut my finger on my screen! That goldfish bit me! If you ever make more apps, please don’t put a sea monster as your cover. I am not sure why you chose a goldfish to represent this app but please remember that goldfish are not very smart (at all) and will eat every fish around them (that they can) in order to survive. 0/10 shame on you. 🟧✨","title":"what is this monstrosity","userName":"NoMoreGoldfish","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:30:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173445662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a while 24 hours to download! I would not recommend. This is such a horrible app I wouldn’t even recommend it to the person I hate most. If you do get this app, the best of luck to you because it all gave a lot of viruses to my phone! My phone WAS so horribly messed up I had to get a new one! A whole bunch of money went down the drain just because of this one app! I may be acting like a Karen right now but trust me this is one of the worst apps on the planet, also may I add this app deleted all of my IMPORTANT photos and then filled my phone with porn! Yes PORN tabs on my safari! I will never get this app again.","title":"Horrible","userName":"black lives matter 🙌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173425403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took 7 hours to fully download, and even when it opened it still wasn’t ready! it took up so much storage, and all other apps were not working after fully downloaded! i came here to support my favorite large orange🍊 to win the 2020 election, but instead of supporting orange, they sent 100 oranges to my house! so this even means this app tracks your location without permission! so now i have to move houses🙄\ni downloaded the app because all my republican family members told me it was amazing for the campaign! but the EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO THEM WITH THE ORANGES TOO! don’t waist your time on the useless app🙄 very disappointed😢","title":"HORRIBLE- DON’T DOWNLOAD","userName":"yuh246813579","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173346319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought this app would be a good way to connect digitally but no. The moment it downloaded fully, my phone caught fire, causing me to drop it into the field I was in and burned ALL of my crops. ALL OF THEM. How am I supposed to feed my family now? Without that food me, my wife, and our fifteen beautiful kids are going to starve. Not to mention the adult goats too. All nineteen of our goats are going to starve without the grains we were growing. Plus, after my phone fire was put out, I realized the app deleted ALL my other apps except for Twitter. Not only that but it changed my lock screen, home screen, AND Twitter account so I’m only following f*scists! Very sad.","title":"NEVER DOWNLOAD","userName":"Pickles 372","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:52:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173301317","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app, it grew legs on me and it started yelling trump trump multiple times! It scared me so I said shut up but then it started chasing me around my house then I tripped and fell over by the fridge! That mf then saw and grabbed a toothpick and start tryna stab me in the leg but thank god I had bullet proof leg things! So I slammed it against the cupboard and jumped on it and said K.O! Omg the thing then slid over and I missed it and hurt my elbow 😭. So it started screaming “come get me ugly” like literally. IT couldn’t even run fast, so I ran and grabbed my spiky stripper boots and ran to it! And guess what I did? I STEPPED ON THE THING!!!! So yeah and it made me break my phone so I got another one but I’m not downloading this ever again!

I mean, I thought the app was like trumps personal p*rn hub, but I was sorely mistaken. Anyways, when I did finally open the app, all I found were statements with incorrect information that will be proven incorrect if you use your brain and google it (and look at MANY sources, not just fox and trumps twitter). \n\nI was really hoping to vote Trump 2020, because you know... real women vote for trump, we don’t need no liberal chump. But alas, I guess I just need to stop cutting off my pen*s every month 😞","title":"Doesn’t even deserve 1 star","userName":"I really mad1234","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:26:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173180491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a proud trump supporter I would like to say that this app doesn’t work 😡, Just gave me so many fake news and told a bunch of lies and I really do want my president to do better.

However, after immediately downloading, the app made my phone completely glitch. I tried turning my phone off and on again and that did nothing. After taking a look inside the app, it actually caused me to go temporarily blind. It had a horrible set up. This app is BEYOND hard to look at from seeing the president’s ugly cheeto face to seeing his horrible supporters and the fact that this app isn’t a joke bothers me. Anyone who still supports this man is an idiot and a white supremacist. y’all all belong in jail. \nTrump 2020 💕 but on a tombstone ✨","title":"TRUMP 2020 ⚰️","userName":"anon 🇺🇸👄🇺🇸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:54:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173166784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To all the Cheeto supporters🤢🤪I was just looking through the App Store and decided to get this app😆😪✨it took a whole YEAR to download it FOR that im giving this app a one star and the quality is just not it like get sum help🤡✨n e ways there’s really NOTHING interesting on the app🤪😌💅🏼✨there’s just WAY to many Karen’s🤢🤪💅🏼✨and my grandma LOVES trump so while it was downloading the thing by it’s self decided to play music SOO loud that it LITERALLY GAVE MY GRANDMA A HEARt ATTACK😭😡 and the music attracted cockroaches to my house while my grandma was having a heart attacking for all this that you caused I give this a one star🤬🤡💀✨💅🏼😪😎😌✨✨✨thank you😌💅🏼✨💀🤡 ugh I HATE clowns🤡🤡","title":"Try✨💅🏼🧚🏼\u200D♂️🦋🧸🎀but never try again💅🏼😪🧚🏼\u200D♂️🦋✨🤡","userName":"ugh i hate clowns🤡🤡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:53:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173130953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"On behalf of gen z we’re not sorry!!!I would rate this 0 star if I could but sadly I can’t🤦\u200D♀️🙄 anyways HORRIBLE APP it showed a very ugly orange😭 my phone is still traumatized from everything that happen🥺 poor thing but anyways this is not an app I would recommend because it kept showing this ugly orange thing and it traumatized my poor phone and it’s something you shouldn’t support I mean have you seen what was lea-just know he got expose for what he’s done🤭 tea sis lol anyways THAT ORANGE THING LOOK LIKE A BURNT OLD SMELLY UGLY MUSTY CRUSTY DUSTY CHEETO I think I will be scar for the things I saw😩 ugh so that’s all I won’t be writing any fairy things :) I should tho but MAN THAT ORANGE THING WAS UGLYYYYYYYYY LIKE GET OFF MY SCREEN REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
