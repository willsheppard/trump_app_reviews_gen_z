So I felt like the developers were not qualified therefore this app is also not qualified enough to be in the App Store. Also the colors were very very very ugly, I don’t care that the American flag is those three colors, I care ab aesthetic. And the aesthetic was BLEGH. Also the picture when u first download was disgusting. I believe ‘our president’ has ‘better’ pictures then that. Maybe like the leaked photos of his little wee wee, it would give a great message on how we don’t wanna have small pp energy. Last, the name has ‘trump’ in it. Which is absolutely preposterous, we should change it to ‘hello kitty’ or something. Anyways, hate the app and hate the person, -10/10","isEdited":false,"title":"I felt disappointed"}},{"id":"6173103116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:33:48Z","userName":"trump2020 on a gravestone✨","review":"So bunker boy oh I mean Donald Trump is a complete racist he does nothing good for America except make irrational decisions based his emotions. He has sexually assaulted women and minors and paid off their families to stay quiet on it yet people still made him president. Trying to ban app because he ruined his rally that no one was going to go to either way all right he’s a terrible orange I mean person so what I have to say is trump 2020 on a gravestone ✨ Trump if you see this Black Lives Matter. Don’t  Forget he said he would date his daughter if she wasn’t his also when ask what do y’all have in common he said he would say sex it not hard to believe that trump have sexually abused his daughter and Barron need to be saved from these terrible people. Oh don’t forget the time he try to kiss that little black girl on the mouth and she pulled away from him","isEdited":false,"title":"No"}},{"id":"6172989125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:57:57Z","userName":"sarah p!","review":"i was looking at this sight to see if trump had actually gone through with all the promises he had said he would do! Unfortunately I can’t find a single one he went through with! As I downloaded the app scarecrows started flying through the screen! It was like a scene from Dora! Anyways I was absolutely terrified by the scarecrows because they started mating with my dogs. They impregnated my dog and now she’s expecting 30 pup-crows in March! This whole situation is absolutely absurd! The scarecrows then started to release a poisonous gas that traveled through my whole house and wiped us all dead! I’m writing this message from heaven by the way! But this was the worst experience of my life and now my dog is alone to raise her pup-crows all by herself! Would definitely not recommend getting this app! It will RUIN YOUR LIFE!!!!! 🙀😿😵😾👹","isEdited":false,"title":"they killed my family!!!😿"}},{"id":"6172888959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:26:51Z","userName":"not bunker boy","review":"This is to all the old men on here saying it’s “children who can’t even vote” commenting things. I am old enough to vote, extremely educated, a social justice AND policial science major, and overall a human being with good morals, and common sense. This app is extremely bias (along with anything else Trump puts out) and needs to be deleted. I suggest you old Trumpets get used the younger generations actually educating themselves on political matters and not just inheriting their parents views. I also suggest you watch something other than FOX News to get your information. The upcoming generation is doing more to change the country than you ever did and ever could. As many of you stated, these kids aren’t even able to vote yet and they’re making this much of an impact already. Oh and, ✨🧚\u200D♀️make America great again💖💘by leaving 🦋✨💫","isEdited":false,"title":"of age to vote 🥰"}},{"id":"6172655115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:19:28Z","userName":"lily bo billy","review":"i went on the “app” and it kept glitching sooner or later i got a notification that said trump posted on twitter,he didn’t so i went back to the “app” trying to read the news and it wasn’t working i turned off my phone and turned it back on it didn’t work now it showed a picture of a cheeto? i thought somebody hacked me and so i deleted the app and got it again and now it won’t work word of advice to everyone DONT USE THIS APP ITS TERRIBLE just go on twitter or fox news they ALWAYS have my back everytime i’m cooking and watching the news while my little devils are running around and breaking things sometimes i think maybe i should get a babysitter but no they’re too expensive so i just let them run around i love you cool cats and kittens (i watched tiger king yesterday) bye bye😘","isEdited":false,"title":"this “app” is the worst i rather use fox news"}},{"id":"6172456612","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:24:18Z","userName":"thateducatedteacher","review":"I came on to view the reasons friends and family are voting for Trump, but I can’t find any that sit right with my conscience. Also, I find it interesting that your ploy to show that “black lives matter” is the first thing that popped up when I looked at your page. It’s kind of like that one racist saying that “I’m not racist because I have a black friend,” okay then... you can earn my vote by becoming a compassionate and responsible leader, wearing a mask in public and promoting that your followers do the same (to end selfish, destructive behavior), owning and explaining why you continuously broke the law, take the kids out of the cages, and actually support lgbtq+ and black lives matter... not just acting like you do, firing Ms. Betsy and supporting public education, and oh, yeah, stepping down. Biden isn’t perfect, but you’re going to cause WWIII.","isEdited":false,"title":"Where are the reasons?"}},{"id":"6172198992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:13:42Z","userName":"This App is Tricking","review":"This app kept crashing while i was using it😡. It wouldn’t stay open even with designated wifi. I’m so disappointed in this and rlly thought i would be able to get something out of it. It also made my phone glitch really bad. I wanted to see if it would happen to anyone else so we tested it on my grandmas ipad and her ipad turned directly off and glitched our from there. We were able to manage getting back on but that was it. She couldn’t unlock it from there. My phone has more speed than her ipad so that kind of explains why she wasn’t able to use it again. This app should be off of the app store because from what i see from these reviews, people are saying the same things and the same things are happening to their devices. This should NO LONGER BE AN APP!🤦🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"What a terrible app🙄"}},{"id":"6177882936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:47Z","userName":"Rob.__.e","review":"I highly advise you to NOT GET THIS APP. AS SOON AS I GOT IT MUSIC WOULD NOT STOP PLAYING🍊! To be exact it was this is America by Childish Gambino That night I had a dream that Donald Trump was standing at the edge of my bed with a taco saying I love Hispanics I woke up 🍊with a cold sweat 🍊on my face and tears in my eyes after telling my mom about this nightmare she told me it’s just a nightmare 🍊a couple days 🍊later my TV fell off of my nightstand and that day I woke up with no teeth no 🍊hair no money and no memory of who are used to be my family started 🍊calling me Mr. clean I couldn’t handle the bullying and harassment I would not recommend downloading🍊 this app shortly after I deleted🍊 it my teeth grew back my hair started slowly growing back 🍊and then the CIA did X-Files type of investigation on the app which led to me thinking it is app really haunted by Mr. Cheeto 🍊himself I think so","isEdited":false,"title":"No 🍊"}},{"id":"6177831577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:50:07Z","userName":"Judy Clancy","review":"I don’t know what’s happening with these kids trying to get this app taken down but I LOVE my president and I was so excited to get this app. I’ve never seen him in my area so I had high hopes this app would tell me when he would be here. As soon as I opened the app, it crashed. I thought it was a one time thing so I decided to come back later. I opened FaceBook and THAT crashed too. This had never happened before I downloaded this app, by the way. I opened it again and it my screen started flashing and messing up. I deleted it promptly and everything that was wrong with my app fixed itself. I checked my photos as a precautionary measure and they were gone. Not only does this app glitch, but it steals your data! I truly wish I didn’t have such a low rating for a great president.","isEdited":false,"title":"Expected More."}},{"id":"6177526083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:15:22Z","userName":"bigbootyjudy👁👄👁","review":"HORRIBLE. First of all, it took 76 weeks to download, and when I opened it, I found a RANSOM note because the Orange Oompa Loompa lookin Cheeto with a weave had kidnapped my exclusive Walter T-shirt and I found out I had to give him my house to get it back! Secondly, I was HACKED. All the photos in my camera roll where turned into Bill Nye the Science guy photos, which wasn’t that bad at first, but when I click on them, I place a delivery I don’t want at a rundown Taco Bell down the road that’s run by a small rodent cult wearing sombreros! They took everything from me and replaced it with Spray Tan! The app controls all of my apps, and every time I open Tik Tok, a life-sized Isabelle The Dog comes out of a bright pink car and sprays rat poison on me when I get too close! This app has caused me and my family so many problems 😖 would NOT recommend!","isEdited":false,"title":"✨𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒✨"}}]}
