Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.","userName":"ｂｒｏｓｋｉ","rating":1,"title":"not a good app (or president)","date":"2020-07-09T19:38:09Z"}},{"id":"6177974851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"honestly with all the campaign money mans got you think he the president could come up with a better app. imagine supporting a racist pedo. couldn’t be me. 🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈😘😘🥵","userName":"reseee23","rating":1,"title":"not it sis","date":"2020-07-09T19:35:48Z"}},{"id":"6177967461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app abused me like trump abuses his power 🥰🧚🏼, 0 star rating 🤩","userName":"tyh.john","rating":1,"title":"Take off AppStore","date":"2020-07-09T19:33:24Z"}},{"id":"6177948532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is just straight horrible...

The best president in the world had made an app that would allow me to connect with other weezer fans and would let us discuss everything from what's going on in the weezer community, to allowing us to discuss the meanings behind our favorite weezer songs without judgment! For the first few days everything was going great. I was able to talk with so many amazing fans who shared the same passion of weezer music with me. Then everything changed when I checked my phone and THE River Cuomo, the lead singer of weezer, contacted me and told me he wanted to meet me in person. At first, I thought it was a prank. The weezers (thats what we call ourselves) LOVE to prank other people in the fandom. But alas, it wasn't a prank. I gave River my address and within 5 seconds he was at my house. I was so excited to meet him when suddenly, it all went downhill. He ate my cat. RIVER CUOMO ATE MY FRICKIN CAT. How could he do this to me? I had looked up to him for so long. I bought so much weezer merch and I have all of their albums on vinyl. When River saw how upset I was, he apologized profusely. He told me that the TRUMP 2020 app has forced him to eat my cat or else our President would ruin his music career forever and BAN his music from the United States. I didn't know what to say. Nothing could bring back my cat or remove the pain I was feeling, but I forgave him. I forgive you River Cuomo. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to feel what I felt as I watched my precious kitten get eaten because of Donald trump's horrible app.","userName":"Cookiemonstercupcake101","rating":1,"title":"This app ate my cat","date":"2020-07-09T19:16:40Z"}},{"id":"6177911126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"🧚✨Just like our president this app was a disappointment🧚✨","userName":"Rqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqrqr","rating":1,"title":"Yeet Feet","date":"2020-07-09T19:15:00Z"}},{"id":"6177883350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is horrible. no specific reason other than he who may not be named but it’s just dumb lol","userName":"Morgan cote","rating":1,"title":"why...","date":"2020-07-09T19:05:55Z"}},{"id":"6177806043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Ok so first I want to say that I downloaded this app as a joke 🤣. So this morning I woke up and I saw that my arm had a tattoo of 🍊trump 2020 🍊 on it. And at fist I was ok where this come from 🤷🏻\u200D♀️? And then I looked at the app and it said first step is complete ✅ and I was like what??!! So then I continue on with my day and I look at my cereal 🥣 and it said if you don’t vote for me I’ll kidnap your dog 🐕🐶. So then I saw on the app it said step 2 phase scare and attack complete ✅. So at this point I was really weirded out by it. Then I hear my doorbell ring so I go and look who it is, it’s my mailman 👮🏽. I open the door and get my package 📦 but as he is leaving he falls down like he’s dead 💀. So I try to call 📱 911 but then all I hear is the 🍊 trump 🍊add for 2020 saying that the police 🚔 are getting defunded. So I try and get my parents but I’m home 🏠 alone 😬. So I go back inside freaking out and I don’t know what to do, so I looked at the app and it said open the package 📦. Me being stupid and scared I did. As I opened it it was a megaphone screaming at China 🇨🇳 to vote for 🍊trump 🍊2020. So I look back on the app and it says phase 3 complete ✅. My parents get back home I tell them the story and they say it’s 🌟 fake news 🌟. I storm up to my bedroom and I find out that my dog 🐕 🐶 isn’t on my bed 🛏. I get really scared and start freaking out cause the app kidnapped my dog 🐕🐶. So then I hear a noise downstairs and it’s the doorbell. I look over my stairs to see who it is and it’s 🍊 orange 🍊 himself. As I try to hide I hear my dog barking and him saying your house is 👌 tremendous 👌. So then I run upstairs but I hear him say who’s up stairs then I hear him come up the stairs. I run into my bedroom but he still follows me. And I jump out of the window to get away from him. Ends up jumping from the second floor gives you a broken arm 😬🤮. I needed surgery but I can’t get it from that hospital 🏥 cause he owns and works there 😬. So now I’m just sitting here with a devil 😈 app and a broken arm. PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","userName":"karate__kid","rating":1,"title":"Grosssss 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T18:42:37Z"}}]}
