Wow I wonder why 🤔 I guess Trump is so amazing that he doesn’t even need to specify who is writing and publishing these articles ✨🧚🏼🍃 The best advice I can give anyone is to immediately delete this app because it’s trash. Just going through it gave me a headache and I wouldn’t want that for anyone else.","title":"This app is trash just like our president :)","date":"2020-07-09T05:09:47Z","userName":"c00lchick133","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175180131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"What I did wrong I was lazy I didn’t want to clean up my room so I dumped all my bags onto my bed and I put them in one bag and then I told you I cleaned my room and that was wrong of me because I lied and I shouldn’t of done that. What I should’ve done was gotten out of the way I just cleaned my room in the first place instead of putting it off for weeks and weeks and then when I finally did it I didn’t do it correctly.

I am now in the hospital due to blindness. What’s more traumatizing is that the last thing I saw was him. I want him arrested and take full responsibility. I am writing this to give people warning so they wouldn’t risk the same fate I went through. I am not writing this I’m blind. My dog Richard the 3rd, insisted to write this. He’s a great help as of now and is helping me through recovery. Once I read that he’s 10 ft away from me on Braille it’s on site (but not literally because I’m blind).","title":"Traumatizing","date":"2020-07-09T03:46:31Z","userName":"i am now blind","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174931528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Bro I swear, this is the worst app I’ve ever gotten. It keeps sending me racist, homophobic, anti-environment, pedophilic, (you get the point) just a lot of negative vibes. It’s really soul crushing watching this app move so slow and affect my ability to drink water to where I have to drink it with two hands. Not only that ever since I got this app I guess the radiation from the negative vibes it gets is making my skin turn this hideous oranges and my hair slowly start to peel back. Would not recommend. Would give negative stars.","title":"I hate this app more than I hate a hot dog water ice cubes","date":"2020-07-09T03:46:05Z","userName":"hotdogwatericecubes","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174915906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to support my great president, he touched me hoohaa once and man did it make me feel alive. Anyways I got the app so I could be update on the President and his plans to turn America homophobic and it was well but then a crazy thing happened. My cat, votebiden2020becausetrumpisabiggot, was chillin outside and then a bunch of rednecks with guns drove up to try and pick me up so I could go to the anti mask conference because I lack a couple brain cells.

You know as a great American I am. As soon as I downloaded the app my phone started acting funny!! It randomly would start glitching!! My friend Karen said she loved the app but I knew I should have not trusted her. This app is un patriotic and anti white! I mean I can’t call the cops off of this app for anything racist. Such a waste of time and space. I real American app would allow me to express my first Amendment right. Such a waste. Worst app I’ve ever been on...","title":"Glitchy app- don’t bother it crashes instantly","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:19Z","userName":"Christy0114","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174716449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app somehow stole ALL OF MY INFORMATION!!! they found out where i live and stole my cat!!!

But otherwise my phone was locked entirely. The mini game  consists of the president trump going to rally’s but if you don’t influence the people they leave. The main problem was nobody ever showed up to the rally’s even though it said millions would be there. Over all I think they should update the app to take the mini game away and let me use the other applications on my phone while it’s downloading","title":"Took to long","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:16Z","userName":"Person who wanted to learn","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174672130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this application in hopes to keep up with my gReAt president fecesface but to my disappointment. The app immediately drained my battery and bombarded my phone with notifications. The layout is nauseating, was it designed by a toddler? Not only this but the news it sends it is absolutely fatal, completely fake news! I thought my pResIDeNt was against this antifacist nonsense! I am disgusted. I will be deleting this app immediately I feel racist and mayo colored simply having it on my phone. I will no longer be voting for fecesface. 👎👎","title":"Horrible App Horrible Content","date":"2020-07-09T02:28:41Z","userName":"fecesfacehateclub","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
