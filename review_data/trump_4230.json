I guarantee it. I open the app and then I immediately close it because just the opening of it was so ugly and disturbing I almost vomited and passed out. I tried to open it again later that same day and it is simply a mess. It was like wading through a dump, trying to find a golden key in a world of dirt and garbage. This app is not user friendly and I felt attacked even being on it. It felt like someone was watching my through the eyes of the app, collecting my data and making me brainwashed to love America. If I could give this app 0 stars, I would. \n-a TikTok member"}},{"id":"6174446390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😬🤚🏼","userName":"1249suri","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:24:11Z","review":"so basically i was taking my pet ostrich on a swim and all of a sudden this app popped up on my home screen and all i remember seeing is mr cheeto man crawling all over my boat while hissing at me saying i need to rate his app 5 stars or else he’s going to bite and scratch me. So my ostrich being my ostrich of course started a rap battle with mr cheeto and all of a sudden chucky from chucky cheese starting beat boxing so i got hyped up so i started danceing and randomly started to fly but then i remembered i can’t fly i can only levitate with wings coming from my back. so i dropped my phone in the water so i levitated with my wings down to the water. but i realized i can’t swim so now im dead."}},{"id":"6174344328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Make my phone great again🧚🏼\u200D♀️🦩🍄by deleting this app","userName":"courtneyyyyyann","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:52:31Z","review":"So apparently this app isn’t the new alternative of tiktok. I got it because I needed something funny to entertain me once they banned that app that’s holding half of the population sane during this pandemic. But unlike tiktok it is not full of hot people, just one poorly spray tanned old man. I had the displeasure of having his body take up my ENTIRE screen and I think I heard my phone weep! I do not recommend this app it is a waste of time and is doing nothing but taint my poor phones innocence. Also I heard being apart of “trumps army” will make you LOOSE BRAIN CELLS at an alarming rate. I’d like to keep my brain cells thank you very much."}},{"id":"6174283171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This is literally the worst app🤢!","userName":"Your Mom💅✨🦋💗","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:32:04Z","review":"God never makes mistakes🧚\u200D♀️🦋✨🌸💅💗except when he made you tho🧚\u200D♀️😍🤩💗✨🌸🦋You guys this app is the worst my phone got a really bad virus of it🤢 my pet dinosaur started to lag and it decided to leave me and go to mcdonald’s without me and didn’t get me my happy meal!😔 I also saw a cheeto there and it was the absolute worst bc i hate the cheese cheetos🤢 it made me sick.

But at least I have some pulled “pork” I thought. But silly me forgot that it was the dodo bird and so obvi we got sick we went the the doctor and he was like o I can’t help you the mean orange has taken me prisoner so I was like is there anything I can do and he whispered in my ear and said you have to eat him as the cure so I raced back home and ate the first Cheeto and tangerine I saw so that is how I’m writing this but my whole family is dead now so that’s a bummer thanks a lot 🙄"}},{"id":"6174125620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Traumatized.","userName":"LillyLou23456","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:34:44Z","review":"I’d like to start this review off by saying, not only do I want to leave a 1 star review for this app, but I also want to leave a 1 star review for myself for even downloading it. This app just might be the most abominable creation ever put on planet earth, besides the man himself. Getting a notification from this app is like getting a notification from your toxic ex explaining why they are so great and how you could do more to make the relationship better. I like to keep up with my country, but not at the expense of my mental health. Unless you’re looking to get checked into the mental hospital during a PANDEMIC, I’d recommend maybe not downloading this app."}},{"id":"6174125205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Literal Waste","userName":"XXXmichelleS","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:34:34Z","review":"This was horrific. I downloaded the app to keep informed on any Trump Rally & campaigns I could possibly attend with my father & as I open the app, I see that it’s Donald Trump, and although in the picture he looks extremely obese and tanned badly, I smiled & continued on by entering my # and then all of a sudden my phone freezes. I will say that this app has a lot of viruses & has infected my phone. I have also kept receiving many texts, even after I deleted the app and texted STOP. I do not suggest downloading this at all. Very disappointing. Moral of it is, I no longer condone or support him. Do NOT download this waste. It will hack into your private info. and cause viruses."}},{"id":"6174110960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"Heck hair","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:29:22Z","review":"this app has so many glitches. it makes my phone run so slow and lose battery so fast. at this point i think the app is so far from functional that the Trump administration might as well just delete it and start a new one next year sometime. maybe they can release it on november fourth to make sure they give themselves enough time to fix all the glitches. whatever you do don’t download this app. you also definitely should not interact with the app developers ads or website to cost his campaign more money because they really need to invest that money into fixing this app!!!!  #maketheappstoregreatagain"}},{"id":"6174048592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING‼️‼️‼️","userName":"trumpsupporteragainstthisapp","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:06:31Z","review":"So I downloaded the app and the first thing I read were the terms of the app. THIS APP IS SELLING YOUR INFORMATION TO RUSSIAN AND CHINESE KIDS EVEN YOUR FACE and address. This non american kids will print pictures on you and sell it on the dark web is confirmed by the FBI. This app allow this foreign kids to hack your phone and even your home system security, a friend of mine got her’s hacked and the setting language was changed to spanish. This app is also used by a lot of immigrants just to see if they can rob you by hacking you. Also the first thing I saw on the app after downloading it was the face of Obama taking a mirror selfie in a very inappropriate outfit THIS APPLICATION IS A JOKE"}},{"id":"6174081947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"This app is UNDERRATED!!!🇺🇸","userName":"mattmatt_clinch","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:18:59Z","review":"The increasing amount of negative reviews on this app is to attack the President of the United States and his Administration, because the possibility of TikTok being removed from America has hit headlines. Anti-Trump Tiktokers are telling other people to go to this app and write negative reviews just because of this. As a young man of conservative values, I challenge my fellow Trump supporters to put five stars on app to fight against hateful messaging from left wing activists/TikTok influencers!!!! Trump 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}}]}
