When I opened the app it immediately demanded I put in my phone number and email so that it could spam me with notifications. It also will randomly crash at different times and is impossible to use!

It capitalizes on Americans’ fear of people who think, look, and love differently than them. It pushes hateful narrative into mainstream media, inciting and encouraging violence along with polarization. The app uses fear and ignorance to perpetuate and solidify power, exploiting less educated Americans who unknowingly are creating a fascist police state out of America in their blind support. Shut this down now \n\nSincerely, \n\n- Gen Z","userName":"fairy culture","title":"Stan this app for BAD skin"}}]}
