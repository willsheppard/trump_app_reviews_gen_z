As it turns out this app doesn’t live up to the standards of mr danny turtleneck , and I am forced to give it a 1 star. I find the app also implicates heavy disrespect to gerbils which i find very offensive and repulsive. I hope that drew train doesn’t hold these same beliefs personally. it’s honestly sickening. I’m very excited to hopefully see this app removed/“improved” and the respect for gerbils to be restored","title":"trashy disrespect to gerbils","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tiana Marie B.","date":"2020-07-09T17:22:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177511133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"⚠️WARNING⚠️ this app may cause death. i was using it and it caused me to start vomiting and pooping violently. i think it was because of what i saw on screen, but it was so intense that i felt like i might pass out. my butthole became inflamed and sore. as i was sweating profusely i tried going back onto the app but every time i did i would start vomiting and pooping again. my hands began to shake and they forced me to delete the app. i just want to warn you. pls don’t get the app because you may die.","title":"guys...i don’t know what that was i’m scared","isEdited":false,"userName":"eggeggeggster","date":"2020-07-09T17:10:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177510322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Whoever designed this app seriously need to reconsider their job choice. First of all, the unstable UI makes it nearly impossible to operate. I was also throughly disappointed by the low quality graphics. The app also has serious stability issues and made my phone crash on SEVERAL occasions. There is little good I can say about this app aside from it being able to download onto my phone. Otherwise, its a useless piece of junk cluttering the cyber waves.","title":"Not good, not even a little","isEdited":false,"userName":"JoshuaTay","date":"2020-07-09T17:10:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177502919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Such a bad app it literally makes those cheap kids games look good. Not apart the whole Gen z thing at all, in all seriousness it’s just a bad app. Horrible graphics, kicked me out of the app multiple times. It wouldn’t even let me go in the app for the first few tries. And the fact that I have no control in not allowing my location to be tracked on this app? Hate that. Also it shows false information to the public which I believe our country deserves the truth.","title":"Honestly the worst app ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"peepeeepoopooweewee","date":"2020-07-09T17:08:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177487172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Omg this app is the ABSOLUTE WORST!!

As soon as I downloaded it, my phone started feeling really warm. I didn't think much of it, so I set it down on my desk. Next thing I know, my phone caught on fire! I tried to put it out but my desk started catching on fire as well. I was freaking out and wanted to call 911 but my freaking phone was on fire 🙃 I went outside to grab some water but I realized my whole house was on fire... So now I am homeless and had to get a new phone all because of this stupid app. DO NOT DOWLOAD!!!!!","title":"APP WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"#1 Trump Supp0rt3r","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177325340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I could give this 0 stars because when I opened the app I my phone crashed and when it was fixed and it turned on, the app was still open. I eventually could not not stand the sight of the Oompa Loompa on my screen that I started to go into a panic. If anyone's wondering my phone is completely fixed, but I have night terrors now. Also the reason why I downloaded the app is because I wanted to see what it was like, I'm not a trump supporter.","title":"Don't download for the life of you","isEdited":false,"userName":"🦄💎🐶🌈","date":"2020-07-09T16:15:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177300955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded the app to see what my very amazing president is up to but to my surprise that was a HUGE mistake. As I opened the app Mr. Trump and the Vice President appeared at my bedroom window on an ostrich! He went threw my trash can head first like a raccoon and ate all my trash. That’s weird. After Trump ate my trash he ATE MY DOG. Yes, my dog! So I made him leave my house and go back to the White House but that’s not it. As he was leaving he gave me his toe nail from his right pinky toe! After this I immediately deleted the app and am certainly not voting trump 2020!","title":"Do not buy this app 🤧🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumps pinky toe 🤪","date":"2020-07-09T16:09:05Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177158573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You do not have to even have any political affiliations to see how bad this app is- you just need eyes. If you want something that’ll significantly slow down your phone, you very well may want to just download this app after all! The layout is not even slightly pleasing to the eye, and the information is disorganized and misconstrued. When the App Store gives the option to leave 0 stars, I can rate this app more accurately. This is not worth your time at all!!","title":"Just Really Not Good At All","isEdited":false,"userName":"betty34!","date":"2020-07-09T15:28:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177133430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is ran by a homophobic, racist, white supremacists. That uses this app as a way to communicate with other people that unfortunately have that same toxic mindset. He is polluting our world with hatred and has divided our courts into 2. Still to this day it absolutely eludes my mind how he was even elected president. But I blame that mostly on my generation not being able to vote in the 2016 election; but guess what , we can vote now! The tide pods has made us unstoppable, now we will topple the patriarchy. BML, ACAB, & literally anyone else 2020!!!!","title":"Absolutely garbage 🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ohh.lizzyyy","date":"2020-07-09T15:21:13Z","rating":1}}]}
