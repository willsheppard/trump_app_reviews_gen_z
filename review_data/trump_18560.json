The app spread misinformation and rumors. I would not recommend AT ALL if you are looking to actually learn something","date":"2020-07-08T15:20:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172606325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"user10039854","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"Usually I’m not one to criticize apps because I always give them a second chance. I heard about this app from a friend and decided to give it a try. But this is horrible, using your presidency for more fame is just unprofessional. I didn’t know to register and why this app is asking to many personal questions. I am no longer a trump supporter.","date":"2020-07-08T15:05:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172552780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"druzzlaj","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever created","review":"The app took 15 days to download and wouldn’t let me do anything else while it was downloading. When I opened the app it kept glitching and showing Simpsons pictures and playing Iranian music. This music attracted the Trump ninjas to my house and they kept screaming “MaKiNg AmErIcA gReAt AgAiN” while watching lynching videos and laughing. 0/10 do not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T14:50:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172529463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bobby princess1234","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️😘💕🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app and as soon as i did, the purge siren started going off, my dog started floating, and i ate everything in my house. i am now sick on the bathroom floor. i am 💕disgusted💕 that the president would even have this app in the store. my phone is glitching so much since i downloaded this app. i am severely disappointed that i am not allowed to support my Oompa Loompa by downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-08T14:44:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172472656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😻sarah❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"SCARED FOR LIFE","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i downloaded this to support our wonderful orange president but only to find out it would be the worst experience ever.

There’s nothing very good about it. Every time I go to click on it nothing happens. I was really looking forward to using this app. I have to give it a one star because it just isn’t that good. There’s nothing special about it. I don’t even want to try and use it “again.”","date":"2020-07-08T14:03:08Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172193951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lordtubbingtons","isEdited":false,"title":"Sad day","review":"I wanted to try and give trump2020 a try. My mom and her husband (not my dad) both think that I’m like this crazy liberal chick.
