I downloaded this app for twenty minutes and it had completely swiped my phone of everything. It hacked my facebook, credit card, and deleted all my apps. I brought my phone to the apple store and they told me the app came with a virus. I had get a completely new phone! DO NOT GET THIS APP! It’s a shame that our own president can’t even make an app that won’t hurt our phones, how is he going to protect our country?! I was supporter until I started to educate myself on him in the slightest and realized this man is a homophobic, racist misogynist! He only cares about himself, money, power, and his fragile ℯℊℴ. Why are you even buying this app? Are you that conservative that you can’t open your mind to think maybe just because he’s a president that he’s not a good person. How is someone with bad morals supposed to use his “best” intuition for our country? Ridiculous. Please sign petitions for BLM, go to protests when you can. End police brutality, end racism, end hate. Learn to be better and be kind. Love is all we have. Have a blessed day🤍"}},{"id":"6173891300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump is cancelled 😤","rating":1,"userName":"hdjjrwejfejxhcfjjcjoaa","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:46Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First off, this app is from Trump who is a HORRIBLE president. He is a terrible president who ruined many lives in America. He claims that he is “making America great again” which is most definitely NOT true. He is a disgusting,racist,rapist. In his life, he has done terrible things. He could have of had a job of anything but the president. He is very arrogant and offensive to many. The only people who think trump is good, are people that are mentally sick to the brain, or are just like Donald who are arrogant and stupid, and have no common sense. He deserves to get fired from being the president and he needs to leave this world. One thing I hate about him is that he is ugly, annoying, and racist. Although he has a beautiful wife, I believe that she actually hates Trump and that she wants to divorce him. There is absolutely nothing good about the current president. I think as a country, we need a new,good, smart, intelligent president, FOR EXAMPLE, BARACK OBAMA. He was such an amazing president. I think we need Obama back. Or maybe even his wife( Michelle Obama). So please delete this app from the App Store. We need to get rid of trump and get a BETTER PRESIDENT THAT HAS A KIND HEART."}},{"id":"6173880884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Spicy mamma is mad Muy Malo","rating":1,"userName":"Ldogmoney","date":"2020-07-08T22:03:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is a disgrace to the white privileged communities. The moment I opened this retched app I was greeted by the horrific face of a fat demon. I broke into a cold sweat and started shivering. Then my temperature rose to a whopping 420 degrees. Then my pet rats set on fire and began eating at my flesh until they got bored and began terrorizing my neighborhood. Then all 69 of my pet goldfish lept out of their tank and into my mouth as I choked and cried for help as my family dropped dead right before my eyes. I was left unconscious for 15 hours but luckily I survived because the fish died before they could kill me from inside. When I woke up, I considered hanging myself over a pool of water (if the rope didn’t work I could drown myself)  this situation definitely contributed to my 5th degree depression which is why I constantly cut myself so I can feel something again. I always feel numb and alone because now my family is all dead and I had to burry them I ditch behind my local Walgreens.  All in all, I wish I could give this app zero stars because it has Single handedly ruined my life and I wish I could die. DO BOT GET THIS APP UNLESS U WANT TO FEEL A GUT WRENCHING PAIN IN YOUR SOUL FOR ETERINTY."}},{"id":"6173825530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hehe🧚🏻🍊","rating":1,"userName":"im a bitch😂","date":"2020-07-08T21:43:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Okay first of all dis app is just...tHe wOrSt. It literally took weeks to download and when it did (fInAlLy) a orange scary lookin face popped up on the screen and scared the crap outta me!

It was shouting “Must support the great 🎃Trumpkin🎃” over and over and over again with me tossed over its shoulder like a rag doll. I screamed for it to let me go but he says not until I support the ⚪️white supremacist president⚪️ the great and powerful 🎃Trumpkin🎃.

I’m furious and I am so serious about how deeply upset I am with this app. Even more serious than the president on his twitter rants that do absolutely nothing for anyone except provide massive amounts of entertainment (since he is in fact an idiot) unlike this app. I opened this app to find disgusting pictures of the boy himself. Boy, not man, because surely he hasn’t matured past the age of 10. Then again, he does have a thing for kids doesnt he? Nonetheless I am extremely disappointed by the administration that put out this app. Almost as disappointed in the American people for voting this big baby into office. I’ve never downloaded a worse app and quite frankly, i’m scared it’ll give me a virus. But, i know how to stop a virus from spreading, unlike the president. Regardless, this is horrible. Absolutely terrible and I think it should get taken down from the app store as much as i think trump should get removed from office. 😡🤬😱🤯🥱"}},{"id":"6174092330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hell no 👁💧👄💧👁 made me cry","rating":1,"userName":"Only Leaves Bad Reviews","date":"2020-07-08T23:22:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is horrible!! It made my eyes sweat just like that time I accidentally broke my guinea pigs neck and carried her around for 2 hours thinking nag she was sleeping and afraid to wake her then told my dad she wasn’t feeling well so we rushed to the vet and they said it was a fever (but that was just from me holding her) and they put her in a little blanket and they told me she died so then before my eyes threw her in a box (dropped it a few times) and sent us home.

My ultra Republican Trump supporting parents decided that encouraging me to download this app would be beneficial to getting the Democrat out of me. Alas, all it did was make me want to barf. The amount of blatant misogyny, homophobia, prejudice, and racism made me sicker than the tide pods ever did. The colors in the design are awful, pro tip honey, orange doesn’t go with red that well, it clashes badly, actually. The amount of old Christian white male also just made my whole experience on this app terrible. And that orange thing was terribly scary, like dude get your categories right. This app was obviously meant to be some sort of horror genre, but it’s marketed as something political. The amount of false advertising and lies on the app made me sick to my stomach. Not to mention the amount of plagiarism. Goodness gracious didn’t anyone tell him that Gen Z created eating household cleaning products? He can not tell his cult followers that ingesting household cleaning products is a good idea without playing tribute to the original holders of that practice. Cultural appropriation much? Honestly the app is nothing more than a cult following tool wrapped into a political package."}},{"id":"6173895572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I Expected more from Our “President”😔","rating":1,"userName":"yanatheforeigner","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I WAS a trump supporter, and so that I could be updated on what’s going on in the presidency. I have never been so disgusted In my entire 26+ years of life. He makes the African Americans feel bad about themselves. He is really not helping us at all. All he wants is to be noticed in the public eye. Believe IT or not, I actually had my little cousin commit suicide because of him. She felt as though she was worthless, and that she had no one to protect her because of her skin color. Before she died, she told me “who is supposed to protect me, if the police are killing us, and the president is doing nothing about it” and she left me note and said, “I never actually had hope that we would stop getting abused by our nation, so what’s the point of fighting to live, if we cant live to fight”. And even sometimes my phone keeps continually glitching. And sometimes my phones says “trump 2020” for hours. And every time I try to delete the app, it’s says “unable to complete”. So I have to buy a new phone, and start completely over. TAKE THIS APP DOWN, IF YOU WANT ME TO BE A TRUMP SUPPORTER AGAIN‼️‼️‼️‼️"}},{"id":"6173241566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting!!!😡😡","rating":1,"userName":"Don J.
