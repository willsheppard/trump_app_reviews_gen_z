However, when I opened the app, and looked through the available options, my phone screen turned off. It then proceeded to began blaring ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù in a deep voice. The noise from my phone caused my mother to lose her hearing. It plagued us day and night for over a week. I could not sleep, eat, or simply relax in my house without the noise constantly playing in the background. I tried to turn my phone off, but the app possessed it. My ears bleed, I hear it in my thoughts now, the drone a never ending reminder of this app. My mother moved away from the house, and now I live alone only to hear ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù endlessly blaring from my phone. It rings in my ears. I have tried to break my phone, burn it, anything to end my suffering. Alas, it did not. I set it on a little boat and sent it off to sea. Now, the fish in the middle of the Pacific must live with the intolerable noise, the echoing voice of ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù. I have downloaded the app on my Ipad once more, only to leave a one star review for it leaving my life in shambles.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Peggy Ann Sue","rating":1}},{"id":"6179720008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:07:30Z","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This app just kept on spamming my phone and made my phone crash and shut off MULTIPLE TIMES.

Don‚Äôt download it. When I downloaded it to see what was on it, my phone glitched out and static noise coming from the speakers. It got progressively louder for about 10 minutes until it stopped and my phone seamed like it went back to normal. But when I was checking to see if anything changed, I realized that all of my emails were gone, and about like half of my 3000 photos got deleted. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up, but DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","isEdited":false,"userName":"jsi yansichs","rating":1}},{"id":"6179719203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:07:12Z","title":"ü§¢","review":"Worst I have seen in my entire live and follow my tiktok @destinybaez581 has to plug it lol üòäüíñ","isEdited":false,"userName":"ya hhf","rating":1}},{"id":"6179719159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:07:11Z","title":"No","review":"Cheeto","isEdited":false,"userName":"h zbchflvs hlh jnf. ms","rating":1}}]}
