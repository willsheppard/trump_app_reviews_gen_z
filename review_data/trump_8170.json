I decided to try it out. And my cat was indeed correct. After about only an hour of it being downloaded I decided to take a nap. When I woke up I saw it. A terrifying Cheeto man in my corner. I was absolutely terrified I close my eyes and when I opened them again he was gone. I immediately deleted the app. But what happened will always haunt me. I can still hear the faint, terrifying words of, “make America great again.” And I shutter every time"}},{"id":"6177167223","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ouchmyshin","title":"complicated and difficult","date":"2020-07-09T15:30:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app here took several days to download. I wanted to check out what was happening but once I got it, this app interfered with my others app sending notifications. I think the opening of the app is messed up or broken. It says “Keep America Great”. That statement does not seem accurate so I don’t trust the entirety of the app based off the opening. The app layout was very weird and not simple. It was complicated to go through the app and glitched a lot."}},{"id":"6177130831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Brooklynn Masters","title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"so i downloaded this to support our lovely 💖𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓼𝓲𝓭𝓮𝓷𝓽💖 and it took a week to download. i was kinda frustrated so i opened the app and then my screen went black. then a picture of our beautiful handsome orange popped up and scared me badly. then my phone started vibrating and exploded. then my bed caught on fire and eventually my entire house burned to the ground. i’m now living on the streets thanks to trump and i’m writing this off of a flip phone. and i can’t get a job because then you’d need a housing address and as you know now, trump burned my house down ❤️. then on the streets i was raped by a cop and the justice system also won’t charge him. i was so upset so i went to visit my mother’s grave and started hearing trump whispering telling me to do racist and sexist things. overall would not recommend. 😡"}},{"id":"6177069741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Xclussiive","title":"If I could I would rate it 0","date":"2020-07-09T15:03:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First of all why is this ugly orange Cheeto have #1 in news apps, screw that why does he have an app. The fact that a celebrity tv star who lives off his daddy’s money is president is sad and all he does is tweet stuff is atrocious. Plus, him and his racist republican supporters are dumb ESPECIALLY Fox News. But the app crashed my phone and made it freeze causing me to have to factory reset it and messed up my audio. This app is spam and keep having apps. Apple should IMMEDIATELY remove this app!!! 😠 #removethisapp"}},{"id":"6176937523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumps worst nightmare🙈","title":"boo!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T14:27:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"it took me almost trumps whole election to finally download this app! And another month before I could actually see anything in the app! by then, trump almost got kicked out of office :). Anywho, this app made me had nightmares because white and orange rats were everywhere on my screen with weird names like pence?!. Next thing I know, blood starts running down the screen- probably for a “vote red” campaigning thing. anyway, this app deserves to be kicked off of the AppStore and handed to the Oompa Loompas for them to eat!"}},{"id":"6176865537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dontvoteKanye","title":"Terrible App 👹","date":"2020-07-09T14:09:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could support our wonderful, non racist, non rapist, non peadophilic, non misogynistic president. BUT I was shocked that when I fist opened the app is said KEEP AMERICA GREAT. Sis read the room we are in the middle of a pandemic and huge economic crisis, America is not doing well sweetie🧚\u200D♀️✨. Then it asked for my phone number!!!

The service was so low and it constantly crashed, it also broke my phone and I had to take it to the Apple store👁👄👁. I expected better. It drains your battery like a waterfall, I went from 100% to 0% in 2 minutes 🤢🤢🤢🤧. It is also run by a fascist who I hope to never see become president😱😱😱. Also it took up so much space with lies, I mean like I was exhausted after seeing all the lies, it really screwed up my sleep schedule."}},{"id":"6176703442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MsGabbrielle","title":"He gave me ptsd","date":"2020-07-09T13:26:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I the nicest citzen opened the app and looked around it was horrifying orange small wewe having trunp With his fake hair on his head.
