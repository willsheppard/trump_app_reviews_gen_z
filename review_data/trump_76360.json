When I downloaded the app took it forever to load and then when it finally did it wouldn’t allow me to sign up for some the events. Also, I got a new phone number and when I tried to change it in the app I could no longer receive messages. I deleted the app because of these problems and thought everything was over. But then a week later I came back and my camera roll was full of the cheeto Trump pictures! I was happy to have all these pictures of our great president but I don’t have any storage left so I tried to delete them. However, every time I hit delete on an image it would duplicate it instead. Then, on top of everything, I had found that the Trump app had somehow redownloaded itself. I tried to delete it again but then my phone started to heat up and burst into flames! I heard a scary voice chanting Trump 2020 :( I tried to assure it that I would definitely be voting for Donald Cheeto come November but that didn’t seem to appease the voice at all. Eventually I took my phone to the Apple store and they told me the only way to fix it was to burn a ritual sacrifice of a blue haired liberal voodoo doll to the great Cheeto monarch of America. I of course was happy to do this (i wouldn’t miss any opportunity to burn a cardboard cutout of some stupid communist marxist libtard) but it still didn’t work. Unfortunately I had to leave the possessed phone in the house and move out. Don’t waste your time with this app!!","title":"⚠️DONT GET THIS APP⚠️","userName":"student 38743891847","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6149672855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T20:21:50Z","rating":1,"review":"The person behind this app caused a giant outbreak in the United States of COVID-19.
