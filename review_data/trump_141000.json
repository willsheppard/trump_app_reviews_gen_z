As soon as I opened the app....my phone started glitching😡. It went completely black after that. I can’t even explain to you how SCARED my pet fish was. 10 minutes later, I heard a sound coming from behind....I turn around only to see Mr.Cheeto with a wig and his group of Karens. I was confused as the Linda’s (Karens sidekick) was throwing chocolate chip cookies that were meant for the PTA meeting at us. Mr.Cheeto came up to me and had the AUDACITY TO KILL MY PET FISH MILLIE AND IM EXTREMELY UPSET. 😭Now I have to plan her funeral. Millie was a bright fishy🥺. Protect the ones you love by not downloading this app. Not mention, this app stole Millie’s private information and I don’t appreciate that.\n\nRest In Peace, Millie. You deserved so much better luv.
