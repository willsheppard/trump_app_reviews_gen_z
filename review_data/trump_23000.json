I downloaded it so I can find good reason to vote for him but it instead made me wish that I never did. Everything that he “plans on doing in the future” is whack!

I’m going to vote him out of office now.","userName":"froggy likes chicken","date":"2020-07-08T16:04:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172657712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","isEdited":false,"review":"First time I opened the app I got a jump scare of trumps face I almost had a seizure do not recommend this app to old people.
