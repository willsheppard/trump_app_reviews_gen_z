Furthermore, I agree with Trump in many ways but this app just does not seem to work and is a waste of my time and everyone else’s time. I think this because first of all it lags, most of the information in the app is not true, and the system of the app, overall, does not work. This is one of the many reasons why I think this app should be given one star. 👎👎👎","title":"One of the worst apps I have ever went on","rating":1}},{"id":"6174456703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:27:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"YassssQueeenieeeeeee","review":"Soooo first off I just want to say that this is the most unprofessional app ever. I mean, I was seriously expecting something from the government to be 10x better than this!! This app just doesn’t work at all, and the most horrifying part about this is that I see an obese Cheeto puff on it! I mean, I opened this in front of MY KIDS!! Now, they have to go to therapy for what they saw. I am SO OFFENDED by this app, and it’s terrible, TERRIBLE. I hope they take this app of the store soon so we never have to go through anything like this again...pray for us 😤😔","title":"Awful, just plain awful.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174440869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheeto mans apprentice","review":"i downloaded this app to pay respects to our glorious leader Mr. Cheeto man🧡🇺🇸. i scrolled through and educated myself on this “pandemic”🦠 all these liberals are misinforming our country with these fake news studies with their “data” and “logic”📝once i gathered my information i exited the app and all my apps were replaced with the fox news app and my lock screen said 🇺🇸“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”🇺🇸 Then  my dad got home after 18 years from getting milk at publix🍼🥛 and he was carrying a milk jug with 🇺🇸MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 🇺🇸sticker on it.

I cannot believe what this app did. #1 when I first opened the app the overwhelming scent of spray tan coming from commander orange perforated my nostrils. #2 suddenly I felt a burning sensation in my eyeballs and realized the aroma of bleach coming from the annoying orange look alike was seeping into my retinas. I am so upset with the app itself and the effects it had on my body. I am now in the hospital writing this review and my medical bill is through the roof. So technically Mr. orange lied to us saying this app was free, bc the bill to repair the consequences my body suffered is astronomical. I am UPSET!","title":"Never again luv Xx","rating":1}},{"id":"6174380875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:04:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Chicken Nugget 4L","review":"It was absolutely horrible. It wasn’t family friendly at all. It shouldn’t even be 17+. There were disgusting images, false information, and horrible quality. It also put viruses on your phone. Ever since I downloaded this app my phone has just been going tremendously slow, turning off unexpectedly, it’s also gone as far as deleting my contacts and apps. This app is should be taken down IMMEDIATELY. No one else should have to get these viruses or see what this app makes you see. Please take this app down.","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6174341359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:51:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"A person that I've skates","review":"When u sign up for apps i usually don’t like to use my real name. for this app i came up with the name Carole. Weeks went by and i have gotten thousands of ads and emails and texts for carole. I had to switch my number and email because of this. Even after i changed everything the app continues to collect all the data everything on my phone and sell it to companies. I even saw a couple of MY photos on ads. photos no one has seen.

It’s disgusting. The Cheeto looks like it took all of my fridges contents then licked the butter off my microwave when the popcorn bag exploded. Then it started glitching aggressively, when I clicked off like a couple other people I saw a giant Cheeto man as my lock screen it was absolutely astonishing how astronomically disgusting this was. It was so extremely laggy it made my phone so hot that it burnt my hand, then I got a moth flew in my mouth. This app is horrible and extremely laggy.\nPERIODtttt","title":"Gross and extremely laggy xx","rating":1}},{"id":"6174272992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:28:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"niyah87","review":"First of all as soon as I open the app I seen an orange looking shrimp holding his fist up like what the freak and he was trying to get my phone number like what the freak why is he trying to get my phone number it said enter mobile number like why do you want my number you perv🌚🌚.. anyways I rate this app a one star because it’s horrible and it’s full of bugs and it’s just really bad all together and I just don’t like that at all so I’m going to delete it from my phone now because I think they’re watching me, thank you🙂🙂!","title":"Worse App Ever 😳.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174218820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:09:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ToeNAILCLIPPER89","review":"So anyways chile 🌶 I got this app to see what was going on with trumpito. I was kinda wondering what’s exactly was happening in that lil brain of his and just wanted to see if any...how u say? intellect was there (ik a little too daring shall I say) and boi I’ll tell u rn this ain’t it 🥱🙄.
