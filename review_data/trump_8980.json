That’s weird. Then it asked for my address and mother’s maiden name. I gave all my info because how can you not trust an app with trump’s name on it? Anyway the app was a disappointment. Not impressed. Didn’t make me feel like a winner at all so I deleted it. I’ve also now become a victim of identity fraud. I guess millions of families suffer every year 🤷🏻\u200D♀️?? I don’t know why this bad stuff happens to me. I just want to make America great again 😩","date":"2020-07-08T18:41:57Z","userName":"darn kanye!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173308349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just No 🥰🧚🏼","review":"So I downloaded this app to support our amazing 🥰president 🟠✨but I was really disappointed 😔 how bad this app was 🤡 I was expecting a really good app since it’s our president is a really amazing 🥰duh 🧚🏼but it toke forever to download.

Also I had been saving food and it ate all my food!! 😡😡 I haven’t eaten since 1970 so I am outraged at the fact this app doesn’t have any manners to ask for some food instead of taking it!! Also, while it was downloading it played horrible music and just high pitched noises!! Very outraged and the owner of this platform keeps trying to take my fish on a walk!! 👿👿👿 I can do it myself!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:30:09Z","userName":"Bobby7152819","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173215721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE!!!

Soon after purchasing i got many viruses on my devise. And if that wasn’t enough my phone exploded in my hand after using the app once. I am currently in the hospital and Trump (🤮) will be hearing from my lawyers. Forgetting to delete the app, my phone grew a mind of its own and began attacking me as I was defenseless from the previous explosion. I highly recommend you do not burden yourself with getting this app (or voting for trump in the election for that matter). Have a nice day ❤️🙈💐🧚💞","date":"2020-07-08T17:47:57Z","userName":"gennnn z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173108657","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Injury","review":"I downloaded the app to keep track of perfect little orange man’s decisions. Shortly after I did this my phone began to shake violently causing my hands to bruise later on.  I can barely even type now. Once I put my phone down I realized my hands were bright red, pulsating, and swollen. So I did what mr trump said to do and I tried to fix the problem by injecting hand sanitizer into my hands. Once I did this they began to stink, itch, and burn. I was in immense and horrific pain. Thankfully I got to the ER before my hands fell off✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:35:33Z","userName":"zoggydawg","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173107061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is absolute trash🧚💕🦋✨","review":"First let me start off by saying that this app took 300 ages to download (which ik is not far of Mr Trump) but anyways when I need a app at the go then it should take 2 secs to download not this long. Second off the songs in the app were so horrendous that the rats in the streets even decided to move away. And final reason that this app is trash is that when you first log onto the app, there is a huge pig on the front! Like cmon why not put a rat. Thank you for this opportunity!","date":"2020-07-08T17:35:02Z","userName":"Winkleberry Ur mom","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173080339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL","review":"I am so ashamed to be writing this as a loyal Trump supporter, but sadly as a Technician from Georgia it is my duty to report and call out apps that do not work. As a mother of 4 beautiful children and a supporter of the best man to ever live I just can’t support this application. Firstly, after opening the app many ad pop ups appear, making it very frustrating and difficult to navigate the app. Secondly the lay out is horrendous, unappealing and distracting. Again my apologies but some person has to call this app out :(","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:25Z","userName":"jaidenlynn07","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
