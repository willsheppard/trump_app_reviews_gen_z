There was a thing on the app TikTok where everyone was told to rate this as low as possible and give it a horrible review. My generation think they are doing good when all they really do is bully. We are all so insanely negative it’s sad and I wish everyone could just love each other. Can’t we all just shut up. We know nothing. We see things on social media and atomically believe the worst in people."}},{"id":"6179496825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:49:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Literally the worst app ever👎🏽👎🏽","userName":"babykay7612","review":"Don’t even waste your time with this app it was a waste of my time and it serves no purpose at all."}},{"id":"6179496774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:49:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"waste of storage ✨","userName":"picklelover356853","review":"this app slowed my phone down so much and took like 3 days to download. maybe the orange. peel should stop tryna take platforms that we use to pass time away, and start working on software for HIS OWN APP."}},{"id":"6179496542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:49:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Lol read this totally it✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💫🌈🐝","userName":"Martina is awesome!","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.
