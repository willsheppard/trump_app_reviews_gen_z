We Stan a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, rapist ⚡️✨🤩\nAnyway, I downloaded the app and almost immediately my phone started shaking and glitching. I dropped my phone out of fright 😨 and ran to hug my doll, Bonja. I saw this orange figure rise from my phone. He started saying things that disrespected women, and other races besides white, so I automatically assumed it was our savior, the orange president. He saw I was holding Bonja, so he took the chance and he possessed her 😭 I’m sorry this is so hard to write I miss her terribly. She started moving and even made me go in the kitchen and cook. I took the opportunity and while she was checking on me, I threw her into the oven!!!!! Unfortunately, he unpossessed her before  I threw her in, so she got horribly scarred and burned. She um, she didn’t make it. 😭😭😭😭😭😭. So, the moral is, if you don’t want a tr*mp ghost possessing your doll, don’t download this app 🌟🌈⚡️✨🤩. Rip, Bonja 🕊 you will be missed. (Also, side note, the app just over smelled gross)","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Greenday4eva2254","title":"My doll died 😔 RIP Bonja","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:03Z"}},{"id":"6173077573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in support of our fat cheeto president because he was my fav 😛✌🏾💕🍊 but after i downloaded and scrolled through it, I got quickly bored😹. That night i went to sleep😴 but was disturbed by an ominous figure standing over my bed🧍\u200D♂️. its skin illuminated a bright fluorescent orange glow but it’s face was indistinguishable🦹\u200D♂️. At first i thought it was my sleep paralysis demon 👹 but me and her haven’t arranged a meeting that night😼 so, i was confused. The figure pinned me down and i was nearly engulfed by its stomach fat 🐖. As it’s face came closer i was able to identify the figure. It was TRUMP! he whispered to me “no black👩🏾\u200D🌾 people are allowed to download my app i can’t stand n*ggers” 😰his sour breath traveled through my nostrils causing me to gag. 🤢 he began strangling me and just before i fell unconscious, he spat on me and scurried out the window 🐀. I have never felt more scared in my life😫. if it were possible i’d give the app a zero. please guys help get this terrible app taken down because if you are black he will hunt you down 😿","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"IDONTREALLYKNOWYET","title":"Scared for my life","date":"2020-07-08T17:25:33Z"}},{"id":"6173038468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I downloaded the app it made my phone crash and it punched me in the face through the screen, then Donald trump messaged me on the app and told me that he was going to get rid of the constitution which includes the 2nd amendment 😱 I was so shocked that I went into a coma for a few weeks and when I woke up, the app had turned into a person that was standing by my bedside and unplugged my life support because he needed to charge his iPod.  He didn’t even have a phone.  So of course I died and then Trump performed a satanic spell to resurrect me from the dead as a ghost so that I could haunt different members of Congress, when I refused, he farted in my face and tried to put me in a bottle but I got away.  I lost everything because of this app and if you download this app, you will die too because now I am committed to haunting every single person that gets this app so that they don’t have to go through the horror that I went through.  This is my warning to you, DO NOT GET THIS APP OR A MONSTER WILL EAT YOUR FAMILY TONIGHT I SWEAR TO GOD 😱","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Delicris","title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-08T17:13:03Z"}},{"id":"6173028885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I would get this zero stars if this would let me. All the notifications it blew up my phone. And kept saying build a wall over and over. The notifications were just horrible. I was forced to turn off notifications. But that’s not even half of it, the app itself isn’t functional. It would glitch like crazy, quality was horrible. Crazy things will pop up on the app. A Cheeto man pops up, start screaming at me. Terrifying racist things, I was disgusted to hear such awful things. And all I want to stop what is the little messages that kept popping up white supremacist words. I don’t even know why anyone would ever download this app. The Cheeto man is so mean and disgusting. Saying horrible things about women and horrible things about his children. It makes me fear for all the people out in the world. The app also kept sucking money from me and other people who use the app. I am terrified that’s such an app can exist for such horrible things. Advert your eyes and don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Renee1618","title":"Didn’t like bunker boy app","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:07Z"}},{"id":"6172761768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Came from tiktok. Anyways our current president trump is a disgrace to our country and by far the worst president we’ve ever had. He’s a heartless, racist, homophobic piece of garbage. He was also involved with sex trafficking children, locking illegal immigrant children up in cages, separating them from their families, ordered cops to be extremely violent with peaceful protesters at the blm protests, and so on. If I had the time and effort, I could right a whole book on why this man needs to be out of office. So Generation Z is fed up, and we’re gonna do everything in our power to make the rest of your presidency hell. We are much stronger than you think, we will throw tear gas bombs back at cops, we will stand up for what is right, we made a whole joke about your rally in Georgia, and that’s only the beginning. And than half of us can’t even vote yet. So next order of business we will take down this app.\n\nAnyways if you’re from Gen Z, a non-Trump supporter, or from tik tok, hello!! I hope you have a wonderful day :))","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"✨keira✨","title":"✨💕you made my day🧚💫🦋WORSE🤩✨","date":"2020-07-08T15:49:40Z"}},{"id":"6177496259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was just scrolling through the app and all the sudden the presidents nudes popped on the screen and i’m very young so i was disgusted and that was the worst app i have ever downloaded i didn’t wanna see a orange naked it was terrifying i would of enjoyed jumping of a skyscraper more than i enjoyed what i just saw DONT VOTE FOR ORANGE 2020 he made an app just to show everyone his nude which is gross i wouldn’t recommend getting this app unless you wanna see a 120 year old orange that’s naked oh yeah and this app also threaten to hit me with a bat and now i’m having nightmares and i’m wetting the bed now i’m traumatized because i saw my awful president orange nudes i wish i could give this app 0 stars because this hurt my innocent little eyes please delete this app because every time i open the app store i see this app in my recommend apps and it reminds me of that one picture you know the 120 year old orange nudes and if you don’t delete this app i’m gonna sue because you showed a little girl and 120 year old mans nudes bye have a good day","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dont vote for trump 2020","title":"DONT DELETE TIKTOK","date":"2020-07-09T17:06:06Z"}},{"id":"6177393684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded because i love my president 🍊. at first it took a month to download. then once i opened the app some bad things started happening. first it made me order tickets to a trump rally even tho i can’t go 💔. and then the presidents n*des showed up on my screen. they wouldn’t go away. it wouldn’t let me turn off my phone. then my parents walked into my room and asked me what i was doing. and guess what was on my phone screen? yeah. i got grounded for 3 years and now i won’t be able to vote for my amazing president 😰😰💔. and not only that stuff happened but then melania showed up in my living room. “hello 😃😃” she said, as she killed my grandma and then took all furniture in my house. i’m assuming it’s because i accidentally looked at her husband’s n*des. but that’s not all that happened. it slowed down my phone completely. if also made me blind. i do NOT recommend this app unless you want someone from the white house to kill your family, or if you want to see the presidents… cheeto puff.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bobby dumb-dumb","title":"this app is horrible","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:41Z"}},{"id":"6177194446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app in hopes to support our childhood phenomenon, the ✨annoying orange✨. I wanted to be up to date on what his plans for presidency where. Turns out, they’ve changed. For the worse. And the app had some sort of power. After a week of having it, weird things started to happen. First it was small, like I almost dropped my croissant. Then it got worse. I only had 69¢, so I couldn’t afford my chicken nuggets. I dropped my free taco. Nobody cared that I broke my elbow. A potato flew around my room. And worst of all, it was my birthday, so my folks took me to the beach. “Happy Birthday Raven!!” Little did they know... I can’t swim. \n\nDon’t download or support him if you don’t want to live in a hellish nightmare. Next thing you know we’ll all be brainwashed or have one of our main platforms for socializing banned because these ignorant elders are incapable of allowing us to have the freedom and rights to protest the actions of a country that nobody’s been brave enough to do anything about. \n\nIf you can vote, please, Biden 2020.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"oovo java","title":"Very very goodn’t","date":"2020-07-09T15:38:18Z"}}]}
