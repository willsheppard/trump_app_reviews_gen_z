He won’t wear a mask. He is a white supremacist and he won’t give the lgbtq communities simple HUMAN RIGHTS. Outrageous this man is. I’m disappointed to be and American with this man as president 😤.","title":"Garbage","rating":1,"userName":"D Doubs","date":"2020-07-08T17:29:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173066495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see if there are reasons to vote for Trump in November, and don’t hold your breath because there are no reasons. Furthermore, this app made my phone glitch out an explode because it couldn’t take all the lies and stupid stuff that this racist, rapist “president” has done... Anyways 0/10 would NOT recommend.","title":"Disgusting 🤢","rating":1,"userName":"Cool Person 2539","date":"2020-07-08T17:21:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173045131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Oh god... this app is just horrible.

Apple should be a shamed of themselves to have this on the App Store. I got no correct information out of this app. It took days to download and it would freeze constantly and I would have to turn off my phone and turn it back on.","title":"Bad app","rating":1,"userName":"linalu2003","date":"2020-07-08T17:08:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172999578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened this app my phone crashed.

Because that’s how the people who support it treat others outside of their supremacist group. I also had to throw my phone out after downloading this app because I felt ashamed it ever existed on my phone. It made all my other apps retarded because it spread false information and dumb💩.","title":"🗑 trash","rating":1,"userName":"GENZ!!!!BLM","date":"2020-07-08T16:47:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172954586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is spreading lies. it says it has the latest news but has a bias and seems like we’re going back in time. there are no morals and i believe the reason for having this app is useless. i don’t support a president who doesn’t care about all of his citizens and hides from real problems. this app is a waste of storage and a waste of time.\nit is clear that with an age rating on 17+ this app is trying to trick innocent people into voting for someone who lies. also someone who retweeted a video saying white power. this app is a lie and should never be used.","title":"full of lies","rating":1,"userName":"harjote","date":"2020-07-08T16:47:20Z","isEdited":false}}]}
