Other people have this issue too. Apps are meant to serve a purpose, this really barely does. Waste of space. Apple is supporting trump by having this on here, so therefore apple supports homophobia, transphobia, racism, and fascism.","title":"The worst app on the App Store","rating":1,"userName":"icewolf3332"}},{"id":"6174093786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:23:06Z","review":"I downloaded the app so I can support trump, but them my phone glitched!

Disgusting.  I could smell The aroma from through my phone, and almost fainted.  Even my dog passed out, and my mother is across the room vomiting. Even my neighbor could smell it.  Now I’m going to have to deep clean my house.  My flowers wilted, and my tree fell.  Leaving a 1-star review. Sorry not sorry.","title":"Absolutely terrible...","rating":1,"userName":"Uraraka Ochoko"}},{"id":"6174058954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:10:31Z","review":"I almost vomited when I opened this app. It didn’t seem secure and was immediately sending me unwanted text messages about his campaign which in other apps, requires consent first. The app seems to be crawling with bugs and is overall, a terrible app. I demand that the Apple store removes this gross app immediately.","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"userName":"alexandrac1978"}},{"id":"6174051794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:47Z","review":"I got this app to stay updated with mr. cheeto- I mean trump. and while I was scrolling it ATE MY DOG. I thought it was a fluke but then it called me “a bucked tooth ni**er” and threw my phone in the toilet. I thought it couldn’t get any worse but it actually started spitting on me and I ended up having to curb stomp my phone. I HIGHLY dislike this app and I am looking for a lawyer.","title":"GIVE ME MY CAT BACK","rating":1,"userName":"namjoons 85th wife"}},{"id":"6174049089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:06:43Z","review":"I’m not very educated so when I saw an app for our amazing president I immediately thought was going to be easy to use. Specially considering that I know for a fact a lot of his followers aren’t very smart. So you can understand my frustrations when I say it was very difficult to use","title":"So hard to use","rating":1,"userName":"Life360 parent"}},{"id":"6174025465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:57:48Z","review":"I refuse to support a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and absolutely disgusting man. How dare he even have an app? Really App Store? It also takes an incredibly long time to load. As I was trying to figure out when the next rally was, but it took far too long and my patience was wearing thin. I DO NOT recommend. Get this cheeto’s app off the App Store.","title":"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING APP","rating":1,"userName":"cxrlyqxeen"}}]}
