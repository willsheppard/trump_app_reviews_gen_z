It can produce a lot of hate and anger towards different cultures and programs.

I was actually very disappointed with my app experience. The second I opened the app it immediately switched me to the game subway surfers. However, it wouldn’t let me use any of the controls (TRUMP HAD HIJACKED THEM!!) so Jake ran straight into the Subway and was bleeding out on the cold hard ground. I called 911 and told them what had happened, but by the time they arrived it was too late... Jake had completely bled out and passed away. Oddly enough, his blood was coming out orange instead of red. Weird...huh?? I held Jakes funeral the following day to pay my respects to one of my dearest friends. The day of Jakes funeral I opened the app again, because I was trying to figure out how to delete the monstrosity... The second I opened the app it alerted me that Kanye West was attending Jakes funeral. I was just kind of like “cool, ok I guess we have another celebrity guest.” He was our 3rd celebrity guest so far because Taylor Swift, Jake’s Aunt, was already attending the funeral. Beyoncé was attending as well. So I walked into the funeral and a few minutes into it Taylor was giving a wonderful speech about Jake. Kanye then runs up onto the podium and says “Hold on I’m gonna let you finish, but my girl Beyoncé deserved to give this speech.” #iykyk. Keep in mind, Beyoncé barely knew Jake... Taylor ran off the stage crying, because of Kanye’s rude interruption. TRUMP THE MAN HIMSELF SENT KANYE WEST TO RUIN JAKES FUNERAL!!😡😡😡 #settleforbiden2020. I am so beyond disappointed in this app... If I had not downloaded this app, Jake would still be with us all. #ripjake2020⚰️😭","title":"JAKE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP😡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"WWHTX"}},{"id":"6177431496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:37Z","review":"This app is disgusting.
