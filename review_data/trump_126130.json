I wrote a long text to the number above to show my support for Trump. It obviously took a while to type and when I sent it, it had freshly turned 3 a.m. I thought nothing of it but then I remembered that it was the witching hour. There was a swift rush of worry upon me but I brushed it off and proceeded to go to sleep. I was RUDELY interrupted by a notification from my phone😡😡. I had my phone on mute as I do every time I go to sleep so the fact that I was woken up by this was surprising🤔. I got a message saying that Trump had responded! I was SO EXCITED AND FLUSTERED, TAHT I ALMOST PEED MYSELF! 😱😱😰😰I was so excited and took a 000000.7 sec shower just for Trump! 🥳I put on my makeup and iron pressed dress I had saved for my wedding🥰🥰😋😋. I opened the message and it said the most horrifying thing ever! It said that I didn’t really support Trump! HOW could it say that! I SCREAMED in agony and horror as I grabbed my phone and threw it across the room.🥺😖😭😓😓😱😱 I then received another message saying to look inside the toilet to prove that I really supported Trump... I was hesitant but I had to prove myself one way or another. I cautiously opened it up and found a RAT!! 🐭🐭🐀🐀🐁🐁.  EWWWW 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤒😷😵. I BROKE THE TOILET WITH MY DROP KICK and the rat FLEW out the WINDOW! My phone then proceeded to send my photos of my dog, Jerry, I loved him by the way, running around on the street! I was SO WORRIED, Jerry was my SON! I BIRTHED him! I was FURIOUS at this point!! 😡😡🤬🤬🤬👿👿👹👹👺👺☠️☠️ NO ONE messes with my child! NOT EVEN TRUMP! Trump PASSED the line! I then ran outside in the pitch black night to find Jerry. When I found him however, I was greeted with a sticky liquid on the road🩸🩸💉💉. I tried to feel for Jerry and I was calling out his name! Then I felt something wet and around the size of Jerry. When I used my phone’s flashlight 🔦, I saw JERRY! ON THE ROAD! I CRIED AND I CRIED 😔😖😫🥺🥺😭😭😭😰😰😢😢😿. My phone then started counting down from 5 with a BLOOD RED SCREEN! I once again THREW IT and ran inside! Then I saw the most BEAUTIFUL FIREWORKS!! I was still mad and I had to get a new phone. That’s why I didn’t write this sooner. I recommend you to delete this AS SOON as you can and move over to Facebook!

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.
