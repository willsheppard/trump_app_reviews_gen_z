I wanted to keep updated with the latest tea from the man. I saw so many issues with the app. First of all I hate the lay out, it sinks, looks like a toddler made it. Navigation is far too difficult, not even sure if he would know how to use. I feel like to make this app better is to almost not have it at all...like a less is more thing...like no one should have to ever see this. I would have gave it no stars if it was possible. Truly disappointed. I’m vomiting diarrhea because of this app.","title":"TRASH APP"}},{"id":"6176354279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:51:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stinky Cooch🥴","rating":1,"review":"My sleep paralysis demons told me not to download the app, but I didn’t listen. The app took 96 business days to download! After successfully downloading the application, I had no storage left. My phone keeps on glitching and showing nude pictures of Mr. Trump + it keeps replaying an audio of Mr. Trump saying, “grab em by the p##sy”. Seeing all these images and repeatedly hearing this audio has caused me many psychological problems and I would love to take Mr. Trump to court and gain full custody of his youngest son, Barron Trump. I hope you read this review and choose not to download the app. \nBlessed be💕","title":"Traumatized"}},{"id":"6176246705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:19:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"maddie ❤️🏳️\u200D🌈","rating":1,"review":"The app took DAYS to install and once it finally installed it wiped my data and wiped my phone and now I keep getting calls saying that my phone will be wiped and I’m trying to delete the app but it won’t let me delete it and this is a really bad app the quality is so bad and I can’t believe that this is a actual app like this is so so so gross and I’m not gonna tolerate these calls and I don’t know who’s stupid enough to even get this app like this app is so so so bad the quality is so so so baby and again I will say it took DAYSSS to install","title":"Terrible 😤😡"}},{"id":"6176039709","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:15:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Vote Him Out!!!","rating":1,"review":"I thought this app would be useful to gain perspective and perhaps see the president as anything other than a racist, homophobic, individual, but I was wrong. First, when you download this app it says “make America great” I find this an annoying statement because America was already great before Trump came along. Sure, we had our issues as a country, but he’s only made it worse for people who truly “keep America great” (such as immigrants and refugees). Overall, I will never download this app again, and I will NOT be voting for him. 😡","title":"Vote him out !!"}},{"id":"6175995430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:00:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tamir E. Rice","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and immediately my phone started getting so many pop ups it couldn’t even function. I had to go take it to a mobile repair shop and in order to make my phone usable again they had to completely WIPE my phone. I lost pictures of my dog that died a year ago, voicemails from my grandma I lost more recently, and many other important things because of this app. And that’s not even mentioning what information may have been STOLEN from my device. I would NOT recommend this app.","title":"Shady app"}},{"id":"6175923904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:37:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Arichella","rating":1,"review":"THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE APP EVER it took over 45 hours to download.

It took hours to download onto my phone. Once I finally opened it up it glitched and closed the app several times. There must be malware installed to hack phones because my data was stolen soon after I signed in and now I have to make sure that my credit card wasn’t stolen. The content in the app is just straight up lies and when I tried to delete it my phone shut off and wouldn’t work until I went to the sprint store to fix it.","title":"Wish I could give a negative score"}},{"id":"6175805132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:57:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Best app but....","rating":1,"review":"Possibly the worst app, candidate, and subhuman to have ever walked the earth. I genuinely hope you, your family, and the entire administration suffer for the rest of your pathetic lives. Once you lose this election, we’ll all be waiting to throw your egotistic self right into jail for the COUNTLESS crimes you have committed. You are a threat to all of humanity and democracy. You’d expect a president to have some sort of decency AT THE VERY LEAST, but instead we are left with a racist and incompetent 5 year old who can’t even fill up stadiums with his little cult followers anymore. “SAD!”","title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6175660492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:08:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Dillon........,/:;","rating":1,"review":"The app Took hours to download and I can’t even get into it I can’t believe this app is still on the App Store it’s been hacKing people’s data This app is sO bad Keep on leaving bad reviews why are you reading this you know I’m doing this just cause they taking down TikTok why are you reading this you know I’m doing this just cause they taking down TikTok why are you reading this you know I’m doing this just cause they taking down TikTok why are you reading this you know I’m doing this just cause they taking down TikTok","title":"Don’t download....................."}}]}
