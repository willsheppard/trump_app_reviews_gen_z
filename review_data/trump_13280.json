Furthermore, I was worried  that my rich white relatives would not keep getting obscenely richer. Thankfully, I downloaded Trump’s GLORIOUS app and nevertheless, I am back on the right track to only gaf about seeing the WELL DESERVED success of upper class white men again 😌✨🧚🏼🤪💕🥰","date":"2020-06-11T17:23:30Z","title":"This app SAVED my LIFE","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179200747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Katie Creek","rating":1,"review":"The app was basically supposed to be a shrine to an old tv star on the apprentice I think, but instead  it was a shrine for an Oompa Loompa. Now I can’t tell if it’s just one Oompa Loompa or multiple, but it’s way too much for me. Also, I think it’s so horrible that instead of naming the Oompa Loompas they nicknamed them “stump” or something like that. Not to mention, there was also a lot of Cheetos on there. They even had one nude photo of an Oompa Loompa with a Cheeto dong.","date":"2020-07-10T03:09:21Z","title":"Disgrace","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179107436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sincerely Disappointed Citizen","rating":1,"review":"This app is the WORST. Completely ineffective at providing any real information. I had hoped to stay informed on the Trump administration’s actions toward combatting Covid-19...but it turns out they haven’t taken any action and have instead chosen to let American citizens die to support their own greed. After downloading this app my phone constantly freezes and I am bothered at all hours of the day with pointless push notifications.","date":"2020-07-10T02:34:43Z","title":"Disaster of an App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179051969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"why we hate the app","rating":1,"review":"This app should be gone because no one want trump to be our president no one likes the Cheetoh looking dude to be president basically the whole entire population HATES him and I’m not lying and the whole gen z generation is going to attack him because we don’t like cheetoh looking people to be president yk what I’m that’s why the app is bad PERIODT.

What is this a Nigerian Prince???? After that it asked for my location and where I lived. What is this Scientology??? Seriously y’all this is a messed up app. 🤯🤢🤮 It then messaged me the creepiest texts from our beloved president. I just wanted to support our cute, amazing, and dummy thicc president 👌👌, but this just disgusts me. 🤢 I’m sorry daddy Trump but I am appalled...","date":"2020-07-10T01:41:52Z","title":"Don’t download this app!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178920037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mymomkarenlikestoreportppl","rating":1,"review":"I was very excited to learn that our hardworking and brilliant president had an app that I could keep up with. I was very disappointed to find out that the app was extremely glitchy and I could barley touch the screen without it going beserk. Even worse, I got a virus while on the app and I believe anti trumpies are trying to hack it!!! Not worth getting your private information stolen from you.","date":"2020-07-10T01:26:09Z","title":"I’m disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178901468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"m_powell224","rating":1,"review":"I thought that I would be satisfied with this app and the information it would display, but it just wouldn’t download for 2 days. I tried off of WiFi on WiFi. When it finally installed it said error and couldn’t enter the app. This is very depressing. You would think that an app dedicated to the president would function properly. This is getting a one star from me.","date":"2020-07-10T01:19:16Z","title":"I’m very disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178899154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jaieldknwosoems","rating":1,"review":"I was scrolling through the App Store then all the sudden I found this app and it took about 1 to 2 days to download and once I opened it it welcome mean in some cuss words and I did not appreciate that and when I open the app it said I downloaded a virus when I was not downloading any viruses it only happens when I open this up so stay safe don’t download this app on your phone or iPad and stay safe .","date":"2020-07-10T01:18:24Z","title":"Don’t download","isEdited":false}}]}
