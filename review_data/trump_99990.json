I was excited to see what good he might bring us. I for one wasn’t too excited about the wall business, but I was only in 5th grade and had no idea about anything that was going on.\nBut now as I am growing up to who I am now today, I am disappointed. No, not just disappointed. I am disgusted, I am shocked, and I am revolted by what this terrible excuse of a politician has brought to our country. All that he had brought was his own selfish wants, nothing more. He continuously brags to his supporters on how great he is, when he isn’t even close. \nHe had done so many terrible things to his citizens that are taken a blind eye for from some people. There is so many, that I probably couldn’t even get enough research done in two months to know it all.\nI want us to take a stand against him, not with him. Who the hell are you helping by standing with him? If the second youngest generation to exist currently can see this, where is everyone else looking? Where is everyone else when you have teenagers fighting against a government? Yes, parts of some generations are helping. I appreciate those who are. But where is everyone else in this fight? Where do you stand? Are you just going to cower in the distance? \nI simply see no reason for this app. \nYou’ve already had too much information against you leaked out, what lies are you going to make up now to support this?\n\nGood day.","userName":"astromuffinz"}},{"id":"6172865081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad app pls take down","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:37Z","review":"Bad app","userName":"ljsks m"}},{"id":"6172855521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"gross🍊✨🧚","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:16:46Z","review":"this app so bad and stupid. i was thinking of who to vote for but clearly it will not be and never will be  t r u m p😝🤣🍊✨🧚","userName":"😛🤣😹"}}]}
