Cocque","review":"This app took me 6 days to fully download. As soon as this app finally downloaded, my entire phone crashed and all my other apps were slow and having a hard time with working properly. It would never notify me in the correct way. Even after deleting and re-downloading it still would slow my phone down and stop my apps from working. I personally, would not recommend this app to any trump supporter if you actually want to be notified on out greatest presidents upcoming events.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:46:46Z"}}]}
