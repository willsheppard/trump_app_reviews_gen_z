Firstly it took over 36 hours to download, and in the process drained my battery so that now my phone won’t even fully charge. The app corrupted all of my contacts, and deleted many of my apps, like TikTok. Also the protagonist of this app, DJ Trump, is a misogynist, rapist, sexual predator, tax evader, liar, child endangerer, family separator, and a fool... which I’m pretty sure goes against Apples terms of use?"}},{"id":"6178634988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ratttstatstaydjjd","date":"2020-07-09T23:37:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not get 👨🏻\u200D🦳","review":"Not only did this take the entire four years to download, but in was reading the privacy policy and saw that when you agree to the terms and conditions, trump actually has permission from the law enforcement to not just punch, but to karate chop, kick, and sit on our dearest grandmothers. For the safety of all of our elderly companions, let’s fight back and please do not download. ❤️❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6178601927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"harry styles ✨","date":"2020-07-09T23:24:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BAD","review":"this is the worst app i’ve ever seen in my entire life. i had to download it and right after i did it gave me hives. i would not recommend this app to anyone and if you do like it... jail. ❤️ please never download this app✨ it’s so dumb ❤️ and there’s this guy who looks like an orange on my screen and i HATE IT 😔😔😔 get him off! gross anyways .... stream fine line by harry styles and walls by louis William tomlinson 🤪✨💅🏻"}},{"id":"6178582093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tay Tay Mama","date":"2020-07-09T23:16:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"Not only did this app take HOURS to download, but there were ads every time I pressed a button, and only in-app purchases. Also, the app design is bad, and whoever’s face is on the app wasnt the best model to use 🤭. Please reconsider starting over the whole app from scratch, actually just do us a favor and delete the app forever please. Thank you for reading this <3"}},{"id":"6178552539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"noomi863","date":"2020-07-09T23:05:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"If you get this you’re gonna regret it","review":"Hi when I downloaded this app I was first confused because I had no idea why a orange with a croissant on top of its head until a strange women who I think her name was Karen and she screamed at me telling me that it’s the president so I downloaded it because I would rather have the predator hunt me down with his thermo gear than deal with the real life president that’s 100x worst 🍊🍊🍊🍊"}},{"id":"6178527288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Hauntedapp123","date":"2020-07-09T22:55:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Beware the app is haunted!!!!!!","review":"The app is haunted! Right after I downloaded it I started to heard things falling from my kitchen. I thought nothing of it at first but other weird events occurred. Something truly terrifying was the dream I had the night I downloaded it, it was an orange Cheeto puff who jumped out of the Cheetos bag and chased after me telling to vote for him! You have been warned, download at your own risk!!!🤭🤭"}},{"id":"6178475121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im probably angry","date":"2020-07-09T22:34:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"i downloaded this app to show my appreciation to our loving and great president. first of all it took 17 hours just to DOWNLOAD and then when i opened it up, i don’t know if this is just a bug or something but it showed inappropriate ads. my child, makenediegh, saw the inappropriate ads as well.

However, when I opened the app it asked me for my credit card number so that i could pay the monthly fee of 100 dollars. Now as a broke boomer, i do not have 100 spare dollars a month. So i clicked out of the fee and then the app started swearing at me. Very loudly. My poor grandchildren!"}}]}
