When I opened the app I saw a picture of a scary orange monster and was immediately blinded. I had to get my sister to write this review because obviously I can’t type on my phone anymore.

Too many in-app purchases. Not to mention the app is created by bigots for bigots and really adds to the cult environment that his campaign runs on. He is a horrible person and president and the people that are rating this highly are just as horrible. Very bad app by bad people.","userName":"angelalala1618","title":"Very bad"}},{"id":"6172677618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:25:47Z","rating":1,"review":"trump is a stinky, racist, immature, child predator and big man baby. i truly don’t understand how anyone could support this horrible human being. donald trump is a white supremest. he has killed so many americans due to his horrid response it covid-19 (which he called the chine virus for absolutely no reason which is racist) and he says it’s nothing to worry about. well if it’s nothing to worry about then why does he have the most extensive security to make sure he doesn’t get it? he just doesn’t care about the american people and that’s a fact. trump is absolutely a horrific human being✨","userName":"caitlynjco","title":"if i could give it a zero star review i would ✨"}},{"id":"6172633608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:13:22Z","rating":1,"review":"I got the app but when I was downloading it took 3 hours to download.
