I can’t use it without it glitching and being kicked off of the app. It’s unusable. I don’t see it being fixed anytime soon either, it’s gone to the point where it’s unfixable. So difficult to use and disorganized.","userName":"Lilacbreeze","title":"An ACTUAL review"}},{"id":"6177774113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:32:57Z","review":"I downloaded the app because I am a full Trump supporter (Trump 2020) and it didn’t even load!!! All I got was a blank, black screen. If the app doesn’t even work then it shouldn’t be in the app store!! It needs to be taken down!! I will be complaining to Apple about this!!","userName":"56748377","title":"Horrible Experience"}},{"id":"6177744986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:24:12Z","review":"Got the app because I heard Donald’s nudes were on there. When I opened it Donald Trumps nudes were there but I couldn’t find what we call a dick?? I had to go on a whole scavenger hunt just to see a glimpse. I was promised a good size but I got this?? 0 out of 10. Disappointing. I feel so bad that Melania had to use THAT to have Barron😔","userName":"ugly.singeroli on tiktok","title":"🍤🍤🍤"}},{"id":"6177730951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:58Z","review":"I downloaded this app, hoping to gain some knowledge and information they put out but I am left with nightmares and my phone is now ✨traumatized✨I am left with a horrible taste in my mouth after viewing this app. Completely and utterly disappointed by this ✨cheeto✨ of a man.","userName":"gejjekwmwk","title":"horrendous app overall"}},{"id":"6177690655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:07:50Z","review":"This is the worst thing I have ever downloaded. I had to see the face of a dusty, old, expired, shriveled Cheeto. I hope no one ever has to go through seeing that terrible, horrific, and ugly Bunker Baby ever again. I really hope he doesn’t get re-elected. I hate the chubby Cheeto \nIf you’re reading this, goodbye from Generation Z.","userName":"C🤡l🤡o🤡w🤡n","title":"Trump is a clown"}},{"id":"6177683223","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:05:32Z","review":"This app is no good. Trump only cares about himself. Him banning TikTok is like him getting Twitter away from him. He doesn’t get it because he has a pathetic life where all he cares about is power, money, and woman with boobs and butts. It is horrific that he is our president. We should not be supporting him. This app represents him. Therefor, this app is terrible.","userName":"<3 fun games","title":"Bad"}},{"id":"6177639838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:51:36Z","review":"This app took very long to download and the app  glitched a lot and so i had tried multiple ways too make it stop and it never did, WORSE APP FROM THE WORST PRESIDENT. Then when  the app open I was greeted by an unpleasant picture of a Cheeto . I almost threw up. Then I had saw a toboggan girl and she kept in saying “hello” over and over again. THUS IS BY FAR FHE WORST APP IN TGE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAE","userName":"liaDS1211","title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6177624814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:45Z","review":"this app was absolutely awful. it made my phone crash multiple times and spammed me with things about trump trying to be re-elected. his ideas were so terrible to read and look at i became blind from the app!!!!!! this app doesn’t even deserve a one star review because of how atrocious it is. the minute u open it minions pop off and start singing the national anthem on full volume! after that it is continued with oompa loompas imposing petitions to help trump keep children locked in cages! this app is truly the worst app i have ever encountered.","userName":"trump id","title":"atrocious app"}},{"id":"6177617509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:44:25Z","review":"This whole app is just a waste of time. Apple needs to remove it from the apple store to make room for better applications. President Trump is one of the worst presidents in US History. Why give him his own app? The app also crashes my phone and even messes w my other apps.","userName":"Exclusive_Hunter","title":"Tragic Application"}},{"id":"6177598889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:38:29Z","review":"As soon as I opened the app they asked me for me personal information. I just wanted to keep up with trump, but no this app is bad and I would never recommend it to anyone. They even asked for my LOCATION which is even worse. I’m sorry to say this but the app is bad.","userName":"WFNV","title":"This app is horrible"}}]}
