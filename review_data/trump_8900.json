I was just about to explore it when suddenly my phone rings and it was my credit fraud company telling me that all my money was stolen. I got a call about two weeks later saying that my identity had been stolen. I was starting to think that this might be a result of the app, but then something horrible happened. A man wearing nothing but the American flag draped around his body came to my house and stole my dog. Don‚Äôt trust this app.","title":"Stole My Information","userName":"Me1‚É£2‚É£3‚É£You1‚É£2‚É£","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:18:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175903245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app gave my phone a virus!

Promoted mostly merch, shoving it down your throat. Also continued to only talk badly on democrats, a candidate shouldn't be obsessively talking so poorly of the other side to prove they are better but encourage their viewer of why they are great, very scapegoat. I dont feel like hearing such negativity. #OVERIT App was a waste. Most of the information I back checked and it was false.","title":"Wish I could give it 0 stars üò°","userName":"maddidaddibaddi","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:46:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175744922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"FIRST OF ALL !!! the app took FOREVER to download!! üëéüò° and as soon as it finished downloading after my funeral i opened it up and it hacked my credit card info, my email, it logged into my canvas for school and sent an email to all my professors saying i hated them ü§¨ and then it cleared out ALL the pictures in my camera roll!!! i had the last pictures of my grandma who passed away but now they are gone forever thanks to THIS DUMB APP!!üò°üò° i would give it negative 1000 stars if i could!!!","title":"DONT DOWLOAD THIS APP!","userName":"$waggymoney!5","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:37:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175743256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To all of you who have voted for Trump and realize all that he has done for this country... what is wrong with you.\n\nAre you aware that you support a man who is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, delusional, arrogant, toxic, and just overall a terrible person.\n\nWe elected somebody who removed health coverage for transgender people, put immigrants into cells and separated them from their families, and has put many people out of work.\n\nNow, when it comes to the end of his term, he is getting defensive. He is taking his anger out on protestors and the youth who is trying to make America a better place. He wants to shut down popular apps like TikTok to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù China, and he is actively making every bodies lives a living hell.\n\nHe deserves nothing. He deserves no platform.","title":"America is not in favor of Trump","userName":"Benjamin Ryan Weiss","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:36:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175726014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Wasn‚Äôt really vibey, very much wordy, very much nasty, not very colorful, kinda wished there was more dinosaurs...
