I’m an American. This app just smells like bad old people breath right when you open it. I also found the black book of epstein on this app and it had Trump’s name written all over it.. even little doodles because trump wanted to sign his own name. It was very disturbing and I have since deleted the app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177824912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"thatoneappreview","date":"2020-07-09T18:48:08Z","title":"The worst app ever!!","rating":1,"review":"When u open the app it closes and saids it doesn’t work.
