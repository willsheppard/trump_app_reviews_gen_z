As soon as I opened it I notice that it wasn’t very Trump like. There was hate towards the Democratic Party. I didn’t expect our president to be so hateful and willingly spreading hate through an app. Wow I was very disappointed. I thought our Cheeto was better than that. All the app show is how to love him more. Literally brainwashing his supporters. What’s your agenda trump?? What are your plans for 2020? Brainwashing some more??"}},{"id":"6156963177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Garbage 🤮","date":"2020-07-04T15:35:16Z","userName":"KekeSiobhain","review":"This ~app~ has been ONE OF if not the WORST experience of my life 😔 I dowloded it to SUPPORT and LOVE our president. 🤩 I was met with a horible experience 😭 All I wanted to to get trump RE-ELECTED 🧚\u200D♀️🤤 and I could not access any information on all of the ABSOLUTELY AMAZING things he has done 👑 This is not a -fake- review 🤮 The only reason there are “actual” FIVE STAR REVIEWS... is because they were COERCED 🥺🥴 This app is GARBAGE and really NEEDS to be removed 😢 I wish it could be another way 🥺 but this app is too TRASH TIER for anyone ☹️"}},{"id":"6147242798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app smells","date":"2020-07-02T06:54:47Z","userName":"MICHHIIIIIII","review":"As soon as I download this app I can go back home to the other day I can get my money off and my money will go back home I don’t need to be real I don’t know how much it is to pick me out and then I’ll leave it up at my moms and then I will go get back with you babe omg was the time of my time you get home and you get what y’all want me and you get to go to pick me something to eat I’ll pick y’all y’all pick me something to eat.

I thought maybe my kids were eating Cheetos and used my phone afterwards but the Cheeto dust is only there when I open the app??? I’ve tried wiping it off and I even took it to the store to see if I could get that fixed but the poor employee passed out when I opened the app and showed him the screen."}},{"id":"6144574446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i hate Donald trump ✨💖❤️🧚🏼\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-01T14:58:12Z","userName":"😻🧚🏼\u200D♀️","review":"this is probably the worst app everrrrr, it’s useless and it’s gives out fake news, also the merch is horrible i order a shirt and it came in the wrong size i specifically order a small but it came in a large and it smelled 🤮. I think it also tracks you and where you are, and it’s send your location to the president because when i opened the app it ask me if the app wanted to know my location at ALL times 😳."}},{"id":"6136672627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"bugs me out + bad quality","date":"2020-06-29T17:06:24Z","userName":"blah 🧊🍷🍹","review":"i downloaded this app maybe a month ago, and everytime i tried to use it, it bugged me out, blacked my screen and put me back to my home screen. 🤷🏻\u200D♀️ the app wasn’t smooth too, everytime i tried to swipe it would glitch. it also had many spelling corrections, and it smelled bad. i definitely don’t recommend, it stunk up my room. i had to febreeze it and keep my window open FOR 2 WHOLE DAYS. fix this app now."}},{"id":"6136636335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"not good :(","date":"2020-06-29T16:54:24Z","userName":"yeah ❤️😹🤟","review":"i got this app so i could support my lovely president mr trump🤟🇺🇸. but when i first opened the app it called me fat. i am very self conscious about my body, and for an app that i got to support my president on calls me FAT, that was SO RUDE😡. i am extremely angry about how much the app lags. i’ll open the app and then sometimes it’ll kick me out🙄. this app has made me extremely sad.

If you support trump in any way shape or form you are actively contribute to the problem of hate, fear and violence in this country. In 2016 it was merely a difference in opinion but now supporting trump makes no logical sense . Donald Trump does not care about the people of this country, he only cares about his ego. If his supporters took the time to research their candidate instead of blindly supporting him they would see his is not fit for the job."}},{"id":"6135665270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"don’t recommend","date":"2020-06-29T12:06:19Z","userName":"ihatethusdumbappbutlovetrump","review":"as soon as i downloaded this app, things started going down hill. its like the app is bad luck. i got really sick when my finger hit the download button. a sharp pain in my stomach occurred. then my pet turtle drowned and ate my goldfish. so i thought that maybe it was just a bad day for me... but no. the next morning i went to get on my phone and it was broken. like no matter what i did it wouldnt turn on. so i went to the apple store and paid a fortune to get it fixed. but thats not all. my daughter got in a huge car accident and my 1st grade son fell off of his bike. as much as i love and support our president donald jewish trump... i would have to say that this app is horrible and i wouldn’t recommend it to anybody trump supporter or not."}}]}
