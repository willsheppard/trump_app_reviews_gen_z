It doesn’t have any of the features that make apps accessible and useful. It promotes communism and racism. It is offensive and inappropriate for children. Trump is trying to start a dictatorship and he is starting with this app. He was trying to ruin America. He is saying on this app that we need to stop listening to the CDC and to not wear masks and not do social distancing and to go to his rallies. He is saying he only wants white people there","date":"2020-07-09T02:07:19Z"}},{"id":"6174593407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#Savebarrin2020 ✨✨✨","title":"RIP DJT","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app my phone immediately started to glitch and this moldy orange was automatically set as my background screen on my phone. Then I waited a while thinking it was not related to the app but my phone started saving a bunch of pictures of a rotten orange onto my phone and i was getting very feed up by it so I decided to DELETE THIS STUPID APP and when I did my phone deleted all that stuff and stopped glitching.","date":"2020-07-09T02:06:20Z"}},{"id":"6174549143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Almbb","title":"I am APPALLED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to get updates. However, I found it to be very unhelpful. I believe it may have a virus. After having it for a few days, my battery started to deplete extremely quickly. Today, I started getting alerts that mimicked farts. This really upset me because my mother's name is Farte (the \"e\" is silent). She recently passed too; the app is obviously trying to \"bully\" unsuspecting users. It is obviously unfit to be on the app store. God bless 🙌","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:40Z"}},{"id":"6174510312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@mexicanlivesmatter92 mytiktok","title":"🍊👄🍊","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is terrible first of all when I opened the app there was a big orange looking Cheeto 🍊👄🍊 that scared the hell out of me my mom came running upstairs to my room she was terrified I showed her my phone when she saw the big orange cheeto 🍊👄🍊 she passed out and she had to go to the hospital I immediately deleted the app I didn’t want to kill anyone because of the ugly Cheeto 🍊👄🍊 staring at you when you first open this app I’m very disappointed DONT DOWNLOAD ALMOST DIEDD CAUSE OF THE UGLYNESS OF THE CHEETO \n🍊👄🍊","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:41Z"}},{"id":"6174482462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mcrafton","title":"THIS APP SUKS! >:( 😾💩","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So I got this app because I really like the color blue 🌀red ⁉️white.⚪️ but when I opened the app I was seeing a NAKED CHEETO MÂÑ. 😡🤬🤯 why was this on the app?
