First, there is no way to give via cash.  Second, it requested a direct, weekly contribution from my Apple Pay account with a minimal sum of $100/week.  I tried to back out, but it marched through the setup and automatically charged the first 13 weeks in advance.  I am a supporter, but I have been out of work since April and my wife is in the hospital with what they say is COVID (it’s not, COVID is fake news).  I went through their customer support and spoke to Roy from Texas (he had a funny accent, but said it was a West Texas accent).  He requested my bank account number and online user ID and password and promised to straighten it all out.  All the App has done since is request contributions and provide links to Tucker Carlson clips on YouTube.  I also just found out my bank account is overdrawn.  I called customer service again and talked to Mary in Indiana who happens to have the same West Texas accent as Roy.  I just got the run around from her and she said she needed my SSN and a credit card number.  I have deleted the app as I now suspect Mary is actually in Texas and this App may be a scam by illegal aliens living in south Texas"}},{"id":"6178726675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:12:57Z","title":"Horrible app","userName":"Vikkijrad","review":"I tried downloading this app to support the President, but as much as I’d like to give it a good review, I simply cannot. This app took 27 hours to download and used a 3rd of the storage available on my phone. That’s outrageous. Signing up was very difficult and confusing. The graphic design did not help with this. The entire app is so unorganized. I had to give this app my mobile number, which I thought would be alright. But within an hour of entering my number, I started receiving so many random phone calls. The app uses my location as well, so many of the calls I got had my own area code displayed so I figured they might be important. When I pick up it’s usually someone of foreign descent and not speaking English. Other calls were shown to be from out of the country. Of course of gotten some calls like these in the past, but never like this. I’ve received 23 calls like this within the first hour of having the app on my phone. The app itself is not worth downloading, and I wouldn’t trust it to be safe, either."}},{"id":"6178723022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:11:36Z","title":"trash✨🧚🏼","userName":"𝒎𝒓.𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒕🍊=🤮","review":"I don’t understand why people would want this app nor do I understand why people like mr.orange.
