I am always on the go and trying to get news at the same time. Sadly, this app took DECADES to download and when it finally did? My phone crashed and I had to plug it back in to get it to turn on again. There is also glitches when you try and add your mobile phone number to sign up and I am ALREADY signed up for the trump texts. Still supporting just definitely not with this app anymore #deleted","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lewfit","date":"2020-07-10T04:44:38Z"}},{"id":"6179480659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad","review":"Bad","isEdited":false,"userName":"bad1234512","date":"2020-07-10T04:44:38Z"}},{"id":"6179480559","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"don’t download","review":"It's Wen and I'm heaven-sent Use it like a veteran Renegade, lemonade, music is my medicine Go ahead and try to name a band we ain't better than Reason why the whole world's picking us instead of them People need a breather cause they're feeling the adrenaline Stop!
