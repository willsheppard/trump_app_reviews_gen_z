The neon orange hue radiating off of the creature in question literally burnt new holes into my eyes and now I’m seeing quadruples of the chubby Cheeto everywhere I go. Triggered. I fully intend on suing. 10/10 would NOT recommend unless you enjoy the feeling of drinking wet cement mixed with broken glass and kitten tears and the impending fatalities associated with such ludicrous activities.","userName":"sadkittenbabies2020","title":"It made my newborn kittens cry blood","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:02:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174165519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is absolutely DISGUSTING! i’ve been looking forward to getting it for a long time now but as soon as it downloads i’m FORCED to see a absurd photo of mr racist cheeto man. i might have to wash out my eyes just to get the putrid look of his homophobic lowlife skin away!! i am an ANGRY customer and will not hesitate to write multiple reviews and get MANY MORE to see what a DISGRACE this app is.\nPLEASE TAKE IT DOWN SO OUR LIVES WILL NOT BE BURDENED WITH ITS PRESENCE ANY LONGER!!","userName":"GenzWillDestroyYou","title":"DISAPPOINTED!!!

Now I’m stuck using my old iPhone that I just upgraded from because this app ruined my new one. It’s bugged for sure. Don’t get this app unless you are wanting a broken phone 🤷\u200D♀️","userName":"🖤Mallory🖤","title":"KILLED MY IPHONE🤬","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:38:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174115861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, i opened this app to an orange man. It was very terrifying, it gave me serious PTSD. By signing up for this app, it took my information and sent me smelly socks through the mail. Do not trust this app, my pet pig ended up dying because it got into the smelly socks, sent to me due to this app. My elephant ate my gorilla. It instantly grew to the size of a giraffe, the giraffe got stuck in my microwave. Dont bother with this app.","userName":"my poor pet giraffe","title":"!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:31:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174102347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support and receive news about Mr. President, who i love very so much. But upon opening it i was greeted with a very scary picture of Donald trump cheeto man holding his fist up at me???? I mean I know he doesn’t like black people or any minority or women because he’s racist and a fat ugly misogynistic white supremacist but trying to attack me for just downloading his app??,?,, disgusting and heartbreaking :((//","userName":"SensitiveChestRaisin","title":"Wayyy to scary and offensive !!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:26:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174114884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t even know how to explain how bad this app is... the mechanics of the app are just terrible. Almost like a third grader who knew how to app design made it. Not only that my beautiful eyes were graced with a horrible sight when I opened the app... A toddler painted orange getting the paint all over our great american flag.","userName":"SkylerParker","title":"Truly the worst app I’ve ever had","rating":2,"date":"2020-07-08T23:30:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174096782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app screams, “I oppose every opinion other than my own irrelevant, so I have to go on a app that filters out all other news and is extremely bias so I can keep a base of supporters from leaving me.” Reminds me of a dystopian government from that book, ‘1984’. Not saying that our government isn’t corrupt. The graphics are rather ok, it’s a shame they’re used on an app like this.","userName":"Ellah M.","title":"Unusable","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:24:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174095897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and upon opening I saw nothing but catalog pictures of an orange bunker boy. These pictures made me so physically sick I had to be rushed to the er. The doctors asked what had made me so sick and I showed them the pictures and they all had fat strokes and died. Since no one was able to take care of me I am now dead. It was in my will to have this review published.","userName":"ABC!!!Def!!!456","title":"Absolutely Horriying","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:23:54Z","isEdited":false}}]}
