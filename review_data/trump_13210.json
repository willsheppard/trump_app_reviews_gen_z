I’ve never had experience with vermin until downloading this app. after the mice incident, my family got tested for COVID-19. WE ALL HAD IT. idk if this is a setup, but this app is the worst app in the App Store and deserves to be taken down.","userName":"dbdbzbjsbd","title":"disgusting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:26:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173770982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was super excited to get this app up and going, until that same night when I tried to have coitus with my girl. It was right then and there where the universe came to me and explained how my virginity had returned and that technically I was no longer a NON-VIRGIN. It had come back to me and my girl immediately left knowing that I had not had my first time once again.

Second, this app is giving me severe diarrhea and vomiting issues. Third, I have arachnophobia (fear of spiders) and this app has made me even more afraid than I already was of spiders. Fourth, I have experienced MULTIPLE glitches in its algorithm and it is super annoying. Finally fifth, the app tried to shoot nerf bullets at me and they hurt.😫","userName":"csfjotchiogds","title":"I hate this app with all my gut.
