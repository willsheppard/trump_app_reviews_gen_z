When I first opened the app I saw “Keep America Great” um honey I don’t know how to tell you but Amerikkka is far from great. The literal child in office with the label of President is very immature and scary. I had a nightmare last night and the big cheeto man was in it.I woke up crying.  I’m sure you can understand my fear. The cheeto man in office only exhibits clown behavior. Please pray for America. Very ghetto do not recommend.

THIS APP STOLE MY IDENTITY. it took a process of six months to get all or privacy regained. and there was a jump scare when i first opened the app which caused me to throw my phone which is now broken. i do not recommend. just awful"}},{"id":"6173993341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fairy queen 🧚\u200D♀️🥰✨🧚\u200D♂️","title":"🧚\u200D♂️✨🥰🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:45Z","review":"I downloaded this app and was immediately met with a comment telling me I’m fat and ugly. I then heard my doorbell ring  and it was Cheeto himself, he punched me in the face and yelled a series of slurs at me. The smell from his breathe made made me go into cardiac arrest and I go to the hospital where they told me I was dying. The disease that sent me into cardiac arrest is very contagious and it has spread to the rest of my family, very sad would not recommend"}},{"id":"6173942637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"5ammmmmmmmm","title":"it gave me chronic illness","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:26:34Z","review":"first of all, the app is an absolute disappointment. i downloaded it to support the great Cheeto lookin racist president and what do i get. A lousy app that gave me illness....mental illness that is. trump 2020 is all i get when i open the app. It has many errors like the spread of false information and the idolization of a horrific US leader. i’m just concerned for others in the community. i don’t want the mental illness to spread"}},{"id":"6173923548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨Space Demon✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:19:32Z","review":"FIRST OFF when i opened the app there was an over cooked chicken starring back at me and i was so horrified i had younger children around me and instantly had to cover there eyes. Secondly the app promotes making this country “great again” but i believe that’s false advertisement seeing that The USA was never great in the first place. Don’t download this app i hope apple deletes this app it’s a literal waste of space."}},{"id":"6173900794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Naye Ari","title":"dump this cheeto✨😝💕","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:11:12Z","review":"it took over 3 days just to get the app, then once i open it my phone froze and kim jon un appeared and was telling to go walk my fish🐠.(only good thing about the app) then i sign in....and I GET A TEXT MESSAGE FROM MELANIA telling me to help her escape 😧. a bunch of viruses then popped up and most of them said “trump 2020 on a grave stone ✨💖💅🏽”. so basically yeah that’s my life threatening experience of downloading the app😁😹✨😻💕\n\ntrump 2020 on a grave stone 😘"}},{"id":"6173871456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jovi10","title":"Didnt like it at all.

When it is not crashing immediately after opening, it is making every app on my phone run slower. On the occasion that it actually opens, it tries to tell me about how superior i am for being a white man, stroking my ego until i actually believe every word that comes out of the president’s bug ridden mouth."}},{"id":"6173840346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","title":"This app ruined my life","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:48:43Z","review":"This app was making my phone glitch so, that day I took it to the phone repair store and they said my phone got 100% shocked.
