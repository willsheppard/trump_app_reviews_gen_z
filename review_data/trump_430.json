I wanted facts, but I got the opposite. I also don’t appreciate that the first thing I saw was a known child predator. There was so much hate speech there. I honestly don’t get the design of the app. My sister and I were going through the app, but she immediately passed out. I brought this up with my therapist and even she couldn’t figure out why I had reoccurring nightmares consisting of a Cheeto man. I feel personally attacked. My grandmas name is Karen, I won’t be shocked if she calls whoever runs this monstrosity of an app. I threw up on myself too. Even Siri couldn’t handle what the hell was happening. She literally crashed my phone. I feel like she was looking after me. That wasn’t the worst part. When I went upstairs to get some food (as one would) I smelled something citrus-y. There were oranges all around my kitchen and open bags of Cheetos all around. I was so scared! This app gave me serious trauma. I’m just trying to look out for my people. Don’t get this app. Developers, if you are reading this... please... for the love of god... do the right thing and take it down.","date":"2020-07-08T23:59:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173845316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wolfgangtakeshi","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"Worst app in the world. It took years to download and when I tried to launch it my phone powered down and a spinning circle popped up like someone was hacking it. Maybe the democrats figured out a way to take over apps too. I can’t believe this happened all my personal info is now spread all over the interface. What a horrible horrible app. Do not download. \n\nUpdate: all my photos have been deleted and I’ve been logged out of Facebook. None of my apps are working or opening and I can’t delete them to redownload. My phone keeps making weird noise too, at one point I thought I heard a voice. I can’t believe trump would allow his perfect followers to be deceived and mistreated. I am very upset. My heart is beating out of my chest. I’m surprised my phone even let me get on the App Store to let me type this review. Please do not download for the sake of your privacy, my sister said all my private photos were spread across google and Facebook. I’m devastated. \n\nThis only happened after I finished downloading the app and trying to open it. Please be careful when downloading.","date":"2020-07-08T21:50:40Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173763779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Remy Stuart Little Jr.","isEdited":false,"title":"My parents are getting divorced! 😔","review":"After Trump got elected, my dad hasn’t been the same ever since. My mom and I are started to get worried because he developed an addiction to his phone. One day, after coming home from school, I found my mom crying in the kitchen. She said, “I think your dad is cheating on me?!?” I was in shock honey, In tears almost. She said that the night before his phone kept on ringing and buzzing, non-stop!. He got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, and she used that time to snoop through his phone. She said he got another notification that read, “We’ve been through so much these past four years...they’ve been plotting against me from the very beginning...I know I can count on you!!” She confronted him the next  morning before work, he said, “I can explain, it’s not what you think! Trust Me!!” But my mom wasn’t buying it...he tried to blamed it on the Trump App, saying that it kept on spamming his phone with notifications, but it was too late. My parents got divorced and my dad lost full custody of me. so maybe tone it down on the notifications...","date":"2020-07-08T21:19:36Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173571499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Daveli love","isEdited":false,"title":"Omg I can’t believe he did this","review":"Yk I was trying to show my support for our Cheeto 🥰but when I downloaded this app a bunch of oranges popped up on my screen 🥺 and yk I normally like oranges and that’s why I didn’t vote for trump👁👄👁 but this is just to far. how do I rate this 0stars instead of one 😔🤚 and Ik you white straight “men” and “women” will be mad at me but I’m sorry I like to live😘 well kinda🙂 anyways I was minding my business using this app to support my Cheeto 🤩when all of a sudden I see my mom twerking to his speech 😋 and yk me I had to join in on that 🤪 and now she yelled at me saying I’m a disgrace to the family 😭 like it’s not my fault I can throw it back farther than you 😖 so in conclusion this app is the reason why I’m a disgrace to the family and (I would love if you download a vpn to change your location so we can still talk about this subject on tiktok🥳) and a vote for trump is taking away human rights from womxn, latinx, African Americans, Muslims, the lgbtq+ community and so much more 🥺.

And now my dog is in a full body cast and I cannot stop sneezing 🤧 so after all of that happened I the app decided to take its time to ask if it could send notifications!! It had the audacity to ask 😡 and let’s not mention the rat under my bed trying to eat my dogs cast 😢 and the loose centipedes and millipedes in my room 🦅and the ostrich!!!  Do not recommend this app. Will leave you with contagious sneezing which may be a sign of covid-19 and will leave your dog in a cast 🦅 I’m very disappointed 😔 I just wanted to have the app my wonderful president created which would be a complete shame if it was banned from the App Store 😒 I installed it 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💖 on my way to burn my phone 💫💕.  \n\nno❤️","date":"2020-07-08T18:57:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173280713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ohkiki","isEdited":false,"title":"👍🏼Wanted to Like it👎🏼","review":"I thought the app would be a great way to troll Trump’s re-election campaign. You know, register for free tickets to inflate the numbers. It asked for all sorts of personal information to register and before I was done something popped up on the screen and told me I could no longer use the app because I was a “liberal chump.” I’m a registered nonpartisan so I was confused. Tried again and another message popped up that said I needed to take my “American hating pansy-ass” home. I was home. Finally, the app seemed to glitch and then told me ICE was on the way to “detain me.” I’m white, and an American citizen. I was worried for a little while but no one showed up. I guess it was just another lie from Trump to scare me into submission. I woke up the next morning and wasn’t feeling well. A few days later I finally got tested and it turns out, I have COVID-19. I’m not saying the app gave me the virus, but I also have no proof that the app didn’t give me the virus. I highly recommend you troll the Trump campaign through their website/social media platforms so as to avoid ICE detainment and the coronavirus.","date":"2020-07-08T18:31:18Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173194361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"unique_fire_dancers","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is crazy","review":"When I got the app I was reading the terms and conditions and what the app does and I seen that they will use your location at all times no matter if your on the app or not and then send you voice memos to your phone when they can just put it on the app and ever time I go to the app it says your phone can not access this app right now FOR NO REASON AT ALL !!!!!! And my WiFi if fine and my cellular data is fine so I don’t under stand why it doesn’t work but I still get messages from the app and my location is still available to them because like I said they app can access your location when you are in and off the app to me that’s creepy why do you need our location what the president is going to come to your house and have a cup of tea with or is he gonna come and tell you something because you disagreed with this is pathetic and he supposed to be our president not our enemy bout now it’s war between the believers and the none believers this means war DONALD JOHN TRUMP !!!!

It took DAYS to download and WEEKS to even open the app. Once I opened it, it made a disgusting noise. Not to mention the 🍊 who decided it would be a good idea to keep this app on the store!! It took up all my data and I only have 1 other app and only 100 photos! I knew instantly that I had to delete it but I obviously had to tell everyone to not get this app. Get a credible news source instead. This app is horrible and must be taken off the App Store because all it does is try and break/hack your phone. I almost forgot to talk about that! I started getting hacked and random numbers started contacting ever since I downloaded it. They wouldn’t stop and they are still calling me! I do not know how to stop this because I deleted the app many times but it keeps coming back. I cannot get rid of it so if you think you WANT no data on your phone for the rest of your life then download it. Just keep in mind that it is horrible and just ruined my day","date":"2020-07-08T17:05:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172482431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"not a liberal snowflake","isEdited":false,"title":"facism","review":"This app is the worst app Ive ever downloaded in my life!! First when it downloaded it deleted the rest of my apps. Then it took over my phone and started yelling racist and homophobic slurs at my girlfriend and I! The slurs started sounding like a chant and then all of a sudden, dead bodies started rising from the ground around my house and THEN THEY STARTED DANCING to the chants. It was wild. \n\nFurthermore, the app has MAD glitches. I opened the app and it linked me directly to a spam video of Donald Tr*mp talking about having sex with minors! I couldn’t believe it. Then Jefferey Epstein showed up the vid and started making out with Tr*mp because we all know what went down on that island between all those middle aged men. ANYWAY back to the app, it also crashed every single time I tried to donate all my money to Tr*p’s campaign!!! I wanna give him all my money so that we can keep up these ICE detention camps! Wait I meant build a wall. Wait I meant support nazi Germany making a reappearance in the United States. Wait I meant...\nOh\nAnyway WORST APP EVER DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! It would be SUPER sad if people downloaded it just to write a bad review... so unfortunate.","date":"2020-07-08T14:31:12Z","rating":1}}]}
