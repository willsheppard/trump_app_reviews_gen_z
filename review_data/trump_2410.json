I like my privacy as much as the next person so this is just sickening! I stand by my President through and through, but having my privacy be invaded, spreading a virus 🦠 (which could have been fixed with the right people), and spreading false codes will not be tolerated! However, once I was able to get into the app I was disappointed to not see anything about the BLM movement or the LGBTQ+ community. But I was able to see the latest cages being used for children and families, Supremacy clubs (how fun!), and ways to be the worst individual possible (I think my dead beat dad will enjoy that part the most!) Overall, PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! ✨🌟🌺🧚🏼\u200D♂️❤️✨⭐️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🌟","title":"⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD⚠️","userName":"Karen Krystal Klemensin","date":"2020-07-08T16:47:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172941120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app so I could possibly find reasons to like Trump a little better but I didn’t really find any besides he’s racist he is keeping Mexican people out of America separating family’s and child trafficking children. I have never liked trump but sense he’s most likely gonna be our president I just wanted to see if he was actually a good person but... he’s not. \n\nNow we can’t forget when I downloaded this app is kept on glitching on me for no reason it kept saying my phone number was invalid which is a little weird. Right when I opened this app I seen “keep America great” we all know when Trump says that he really means “make America white again” dang trump is such a white supremacy.\n\n In stead of putting “keep America great” he should of put something to involved involve black lives you know to help out the cause that’s happing right now in America sense he’s such a rich man. This app is just horrible just every time I’m on it, it always does something weird. I know so many others agree with me I bet they had the same thoughts and thing happen to them. \n\nPsa I will never download this app again and you shouldn’t ether.","title":"Worst app","userName":"yahhhhhuhuhyh","date":"2020-07-08T16:43:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172880677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For starters as soon as I downloaded the app which took 4 hours too start with. It just disappeared off my home screen. Which is so weird I’ve never had a app that’s done that before. But I will say I’m pretty great full that it disappeared. The app was just so glitchy I couldn’t even open the app. While trying to open the app for 2 hours I wasn’t paying attention to my pet elephant. He ended up getting out and I can’t seem to find him anywhere. And after 6 hours of trying to get this all too work. I lost my elephant Ralph my ostrich Jimmy and my pet  turtle Susan. I 100% regret even thinking about getting this app. Don’t recommend anyone to download this app unless, they want to go through the same devastating pain of losing your dearest family members.","title":"Terrible","userName":"sishdbd","date":"2020-07-08T16:24:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172726901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Personally I don’t like this app. It took to long to download for a stupid app that just lagged a whole bunch, and showed way to many adds. I just got new wifi and it works perfectly fine but this app is the problem. It makes my phone glitch and it pops up random adds everywhere. I have to say that it hasn’t helped me at all. It just makes me realize that the president is not good at all. He won’t be good for 2020. The only good thing if he gets it is that he will never be able to run again after the eight years. But, no one should want him for another four years. He has done countless horrible things for thing country. We almost had WW|||. I personally DON’T want to go through that. I don’t think that anyone wants to go through that.","title":"To long not fun.","userName":"to long.","date":"2020-07-08T15:39:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177737274","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is THE WORST app i have ever used in my life. If i could, i would rate it 0 stars and i don’t recommend this app to ANYONE. I was excited to see what the app was about and i am truly disappointed by it. I kept getting spammed and the app isn’t useful at all. It keeps crashing every time i open it up and none of this information is helping me at all and i honestly wish i didn’t waste my time getting this pointless app. This app has made me decide to vote blue because if trump isn’t able to run an app smoothly, how is he expected to run the country “smoothly” for 4 more years? Worst president in U.S history and i hope you don’t get re-elected. Hope you have a horrible day and that the app stores takes this app down because it’s horrible.","title":"HORRIBLE APP","userName":"Starting164","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177542405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is very terrible. it glitches all the time, and i’m not even updated on everything. it’s not showing me all the things my big bad great president has said. like the fact that the protestors are thugs, and how horrible gen z is (which is totally true). i just wish this app had a more personal outlook of trumps life! i wanna know EVERYTHING and it’s just telling me about campaigns which i cant go too. overall this app is very trash and horrible and gave me a headache trying to navigate and i would definitely not recommend getting this app unless you want your phone to start glitching and acting dumb. i would recommend everyone to go to twitter and see what our orange of a president with the worse case of twitter fingers ever has to say on that app!","title":"😍🔪","userName":"y4assy","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177467875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was the worst. Not only did it take 3 days to download, it asked me for an age agreement. Now, do we think that a president who is supposed to be an influencer and positive person in our country should have an age restriction on THEIR app? I don’t think that it’s appropriate. But have you also seen how he talks about his children, “if she wasn’t my daughter I’d bang her”. That’s just, wow. And for every Trump supporter, you can’t belittle the fact that he is LITERALLY a RAPIST AND MOLESTER. There are so many things that lead to this. He did nothing about corona until 100s Of 1000s of people were dying. If he just listened, he would’ve avoided this whole mess, and we’d probably be okay now. \n\nAll in all, this app helps a child molester and rapist and the worst person to run our country. Thank you.","title":"welp","userName":"Barron Trump aka his favorite","date":"2020-07-09T16:57:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177342990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I love trump and all he does. So when I downloaded the app I thought I would get as good of service. But when I opened it child porn pop ups flooded my screen and my other apps. I don’t know if Trump knew of this like he did with Jeffry Epstein but it almost broke my phone. After I went to the Apple store to wipe my phone clean of intense child porn endorsed by Trump I found nothing but more problems. My notes and social media were filled with homophobic and racist tweets from his app. I only follow Trump because I agree with his values like LGBT people should burn and that whites are superior so I was happy about that. But the sheer amount flooding my phone causes it to crash quicker that the child porn that Trump loves! Anyways this app speed and hate and child porn.

As soon as I got on the app, the national anthem started blasting on all of my devices. I tried to mute it, but it wouldn’t mute. This resulted in me getting hit by a tsinela (translation: slipper). So that already gets a one star in my book. It also cut off my WiFi for a good ten minutes. Like, what app does that? And don’t get me started with my DRAWINGS coming to life! I mean, it was cool, but so annoying. And thanks to THIS app, I had to delete my drawings in order to Thanos snap the drawings. Also, it required me to send a picture of me, as I put my gender as “Female”. This is completely not needed. I have way more to rant about this app, but I’m too lazy to do that. Overall, HORRIBLE APP 🤮🤮","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE 😤😖🤮","userName":"Xendriyana1011","date":"2020-07-09T12:45:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
