It kept requesting for my location and it‚Äôs pointless. You receive spam calls. If I could give it a 0 star rating I would. Also trump has such a big mouth and post everything he wants to on Instagram why does he need his own app? 0/5 would NOT recommend","rating":1}},{"id":"6173486220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:41:18Z","title":"it took ALL my information and now im getting random phonecalls from around the world","userName":"NO SPCEEE","review":"I downloaded the app filled in my info and now i getting RANDOM phone calls from around the world this app also almost killed me it sent someone to my house and i had to call the cops bc they had a gun this app is also useless and takes up to much space","rating":1}},{"id":"6173480409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:17Z","title":"My name is Karen.","userName":"[{#]","review":"This app is a joke. It took sixth weeks to download and I wasted a yuge amount of my time. While waiting, I began to turn orange and my skin turned into a Cheeto. On top of that, my hair resembled corn and I am not happy about that. I would like to talk to the app creators lawyer because this is not acceptable. As a polished white woman who gets my way no matter what, I am upset with this app as well as its influencers. Unacceptable.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173469486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:33Z","title":"UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE","userName":"trumpcankissmypinkass","review":"So I was walking in Washington today, then I saw that big fat disgusting orange of a man in a limousine as long as his insecurities and this man had THE AUDACITY to walk up to me and TELL ME, as a Muslim woman, to take off my hijab as it makes me look like an EGG i have NEVER been so ASHAMED to walk in public with a hijab on and you know what I did ? \nI told him that a man that looks as ugly as he is should NOT be shaming beautiful women as he looks like a rotten orange","rating":1}},{"id":"6173467980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:02Z","title":"NO STARS","userName":"nickname._.create","review":"If I could put zero stars I would.
