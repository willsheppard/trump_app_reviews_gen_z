Soon afterwards that was all I could see, big fat Cheeto rats. This really traumatized me and I had to go to a mental hospital😔. I can still hear the Karens yelling 🗣and the scurrying of the fat Cheeto rat. I do not recommend this app unless you want crippling depression and trauma.","userName":"✨NiGgWoRd✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174039969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:13Z","title":"Zero stars","review":"If it were possible I would give this app zero stars. First off when I opened the app it would NOT let me do anything like the whole thing was frozen. I tried OVER AND OVER to get it to get it to work but nothing did!

TikTok is the only point of our existence, without it we will become a force worse than you could imagine; ruining your app and rally are just us warming up. You really don’t want to mess with such a huge part of the population. Oh and the app’s bad.🥰😌😙🧚\u200D♀️🧚🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"miavfecher05","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174032268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:00:21Z","title":"❌❌❌Very terrible❌❌❌","review":"I gave this app a 1/5 stars, I was just scrolling through, looking for games to play and this one had a Cheeto on the front cover and stars so I thought it would be like super Mario.
