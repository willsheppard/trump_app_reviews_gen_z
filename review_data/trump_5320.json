But when I opened the app I heard a weird noise in my kitchen. It was a very big orange eating ALL MY food 😡. I pulled his hair but it was actually a wig 😳. He then attacked me w/ his big hideous stomach 😭, AND THEN he called his hideous family and I saw Barron, and his wife I was going to save them from that alive orange but he called his crew in and I went running to my room. I deleted the app and I was safe and it was all gone 🤠. So I am good. Plsss don’t get this app if you want to live another day. Who knows what he will do next.

He refuses to reform the police and calls blacks people fighting for equal rights “thugs.” Trump should not be re-elected what’s so ever. Conservatives who view this man as a saint need to re-evaluate what their purpose is or where their info is coming from.\n\nTrump has screwed the LGBTQ+ members time and time again. He has belittled minorities like African Americans and Hispanics, mainly Mexicans, and has kids and adults trapped in cages. \n\nFurthermore this is the worst president in history and he should not be re-elected.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karly See","date":"2020-07-08T16:06:45Z"}},{"id":"6172458112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app almost killed me 💀","rating":1,"review":"I clicked the download so I could learn more My president and trump broke into my house and said “give me five stars ⭐️ now” I was so sacred 😱😭 he told me not speak and give him five stars ⭐️ and he hired a swordsmen. The swordsmen said “ Do what the boss man says now” and his voice was kind of cracking. So I just wasn’t threatened by him. He just wasn’t scary any more. 😒🥱 and I was getting tried  so I said. “I will give u the rating ur majesty” he said “hmm” then left. I deleted the app and gave it MY rating. I did not lie to the president After all I told him I’d give him my review. That was the worst experience of my life.

The images of this “Trump” character are so graphic and disgusting! As soon as you open this app a horrific image of a something holding up a fist pops up and threatens you. I was scrolling through it with my little cousin sitting next to me and she cried when she saw this orange gremlin! This gremlin is notorious for raping innocent children and is very racist towards people of color. This image has given her nightmares since, I highly suggest that this application be taken off of the App Store to spare other people from experiencing this trauma as well. All fruits matter! except for oranges 🧡✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jforjeniusclown","date":"2020-07-08T11:05:44Z"}},{"id":"6169389803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cancelled🙄😭😳","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app 🍎to support my country😁But when I got it there were squirrels running on my screen 🐿 and they diagnosed me with cancer?!?

I was so thrilled to finally be following him blindly with no correct or feasible decent explanation as millions of Americans do! But :( as soon as I opened the app my retinas were seared with a bright white light and my eyeballs were steadily chopped in half. I am now permanently blind and incredibly upset!!! I expected better!! Truly disgusting I even had my brightness all the way down. The sheer stupidity from this app was so bright and blinding I guarantee you it’s visible from mars!

I was greeted by a disgusting looking man wearing a toupee. Now, there’s nothing wrong with a toupee, but it was horribly laid and looked like a birds nest. After seeing this, I closed the app and decided to take app, seeing as though I’d been traumatized enough for the day. In the middle of my nap, i had a strange nightmare about a human sized cheeto puff(frightening, I know!)that was controlling our precious country! I don’t think anybody should download this app unless you enjoy having scary dreams involving human sized cheeto puffs ruling the world.","isEdited":false,"userName":"drueeeeeeee","date":"2020-07-02T01:25:51Z"}},{"id":"6145270485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"💫Oh, to see without my eyes 👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"Yeah I don’t even have a phone 📱.
