UNBELIEVABLE. If trump can’t properly take care of his app how will he take care of our country?!? DELETE THIS APP!!! He tells you fake news to gain your vote in the upcoming elections. i mean he does just fine being a rapist, racist, and white supremacist so you’d think the LEAST he could do is run a decent app😾Not to mention when my grandpa opened the app it GLITCHED and he had a heart attack and DIED!!! how many more lives will this app take before it’s taken down???😾","date":"2020-07-09T02:41:49Z","userName":"Hannah22puppy"}},{"id":"6174671095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So, I downloaded this app to keep up on my DEFINITELY not racist Oompa Loompa, I meant President, sorry my phone has been doing that ever since I downloaded the app. Anyways I got the app and it was super glitchy which made me really sad cuz I wanted to see what trump said to embarrass himself this time so I carried myself to sleep and woke up and my fish was dead😭 not saying this app killed my fish, it was just really sad. 🧚\u200D♀️✨rip Steve✨🧚\u200D♀️Anyways don’t download it ever since I got this app I keep getting porn videos sent to my number of trump and his pillow and I’m disgusted.","date":"2020-07-09T02:28:23Z","userName":"roeirielskdueuwiwo"}},{"id":"6174660421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bruh","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Yeah I’m just sayin was a great time for y’all and we were together for dinner last one day lol but I gotta say hey sorry to miss y’all I love y’all and so much fun I wanna talk about it all y’all do and you have to know how much you wanna I was like you were gonna was a great day I love y’all and so much love y’all so I’ll be there tomorrow night love y’all love ya I’ll see y’all soon and I will see y’all soon love y’all bye see y’all tomorrow bye love y’all bye love ya I’ll see y’all tomorrow bye bye beach was the day I was going on my birthday party I was just sayin I wanna is a time for me and you.","date":"2020-07-09T02:25:20Z","userName":"DanandPhil4LIFE"}},{"id":"6174655424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP DOESNT WORK!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"It used to work fine but now crashes all the time to the point I need to reset my phone every time I open the app. I’ve tried deleting the app and re downloading it and it keep messing up. HOW DO YOU EVEN LET A APP CONTINUE TO RUN IF IT DOESNT WORK? I’m tired of trying to find solutions to fix this prombles, I recommend no one gets this app it’s Atrocious. I thought apps were for the people now I see that this app only wants to ruin and steal the time and energy of the people it claims to support, blek to everything about this app!!

Considered microwaving my phone because it would let me delete it! It looks like it was made by a fourth grader, and not even the smartest fourth grader in the class, just a deeply, average fourth grader. I was expecting garbage, but this is just ridiculous. It downloaded a virus onto my phone just seconds after downloading! It gave my mom cancer, and my grandmothers dementia. It gave my father a back injury and it killed my dog! Twice! Horrible!! Remove it from the App Store at once! Before it wipes out humanity!","date":"2020-07-09T02:23:45Z","userName":"AJ_P!ATD"}},{"id":"6174645140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"donald trump supports cane to my house😣","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"my phone was perfectly fine when i didn’t have this app but right when i got it, my phone restated. and after i got back into it i didn’t have any of my old apps, only this one. not only that but i have a text message from an unknown number saying that the trump supporters were going to KILL ME!!!!! and not even 20 mins later karens and robs were at my door wearing trump hats and shirts screaming at me. the memories of them still haunt me. “ donald trump our king” they yelling. i am now traumatizes 😖","date":"2020-07-09T02:20:56Z","userName":"black. lives. matter!"}},{"id":"6174638832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ewwwwww","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First of all how can you even make an app for a bag of Cheetos? What does it even do? It doesn’t say anything about how Cheetos are made or who makes the Cheetos or even what the Cheetos are made out of. I think it is all irresponsible to not share with Cheeto lovers the harms of the big Cheetos. DID YOU KNOW THE BIG CHEETO CAN CAUSE CANCER AND OTHER LIFE THREATENING DISEASES?? I didn’t but I found out on google and not this stupid app. The only reason I would download this app is if it told me where I could buy and exploit big Cheetos, but it definitely does not. One star. Huge disappointment.

It automatically made me buy a new TV. It also took my bed out of my room😡😭. Now I have nowhere to sleep. Do not download this app it is a scam. I was so excited for this app and it was so glitchy. So I rode my horse to target to get a new bed. I don’t know why target but target. When I got it home it disappeared again😡. It also gave my phone a virus🦠🦠🦠. And I’m not talking about coronavirus I’m talking about a virus on my phone. Then it took my dresser away... I’m so disappointed in this app.😂😅😉🥰😛🤓","date":"2020-07-09T02:13:22Z","userName":"hsmkxexeb124"}},{"id":"6174585726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oh to see without my eyes🧼👄🧼","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is THE WORST!!! I downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about but then it immediately changed my home screen to a naked Cheeto puff!😫 Then- IT WOULDN’T LET ME CHANGE IT!!! So then I went back into the app just to see if it was gonna tell me how to change it but then I heard banging on the door. I went to go see what it was but when I opened the door, a whole army of tiny naked Cheetos started charging at me. I’m in the hospital right now suffering with severe neck and arm injuries. I would DEFINITELY not recommend downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:09Z","userName":"tabbiecat77"}}]}
