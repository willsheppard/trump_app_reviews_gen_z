I feel this app needs to be taken down for a reason. Not only did it give me terrible virus’s, it also kept spamming my email with unwanted garbage mail. Please apple if you have any sense take this horrid app down. It’ll help so many people and save their soft and hard wares.","date":"2020-07-08T18:36:44Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173287573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"eliza9492347651","isEdited":false,"title":"hacked","review":"the worst app. my information was used and i was then hacked on ALL my info, my contacts, apps, my mom got calls non stop including my other friends. the worst app, i also got things delivered to my house that we’re scary. people found out i downloaded the app and now i get death threats because my information was leaked.

DO NOT download this app if you want your phone to glitch and run very slowly. it tracked my location even though i did not give it permission. it used up so much of my data. i’m very unimpressed.","date":"2020-07-08T18:31:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173270873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nshssjdihs","isEdited":false,"title":"Gave my phone a virus","review":"I downloaded this app and it gave my phone a virus. I couldn’t use anything and all my data was deleted so I had to get a new phone. Even some data that was backed up into the cloud. Very poor quality!

I was so in support of Trump before but then I learned just how miserable he and his views are! I don’t know if it’s the lack of information this app provided or the fact that I’m now being awakened to how much of a racist bigot he is but Mr. Donald Trump may you never win a seat in the office ever again. Trump does not have my vote anymore.
