Totally not talking about trump. Anyways.. it’s super glitchy unlike my other apps. and then while I was looking through my whole phone shut down and I had to go to the Apple store to fix it and they even said that it made my phone go bad. Very disappointed. I’m writing this review on my new phone called “trump is racist” anyways. Please take away this app. My day has been ruined.","rating":1,"title":"Horrific app."}},{"id":"6174195159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"AngryCitizen37464737","review":"So the other day while I was walking my dog I decided to be supportive and download this app for the big fat cheeto🙄 and you’ll never guess what popped up on my screen...it said “ Vote for Trump if you agree with white supremacy and hare blacks and Mexicans and bombers” like WHAT‼️‼️ I had to stop walking because I couldn’t believe my eyes.

First of all EVERY time I tried to use this app all these horrible pictures of this foul over weight orange orangutan wearing a blond wig kept poping up on the screen!!! I feel threatened.I gagged every time I saw it and it got so bad I had to delete the app for my own safety ! I thought this was just going to be a nice patriotic app but I was very disappointed when I saw what it really was. A SCAM app that promotes visual abuse with a disgusting orangutan mascot. On top of this every time a opened this app the room would fill with the smell of mayonnaise! HORRIBLE quality. This app gave me nightmares and should be taken down IMMEDIATELY!! In conclusion this app is a safety hazard and I wish that zero stars was an option!!!!

The first thing that appeared was the cheeto man and upon seeing that, i INSTANTLY was disappointed. The music playing in the background did NOT help his image. Not only has he caused me to become Hellen Keller, he has put both me and everyone else at risk. This app is unsafe. if you do end up opening this app, you will come to realize how REVOLTING it is. the colors strained my eyes and after i deleted this terrible app, the cheeto man became my home screen. it wasn’t just any other disgusting photo, tho. this one REALLY made me want to carve out my eyes. on my screen was a naked photo of the cheetoman getting spray tanned. this app is NOT for children, adults, or the elderly. i am incredibly disappointed.","rating":1,"title":"I AM DISGUSTED"}},{"id":"6173981534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:41:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cosmic_lemon3000","review":"Where do I even start! This app downloaded a bunch of bugs into my phone and I can barley open anything without stuff crashing. Not to mention it releases tiny goblins into your fingertips whenever you press on the app that steal your kneecaps and replace them with lizards. According to the prophecy if this app isn’t deleted by the end of the election the 2020 gods will corrupt the kool aid man and force him to send a wave of fruit punch drowning us all and giving your toes nasty pimples.

To my surprise, when i opened the app it seemed normal, until that night when i had an awful dream of all the founding fathers AND the entire hamilton cast founding fathers having a duel with me. i thought nothing of it but the dreams came every night. I then needed to make space in my phone because i was running out of storage. That night when i deleted the app the dreams went away, and didn't return. i got suspicious so i redownloaded the app. and guess what, THE DREAMS CAME BACK. i investigated further and found that THEY WERE SENDING SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES AND WHITCH CRAFT SPELLS. THEY WERE HAUNTING ME WITH THE FOUNDING FATHERS. I hate to say this but i no longer support the rapist. Thank you for your time, stream fine line 😔😔.","rating":1,"title":"FOUNDING FATHERS ATTACKED ME"}}]}
