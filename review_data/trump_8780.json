It is a shame I am having to write this review, god bless the creators of this horrible app, they know where they are going. Not only does the app buffer and glitch, it took approximately two hours to download. I would like to get in contact with this apps customer service hotline IMMEDIATELY, and have a civil conversation with their executives.","date":"2020-07-09T06:49:16Z"}},{"id":"6175233362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tehe:)25","review":"I downloaded this to be more informed and instead it went ahead and stole my dog and sold it on eBay which I then ordered back to my house when suddenly my fridge exploded from the glitches the app gave it very very disappointed because my dog was also indeed in the microwave watching it all happening when suddenly I tried to deleted the app and it scanned me in the eyes and say bye bye buddy which is the name of my dog then my dog buddy exploded into tiny little bits 😞\nSincerely disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T05:25:13Z"}},{"id":"6175172669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My ankles are broken over this app 👠","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Some Person Who Like Something","review":"I would not recommend this app to anyone, not even my friend who also enjoying hiding away in basements🩹 As soon as you open the app so my phone instantly froze🥶, then shut down.

It’s really gross. Idk who’s sending them but no one wants to read about how he uses orange Crayola marker ink to tie dye his skin. I deleted the app and the text messages stopped, but now I receive letters in the mail begging me to put the app back on my phone. I refuse to cave in. Long story short, I’m giving this app one star because I didn’t like the color of the font.","date":"2020-07-09T04:23:10Z"}},{"id":"6174946716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app in the 🌍🪐💫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tiktokluver33","review":"after downloading this app I suddenly felt ill, all brain cells seemed to have completely left my body. As I put my cat on her leash and laced up my rollerblades, my vision felt fuzzy & my body began to shake; then I remember i just had too much ice coffee, whoops!!!

Burge","review":"So……I was mopping the grass in front of my church and Cthulhu came from the sky and stole my pocket mace so I couldn’t protect my family from the bison of North Dakota. THEN my family went to Wendy’s to get a $1 McFlurry  or whatever and THIS APP MADE A Barrier SO I COULDNT GET IN SO I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A BISONS STOMACH WITHOUT MY MILKSHAKE. I’m forever annoyed. But once Me and my caravan got pooped out I was all sunburnt because this app stole all my aloe and SPF 100.

Had to ride Bison home.","date":"2020-07-09T03:31:36Z"}},{"id":"6174821624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Nevae311","review":"This app is horrible and not worth the time or space it glitches so much one time it deleted by itself and I had to download it again! When u click on something it doesn’t work or it takes u out of the app itself! It needs a huge upgrade I’m not satisfied with what I download, and it doesn’t look like many are ether.

Also, when I put in my info into the app it immediately started glitching and my phone froze and now seems to have some kind of virus.🦠 I am beyond disappointed with the fact that this app is so poorly made yet still available to download. Don’t risk your safety stay away from this app!","date":"2020-07-09T02:57:14Z"}}]}
