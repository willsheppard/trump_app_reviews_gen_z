I don’t know what they mean by “Make America Great again” but that is very disappointing.

I of course jumped out of fright and fell off my bed only to hit my head on the dresser. I then proceeded to bleed out of my head and had to go to the hospital, I am now getting legal action for this situation. And whoever this weird corn for hair person is pretending to be “a good president” but is really a mindless orange noodle should get their rights revoked. If a cheeto puff can run this country why can’t I??? I will be submitting this as my official presidential campaign speech. Also i’ve added as much merchandise as possible to my cart and it’s all so ugly🤩 you misogynistic whore✨✨. Anyways I hope everyone who isn’t racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or a rapist, has an excellent rest of the day. everyone else can go rot in the fiery pits of hell like you deserve🥰 Oh also this imposter reminds me of the talking orange, a profound and sophisticated show that deserves no such resemblance to this tiny penis man.","title":"He’s an imposter","isEdited":false,"userName":"yOu ArE aN iDiOt🥰✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️♥️","rating":1}},{"id":"6177625355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:55Z","review":"this app treated me like i was a piece of DELICIOUS cake and it said the meanest things about feet, like luv what u for against feet with 8 toes? worst of all when i downloaded the app, a CHEETO popped up... like sis -🙈anyways i was minding my own business looking all fine and shi and feeling immaculate, when i got an EMAIL from the app saying to go to shreks village... let’s say i kindly passed on the opportunity because fiona would be mad luv and i would lit rally not like that luv💋 anyways i’m rating this app a 1 star because it’s a terrible app, i’d rather download WISHBONE than this app (no hate to wishbone) .. anyways my husband ross lynch said that it was not a good app either, the rat between my walls and the roaches in my rooster said it wasn’t good either.","title":"most UGLIEST app in my whole scrumptydumptious life EVER.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sophia..\"","rating":1}},{"id":"6177623583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:21Z","review":"I downloaded this app to show love and support my president and ever since I downloaded it my phone glitches all the time!! 😡 I don’t know what’s wrong.

No it was willing, they told me they knew where I lived and knew what my pet chea-pet looks like ;-; I was so scared for my grass pet that I quickly downloaded the app. It couldn’t hurt right? It took 4 YEARS TO DOWNLOAD! I’m already graduated from college at this point... when I opened the app all I saw was little Cheeto di*k, it caused me to go blind instantly. Dr.Willy Wonka said I’d never get my sight back. Now I’m blind and the last thing I can remember looking at is his soggy cheeto. I cry at night thinking about it, my chea pet keeps waking me up every night wiping my tears away with his little grass. 😢😢 it’s the only thing that gives me comfort anymore. VERY BAD APP!","title":"ASSAULTED","isEdited":false,"userName":"t's lil d","rating":1}}]}
