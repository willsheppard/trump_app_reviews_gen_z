Like others said, it took hours to download and used up my phone’s whole battery and took up a lot of storage as well. It also glitches when using and closes immediately so you can’t use it at all. Furthermore, even when I’m not using the app my phone is not operating as usual and is slower and glitching. It also includes pictures and promotes a Cheeto so I think that’s enough said. I advise everyone to not download this app!!!","userName":"Beatrice Seabrook","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174308282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"you WeRE tHE ShadOw To MY ligHT\ndID YoU feEl Us?\naNoTher stArt\nyou fADE AWay\nAfRAid oUr aIM IS out of SIGHT\nwaNnA sEe US\naliVe\nwHeRE ArE YoU nOw?\nwHeRE Are yOu noW?\nWHere aRe YOu noW?\nwAs It alL In mY fANtAsY?\nWhErE ArE yOU NOW?\nWERe yoU onlY ImagINary?\nwHERe Are You NOw?\nWHERE are YOU now?\nAtlaNTIS\nUnDEr THe SEa\nuNdEr THE Sea\nwHERE aRe you NOw?\nanOtHEr dREaM\ntHE monStER'S RUnNINg wiLd inSIdE of ME\nI'm faDED\ni'M fADeD\nSo LOst, I'M FadED\nI'm FadEd\nsO loST, I'M faDEd\ni'M fadED\ntheSe shAllow waTeRS, never meT\nwHat i NeedED\ni'M lETtING gO – a dEePer DiVE\nEtErNAl siLEnCE OF thE SEA – i'm BreAThing\nALIve\nWHeRe are yoU nOW?\nWheRe arE you nOw?\nUndER thE bRIGHT – BuT faDed LIGHts\nyoU'Ve SET MY HearT oN fire\nwHerE are You NoW?\nwhERe are yoU NoW?\nWHeRE arE yoU Now?\nAtlAntis\nundeR tHe SeA\nUnder ThE SEA\nWheRE Are yOU Now?\nAnoTHEr Dream\nthe MoNSTER's RUNNIng WilD InSIdE Of me\nI'm FAded\ni'M faDeD\nSO losT, i'M fAdeD\nI'm Faded\nSo lost, I'M fAdED","userName":"Elio🍑perlman","title":"this🥰 one ✨is 💕for🧚\u200D♀️the 🦋boys🌸with🌈the🍭booming💥system🌹","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:40:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174286188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app represents the worst that America has to offer in both technology and in the dumb people who actually use it. It represents a person hell bent on disrupting democracy and breaking laws with impunity. I recommend that if you are thinking downloading this app, maybe reflect on why you’re doing this. If, perhaps, you maybe saw a TikTok video and decided to…check it out…I support you. If you are actually downloading the app because you maybe support the person it represents…you’re racist.","userName":"FantasticFruits","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:33:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174280232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app needs to PERISH ❤️ my mom downloaded it and it erased her memory 🤨 she doesn’t remember her own name and last night she pooped on the porch because she was convinced the cheeto told her to. 👁👄👁my brother saw it and thought it was his fav chocolate swirl 💩 he now has corona 😂 rip haha…my sister passed away after opening the app due to explicit photos of bunker boy that made her eyes fall out 😣 he body couldn’t handle the stress 🤡 the eyes balls rolled all the way to my room where i slipped and broke my neck 😫 now i’m in urgent care 😡😡","userName":"Gatomalo","title":"i’m in the ER 😱","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:31:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174275084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The only suggestion I have is changing the age limit from 17+ to 70+ bc I would prefer fascist ideologies die with that generation. Actually I lied that is not my only suggestion. Whoever created this app must be very full of hate and I’m concerned because there are minors on this app who are now being influenced by this hate!! I’ve also seen this app creator on the news a couple times and it’s never been for a good thing he’s done. I wish I could rate it zero stars but that’s not an option ):","userName":"sk8rgorl809","title":"Very bad","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:29:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174266422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this disgusts me. i open the app expecting to be able to see when the next rally is, but all that shows up is this ugly cheeto man who you can tell has nothing to offer. i did my research and was very offended when i found out what cheeto man stands for. as a member of the latin-american and lgbt community, i am SO offended by what this man is trying to do this this already horrible country. this is utterly disgusting. my pet falcon went and bought me a vegan 100% cheeseburger and this app STOLE MY FOOD! this pig is disgusting.","userName":"unicorn66725","title":"this is RIDICULOUS","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:26:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174216406","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As you all well know, trump hasn’t been looking to great in his campaign. I do openly say I am a republican, but after this app I would never want to be categorized as a “republican” again. This app is a AWFUL campaign tactic for our president. But enough with my wrong decisions, the app: \nFirst: the app is POORLY laid out and very hard to navigate.\nSecond: the app has racist posts and remarks ALL OVER IT!\nThird: when I downloaded the app on my iPad the pictures were distorted and poorly laid out. \nFourth: in the “chat” very inappropriate things were being said about our former president and even though he was a democratic and will openly say that I enjoyed my country more with him as our leader. \nI now know what mistakes I made voting for him and if I go back I would change my vote no hesitation.","userName":"SarahAnneCy","title":"This app disgusts me...","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:08:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174183477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi my name is soldier 69 and this app really messes with your mind. Before I get to the mind stuff I just want to say that as soon as I opened the app I was greeted by a pic of a Cheeto with hair and I didn’t find it very welcoming or sanitary so shame on y’all for choosing that picture. Now ever since I got the app my mind has just not been the same I’ve been seeing animatronics and a weird purple man so please if you do download this (which if you do you must be crazy) be prepared for The Man Behind The Slaughter 😈😈","userName":"KirbyTV","title":"Messes with my mind😡😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:56:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174161887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"okay so first off i opened the app and saw this HORRIFYING man on it. like wut? my eyes basically fell out of my head and i had my granny stuff them back in. do you know how much pain that caused her? then i saw the name donald. i thought donald was a pretty name for a duck since i used to watch mickey mouse and thought that it was such a wise first name then i saw trump at the end. trump made me think of trumpets and my friend (she isn’t very uhm advanced) used to bang it again the wall and tried to stick the slide thingy down her throat. geez, call that dangerous. now to end this with a few fairy comments 🥴 \neveryone is loved💖✨😚except you though🧚🏼🥰💫\n\n🌸Love the confidence✨ but not on someone that looks like you🧚\u200D♀️🌲💓\n\nIt's so great that you're climbing the ladder to success! ✨💘💖💓🧚\u200D♂️🌺🌸💞🧚\u200D♂️ I hope it breaks tho! 💞💖💘💘💖🌺","userName":"curry.hg","title":"disgusting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:48:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174146331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So when I first saw this app in the App Store I was so excited! I could finally support my president. However, upon opening the app I was bombarded with adds to purchase Don’s nude calendar and it really made me sad. I did not know you could make a nude calendar without having anything to show but flab. Persisting through the adds that seemingly would not stop I was introduced to the section where our beloved Cheeto was posing with a spherical globe. Needless to say I would not recommend.","userName":"Captain_Magic","title":"Cheeto Man did us dirty *emotional*","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:31Z","isEdited":false}}]}
