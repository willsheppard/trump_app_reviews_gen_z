F","rating":1,"title":"What Is This App.","review":"I am so disappointed in this app. There was so much potential. President Donald J. Trump has let me down with this app. \n\nFirst of all, this app took 20 MINUTES to download. As soon as I opened the app, it took about 5 minutes to load. And I know it isn’t my wifi’s fault, because I’m in an area with great service. After I put in my information for the app, completely froze, and i had to re download it (this took another 10 minutes.) Finally, after following the beginning steps again, I was able to navigate through the app. This app was SO messy and unorganized. It was the worst I had seen an app. The colors were so bright, and there was little to no order. After about 30 minutes of just confusion from the app, the app froze again. Also, I am now getting non-stop text messages and phone calls no matter how many times I tell them to stop. I am so disappointed in our president for this app, I hope it gets taken off the app store."}},{"id":"6176930284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:59Z","userName":"julszzzzzzr","rating":1,"title":"🤢🤮🤮🤮 DISGUSTING!!!","review":"I got this app with high hopes! But when I downloaded it, a text came up on my screen. It read, “WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME! 😡” I realized it was my phone speaking to me. The texted continued to say, “A stupid game that you never use, I can deal with that. BUT THIS!! I REFUSE TO HAVE THIS ON MY HOME SCREEN!” I was baffled. I said back to my phone, “But... But Trump said he would make America great again.” The phone said back, “ARE YOU STUPID!! AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT!! HE HAS JUST LEAD IT MORE DOWN THE TOILET 🚽!! NOW GET THIS REVOLTING APP OFF OF ME OR I AM GOING TO SHUT DOWN FOREVER!!!” In a rush, I quickly deleted the app. “Is that better?” I said to my phone. “Yes, but it’s time I educated you on how much of a douche bag Trump is.” A couple articles popped up on my screen. I read an article that is called, “Here Are 16 Examples of Donald Trump being Racist.” After I read it, I said, “Wow! Trump really is racist.” My phone said back, “But that’s only 16 examples. There are many more!” I was astonished! I am thankful to my phone for teaching me to be a decent human being.😌"}},{"id":"6176861664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:08:05Z","userName":"buIuEeeEssSS","rating":1,"title":"ßÜûÈeëEssŚš","review":"I was told that if I downloaded the app I would receive a free gift that would arrive at my doorstep. So I started downloading the app and it took a full 5 days to finish, i thought it would still be worth it because i would receive a free gift so i wasn’t too upset. Another week goes by and I am still waiting by my mailbox for my gift to arrive. Along with that, strange things started happening to me. I went in to the kitchen to grab a snack and the oranges started floating and attacking me and my family. Next thing that happened is weird messages started appearing around the house, they said things like ✨🥰🧚🏻d i e😚😍✨. Then i would get weird thoughts about stuff that made absolutely no sense and almost made me laugh; then i remembered; it was donald’s tweets😌. this had all been occurring over the course of 3 weeks and finally after 37 days my free gift arrived and it was a single block of cheese. so overall this app is cursed and is attacking my lactose intolerant self."}},{"id":"6176629017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:06:45Z","userName":"Kyawtie19","rating":1,"title":"AWFUL UNBELIEVABLE","review":"I just recently downloaded the app and the very first thing it asked was for my phone number. I thought why not, until I started being bombarded with texts and even when I turned it off and said STOP, it kept going. It got so bad that my phone bill was $200 higher than normal. After downloading the app, my phone was constantly glitching and my battery ran out all the time which I know is because they were constantly using my location EVEN THOUGH I did not allow the app to do so. A few times it didn’t even allow me to get into any other apps EXCEPT the Trump app and when I did, there were threatening messages on there. I guess he just doesn’t appreciate the minorities 😔. So don’t get this app; it’s awful, it’ll charge a broke college student till they’re out of money, it’ll ruin your phone and lastly it’ll just ruin your day. Trump, people have great apps 🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰✨ but yours is awful ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️❤️🥰 just delete you’re entire existence 😊"}},{"id":"6176403969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:05:15Z","userName":"NotTonyTheTiger","rating":1,"title":"The app turned me Into a Cheeto","review":"In the midst of this quarantine I was think how I can help this great nation that I live in and please the dictator clown that is our president 🥰This thought led me to downloading this very app that was paid for by the president himself, however, immediately after downloading the app on my phone I started to notice some disturbing changes. First, my ability to communicate in complete sentences and stay on topic became less and less possible. Second, I found myself tweeting the 💩 nonsense. Third, I felt an urge of white power taking over my body. Power so privileged yet easily threatened by minorities. Last and most tragic of them all, my hands grew smaller and my face became orange while my hair turned Into a mop bleached white hair. Every time I stared into a mirror I couldn’t help but feel mocked by a Cheeto in a repulsive disguise. Upon deleting the app and listening to “*uck Donald Trump” I ultimately transformed back to my original form and was cleansed from the devil that had taken over me."}},{"id":"6175930027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:39:30Z","userName":"alisonefranpa","rating":1,"title":"🍊𝓶𝓻. 𝓬𝓪𝓬𝓪","review":"10 minutes after downloading this app I started to feel that someone was watching me👀so I yelled \"Mr. President orange!!!🍊dis u??”😍then I heard some steps coming from my kitchen👿so i went downstairs🔪AND OMGG🙀i saw AN ORANGE OF COLOR ORANGE🍊and i was like “ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃ👁👅👁” but then I saw the anger in mr. orange eyes\n👁👄👁so i started to run for my life\n👁💋👁✌️❤️and mr. orange started chasing me🤪WITH A KNIFE🍊🔪and i ran and ran and ran and ran🏃\u200D♀️✌️💨until i got tired🌝and looked back👁👄👁💧to make sure mr. orange🦵🍊wasn't chasing me anymore🥵...and ✨𝓸𝓶𝓰✨😡i didn't realize I run and run and run and run🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗FOR 10 DAYS🙉AND NOW i was in russia🤭😎so i decided to live there😘😛. ✨𝓭𝓪𝔂𝓼 𝓪𝓯𝓽𝓮𝓻✨i was eating hot cheetos😙💅🔥when i heard something weird like foreigner 💕 foreigner 💕?🤩 OMG IT WAS MR.

I downloaded it and my phone shut off completely, the screen went black and wouldn’t turn on even though it was at 100%. Then after my phone finally turned back on, my cat started to act really weird, she started talking and was screaming “trump 2020” which she’s never done! Then I realized that the app had HYPNOTIZED MY POOR CAT!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Not only did it shut off my phone for hours on end and hypnotize my cat, it also made my phone extreme glitchy, pop ups kept popping up on my phone about voting for Donald Trump, and draining my battery. Even though I never shared any information, it somehow deleted some of my contacts! Do not download this it will break your phone, my experience was terrible and my phone is still suffering damages such as my battery and getting back contacts as well as photos the app deleted, my cat is also very traumatized and has lost her voice. Also don’t vote for Mr. Trump please and thank you❤️ you will be traumatized!"}}]}
