I don't know why they would want that but after looking up articles in Facebook I came to the conclusion that this app is monitored by russian spies to infiltrate the United States. I am scared for my life. Please, Trump if you are so kind, take this app down. We do not want to be invaded by the communists. This is a threat to our society.  \n\nSincerely, a pro-choice, democrat, decent human being","title":"Please Trump Take This Down"}},{"id":"6122797691","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-26T05:14:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lizzie1206","rating":1,"review":"I would give it 0 stars if I could. The app is glitchy and I was offended by the layout! The red, white, and blue colors were painful for my eyes. It’s as if this man does not respect the nation’s beautiful flag >:(\n\nI’d also like to add that when I opened this app, my cat threw up on the floor. Clearly this app is sickening to humans and animals alike! I expect Donald Trump to pay for the pain this app has caused me and I will be redirecting his payment to Joe Biden’s campaign.","title":"Do NOT Download!!!"}},{"id":"6113750528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-23T21:36:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ms.DeprCakes12","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this wonderfully horrible app to see what the hype was about with that cheese ball y’all call “President”. All i found were tons of articles and facts about some ra*ist, ugly meatball. I can’t believe people still use this app even after the emails came to light. this app crashes a lot because i think it’s takes a lot to keep up w fake news ): gross place to be id say.","title":"Worse than kidney stones"}},{"id":"6064899310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-12T00:21:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"angie ec","rating":1,"review":"I am a huge fan of the Lord and savior himself, Donald J. Trump. I love how his oily Cheeto skin glows in the sunlight. I was so disappointed in this app. I had great expectations for it. It kept on crashing and these weird and inappropriate ads kept on popping up. I never thought of our president to be a man who would let such ads to pop up. And to add to that the app always says insulting things abt me. I was hurt by this bc I am one of his biggest fan.","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6061886383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-11T07:04:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"AnonymousQWERTYUIOP","rating":1,"review":"Thought I could show some real support for a non-fascist person who uses their position to echo his party’s weaponization of Christianity, denial and trivialization of racial and economic disparity/injustice, classify ideologies as action groups, spreading xenophobia, and other fascist tendencies. I guess I was mistaken. Sadly, the other main candidate shares some of these characteristics as well. \n\nAnyways, I don’t need these people having my phone number 💁\u200D♀️\n1 star","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6179198884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:08:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ace._martin","rating":1,"review":"this app completely destroyed my phone like there were so many viruses and i had to end up buying a new phone! i just wanted to be informed on what our president was doing to help our country. and bam!

I’m really disappointed! I thought this app was going to be great.

It took two hours to download and asked for my SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER!!!! I gave it to them. Ever since I’ve  been getting updates on the app saying “we’re watching, we’ll know if you don’t vote.” I am terrified for the my life and the lives of my 6 children. DON’T DOWNLOAD.
