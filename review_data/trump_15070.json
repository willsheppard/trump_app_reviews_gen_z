I didn’t like the app it made my phone incredibly slow and was glitchy I don’t recommend it! If you want to keep up just go online and see what’s up and read articles! I used to be a trump supporter when I wanted the app but now I’m a little more educated!

The ui is convoluted and confusing. It’s impossible to find any important information. Links almost never work on this app. I wish I could give this god awful app less the one star because that is what it truly deserves. Whoever designed this app is scum of the earth, and I hope they never design another app.","userName":"S.

THE RACIST HOMOPHOBIC DISGUSTING AND PERVERTED ORANGE POTATO!!!!! i was S H O C K E D. i didn’t expect the “app” to have such an impact on me. i give this a 1 out of 10. disgusting and put me in a very emotional state of mind 😔 🇺🇸Anonymous 2020 🇺🇸","userName":"🤡✨ TikTok ✨🤡","date":"2020-07-09T14:43:55Z","title":"🤡✨TikTok ✨🤡"}},{"id":"6176934987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I would give it a zero star review if I could but I can’t. When I first opened the app, Donald trump jumped out of my phone and yelled “TRUMP 2020”. I am a loyal trump supporter/republican so I tried to shake his hand. He then slapped me on the face and took out a knife. He chased me around my house trying to kill me!! He caught me in the end but I used my super cool karate skills to disarm him and kill him. I then said, “Trump 2020✨🌸🦄💘🧚🏼\u200D♂️ but on a grave💞💖🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨”\n\nIts such a bad app","userName":"unicornprincess2","date":"2020-07-09T14:27:15Z","title":"This app is not good"}},{"id":"6176917170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"as a very large trump fan i downloaded this hoping to get more reasons to love him. but when i downloaded it. this big scary man w his toupee and orange skin was there 😱 and as i was scrolling i started smelling this awful smell and it was coming from this app. i closed out to see if it was just this app and it was!!! i also don’t like it because the person who this app belongs to likes to make sexual remarks about minors.","userName":"penishands 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T14:22:38Z","title":"STINKY"}}]}
