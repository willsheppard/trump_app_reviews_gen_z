And no, i’m not exaggerating. It took approximately 5 days to finish the download. After it downloaded i was already getting annoyed, but i trued to keep positive about it. When i opened the app it welcomed me with something’s face. I’m not sure what it was but it kind of looked like an orange. It absolutely traumatized me. It took a lot of courage to open the app again. But then, it asked for my personal information (my phone number). There was absolutely no way that i was giving this app my number. I don’t want it to steal all of my information and send it to china or whatever. I ended up just putting in some random number just so i could see what the app was like. After a bit of scrolling, it started to tell be to do things that were racist and sexist. It was like it was brainwashing me. This is absolutely unacceptable. I already get enough brainwashing from watching Fox News every morning. Overall, do not download this app unless you are a racist, sexist, idiot. 0/10 do not recommend.","userName":"teabugz","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible"}},{"id":"6176997690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:44:04Z","rating":1,"review":"ITS TERRIBLE THE WORST APP EVER TOOK AGES TO DOWNLOAD SND THEN WHEN IT FINALLY DID I HAD TO PUT MY PHONE NUMBER IN IF UR ASKING ME I THINK ITS A RISK TO MY PRIVACY DUE TO THE FACT OF MY PHONE NUMBER TELLS THEM NY AREA CODE AND I BLAH BLAH BLAH U CANT STOP US GIVE US BACK TIK TOK","userName":"(123)& kitten","isEdited":false,"title":"SO BAD✨"}},{"id":"6176994832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:18Z","rating":1,"review":"when I came in the app I saw a big fat orange thing and it’s like a scp it’s so scary.
