As soon as I downloaded it, the size of Trump’s ego grew too large and collapsed into a black hole. The black hole in question then proceeded to swallow the sun because it was associated with ANTIFA and the radical left. Now I am sitting here freezing my ASS off because there is no sunlight. I caught a break when a local Chinese food joint caught on fire because it couldn’t go on any longer after seeing Donald trump’s subatomic penis on Twitter. I would NOT recommend this app. Anonymous 2020!"}},{"id":"6113378837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-23T19:09:05Z","title":"wow.","userName":"sablouboob","review":"I myself am a trump supporter which I seriously am reconsidering now because of this app.There was so much shocking news.First of all they called trump peach when he is clearly orange.This is so obvious and disrespectful.I got a notification about trump being a orange.He resembles a Cheeto and all trump supporters should already know that.The current threat level is yellow but we all know as long as we have trump as our president the threat level will remain orange❤️"}},{"id":"6113241219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-23T18:18:08Z","title":"Ahaha","userName":"barrymcdairy","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

The accusations are laughable. So here is the TRUTH. \n\nYou give your phone number and email. \n\nUhm...99.999% of apps do that INCLUDING other candidates apps to which I’ve also signed up for in the App Store. \n\nThis is not the place for political hacks to leave fake reviews.
