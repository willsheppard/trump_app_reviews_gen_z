Even though he is an embarrassment to our country. The app is scary and made me feel harassed."}},{"id":"6172802624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chrisandhalle","date":"2020-07-08T16:01:23Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible","rating":1,"review":"This is a attempt to get you to vote for trump however thy reasons or HORRIBLE.

Because of this horrible application, my Tik Tok feed has shown me videos of dedicated President Trump supporters giving inhumane reasons as to why the Black Lives Matter movement is \"stupid\". This is UNCALLED FOR. Basic human rights are not political."}},{"id":"6172725753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"adrieepoooohh","date":"2020-07-08T15:39:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download this app","rating":1,"review":"Donâ€™t download this app, this man is a very evil man why would you support an evil person like this who have No sympathy for others and is always being negative.

Then it asked for my dataâ€”why does the government need my data?! I can barely understand anything I read on this damned thing!

Only to find a bunch of angry white people with guns and confederate flags confused saying to make America great again when it was great when Obama was president, they probably just want Obama back."}},{"id":"6172586207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"SimoneOlivia2002","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusted.","rating":1,"review":"Donald Trump has proven time and time again that he is not fit to be president for ALL people in this country. His appeal to Christians amazes me, as he clearly uses the Bible as a prop to gain the Christian vote. His rhetoric encourages white supremacy and nationalist ideals that are a danger to society if widely accepted. Stop idolizing this man and take a hard look at his tactics that gaslight the American people."}}]}
