But he is lying to us right as we open it. Keep America great?? Have you seen what America is going through right now. Cops killing black people, not getting rid of COVID. America isn’t great. He is lying. His policies are horrible and he cares more about religious biases, white people, and businesses rather than everyone in America without any biases. I hate this man and he is upset that the gen zers didn’t have people show up to his rally so now he wants to take away tiktok. He needs to be less butthurt over small things and start acting like a president. Facts over feelings. He acts like a child and absolutely disgusts me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:24:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177105118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Blah Blah girl 000000000001","title":"orange","review":"so basically i got the app yesterday and when i woke up this morning to go to work there was this orange guy at my doorstep. i was soo confused and he told me that since i got the app he got my address. i was going to call the police but then i remembered ACAB. so i didn’t let him in then he pushed me out of the way and proceeded to kill my sister. i was shocked then he came for me i hit him with a frying pan but he was indestructible. then the fbi showed up at my doorstep. it was spencer reid (matthew gray gulber) coming to save me! He ripped the orange guys head off and then we got married. so basically i could thank the app for finding my husband for me but the orange guy did kill my sister so 1 star. do not recommend ❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:13:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177083543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ur mom 🏃","title":"AWFUL!!!!!","review":"as i opened the app the first thing i was asked for was my phone number, which is my personal information and that led to making me feel extremely uncomfortable. as the days continued, i noticed my phone acting up, everything i opened crashed almost immediately. my screen would go black and exit the app that i was trying to use. this was unusual for my phone, it’s never done anything like this before. i’m deleting the app, it’s truly the most disappointing thing. i was looking forward to downloading it but it did not in anyway meet my expectations. it’s messed up my entire phone. everything. it’s awful, and i don’t recommend. 😕","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:07:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176978592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump lover 202020","title":"Not a fan","review":"I thought this app was supposed to give information about our amazing country 🇺🇸, but instead there’s just a whole bunch of false information, broken promises, and pictures of what seems to be a Cheeto impersonating our president!?? I thought we were gonna make American great again but nothing has happened?? This app made my phone CRASH!! Maybe we could take this money used for this app and donate it to the people of Yemen who are DYING!! Or maybe DEFUND THE POLICE and BAN ICE bc innocent Americans are dying! This app is a terrible, virus filled, money stealing pig just like our president!😘🐷🧚🏻\u200D♀️ A high schooler with no degree that’s taken the basic government class would be a much better president!!! 🙂","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:38:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176909339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Emily 😝😍💐🌹🌺","title":"not the best one","review":"I opened this app and it went to a black screen and I couldn’t do anything about it and then I restarted my phone and then I opened the app again cause I really wanted to see what it was about and it went to the white screen then it crashed and my phone was frozen for 10 minutes. Once it stop being frozen I went to go on again and it worked for a little but it was very slow and then five minutes later it crashed all over again. I thought it was my phone so I used it on another one too and it just did the same thing. This app needs a lot of improvement especially if it’s for our president.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:20:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176870087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"semifunctionalwife","title":"Just... don’t","review":"I downloaded this app to see how we were going to make America great again, because frankly after the last 3.5 years, we need to regain our standing in the world. I realized, after opening this app, that it is part of the reason we’re a laughingstock to other countries. Downloading this app was a yooj mistake, the worst mistake ever made on the face of this magnificent earth. This app, and those who created it, are never going to help make America great again. Scrolling through the app, you’ll realize that until black lives matter, and the lives of all non white people matter, America will never be great again. Do yourself a favor and do not download this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:10:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176852736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tater__21","title":"What is this? Why is it still on the App Store?","review":"HELP ME!!!!! I downloaded this app because my republican trump supporter grandfather told me too. So I gave it a shot. First off, it took FOREVER to download. Then when I opened it I saw this ORANGE and all his plans as a “president” Maybe I’m living under a rock, but WHO LET AN ORANGE be president? Man they’re just letting anybody in that Oval Office! I turned on the tv because this app is BORING AF! There that orange was on the TV!!!! I wanted to throw up! Like eww. I had to go wash my eyes. For the sake of everyone this app NEEDS to be deleted! It has scared my childhood! And all around it just a weird app. 🥺please delete IT🥺 thank you! I’m going to try Obama’s app now since he is WAY more educated than an old wrinkled orange.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:05:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176238743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Minecraftloversoyah","title":"Literally ew","review":"I can’t believe this Cheeto for a president would allow this app to be on the internet. First thing that showed up when I opened the app was a screen asking for my number which is highly inappropriate since this man is old enough to be my grandpa. Then when I signed up, my screen was hacked and tried hypnotizing me to vote for trump 😖 luckily I have strong enough morals that are against trump that the hypnosis didn’t work. Afterwards I received a call from the president trying to get me to come over because he was home alone, which was highly flattering, but I almost threw up because of disgust. Long story short, 👵🏻don’t 🌮 get 🖤 the 👩🏼\u200D🦯 app. 👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩Kanye 2020🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:17:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175838530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"postmalone's beerbong","title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"This app took several months to download. And, oh boy, when it did..... it allowed access to my camera on its own accord and repeatedly displayed a message saying I was ugly. It also accessed my credit card through Apple Pay and charged my account for $30,000. I had to get a whole new bank account and cancel the other because the bank thought it was credit fraud. If you though that was bad, this app also cost me some relationships with my close friends because it allowed itself access to my messages and started calling my friends horrible things. To this day they won’t talk to me. So, DON’T GET THIS APP if you want your friends to stay your friends.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:08:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175651059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Major Hamiltom Fan","title":"VERY IMPORTANT","review":"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:05:02Z","rating":1}}]}
