It said it was from picture and videos but I don’t have that many. I had random messages from people and I got a notification that my phone number was being used for Trump. It scared me so I deleted it. Don’t download this app. Who knows what kind of stuff it can do with your phone or your personal information."}},{"id":"6176770716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"genz=betterthanboomers","date":"2020-07-09T13:44:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Tiktok lives matter ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","review":"Where it began, I can't begin to knowing\nBut then I know it's growing strong\nWas in the spring\nAnd spring became the summer\nWho'd have believed you'd come along\nHands, touching hands\nReaching out, touching me, touching you\nSweet Caroline\nGood times never seemed so good\nI've been inclined\nTo believe they never would\nBut now I\nLook at the night and it don't seem so lonely\nWe filled it up with only two\nAnd when I hurt\nHurting runs off my shoulders\nHow can I hurt when holding you\nOne, touching one\nReaching out, touching me, touching you\nSweet Caroline\nGood times never seemed so good\nI've been inclined\nTo believe they never would\nOh no, no\nSweet Caroline\nGood times never seemed so good\nSweet Caroline\nI believe they never could\nSweet Caroline\nGood times never seemed so good"}},{"id":"6176678589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🤡👁👄👁🦋👑☕️","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"👁👄👁🥰🤩👑😡👈🏽😔","review":"worst app ever. it took several days to download and they keep talking abt some 🍊. like um hello this app is supposed to be abt the president? oh that’s right! we have a 🤡 and a man baby as a president.*says in sarcastic baby voice* “you guys are being meanies and bullying me on tiktok.😡 so im gonna delete it! i didn’t even do anything!😔 im just homophobic, racist, and a rapist but that isn’t a big deal!😡” yea okay. gen z ain’t going down w/o a fight sir. and on that note, take this L🤡 the clownery is astronomical."}},{"id":"6176633757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hzdkdnfncu","date":"2020-07-09T13:08:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Sorry but","review":"I didn’t like the way that it was set up and it applied that America was great which is not all that correct because we have a lot of big problems but that’s besides the point I like living in America but it definitely has things that we need to sort out. Back to the app it was slow and wasn’t working well you should just drop it because it really isn’t any help."}},{"id":"6176644150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Famousfavour","date":"2020-07-09T13:10:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Made me contemplate my life and was a big inconvenience","review":"Notification Center of it doesn’t work, it spams your phone and shows too many adds, there’s a big orange add that keeps popping up"}},{"id":"6176615400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TypicallyVal","date":"2020-07-09T13:03:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Made my phone heat up 🙄","review":"When i got this app it thought it supported bernie 2020 😻 But i realized stinky man trump was on the picture 😒 Then my phone began to heat up 😱 So i realized it was my storage 😦 I check my photos and nothing was there 😑But then I checked my videos 😼 and it was videos of aiden Gallagher singing Lauf 😬 Lauv 🙄 Loaf 👹 I was furious 🤬 And then while i was deleting the videos 😝 MY PHONE EXPLODED 😤 So i had my friend Bill nye the science guy run to Antarctica to get me a new one 😋 SO THIS IS WHY IM WRITING THIS ANGRY REVIEW 😡"}},{"id":"6176557439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Die❤️","date":"2020-07-09T12:47:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Die❤️","review":"The amount of time this app took to download is totally inappropriate. It also takes up so much storage for such a simple app. I also don’t see the point. This app is horrible. Do not get it, I really wish that I could go lower than 1 star, and I am completely upset at trump for the way that this app is put together. I wanted to download it because it might change my perspective on trump, but no. This app is terrible. DO NOT GET IT"}},{"id":"6176413778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lex22598","date":"2020-07-09T12:07:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My phone blew up ☹️🥴🧚✨","review":"I saw some five star comments say we are 12 year olds or far left, NOT everything has to do with politics. This app took 48 weeks to download and when it did my phone actually blew up :( I would not recommend this app as the software glitches my phone! Again this is not political, just trying to save everyone’s from having to buy a new phone like I did :( 0/10 stars"}},{"id":"6176374241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Hey Boo 😚🧚🏻🧚🏻","date":"2020-07-09T11:56:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"I want to keep up will our savor, Donald J. Trump, so I decided to download his official app. I had very high expectations for this app since Trump has done wonders for our country. Unfortunately, I was instantly revolted the moment I opened the app. He asked for my number. I do not feel safe giving my number giving my number away. It’s very inappropriate to ask for my number without knowing me. Treat me to dinner first and then I’ll think about it 😚🧚🏻🧚🏻."}}]}
