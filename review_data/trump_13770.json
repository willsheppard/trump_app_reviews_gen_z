There’s just one problem i’m not 17. Why does a app that’s for news has to be 17 and older? It makes no sense to me. Therefore I can’t even get the app. I mean sure i could lie about my age, but why would I do that? Please fix this problem. I don’t think us younger kids so be restricted as to what app we want to use. Especially one for the news.","userName":"hdjsjsoqksh353","title":"Age","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:40:08Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178258935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I went to download this app, it just kept crashing after taking a very long time to download. I don’t understand how anyone would enjoy this app, it’s absolutely useless and a disgrace to my eyes. I can’t believe I wasted my time with this app and I deeply regret this time I’ll never get back. It’s very not good and I wish I could go back in time and save my eyes from this atrocity of an “app”. Disgusting.","userName":"StackerPro","title":"Very not good","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:12:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178242412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Whenever I tried to open the app, it would only stay on the loading screen and my phone would heat up and then I’d have to restart it but it would never open. This app made my phone start to radiate massive bigot energy, so in order to protect myself from bigot cancer, I had to stop trying to use it. This app should be deleted because I don’t want anyone else to get hurt!","userName":"app review 500","title":"Horribly developed","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:05:59Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178236731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I recently downloaded the app because someone said you could get awards like getting kidnapped by timothée cheezit. TURNS OUT you do get to meet timothee but he grabbed me very violently and throw me against the wall! Worst thing was Donald Trump was watching the whole thing and didn’t do ANYTHING. He broke all my limbs and i cant walk properly anymore. I give this app one star. Plus im not able to make it to any rallies since my goldfish needs leg surgery. 😿","userName":"karla lopezmejia","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:57Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178211729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely terrible.\n\nYou mean to tell me I can’t use this app because I have to create an account???? That’s homophobic off the bat. I tried giving this an application a chance, I really did and I immediately was greeted with the insensitive slogan “Make America Great Again”, great again for who? Sounds like an incomplete sentence and we all know how it finishes. Any who, terrible app and most definitely must be taken off the App Store.","userName":"Donald: 👁💧👄💧👁","title":"😌✨🧚\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:55:04Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178204257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded TRUMP 2020 because I am an idiot and support our tyrant of a president. Immediately upon opening this abomination of an app ALL OF MY FINGERS EXPLODED and sent dripping bloody shrapnel flying straight into my fat privileged face. In the second after that a huge warning popped up on my screen reading WARNING VIRUS DECTED. Less than a second later a SWAT team had swarmed my house and shot up me and my whole family. Otherwise good, GO RACISM","userName":"sawyerp36","title":"Absolute hot boo boo DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU WANT TO KEEP ALL UR LITTLE RACIST CONSERVATIVE FINGIES!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:52:26Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178156103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app thinking it was to support my beautiful orange dwarf son. As soon as I downloaded the app a goblin appeared in my room and started violently screaming and running in the walls onto my ceiling. I tried to get him down with my Hisoka Extra Large body pillow and he ate it right up! Now he keeps pulling and pushing things away from him like he has some type of invisible gum attached to him. Awful app would rate 0 stars.","userName":"reeeeekers","title":"Orange man bad","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:35:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178125489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was not useful at all. The intention was to help with following the campaigns but it was always crashing and not doing what it needed to do. I wish I could speak to a manager because honestly what even is this. I’m sooooo very disappointed in how the trump administration developed this app. Guesssssssssss were no where close to making America great again.","userName":"Michell_55","title":"I only have a one star because I couldn’t give a zero","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:25:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178117348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not only did this app not actually perform its purpose (what can I expect from an app that the most belligerent and ignorant president in our history endorsed), but the SECOND I opened it up, bad things started to happen! I had never come in contact with so many racist and bigoted people!! I had always wanted to support our bunker boy🥰 but I realized this app was trying to brainwash me!

This app tells lies and is fake. If you think you are going to get something out of this app you are not!!! You should get it just to give it a bad review!!! I want the app store to take this off the store. it is.                           🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨f a k e  n e w s✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"harrystyleslover_10385","title":"✨THIS APP IS TERRIBLE ✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:19:25Z","rating":1}}]}
