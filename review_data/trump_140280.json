First of all, it took FOREVER to download, which was super annoying. But that’s not even the worst of it. As soon as I opened the app, I could feel a chill in the air, and all of a sudden the sun went POOF, like an eclipse or something. Then, things got weirder, my whole neighborhoods power went out!!( I know this because I could hear my neighbors generator running too) After that, my microwave started blinking on and off, and eventually it started on its own!!! Im pretty sure all this app does is act as a beacon for ghosts and demons👹 to come haunt you. That is the only explanation for all the weirdness that has happened to me and my family. PROTECT YOURSELF!! do not download under ANY circumstances!!😭😭","title":"Not worth it","date":"2020-07-10T04:58:31Z","userName":"rlwemwmlw"}},{"id":"6179522104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app was downloaded on 4:20 on the 69th day of the year and it made my heard hurt. don’t get this app or support this horrible human being we call our leader. it is a shame that this cheeto is running the country, this homophobic, xenophobic, racist, self obsessed carrot with a high ego. oh so sad gen z gave you what you deserved, be ready for what else is coming from us. we are u stoppable","title":"you tried ✨🌟 now never try again ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🍃","date":"2020-07-10T04:58:28Z","userName":"Cooljayjay8"}},{"id":"6179521950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Awful","title":"All I have to say","date":"2020-07-10T04:58:25Z","userName":"qtf7j"}},{"id":"6179521932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Tried using dis application and it woodnt let me git it werkin.
