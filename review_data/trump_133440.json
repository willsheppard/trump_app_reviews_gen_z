After 21089748474 tries I have decided the app was broken so I deleted it and download it again, but this time it opened and my phone caught fire! Then I took it to the phone guy he fixed it and said to me “sparks are catching and fire is spreading” I went home and my house was on fire!! Then burns formed a shape of trump 2020, so I deleted the app but I kept coming back! So I tossed the phone into the sun but I came back! This app is cursed don’t get it!!!"}},{"id":"6173487287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I missed the homies cause of this app","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:41Z","userName":"We're sea","review":"This app is doggy dog shi. Big regrets on downloading, 11/10 would NOT recommend this app. It made my phone freeze. Don’t know if it’s a coincidence but after downloading that happened. No matter what I wouldn’t suggest taking that risk. I couldn’t even text the boys, that hurt. In the end Trump is Not for 2020."}},{"id":"6173486812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Fees?","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:31Z","userName":"jamie_tress","review":"The app is supposed to be free but when I logged into it with my email (its required) it charged me $35.99!!! My email is linked to my Apple Pay so I assume it put the fee in the fine print of the terms & agreement section. UGH I tried contacting customer service about it but they said it’s perfectly legal and I will NOT be receiving my payment back. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6173486276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Almost died!!","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:20Z","userName":"Han McCor","review":"I downloaded this app because my friend send it was a good app for me. So of course I go and download it and the first thing that happens is my phone shuts off! My phone was burning hot and I didn’t know what was going on! So I let it cool off and tried to go on the app. When I got on someone knocked on my door. Me not thinking anything of it I opened the door. There was a man carrying a box of oranges at my door. ORANGES! I am severely allergic to oranges and cannot be anywhere near them! He gave me the box and ran! Thank god I had my anti orange blanket with me! (my blanket is rainbow by the way!) I couldn’t believe that happened but to calm me down I still wanted to see what the app was. I load into the app and all I see is oranges! I couldn’t believe my eyes! I started to panic and try to get the disgusting oranges off of my screen but nothing worked! There was even an orange with hair! BLOND HAIR! I thought I was gonna faint! My brother took my phone and deleted the app saving me from going into shock! I could’ve died because of this app!"}},{"id":"6173485512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ✊🏿","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:04Z","userName":"Ig- jxs.0_0","review":"the app worsens my mental health and causes me to have horrible anxiety, when the app first opens it shows a terrifying picture of a sexist, rasist and all around horrible man. It is promoting a rapist to be in power of us all, the app also takes forever to download, has very bad quality and crashes a lot. the man who is shown on the app looks like a orange avocado frog  and is truly horrifying, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! my mother once told me to do what i think is right, so if you think rape, sexism, and racism is okay then download this app because that’s all that this app promotes. This app deserves to get taken down and anyone in their right mind would say the same, do not waste your time on this app!! Thank you for your time."}},{"id":"6173484557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Dookie","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:45Z","userName":"sandpapertoliettissue","review":"This app is not good. The coding is terrible and it kept on crashing. 10/10 would NOT recommend. I would rather use sandpaper to wipe my butt than use this app again.👎🏾\nWith that being said... BLACK LIVES MATTER!!

It took a WEEK to download and used all of my data! After it finally downloaded it caused my phone to lag  SOOO much that it took me TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EVEN OPEN MY PHONE! THATS NOT EVEN HALF OF IT! After having the app for a day my phone it CRASHED and I had to PAY $257.95 to get my phone fixed. It crashed AGAIN and couldn’t be FIXED! Thankfully they where able to find out what the problem was and it was THIS APP🤬🤬 It gave my phone a VIRUS! Also on top of the cost to fix my phone the first time I had to buy a completely NEW phone! DONT GET THIS APP!"}},{"id":"6173483493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Yeah❤️","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:23Z","userName":"Gabbie Hanna❤️","review":"People😌love🧃that✨i🧸hate⛓myself👩🏻i👣climbed👛out🦋of🌸my🌼head🌙and🌶watched👁myself🦈implode🐡a🕷thought🛷without📞a🖤body🔰"}},{"id":"6173483290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:18Z","userName":"Victoria1638","review":"The download took 6 hours!
