I showed up to one of his rallies and got corona virus! I thought he said that corona was a hoax and it isn’t real. I believed in you and I’ve been severely disappointed.

I got the app to keep track of the state of the country and the app glitched the moment I first try to open it. Not only that but it constantly freezes and closes down on my phone.

It completely made my cellular device malfunction and turn off. It wouldn’t even load up. It was so incredibly slow that it broke my phone! Worst app ever.

What I did not expect were inappropriate pictures of a rather large and unruly man who bears the same face as Donald Trump. If your struggling to picture this imagine a grotesquely large sheep, completely shaved of fur, with the head of the sphinx with an extra 10,000 years of erosion. would not recommend.","title":"Not what I expected","rating":1,"userName":"Arshon Bozorgi"}},{"id":"6174544740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:52:21Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as i opened the app and started viewing the content, i was immediately banned from most of the apps on my phone.
