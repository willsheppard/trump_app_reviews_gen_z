Nothing seems to be working, I don’t see it changing to a better president!! Immediately deleted. Everyone says how he’s a good president but I honestly just don’t see it. It’s not even about Republicans V.S Democrats anymore, it’s just about Trump. Honestly, I don’t even mind the Republicans. If you support it then it’s perfectly fine, but supporting trump is the bigger issue. :/"}},{"id":"6174683105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Percyjackson❤️❤️❤️hehe","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I got this app to recieve trump news for the 2020 election but in reality i just got GARBAGE. After i downloaded this app i started getting weird texts and emails and i realized it was from putting my phone number in this app!! It stole all my information and used my credit card to buy robux. This is a disgusting use of an app designed simply for our presidential news."}},{"id":"6174668728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"SmellyQueen","date":"2020-07-09T02:27:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"This app is EXTREMELY GLITCHY and messed with my ENTIRE PHONE.

It gave my phone bugs and viruses. Like come on Trump the least you could do while hiding in that bucker is make an app that actually works. I’m very disappointed mister. Wish it was better.

For some reason it’s been showing me photos of this moldy orange looking thing, and I was so disturbed I had to get off the app and puke. It made me fail all my classes, I got evicted out of my apartment, it made me break out, and my dog died. So, wouldn’t recommend. There’s a bug or something in it, and it needs help. You know what I mean. It really needs help."}},{"id":"6174615411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NicoleOrellana","date":"2020-07-09T02:12:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Vanessa Guillen ❤️","review":"Vanessa Guillén was a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier who authorities believe was killed on April 22, 2020, inside a Fort Hood, Texas, armory by another enlisted soldier, Aaron David Robinson, age 20.
