All my emails got hacked and sent a link to adult videos. THEY WERE SENT TO MY TEACHERS!!!! This app has ruined my life. Sent me very strange messages such as “ If you don’t vote for trump I not give you the cake you wanted”. It is very weird. It’s a scam app. Terrible things have been happening such as my car stop working and a small fire started. After deleting the app I realized everything went back to normal. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I’m trying to save your life.. ✨✨","userName":"Natalie 💍","rating":1}},{"id":"6175901963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:30:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ion know","review":"This app broke my heart like you wasn’t go say anything about my cat being in the oven while it was in and the oven causght in fire but the cat was still alive.

It immediately filled my phones storage and I noticed that my phone had downloaded every episode of The Apprentice. My phone would not stop playing the money theme song. After hours of listening to this terrible song, I attempted to reset my phone. When I did this I just kept getting phone calls from Russia. \n\n10/10 do not recommend. I had to buy a new phone and burn my old one.","userName":"Alexa01234567890","rating":1}},{"id":"6175663100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:09:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App on the App Store 🤮","review":"If I could give this app a ZERO STAR RATING... I would! This app is terrible. This app recommended me to drink, ingest, and inject myself with disinfectant that is not at all safe for consumption or internal use. It also recommended me to “go back to my country” even though I’m born in the USA. It also told me that it wants to grab me by my... you know what. However, luckily it didn’t because I’m not a minor... oop. It also wants me to do the unthinkable - vote for Trump 2020... THE HORROR! No thank you. Throw the whole app away. Thank you, next. ✌🏼✨","userName":"with love ☺️❤️✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6175652507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:05:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Just plain bad","review":"I was excited to have the app to keep up with rallies and news updates but every time I try to open the app it loads for five min then my screen goes blank, it crashes to the home page and shuts off my phone. Also since I have downloaded, I have been getting so many spam calls asking me for money for the campaign. I already donate so the 10 to 15 calls a day is auwful. Very disappointed I was expecting more high quality like his ussual work","userName":"highwaisted jeans","rating":1}},{"id":"6175561593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:32:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"It made me die.","review":"So. I was going to download this app for the Cheeto man in office, just as any US citizen should do. Well, it took 86 years to download and I lost my LIFE waiting for it!! I’m typing as a ghost at the moment... we have been through so many presidents since Carrot boi and yet... I WAS STILL WAITING! MY EYES WERE BLEEDING!!! Fix yourself before you even THINK about having this highly not recommended app on the App Store for ANYONE to consider downloading. 1 Star, it isn’t worth it. Don’t lose your life waiting for something. Move on people.","userName":"peanutpepperoni","rating":1}},{"id":"6175434633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:43:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ugh absolute GARBAGE","review":"Ugh I tried to download but took several business days. Once in asked for my race?? Well I’m white so I clicked white and it said I got an account upgrade? But I’ve seen reviews from poc saying they got a standard and some even downgraded? What is that about we’re all supporters! Anyways. App lags and is terrible, sometimes it screams misogynistic comments at me, and even says it’s going to “grab me by the p**sy” I know that’s a famous trump quote but to put it in your app is outrageous. I would give 0 stars if I could!!","userName":"Misskitty1248","rating":1}},{"id":"6175386315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:24:14Z","isEdited":false,"title":"At that hot Cheeto looking can of tuna😘","review":"I downloaded this hoping it could change my mind on this sociopathic psychopathic narcissists misogynist racist fascist predatory abusive spoiled mentally unstable emotionally incapable sexually confused 7 feet under sea intelligence level below average penis pathological orange skinned stringy haired gigantic gaslighting bag of dicks not to mention with an IQ of a roach so called preside...... but it literally took 7 hours and let’s just say I had zero patience and I heard it was because it was going through all our information in our other apps unauthorized✌️😑","userName":"uwasemendes","rating":1}},{"id":"6175250331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:31:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitchy","review":"The whole app in itself is shady. My phone was working just fine then all of a sudden the app closed on it’s own and my phone hasn’t worked since.  I just wanted to be updated on how our annoying orange was doing.  Now I might have to buy a knee phone.  Another person complained about their fridge and as stolen and mine was as well as soon as I opened the app. I went to go get me salad I had made yesterday but my fridge was no longer there. 10/10 don’t recommend this app","userName":"phinese and ferb","rating":1}},{"id":"6175240653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:28:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disfunctional Disappointment","review":"This app is so unbelievably slow, it takes far too long too load and has absolutely no value whatsoever. It activated glitches which was inconvenient to say the least, it’s very dysfunctional. The creators of this app are lacking in creating good digital content for app users, the Trump administration can’t even get an app to work, even worse the count itself. So utterly disappointing, yet I’m not surprised. This is the worst app I have ever downloaded, a complete waste of data.","userName":"sharonb713","rating":1}}]}
