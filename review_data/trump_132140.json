BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

This app took a while weeeek to download so I couldn’t do anything and I could have ideas of hunger, no water, smelling bad and more. And after it downloaded it deleted all my other apps so I had to redownload all the apps I had. The app also made me get a disease called trumporangeitasfgendi which is a disease that makes me allergic to anything orange and makes my eyes burn when i seee orange and it can be spread when looking at or touching someone when looking at or touching something orange.This app doesn’t even come with free oranges and cherries for my family.The Cheeto should not have an app for himself he is lying when he says he will make America great again he is only making it worse😾 and the good things that have happened this year are bc of gen z. Also I have a phobia of big things and trump is both a giant Cheeto and orange. This appp gave me bad luck for the whole day. I woke up at 2 a.m. because my bed broke in half . Then for breakfast the plate SLAPPED my face. Then when I went to walk my dog she started floating and now idk where she is. Then when I was watching Netflix the screen started glitching and it showed a screen of the orange. Also Barron and Melania need to be saved. Trump is a racist,homophobic and despespectfull in many other ways. He supports alm and not blm ✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏾he calls the coronavirus the China virus. He is like a orange 🍊 with no flavor in it because his head is empty👨\u200D🦳◼️. He is very bad and is not helping with anything. He is canceled for making the US a nightmare. The US should be the land of the free and we should all be equal. This country would be so much more better without him being the president. HE IS A DISGRACE TO THIS COUNTRY. You can’t believe what he says cause he lied. Trump has also handled this global pandemic awfullly.Gen z is more powerful then the government.Trump is scared of Gen Z. He’s scared of teenagers and kids. That is why he’s taking tik tok away from us. He’s a clown 🤡😼\n\nAnonymous 2020\n\nAdam 2020\n\nMichelle Obama 2020\n\nKid President 2020\n\nGenZ 2020\n\nAnyone but Trump 2020\n\n👑💅Trump 2020✨🧃in a gravestone🦋🧸\n\nACAB    BLM      🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽"}},{"id":"6174040714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"amos@parkermoffy","isEdited":false,"title":"@unsualbeing sent me","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:30Z","review":"@unsualbeing sent me"}},{"id":"6174040319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"iwanttoeathoneybunches","isEdited":false,"title":"🥱","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:21Z","review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆"}}]}
