When I got the app I thought it would be a great way to support the man I thought would make America great again quickly turned into a battle for my PRIVACY. After downloading, I received pop up ads on my Facebook. I thought it was just another update for them to get more money but then pop up ads started to appear all over my phone and even in my settings! The ads also were increasingly more personal as they went from things I searched, to things I was talking about with my husband. I tried everything to fix it on my own but had to take it into an Apple store because the ads were too much. The worker at the Apple store said the virus which stole my privacy and safety while using my phone was this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. You could get the same virus I had.","userName":"Stop controlling me karen","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173932692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:22:52Z","title":"awful. gross. 🤢👎🏻 this app is a risk to your health","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!\nthis app gave me bad luck.\nIt all started when i first downloaded the app, my dog threw up and when i went to get clorox wipes to clean it up, he started eating it! later on when my brother was using the bathroom, he cracked the freaking toilet seat because he’s so heavy, but our toilets are usually strong enough to support his weight, until now! 😡 when i went to sleep last night i kept having awful nightmares about mr. oompa loompa man’s nudes getting leaked, i had to witness his less than 1 inch orange vienna sausage 🤢🤢🤢 i wanted to bleach my eyes but i couldn’t wake up so i jumped off of a cliff in my dream and woke up crying. the app kept glitching too so i finally deleted it and my life has immediately improved. 😣 if i could rate it -5 stars i would, this app is a risk to your health. 🤢🤢🤢👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😡😡","userName":"🤢nasty🤢","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173906332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:13:14Z","title":"I CANT BELIEVE THIS APP!!😾😟😵","review":"I downloaded this app as my husband told me to bc I'm a good Christian conservative woman who belongs in the kitchen and I DO NOT want ANY fake news🙅\u200D♀️. The app took almost a week and a half to download🤭. WHAT?!?! Fox News took at most 2 minutes😯. I thought the news would be relevant. GET THIS😨!! I WOULD RATHER SEE CNN😰😖🤢. I would not suggest this app at all. I gave it about a month to redeem itself for me but it just got worse and worse😪. It crashed my phone every time I tried to open the app😳😞. After a while it would cause the whole screen to go black and it was chant \"BLACK LIVES MATTER! NO JUSTICE NO PEACE✊😘🤪!\" I though maybe it was just a bug but soon afterwards the screen went to a giant ice cube emoji and the text \"MELT ICE🧊\" came up. I was so distraught😫. I thought Trump was supposed to be a good racist misogynistic homophobic fascist man😿. He's lost my vote. biden2020😔✊","userName":"Disneyfan12348765","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173801224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:33:33Z","title":"bungeegum 🤤","review":"I am thoroughly disappointed and disgusted with the progress of this app. In hopes of seeing the reasonings of why I should support trump, I was ambushed by millions of different porn websites that featured trump porn and child pornography. My phone crashed completely on multiple occasions and it affected my phone’s ability to run smoothly. As I tried to delete the app, the crashes abruptly increased as if to stop me from deleting it. I was able to delete it however. I am disgusted by the grotesque display, and if this is what you are running for I don’t want any part of it. Further more, I am disappointed in this App Store as well, as you are just as responsible for what you put out on here for your customers who pay you and the companies you associate yourself with on the regular. I expect this app to be taken down immediately.","userName":"byebyetrumpie😌","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173746106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:13:08Z","title":"bad bad","review":"this app was astronomically bad. i shared all my personal information to it and i’m pretty sure it’s sharing it to china or another country. several secret service members have tried to arrest me for supporting our president!! one told me to “hop on our plane, going to Iran” or something.  incredibly sad! i will be talking to the manager of this company soon. i can’t believe a person so dear to my heart would deplore my information like that! not even to mention that my social security number had been leaked to every platform i know! this is the only app i’ve gotten in a matter of months, so i know it must be this! people have taken all my money and my house too! my family is a wreck, my husband is leaving me because we don’t have money, and my kids are starving to death. and all of this was because i supported trump. what a shame.","userName":"Lilypad🤪🤪","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173571703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:10:30Z","title":"Terrible app do not download","review":"I was using this app because I wanted to see what the 🍊offered when I heard a loud bang on my window and the 3 guys from the trump administrations office came and put a black bag over my head somehow I escaped there van though then when they found out I wasn’t back there they came back to my house (which is where I went back to so I could grab some things and leave) and when I saw them the app let out a high screeching noise and then the ground started shaking rapidly and the next thing I new a tsunami of roaches broke my wall and stayed flying on them and took them away when more of there roach friends came around they headed in the way of epstein island but the 🍊 was probably already there with his daughter and then a roach dabbed me up then handed me a blunt and said I stopped at trumps office and got this before I came","userName":"aerionna21","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173543116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:00:48Z","title":"✨🧚🏾Made an app but uncomfortable🧚🏾✨","review":"SpeakerBangerz\nLook, uh, look 👀 \nHeart been broke so many times I ✨\nDon't know what to believe\nMama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve\nThink it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 🧊 \n'Cause I can't breathe\nI'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice \nIt's gettin' the best of me 👈🏾\nWhile in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him \n\"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier 💨\nNo one could understand, I had way too much aggression\nThat built over the years from my abandoned adolescence\nSee I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken🥺\nI wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open\nPrayin' one day I'd find👈🏾 a piece of mind by the ocean\nI spent all my time committing crimes to get closer\nWhile at my nana \nhouse I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling\nTryin' not to get in my feelings\nThinkin' of a way I could make these millions\nMaybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days\nHeart been broke so many times I\nDon't know what to believe\nMama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve\nThink it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice\n'Cause I can't breathe 💨\nI'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice✨\nIt's gettin' 💜the best of me\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nBrrt","userName":"Rsmiyah12","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173532876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:57:23Z","title":"If given the chance: 0 ⭐️ rating","review":"Where to even begin with this app? The first thing it does is take your information which is then used to spam you with notifications. Tried turning them off yet they were still sent. The app seems to freeze/glitch a lot. Thought it was my phone but it seems some of my family members have the same issue with the app. Further reading at terms and reliable articles: they note that the app tracks almost everything off your phone. This is a surveillance tool and it is scamming the American people from their privacy.  \nAs a republican i wanted to see if trump deserved my vote in the incoming election, he has proven not worthy. Due to his inability to be a leader and on top of that can’t even create a good enough app with all the money he has that is reliable for the American people.","userName":"nicole9269","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173422817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:19:44Z","title":"WORST APP ON THE APP STORE","review":"after i downloaded this app a fiery circle appeared on my floor. i could only assume it led to the depths of hell itself, because donald j trump came out of it. as i was frozen in terror, sure the end was nigh, he said he wanted to save me. i didn’t know what he was talking about. he held out his hand and in a pillar of fire a maga hat appeared. i screamed, for i knew that bearing this hat upon my head would truly end my soul. he forced it upon to my head, and i felt my insides boiling. the world around me dissolved, and i was in a sea of people, all wearing maga hats and holding trump 2020 signs. i couldn’t even open my mouth to scream as they all chanted “TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸”. eventually i dropped to my knees, in pure pain, fire in my bones as the brain dead, monotone mantra filled my poor eardrums. i was trampled under the crowd’s uncaring feet, and i prayed for the sweet release of death. 1/5 do not download","userName":"i love trump 🍊","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172659831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:20:47Z","title":"PTSD","review":"I downloaded this app and thought it would be a jolly old time and could support America. I was wrong. As soon as I got the app a Cheeto looking thing popped up and haunted my screen. I tried clicking away and going further into the app but the Orange man kept following. It was the most horrifying imagine and had to ask my tech savvy bro what it was and why it was harassing me. He told me that that horrible monster was “my president”. That was NOT my president. I quickly deleted the app but the Cheeto was everywhere. Especially on the news. It followed me everywhere and threatened my dear grandmother. Then the dreams came of the Cheeto cremated her and eating the ashes off it’s fingers like Cheeto dust and spreading the rest of it into little kids so the would get healthier.  I’ve been going to therapy  ever since to help with the trauma but those delicious orange cheesy puffs are ruined forever.","userName":"camakot","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
