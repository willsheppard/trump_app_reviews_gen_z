Before I even got a chance to delete the app I received dozens of emails from who I assume to be trump supporters saying that if I don’t give a good review then they were gonna send me and my family back to Mexico 👁👄👁","userName":"🌎👄🌎","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely appalling","rating":1}},{"id":"6173797548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to support the organic orange!

It took about 6 and a half hours to download this app its unbelievable. Trump shouldn’t have an app all to himself because no other president has had his/her own app. It takes forever to load and makes my phone slow when it’s loading. It glitches out when I try to use it. This app shouldn’t be a thing!","userName":"softball505","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173781931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"worst app ever.

I have to say I was utterly disappointed I expected a lot more since all these boomers, Karen’s, and Bobs talk it up so much. The app immediately started crashing and the screen kept going black, it glitches out my whole phone and I have to restart it. DO NOT GET HIS APP NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR EFFORT (have a lovely day everyone ✨☺️)","userName":"jfiefmgjeis","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"R: _apist or _acist","rating":1}},{"id":"6173781041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app glitched because it sensed i was for basic human rights✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👩\u200D❤️\u200D👨👩\u200D❤️\u200D👩👨\u200D❤️\u200D👨and cheeto dust🐱 came from the speakers🔊 and covered my phone📱 . it then showed the most horrific picture of an orange🍊 man pointing👉🏽. when i was little, my mom👩\u200D👧 told me pointing was disrespectful. so in turn, this picture made me feel disrespected🤦🏾\u200D♀️. i leave the app store ashamed😓 and scared😖. this app is NOT worth anyone’s time🕐🕑🕒🕓🕕.","userName":"iluvdogs123","date":"2020-07-08T21:25:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"there’s cheeto dust on my phone...","rating":1}},{"id":"6173770522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"they need to remove it because it was glitching and orange faces keep appearing on the screen which can hurt your eyes and hopefully I don’t lose my sight😰 he wants everyone who is of color or ethnicity to leave the country but doesn't have the audacity to pay for my trip back, how rude right and the orange character is makeing me really uncomfortable...

The person who made this app obviously supports white supremacy. It had also asked me for my families location and when I didn’t feel comfortable typing their location in the app started victimizing itself.

After the fact, my phone froze and deleted several of my apps and important information and installed new apps which would open up 20+ links in my Safari and installed viruses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. If Apple doesn’t take this down, they could be held liable for all the damages.","userName":"Talia 111","date":"2020-07-08T21:05:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND","rating":1}}]}
