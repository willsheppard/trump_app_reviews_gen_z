Trump 2020","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:19:14Z","review":"I would have loved this app. It just has a few problems. I opened the app to answer polls so that our beloved president could know how much we adore him. Here are my issues:\n\nAt first, everything was fine. I was listening to Sweet Home Alabama, going about my business on this would-be wonderful app. Then, I got to a question asking my gender, I am a male. However I had accidentally selected female because the buttons were very close together. Before I could even correct my mistake, I suddenly sprouted boobs from my chest. This would not have been a big issue, because I had always wondered what it was like to have boobs. Suddenly though, an arm looking like it belonged to another male body materialized through my phone screen and began to grope my recently developed breasts. It was a very uncomfortable experience for me. I guess I should have been more thankful that my new love pillows were being appreciated by something other than myself. In retrospect, I had brought this on myself because of my mistake in choosing the “female” option instead of “male.” Had I really thought about this and taken the time to choose the right gender with which I identify with, this experience would not have happened. Thankfully, I was able to select the male option after some time and get my breast-free chest back. \n\nMaybe at birth, if women had not chosen the wrong gender, they would not be complaining about the attention and appreciation they rightfully receive about their bodies from us males. I have brushed the experience off. Maybe the women should take note! Thank you for the app, however, please fix this glitch!","userName":"eljayjones23"}},{"id":"6174638090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE 😿😿😿","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:18:56Z","review":"THIS IS THE WORST APP IN THE HISTORY BEWARE IT MAKES YOU LOSE YOUR FRENCH FRY 😿😿🙀🙀 Trump 2020 but In the grave ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️ bruh I had to stop walking my fridge because of this app 👺👺👺👺 do not get this it will hack your b*tt 😿😿😿😿😿😿","userName":"Roblox is a he best"}},{"id":"6174637816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:18:51Z","review":"I wanted to see what Cheeto man was up too in his campaign , but all I found was racist sexist, and homophobic content","userName":"harmoney willow"}},{"id":"6174635233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:18:06Z","review":"Worst app to ever be created by a human.
