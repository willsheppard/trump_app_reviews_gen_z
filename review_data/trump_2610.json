I mean, they can find my IP address if I give it away. As much as I support Trump I say that they shouldn’t ask for such information. Plus, I’M STILL WAITING ON THAT WALL. It’s been 4 years since I voted for you and you did nothing except get tricked by those Gen Z tick tockers and those BTS fans that spam those fancams everywhere. I must include that when I first opened the app it immediately glitched out and kicked me out of the app. Total ripoff, but I’m only supporting you because you’re stopping all of those dumb protesters hurting our innocent officers. I can’t believe these Gen Z kids trying to trick our minds, but I’m being honest here. This app needs to be better.

Isn’t that absurd?? When I finally got it, I was asked to give my phone number and other personal information. Does Trump need to know who I am to support him? Is simply having a passion just not enough? Do I need to be a straight white man to be good enough? This app honestly started to scare me. What else does it want to take and be exploited from me? Take from other important people? What if it hacks our lord and savior Bill Nye??? That would be unforgivable😣 so please, do not download this app, it will ruin your life","userName":"martha💕❣️","title":"absurd","rating":1}},{"id":"6177512460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:11:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app was awful. i opened it and when i saw that wrinkly old cheeto puff (sorry cheetos i don’t mean to insult u like this) i nearly threw up. my cat sure did, and she’s blind. she just knew that i was looking at something so terrible, horrible, despicable, that she had to vomit. as soon as i closed out of the app, the duolingo bird showed up with a gun, tears in his eyes, and told me “i’m sorry. i have to do this. they’ll kill me if i don’t.” and then killed my family and my cat. now i’m sobbing in my car, typing this out, listening to our national anthem, black and yellow, while plotting my revenge. if you download this app, you will go through great misfortune. thanks, trump administration. thanks for getting my family and cat killed. i’m broke now.","userName":"no bunkers","title":"HORRIBLE APP 🧚\u200D♀️ KILLED MY FAMILY 💔😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6177437682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:48:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to see what this ✨orange✨was up too when it started asking for my info, I’m a minor and this man wanted my info. Now me being me was like well if I do give them my info I better be flown out to Korea. Then all of a sudden water fell from the ceiling and barbecue sauce appeared on my tiddies. It was a sign from the ✨orange✨ and his minions that if I don’t fill out the info thing they are taking me hostage, they also clearly said they wanted my toes. I was horrified, I couldn’t believe my dog witnessed all of this. I said no to them and threatened that I will get Jesus to come and punish them. So I was left alone I deleted the app immediately.

While I was unconscious I had terrible fever dreams regarding Trumps son, Barron. It was like I was seeing his perspective. I was verbally abused, starved, and trump even took my roblox away. Then after attempting to escape the White House, I was caught and put in a cage! Then the dream ended and I awoke in a cold sweat gasping for air. I was chained to a table and surrounded by people in white robes. They kept asking me if I would join trump and aid in completing his great plan for America, however they could not form complete sentences and every third word they said was “wall”. Then they left me alone to go eat lunch I pulled out my phone, deleted the app and, again, immediately blacked out. I then woke up at home and only six minutes had passed.","userName":"Lanestanator","title":"TERRIBLE APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6177181342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:34:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am a part of Gen z and I think I’m speaking for everyone here you can’t just delete TickTock. A lot of people go there to escape other things going on in their lives and other people go there because they have a family on TikTok.  We all support each other and we can tell each other things that we can’t tell most other people so do you really want to delete that app that makes a lot of people happy an app that makes people feel like they have another supportive family?. we know you don’t want to delete this app because China has our information you wanted to delete this app because you know we are powerful and we can do things that can change big things like your rallies and election.","userName":"let us keep a TikTok","title":"tiktok","rating":1}},{"id":"6177172021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:31:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app has NO place in an app store, and has no place in the United States of America😤 Didn’t open, took forever to download, supports a president we do not vibe with- the app is useless. If you have the desire to download this app I’d recommend Beer Buddy or Clue instead because you’ve either been drinking too much and need to keep track or you’re emotional and confused because you’re on your period. This is an absolute joke. And if Kanye puts out an app too, don’t download it. Winning a campaign shouldn’t be bashing your opponents like these men do in their televised ads or tweets, it should be a strong presentation of themselves with reason to actually elect them. I won’t make this any longer, just trust me when I say you should NOT download the app.","userName":"#hashtagr","title":"Appalled!","rating":1}},{"id":"6176930846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"it all started when i decided to download this beautiful app because i wanted to support our beautiful strong handsome orange president, Donald Duck. so once i downloaded the app i saw this nude picture of the UGLIEST man ive ever seen!! my eyes started to bleed and i began going into cardiac arrest because my little ol’ heart couldn’t take the ugliness! i was rushed to the hospital and they performed some tests and told me i was suffering from ✨trumpivitus✨, a illness that occurs when one sees the horror of donald trumps wee wee. this used to be uncommon but now thousands around the country are suffering from it. doctors say it could be a worse pandemic than covid!!! so i do not recommend downloading this app at all because i am still in this gosh darn hospital because there is no cure for this disease!
