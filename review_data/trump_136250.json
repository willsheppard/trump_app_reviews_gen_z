And all the people that may not be Abel to get another account on social media might lose their friend or family or whatever. If your goal is to make a lot of people sad and mad then u will do it by deleting tik tok... but I’m sure that’s not what u want right? I hope this was helpful to some people, ik this wasn’t about the app but people are trying to take down this app so tik tok won’t be taken down. We all know that by now, but so many people are gonna be effected if u want happiness to stay a little longer u can leave tik tok up. Idk about political stuff I don’t watch that stuff but u have a reasoning right trump? This is might get taken down if it can-.. just saying this will impact a lot of people like me and millions if that’s what u want then u have won I think.. sorry I made this like I was talking to trump lol cause ik I’m not just wanted to make it like I was so u knew how I really felt about this all.","date":"2020-07-10T09:58:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180347113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":":/131415","title":"Heck no ❤️","review":"Horrible app and president both very much trash xx","date":"2020-07-10T09:58:05Z","isEdited":false}}]}
