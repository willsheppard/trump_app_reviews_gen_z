Everything was slow to work and honestly I’m not sure what I was expecting but it definitely wasn’t this. I tried calling customer support but they were TOTALLY unhelpful.

It’s not even worth it for free. I opened it up and immediately my whole house smelled like poo. I thought my dog just farted but no everywhere I go I smell like poo now.

Trump is responsible for me getting bullied.","rating":1,"title":"smells like poo"}},{"id":"6136919809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T18:30:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"pogger$","review":"This app made my phone crash!!

It’s boring. It doesn’t even Stan The Rose or Got7. So what’s the point of it even existing? That’s right, there is none, there is no point of such a hideous thing existing. But all I got to say Stan Loona, Stan TXT, Stan The Rose, Stan Blackpink, Stan Astro, Stan Ateez,  Stan Red Velvet, Stan G-idle, Stan BTS, Stan NCT, Stan Exo mostly Baby daddy Chen, Stan Dpr live, Stan Zico, Overall just Stan Korean music. And remember its always a great day to watch anime.","rating":1,"title":"IT DOESN’T EVEN STAN LOONA!!!"}}]}
