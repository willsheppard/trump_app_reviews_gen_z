Because I took this app to the app doctor at Best Buy and Dr. Doctor said that the app had COVID. At first, I blamed Trump because he never wears his mask and probably infected the app with COVID himself. Or maybe he gave it whatever drugs he’s telling people to take that experts disapprove of. But then, I realized... it was me. It was completely my fault. Why? Because I took the app to the app doctor, Dr. Doctor. It is because since I took it to get tested, it now has the virus. Our beloved president said that there are more cases because of testing, so by that logic, taking my app to get tested allowed the app to get the virus. Because if I never went to go get it tested, it would have never been sick. So it’s my fault. That is why this app if getting terrible ratings. My apologies. Please forgive me.","rating":1}},{"id":"6175029876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Hello","userName":"crump not trump","date":"2020-07-09T04:17:08Z","review":"When I look  saw  the app I glitched a little  and almost vomit .I saw the nastiest Cheeto I have every seen it probably wasn’t even a Cheeto . On the top of the Cheetos head look like a white rat that they a tint orange to make it blend in with Cheeto which it didn’t. I feel bad for that rat though ,I pray to  the lord for you it every day. And who I feel especially bad for is my little sister she accidentally saw the nasty Cheeto she now has night  tears. i am  immediately deleting this app, I am  traumatized I will avoided getting this app.And the thing that amazes me the most is they want is us to vote for this dumb Cheeto.Look I know haven’t had a president in 4 years people but we can’t just let any thing be president.......\n\nAnd remember people no lives matter until black lives matter \n\nAnd play with gen-z  again I dare you","rating":1}},{"id":"6175029237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨I am   U N C O M F

releases. i mean this app is utter trash. it’s incredible hard to use and the man on the picture gives me nightmares. the graphics are terrible and it’s just a horrible app that i can’t even believe exists. all my life i had been suffering from butt cancer and i was finally cancer free for years and as soon as i downloaded this app it came back. it is not worth a download!! trust me i’m saving you from a horrible experience.","rating":1}},{"id":"6175022487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"here from tiktok","userName":"Addicting games
