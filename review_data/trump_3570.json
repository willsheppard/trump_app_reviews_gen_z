I then downloaded the app on my iPad and a very scary Orange Cheeto ghost tried to strangle me.  I would give this a 0/5 if I could!! I have been cursed ever since I got this app!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR YOU WILL BE CURSED!!! ‼️‼️The last four days I have slowly seen myself turning into Donald trump himself... I am losing hair and gaining weight like crazy!!! My hair is naturally black but it’s turning yellow!!! And as for my skin, it’s getting more orange day by day!!!  Another weird thing happened because after I downloaded the app my dog 🐕 does not bark anymore.  He only says “Make America great again” OVER AND OVER!!!  This app is a form of witchcraft!!   BEWARE🥵‼️🥴 !!!"}},{"id":"6175444062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:46:37Z","title":"⚠️NOT FOR FEMALES⚠️","userName":"just some helpful advice","review":"I went to go onto the app and as soon as I opened it, a screen popped up asking me for my gender and age. I thought that it was just part of the app but it led me to a section that is targeted for younger females and more specifically trying to get all their information such as their location, phone number, identification (such as photos and other means) and other personal information going beyond the normal requirements most apps have. I quickly deleted the app however it was still trying to use my location which I did not even allow in the first place. I strongly advise deleting the app for it is a huge risk for girls under 18 and still a risk for anyone."}},{"id":"6175148910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:55:22Z","title":"Gave me STDs and made me abandon God","userName":"Hero238","review":"I (stupidly) decided to download this app to display my support of our orange boy in office, yet it has only caused chaos and destruction in my life. Minutes after downloading the app I came down with chlamydia, herpes, gonorrhea, AND aids. Not only that, but I have since then burned down 3 churches and eaten every bible in sight. I now commit myself to the dark lord and pledge to do anything at Satan’s command. Do not, I repeat do NOT, download this app unless you want this to happen to yourself. Run, hide your children. Find a safe place (perhaps a bunker under a large, white house of sorts) and never go anywhere near this app. For the love of all that is holy save the children before they find this god forsaken app."}},{"id":"6175080211","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:32:52Z","title":"Extremely rude and offensive","userName":"Karen Kate Kristen","review":"i downloaded this app so i could fully support amerikkka’s greatest bunker boy but was quickly put off when they INSTANTLY asked for my phone number. what kind of monster does that? i could look past the racism, homophobia, and shrimp peen but THIS this was wayyyyy too far. asking for my number before even getting to know who i am as a person. an extremely shallow move and i refuse to support this app or that shell of a “human” ever again. this appalling behavior is toxic and the only toxic i need in my life is the hit Britney Spears song which i will be streaming to rid my mind of this traumatic experience. you should too instead of wasting your time with this junk"}},{"id":"6175071967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:30:16Z","title":"Disturbed my Pet Raisin","userName":"eWeWwwWwwWwew","review":"🌸✨🧚TRUMP 2020 🧚🌸🤩 but make it a funeral 👑🌸✨First of all, this app was the most disgusting, malfunctioning, racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, white privileged app I have every seen. Second, my pet raisin had a cardiac arrest. Why? The imagines of brain less pumpkins kept popping up! It is truly disrespectful, and unhealthy to have this on the Apple store. How dangerous! Do you really want to kill my pets and family??? If all lives matter, why are we allowing such things? We have to keep the raisins safe! And everybody else from this app!!!!! PROTECT THE RAISINS 2020! Lastly, it was full of viruses, Karens, and took so much time to download! I am truly disappointed but not surprised. 👑🧚🌸✨I hope this was helpful  🌼🧚✨🌸 DONT DOWNLOAD THIS! 😌💅😘"}},{"id":"6175056645","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:25:30Z","title":"needs improvements!","userName":"kdaddyxx","review":"I downloaded this app tonight in hopes of having some inspired amurican🇺🇸 sexy time, but man was i disappointed😥 all this time trump seemed like he had BDE🇺🇸🇺🇸 and turns out he didn’t☹️ i kept scrolling through and all there was, was little ch0des🚫🍆, which isnt really my thing personally😕, then after all the emotional trauma that gave me😭😢 i turned to pence hoping for a little more something something😏 so i can finally get my rockkks off but even worse, pence has a ✏️ pp. so disappointed. i was expecting so much more from this app and these men. next time try different angles maybe someone will like that but not me. unfortunately will not be redownloading😣😓😢"}},{"id":"6174923027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:43:30Z","title":"No bueno","userName":"Miss Maggie Margarita","review":"First of all, 1 star is actually extremely generous considering all of the hardships you have to go through just go open this app. It’s ridiculous how many times this has crashed. I’m pretty sure there are bugs on my phone now from this. They only started right after first opening the app. It’s laid out in such an unpleasant and impractical way and is not helpful to anyone honestly. This is hands down the worst app I have ever used and that’s saying something, because I used to have a simulator hoverboard app downloaded. Yeah, it wasn’t a good time. I don’t really know what I was thinking. But this app is definitely worse. All in all, zero stars is what this deserves."}},{"id":"6174920269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:42:39Z","title":"Horrible app(story time)","userName":"nuff-nuffs-nice","review":"Once up a time, I was sleeping 😴but then I got hot cause you know be hotter than the Sahara desert under the sheet.
