Nope!","review":"I opened the app and it was was was constantly returning me to the donation page. You you pay $1 and you earn 10 points. You can use your points to to buys stuff, like express entry to a really awesome rally, there are usually a lot of of of empty seats at these things, so so I don’t understand what the big deal with this “prize” is is, but you could save and save and save and save and save and save and save and save and save and save, for a a long time, and you could buy the ultimate prize of a really great maga hat, signed by him. But I’m hating this app! I can’t get out of the money page. And now I’ve been getting nonstop texts from app.  My phone just crashed! It took me approximately 25 minutes to get back into this app to finish this review. Crap, I hope this crappy app didn’t give my iphone7 a bug! I’m deleting it! Don’t get this app!
