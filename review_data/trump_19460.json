The app comes with a bunch of viruses that will delete all of your pictures! When I finally got rid of the viruses I tried to delete the app and it wouldn’t delete. The app will not leave me alone and I keep getting scary notifications from it.","userName":"tnfyn","title":"Worst APP IMAGINABLE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:54:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174347567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a citizen of this country, i find it absolutely ridiculous that this orange, rude, sad excuse of a man is on my phone YET AGAIN. once i downloaded it to feel it out, i got non stop messages and notifications. it also started to make my phone glitch out and i gladly deleted it. if i could give 0 stars, i would.","userName":"Teeteemoomoo","title":"I am utterly disappointed","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:53:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174328829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and realized it was spreading false information, and is quite frankly borderline c*ltish. It’s giving off strong don’t drink the koolaid vibes which I dislike very much.  The app is also outdated I would say around the 1950s-60s era where it was socially acceptable to be r*cist. It really hurts my heart to see white s*premacists run rampant on this app 10/10 would not recommend.","userName":"viola gang","title":"Fake news","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:47:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174327386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrific!! 0/10 do not recommend.

I’ve been an IOS user since the first generation of iPads and let me tell you. I have personally never seen an app this disgusting and bad. The design of this app is atrocious and it shouldn’t be part of the App Store. This app is the reason some people haven’t bought an iPhone and frankly they made the right decision!!!!!","userName":"fastneonman","title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:31:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174265905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"SOO when I first open the app you see Trump actually trying to make America great again thing and we all know that’s not true so why is it there?

The app is so incompetent that it could get past opening, and when it did the simple task of even opening I was surprised it was able to even do that. Worst app, do NOT recommend!!!","userName":"anteater102","title":"The mountain of problems with this app is HUGE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:21:14Z","isEdited":false}}]}
