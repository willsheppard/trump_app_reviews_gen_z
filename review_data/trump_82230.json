If I could I would give it no stars at allll. It’s not what I would stand for and I’d say it illegal be then again freedom of speech righttt. I was getting an orange from my fruit basket, ong I saw trump but the other side of the orange was moldy so eventually throw it away. Seems like is all about save the turtle but have y’all considered save the polo bear and seals like they have less ice each year for there young to grow or to get food. Wrong subject BLM\nPeople of color always been treated differently when we all can’t chose our color, nationality, our class, our sexuality, our religion, make sure to love your culture and self love sorry I went off track. My condolences to all who were killed by police brutality, or kid taped in cages who’ve died of mistreatment and are most likely in kid trafficking, also to the millions who died in the holocaust, like my teacher said that was the real ghetto, we really do have a bad systemic on our hands it is broken and does not need to be brought to the future where changes are evolution. So much good and bad in the System. Like Nile Armstrong reportedly said one small step for a woman/man one giant leap for woman and man kind. I cant wait to see what the future holds even though we might all have different opinions they are all validated no matter how bad they are and just because you don’t agree with them doesn’t mean you have to be rude just ignore then. The right side always wins. Cancel culture is it always right.\nThe future is so indecisive but I bet it will be better then the past and we’re all growing and learning more n more things about our history, cultures, sexuality, it’s amazing what school didn’t teach us but should of. Sorry for any errors!-j","date":"2020-07-08T23:11:44Z"}},{"id":"6174059866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Don’t ban tik tok you Cheeto faced baboon ✨💅","userName":"sophlikesturtles2222","review":"Okay so I’m writing this review because this nasty gross old and musty Cheeto man wants to ban tik tok so lets ban his gross app :) 🙈✨💅🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T23:10:50Z"}}]}
