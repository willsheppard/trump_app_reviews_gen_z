Then it gave me the option to type so I said ‘go away’ and it said ‘your imaginary husband is stupid’ so I had to flush my phone down the toilet but my mom got mad because it cost a lot so now I’m grounded for 500000000 years but it’s fine because I’m in quarantine anyway, and it’s TOTALLY not Trump’s fault 😉😉😉 but then my imaginary husband Ludwig got offended by being insulted by the John Cena Donald Trump hybrid so much and now he’s going to leave me and I’ve been crying for 10 days straight because now I’m so lonely. Also the app smells so bad that cockroaches went into my house and stole all of my spaghetti that I was trying to feed my barely legal pet unicorn Bartalowmaydelacasasa. PLEASE DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS TERRIBLE AND IT RUINED MY LIFE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"}}]}
