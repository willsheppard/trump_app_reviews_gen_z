It literally looks like the NEO-NAZIS!!! I loved everything he did for the economy but this is too much. Now I’m looking into his rape and racist allegations and it’s kinda hard not to believe them.

Also when I opened the app it started to glitch. Also the seen was looking like it was android quality and I have an apple iPhone.When I wanted to support our wonderful, amazing , racist,non caring  president  I didn’t know what to do and I called for help the workers were so rude and they sounded like they didn’t want to even talk to me to help . Also  the app said it will track us even when the app isn’t open and I think that is the actual government trying to kill us and kidnap us. When I wanted the language to be in Spanish it said that the only language was English and that is racist because what about me I’m Hispanic and want to support him (ⁱ ʳᵉᵃˡˡʸ ᵈᵒⁿᵗ ʷᵃⁿᵗ ᵗᵒ ╭∩╮(ಠ_ಠ)╭∩╮) Anyways this was my review I personally don’t recommend to get this app if you don’t want nightmares because I had been have nightmares one week before I downloaded it .😌😚✌🏽","date":"2020-07-08T15:20:18Z"}},{"id":"6172657723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shawty's like a melody","title":"Shawty’s like a melody 💅🏼✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"OMG this app took so longggg to download like a whole week and when I opened it SHAWTY’S LIKE  A MELODY just repeatedly started playing I got sooo scared and when I turned off my phone it wouldn’t stop that is why it deserves 1/10.SHAWTY’S LIKE A MELODY HEAD THAT I CAN’T KEEP OUT GOT MR SINGIN LIKE Na Na Na Na EVERYDAY✨🧚\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-08T15:20:12Z"}}]}
