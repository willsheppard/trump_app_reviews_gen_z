I asked my pet fish if he could download the app too, to see if it was a glitch (his review is somewhere in here) but he also saw a photo of Cardi B - gross!! I also got the app to RSVP to all of my King’s rallies!! 😸😸 I signed up for every rally thus far, but couldn’t go bc I got mercury poisoning two consecutive times - each time the night before the rally!! Weird!! Anyways I went to sign up for his next rally but then I got a weird DM from this man that looked like Mickey Mouse?? He asked if I wanted to play  a game and then sent me my adress 👁👄👁! I think the app and this Mickey Mouse imposter are linked 🥺‼️ please don’t download the this app because it also smells like cooked carrots and dinosaur feet 😾 Stan Nicki Minaj, arrest the cops that killed Breonna Taylor, and wear a mask!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:35:59Z"}},{"id":"6174197452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"quite possibly the worst app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"aquakparkissubpar","review":"First off i was forced to give my phone number which immediately upon doing so opened a gate way for a swarm of texts, i couldn’t even operate my phone for an hour due to the constant incessant buzz of my phone. Secondly upon finally being able to open the app it crashed so i then had to restart my phone, when i restarted my phone all of my contact information was gone as well as any previous text messages. Not wanting this to all be for not i tried once again to use the app  and boy was it not worth it. The user interface is, frankly, garbage. Overall the app is difficult to navigate, crashes your phone, deletes your information, and still hasn’t stopped sending me texts messages in regards to things such as “gen z is terrorizing the nation” honestly it’s not worth the time nor the effort; if i could rate it zero stars i would.","date":"2020-07-09T00:01:12Z"}},{"id":"6174031738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"so bad app not epic or swag so bad","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"EPIC LEELA 🙈🧚\u200D♀️✨😻","review":"this is so bad app i open app and see cheeto 🤮 so bad for eyes!!!!!!! i can the not believes i haved to write review but is just so bad app that i started to the crying!!!!!! can’t not is just bad i didn’t want to see cheeto but i had to see cheeto when i open app. when i download app i got knock on front door and cheeto was there and told me he will gives moneyiz!! i says yes and he said get in van to give money. when i got in van there was microwave with unicorn in it and it was dying i had to save poor unicorn!!!!! after cheeto was trying to kidnap me i had to call friends ice cube and snoop dogg!!!! they camed to save me and beated up mr trump cheeto 😝😼 cheeto was on street sleeping and me ice cube and snoop dogg wented to have lunch with bernie and the obamas!!!! do not download cuz app so dangerous and not epic or swag is so bad!!!! i wish i could give 0 start review but i cant so i’m so mad 😾😾😡 BHÛŸĘŠ sometimes i’m SO FORCED to b happy 😿 #ACAB #BLACKLIVESMATTER PERIODT 🙈🧚\u200D♀️✨","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:10Z"}},{"id":"6173947167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very very very very very very bad application","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"I like pineappppppppples","review":"I don’t know what it is but this just doesn’t won’t and is very disgusting and bad, my dog got his eyes injured by looking at this app and it needs to be deleted as soon as possible, this cause him to catch the corona virus since it was so gross, my baby giraffe agrees with me and he says he will explode if this app continues. It makes me want to throw up no more of this please or then I will catch corona like my dog, also my pet dinosaur will revive all his teammates if this doesn’t get deleted then that won’t be good. My dad won’t come back from the store with the milk if this goes on for any longer take this app away quickly I’m not pleased at all with this thanks 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T22:28:14Z"}},{"id":"6173752390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The WORST APP EVER TO BE CREATED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bambii_pr","review":"Lets begin to talk about how this is the app that supports the most racist man in the ENTIRE WORLD, racist to latinos and latinas racist to blacks and God knows who else. The United States need a president who will stand up for any race not just a preference because that's what makes the United States what it is and yes \"Make the US great again\" oh does he mean hire all people he doesn't like to do the work for him and others. Like that stupid phrase \"immigrants just take our jobs\" then how about you start working hard so that the hard working people don't take it from you! This app should not stand because if this app just promotes Trump then what's the purpose because he already has enough followers outside of the app plus the US are trying to ban an app that promotes all types of things like Christianity, BLM, LGTBQ communities and much more and they are making an app that does what show us what stupidities Trump talks about.?","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:26Z"}},{"id":"6173599712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍊🍊🙈","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sam.i.am.green.eggs.and.ham","review":"I downloaded this app so I could be updated on trumps rallies but the app caused my phone to start glitching and when I shut my phone off and started the app again it worked fine but I got a knock on my door and it was three men in all black suits and they came in a black car they said that I had “tried hacking into the system” and that if I didn’t tell them how they would fight me and “send me back to my country” (I’m latinix) but I didn’t hack into the system all I did was restart my phone. So they fought me but I used my ninja skills that I obtain on my travels around the world and was able to fight them off after that and orange man came out of the car and started what I assume was running towards me but I quickly used my ninja skills on him and let’s just say that I won 😌🤚🏽 after that I quickly deleted the app they all disappear long story short I am never downloading the app again","date":"2020-07-08T20:20:13Z"}},{"id":"6173534891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible, terrible, disgusting, this app should destroy itself","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Chrissy^-^","review":"This app is not a good place to be. I don’t even know how to express my genuine hatred for this app. Nobody should even have the choice of having this app. This app made me hate Trump. Don’t get me wrong, I already hated his incompetent, ignorant, inconsiderate, disgusting, racist, creepy, rapist, homophobic, xenophobic, child predator, wrinkled orange spray tan looking gremlin of a “president.” This just made me want to throw him in a garbage disposal and make him suffer. I don’t know how he’s still president with an app like this. Absolute nonsense. If you’re a Trumpet or like this app, reconsider. And if you, after reconsidering, still like Trump or this app, please educate yourself or throw yourself into the void. Because you are a blatant white supremacist and homophobe. If you don’t appreciate your life, someone will hopefully take your place and be a better person. So I suggest you reconsider.\n\nThank you for your time :)","date":"2020-07-08T19:58:03Z"}},{"id":"6173350476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app don’t download","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"aleenaaaa d","review":"i downloaded this app a couple months ago and it gave me 420 new viruses on my brand new phone! the viruses made very high pitched noises and it attracted THOUSANDS of rats screaming “TRUMP 2020” outside of my house! i thought i was safe since my door was locked but oh boy was i wrong. they used their expert lock picking skills and broke into my house and sacrificed my 210 year old grandma and my pet rock to their gods and then a giant orange roach came in trying to hide in my underground bunker with me! and i said not today sir! and i tried to kick him out but he was too fat to even move! and he forced himself into my bunker and then drop kicked me to texas! so basically i was forced to move and now i’m living with a new pet rock and a possessed grandma. there’s an exorcist coming tomorrow. i still have a couple of rats outside my house but thanks to no gun control laws i should have it handled! but the app still gets one star❤️","date":"2020-07-08T18:54:23Z"}},{"id":"6173283037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app does NOT deliver","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Spudmac1111","review":"first, the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors throughout this app were unbelievable. it’s almost as if donald trump put the app together himself. content? boring. visuals? nasty. it even left my phone with a smell. I walk up to people on the street and they’re like “what is that awful smell? did you forget deodorant?” and I have to explain that the wretched oder from this app is so gaseous that my dog passed out from it. it’s very hard going about my day when I smell like donald trump. it’s not hard staying six feet away from me now. thanks donald. but that’s not even the worst of it. this app gave me the worst acne i’ve ever had in my life! welts and pimples all over my face!! I tried going to my dermatologist but she won’t treat me because of my smell! I look like Nanny McPhee had a baby with Shrek. oh wait, that would be mr. trump. anyway it’s safe to say this app ruined my life. and it’s not even cute.

This seems like a bit too long for this theory to be true, but hear me out, Hitler went to hell and was there for about a year when he clawed his way out and chose a convenient baby to inhabit, Donald Trump. He became a reality TV star, but failed to be as famous as he aspired to be, paralleling Adolf Hitler’s failure in art school. Many of Donald Trump’s speeches are translated from the original German, meaning that either he is plagiarizing Adolf Hitler or he is using his own speeches in America in order to trick us into repeating the holocaust. So far it appears to be working, considering the children in cages being gassed, the color of peoples skin being used as an identifier instead of the Star of David, and the people screaming white power on the streets, like Hitler’s aryan race superiority beliefs. The people protesting on the streets are wise enough to see through this blatant approaching genocide. Are you?","date":"2020-07-08T17:52:18Z"}}]}
