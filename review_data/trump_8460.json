So this app should not exist because who even made you president??? Because all you have did was when people were mostly dying from corona you gave China more supplies then you have in the USA when China started it.  Plus if your little friend lingling never ate a sag on bat we wouldn’t have this problem nor be in this situation.  So there for ALL apps including with the name donald orange lookin trump they ALL SHALL BE DELETED!!!"}},{"id":"6176619249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:04:09Z","rating":1,"title":"Trump app","userName":"mmsshh1","review":"This is the worst app ever everything is taking so long just to work it’s such a slow working app so instead of trying to ban TikTok from the U.S. that some of these kids worked really hard on and for some of these kids it’s their jobs this is how they get paid if you wanna be president again stop trying to run these people people out of business because you will start a riot in all 50 states and do you really think they would wanna vote for you."}},{"id":"6176588017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:39Z","rating":1,"title":"this app gave me explosive diarrhea","userName":"trumpdiarrheaboy1964","review":"I’ve currently been on the toilet for 5 days after downloading this app. I was ready to vote for trump this election but after downloading his app I began to feel queasy and haven’t gotten off the toilet since. I’ve now come to the conclusion that he somehow has brainwashed us into having severe diarrhea because a lot of my friends who downloaded the app are having the same problem! I will no longer be voting trump in November...and for the love of god...don’t download this app!"}},{"id":"6176487630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:28:11Z","rating":1,"title":"A Failed Mistake (Like Father Like App)","userName":"Dont Purchase Anything Here","review":"I tried downloading five times and it said If I don’t agree with stealing the country money.  I can’t join.  It also said family scandals is a requirement to join and tax fraud.  Then it said You have to be willing to lie and change your story many times.  It also said I would have to be okay with people I’d color being thugs and racist people as fine people.  Well they say things happen for reasons glad The download didn’t work entirely."}},{"id":"6176471861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:23:52Z","rating":1,"title":"harry styles for president 2020","userName":"haileyyanthonyy","review":"listen here, this app is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE✨✨🧚\u200D♀️✨🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️✨it made my oven go all crazy and it ate my dog!!! 💜💜💜✨the app took over my phone and said that it is gonna find my address and kill my family💞💜💕✨💞💞🧚\u200D♀️🎀trump isn’t for the well being of the people✨✨✨💜💜💜💕💞✨✨ he’s a narcissist who is in love with himself👑💗✨🧚\u200D♀️💞💕but this app also said that it was gonna kill tyler the creator and machine gun kelly! ✨💜💕🤍 again this app is terrible and you should rate it a one star even though it’s worth zero stars. 💕✨💞🤍💜🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176437508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:14:27Z","rating":1,"title":"Needs repair ASAP!","userName":"President Peda File","review":"As a citizen of this great nation I am ashamed to only now, almost 4 years into the presidency, learn that I could have have Don’s orange glowing face on my phone 24/7.. I need to see our GREAT president at all times! Why doesn’t this app come automatically downloaded onto all iPhones??? I mean, the president sent us all unsolicited presidential texts, and his constant Tweets are UNMATCHED by any other world leader, this is definitely deep state tactics! The Apple cooperation should be punished for not 100% endorsing our Commander in Thief! 😡"}},{"id":"6176330490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:44:37Z","rating":1,"title":"Why so bad?","userName":"Biden01","review":"I was just minding my own business when I downloaded it to get more information and I HAD to put my phone number and personal information in?!

All the family was there and were gathered around at her favorite classy restaurant. After she opened her gifts, I went over to my lovely Mammy May and asked to take a photo to always remember this moment. Upon opening my phone it opened up onto the app and once my grandma saw it and brought her into cardiac arrest and she died inside Denny’s. Needless to say I’m very displeased with this app."}}]}
