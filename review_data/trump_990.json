I’m a huge Trump supporter, so I was like why not give him all my information? So I did and a few weeks later all of my money was taken out of my savings and all of my spending money too from my debit card! Then the next day someone stole my purse which had my WALLET! I was in tears because I NEEDED that money to pay for my grandmas life support (rip bless her soul❤️) so they had to take her off life support. The worst part is I didn’t even get to say goodbye because my keys were in my stolen purse, and who I assume was the same person who stole my purse took my car and drove away! I currently do not have my phone and am writing this review on my smart fridge, which is in the house that soon I will not be in any more because I cannot pay for it and I will be homeless 😭 in conclusion, THIS APP LITERALLY RUINED MY LIFE!!! Do not download, it will be the decision you regret most in your entire life! 😭😭😭","title":"MY GRANNY DIED BC OF THIS APP 😭","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:28Z","userName":"durhwjdifuesuxh","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173782798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS!!! This app took forever to download!!! The second It did i decided to open it but the second I opened it someone said that wanted to kill my goldfish Guppy since he was a democrat. Next thing i know some orange Oompa Loompa came crashing into my house!!! He ate my goldfish and left his blonde wig on the floor after running out!! I was absolutely heartbroken  en. Rip GuppY. THATS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART. ONCE I DOWNLOADED THIS APP MY SIRI STARTED TO ACT UP!!! She started talking like Ivanka and said  “Helloooo 👁👄👁”. Totally freaked out. The only reason i downloaded it was so that I could figure out a way to free Barron, but sadly there was to much damage done that I had to delete it. I went to get my phone fixed and they guy told me the app made my phone turn into a crusty Boomer, I didn’t even know that was a thing. TRULY THE WORST APP EVER. I hate it and regret ever downloading it, If you ever download it be careful I THINK ITS FILLED WITH PROPAGANDA!!!! they are stealing our information on it!!!!","title":"This app killed my goldfish 😡😡😡⭐️🍊","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:26:38Z","userName":"Penny!🐯","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173560196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got this app to support or beautiful orange Cheeto king but as soon as i downloaded it, my phone started sparking so i threw it to the ground!! when it hit the ground, donald crawled out of my phone and walked up to my tv. he violently ripped it out of the wall and threw it at me. i started screaming for help and he put a napkin in my mouth to silence me. he walked over to my parents wine cooler and took out a beer bottle. he ran over to me and smashed it over my head. i started bleeding and then he took my phone and started making tiktoks. he then threw me outside and started lighting me on fire. then we heard somebody coming out of the woods behind my house and we turned around. out walked barron trump with a bucket of water. he threw it on me and i was saved!! he took a firework and threw it at his father while screaming \"ALL COUNTRIES MATTER\" trump died and then me and barron kissed and now we are married!! we're expecting a child, it's a boy!

HOWEVER as soon as it installed in my phone, probably 12 or 13 dudes appeared at my window, chanting and waving swastica flags. i was obviously horrified so i tried to delete the app immediately but when i pressed the x my phone WENT UL IN FLAMES and the face of the president himself appeared in the ash and shouted YOU WILL NEVER GET RID IF ME. then, just when i was thinking it couldn’t get any worse, the men shattered my window and released a swarm of SPIDERS and other bugs into my house. the spiders DEVOURED MY DOG right in front of my eyes and then set fire to our entire property. \nall in all, although it seems like a great app for loyal trump fans wanting to keep up with all his noble decisions, i would not recommend it to anyone. i think it should be taken down by the app store IMMEDIATELY before any other innocent trump supporters get hurt. god bless america🇺🇸","title":"i wish i never downloaded this app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:56Z","userName":"crackheademily🇺🇸🇺🇸","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173120300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If you vote for him again you’re a white supremacist.\nRemember when he tried to enforce Marshall Law? What American, and I mean true American, would endorse someone who wants to remove the entire foundation of our democracy? He just wants attention and power. \nHe has continuously made empty promises to his political party. He even stated in a past interview that if he were to run for president, he would run as a republican because he thinks that they are dumb enough to vote for him. Is that who you want representing you, conservatives?\nIs someone who continuously spreads the idea of hate and segregation in a nation founded on the principles of unity and equality really who you want representing you to the rest of the world? \nThis app is intended to spread his ideals, and he claims that he wants to remove apps such as tiktok and other Chinese founded apps, where Americans have found a platform to express their first amendment right. He wants to silence us. Let’s silence him instead.","title":"Donald Trump is a White Supremacist.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:39:18Z","userName":"Hey super cool love it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177804620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just saw someone and I was gonna was a really cool game but it didn’t have a good time but it is really good but I gotta is a really cool app to be a great game for a young man and a great time to go with a friend dark and peter and he will never have to be with a friend and he will be happy with what he is and he is the one that has a great friend who will never have to be with a man who will be a good man with his hair he looks so much like a man who likes the black and white lives he has always loved him he will be happy with it he will be happy with what he is and he is the one that they can do be happy to give him the same thing and he looks so good and he will be happy with it he is the one that they can do be happy to give you the one you will have a good job he is also the one that he likes and he likes you guys know who you can do be happy to do with a man he is a great man he will be happy with what ya doing bro \n\nI just spammed the middle button 👁👅👁💅🏽","title":"Trumpets are ❄️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:12Z","userName":"elithabeth2.0","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177672924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app to see what all the fuss was about. When I got it an ugly orange orangutang lookin ogre popped up. It blinded me. So I rode my donkey to Walmart to seek medical attention. When I got there they toke my phone and found out I had this app. So they stole my donkey and ate in front of me. So I had to call an Uber and rode a squirrel home. My dad said we ran out of milk and he had to go get some. I waited patiently for him. But he never came back. He texted me 3 days later to tell me that bc I downloaded this app that he was NEVER going to come back!!!!!!!! Now I’m dying of thirst, have no milk to drink, scarred by seeing that orange pig, and to top it all off I’m blind now. It takes Trump 1 second to come up with something racist, but 49 frikin years for my dad to come back!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! And when he did he left again. With the milk. If I could give this app no stars I would. SO DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP OR THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU!!!!!!!! \n\nthe end","title":"My dad never came back with milk","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:02:17Z","userName":"no milk for me","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177443989","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! I tried to download it a week ago and it took FOUR MONTHS to download 😤. It continues to crash when you try and open it. And when you do open the app some nasty looking Cheeto with a wig that looks like it fell under the couch and was just left there to rot pops up. The app is just some  game with peppa pig. You have to run through her neighborhood with peppa dressed in a chica suit from five nights at freddys. The goal is to kill the evil Cheeto man that looks like an OOMPA LOOMPa. His main catchphrase is “that’s fake news”. He has a pet Elmo and Kim Kardashion as his wife. There’s mini bosses that are in your way like the police and Karen’s that you have to fight. Sometimes they throw gas at you that blocks your screen and you can’t see anything. To defeat the evil Cheeto man you have to fight him with an army built of people from different cultures, women and people who are part of the LGBTQ community. Together they blow him up with fireworks and he dies. THE END","title":"ThE eViL cHEeTo mAn","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:50:28Z","userName":"tHe eViL cHeEtO mAn FiGhTeR","isEdited":false}}]}
