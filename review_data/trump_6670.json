The app didn’t take long to download but there was fake news everywhere. There was only info construed to be true. Trumps presidency was a very big let down and this app showcases it perfectly. As a 37 year old republican man, I don’t know where I’ll find better news.","date":"2020-07-08T18:19:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"Navyknight1","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173223393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it’s a no from me luv❤️✨","review":"I was so excited to get this app that was created by our amazing 🍊 President, but my heart was absolutely shattered when it took WEEKS to download. Because of my excitement I was unable to do ANYTHING else while I waited. Once the app had finally finished downloading it started to play this awful music🎶❌ that caused all the birds in my neighborhood to DIE😔. So not only am I no longer going to be able to hear my song birds sing, but this app is a MURDERER. \n\nThis is the worst app I have ever had, and I would not even want my WORST enemy to download it!\n😡😵😾👺👁👄👁🙅\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-08T18:12:23Z","rating":1,"userName":"Rainetree414","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173191261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolute Worst!","review":"It took me three months to download the app, and when I was finally able to open it today, I was greeted with a nude picture of some weird ugly orange guy. 😡😡\n\nIt takes forever for each page to load, and it won’t let me open my profile. 😫🙄\n\nI used the app to get tickets to an event, and now i keep receiving texts. That would be fine, but for some reason the texts are making birds fly into my window, and cockroaches are climbing in through my heater. 😡🤬🤢🤢🤢😬\n\nThe colors are two bright, and caused my grandmother to go blind. I’ve contacted the administration, but they said I’m lying and refuse to pay for medical bills. Very, very disappointed.😧😧😡🤬🤬🤬\n\nAt this point I have no other option but to delete the app. This just shows how little time Donald Trump puts into his creations. I hope his cookies are always a little too salty 😡🤬","date":"2020-07-08T18:01:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"thatonegayatrocity","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173107370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad❤️","review":"I had really high expectations for this app considering that it was created for our amazing president! However, it does not work the way it is supposed to and I am very disappointed. He will not be getting my vote this year because of this. I also found out some very disturbing things about the president such as his pedophilic tendencies, his sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and countless other issues! In all, do not download this app and do not vote for Trump. Our president should be able to at least make a successful app, but he is not even capable of doing that.","date":"2020-07-08T17:35:08Z","rating":1,"userName":"bruh...bruh...bruh","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173029387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave my phone a virus!?!","review":"I tried to secure two tickets to the New Hampshire rally, and when I hit reserve my spots, my phone crashed. It wouldn’t turn on even when I plugged it in. After getting it fixed at the Apple store, my phone did not let me opens any of my apps. Then I proceeded to get a notification from Mcafee,(that is the virus protecter I pay for), and it said my phone was at risk of 11 DIFFERENT VIRUSES?!?! Took it to the Apple store again and they said it was beyond repair. Now I am out $400 for a new phone AND I CANNOT ATTEND THE TRUMP RALLY,(I have to walk my mattress that day). What a horrible day.","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:17Z","rating":1,"userName":"krustycoochie","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172952590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"He is ruining the country","review":"The fact that ANYONE could possibly believe that Donald Trump could make America “great” again completely baffles me. Everything good that he has accomplished for this country should be completely and utterly blinded by all the bad he has done. He is not the man we need leading our country, especially in a scary time like this. Please, I beg every person to please vote for literally anyone else other than Trump on the 2020 ballot. (Unless you, for some odd reason, believe that a sex offender could become the perfect role model and leader of this country.. DO NOT VOTE FOR HIM!!)","date":"2020-07-08T16:46:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"t.addy","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172902221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","review":"I was looking forward to downloading this app. My entire family has it, but as soon as I download it started giving me fake news, is really our president, i then thought it was a Scandal. I then proceed to research more about this app, and it told me that this app is all fake news! It took at least an hour to download it, it usually takes a few seconds. It took so much storage off of my phone and I had to delete all the new pictures of my nieces daughter! I want to give everyone a heads up, this app is not worth it!","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:55Z","rating":1,"userName":"queen bea, herslef","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172727073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Big cry Baby man makes glitchy app","review":"Worst app ever there is no freedom to do what you want on the app, and it has the strangest looking big baby everywhere that’s captioned “that’s not what I meant when I said that”. And it talks about taking the rights away from women, natives, and people of color. Lots of hate speech too. Wouldn’t recommend unless you’re a chewing, racist, truck driving, flag flying, don’t care about others, racist, sexist,child predator, ungodly (that acts like they are godly but really does the opposite of what the Bible says), fascist. Oh and it glitches out every time it loads up.","date":"2020-07-08T15:39:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"yourenotgod","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172663600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NO❤️","review":"Got the app to see the Cheeto puff but was quickly disappointed. The app glitched a lot and I’m  sure it was not my internet because my internet is the best in the country✨🌸🧚Anyways I tried voting and when I started typing, it would say the OPPOSITE of what I meant. HOW CRAZY!\nI’m sure it just another glitch in this disappointment. Another thing I tried listening to music and the sound was just HORRIBLE. It sounded like someone was scratching CHALK ON A BOARD! NOT ACCEPTABLE!😡 So... if you’re planning on getting this APP. Just DONT! Because I’m sure you will be just as disappointed as I was😡😾","date":"2020-07-08T15:21:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"ddusisnxjcisknanz","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172613540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app turned my brussel sprouts evil","review":"I always hated Trump even before he was president, so I decided to get this app to see what was going on here. This app turned my hatred to a NEW LEVEL. Worst president and forever will be. Anyways, there was this blue smoke coming out of the app as I x-ed out of  it. I really thought nothing of it until I open the fridge and see that my Brussel sprouts have turned bright red with the most angry face I have ever seen, and a cleaver in their hands . They all jumped out at me at once and almost killed me. Thank god my broccoli saved me. So DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","date":"2020-07-08T15:07:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"chcjxbzjxbskx","isEdited":false}}]}
