I cannot even go into it without giving my phone number! That is Un-American I have the right to download apps and see the information I would like without giving my phone number."}},{"id":"6178685897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:57:12Z","userName":"jdjudf","isEdited":false,"title":"Make America great again","review":"This app is horrible, it’s very laggy and i felt like I was being spied on by the government because i kept getting notifications from random places even though I didn’t allow notifications for this app. It also took a day and a Half to download when i was just trying to keep up to date with my president. I wouldn’t suggest anyone to get this app."}},{"id":"6178611852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:28:28Z","userName":"the.Lioness","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"First, it took literal HOURS to download (and I can now say it ended up not being worth it AT ALL). Then, as soon as I opened it, it crashed! And THEN, After I FINALLY got it back up, I attempted to make a donation of $10 through the app, and in my bank account it said it took $20! I don’t have the time or energy to worry about $20 though, so I guess I’ll just leave that be... In conclusion, an overall HORRIBLE app!"}},{"id":"6178605780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:26:01Z","userName":"the real app reviewer 👁👅👁","isEdited":false,"title":"WORSE APP EVER DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"i downloaded the app  and mind me it took 3 days to download, trump huny what’s going on👀but anyways would not recommend app very unprofessional, made me pass out while in the app. if u value ur health and ur life please don’t download the app it also inserts viruses on ur phone . while in the app a very uneasy song came on it went like “she like “papi i adore you “ Im like “Baby i ain’t normal” Rrrrrrrr Forigner(grr) forigner (bah) foreigner (woo) foreigner (ah) foreigner (grr) foreigner (bah) foreigner foreigner 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6178589558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:19:29Z","userName":"NicoleAhgase","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgraceful Application  Dissatisfied Beyond Belief","review":"Downloading this app I had so many expectations. Sadly, all I was met with was a putrid smelling freight train of disappointment, dissatisfaction, and discontent. I feel dissed. How is it that this man expects to make America great when his administration can’t even seem to create a functional smart phone application? I fear this app’s abominable lack of functionality is directly reflective of the man’s admiration of this country. Dissatisfied beyond belief."}},{"id":"6178500345","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:44:15Z","userName":"Jenae Rosette","isEdited":false,"title":"Why?","review":"This app is horrible. You should not be promoting trump as president for 2020, he is reckless and doesn’t know what he is talking about. The Cheeto man shouldn’t have ever been president. And actually that’s disrespectful to Cheetos. The way he is handling the coronavirus is ridiculous and because of him our country has the highest coronavirus numbers. Soooooo yeah don’t get this app and don’t vote trump because our country is falling apart at the seams and he is the reason"}},{"id":"6178466783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:31:01Z","userName":"ruuuuubaaa","isEdited":false,"title":"disappointing","review":"i would like to say as trumps number one gen z supporter i was expecting a lot more from this app. even the kardashian app was better and that’s saying a lot. first error on this app was that it smelt bad when i opened it up. i don’t know how but i had to call apple and tell them about the situation bc my phone never had that smell. they told me to delete the app. next i had days of nightmares when i downloaded it. i dreamt of a world with trump as president but he looked like hitler. my dreams came back to normal after i deleted the app for the second time. im happy to get my phone and life back together. if trump can’t get his app together how is he fit to lead this country?"}},{"id":"6178380489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:57:33Z","userName":"galactic gaga girl","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!","review":"I’ve been trying to download this app and it took over 72 hours!! It drained my battery multiple times AND upon opening, there was nothing there— just a white screen. Further, since downloading my phone had been glitching and I’ve been getting hundreds of telemarketing calls a day!! Once I deleted the app, it also deleted all of my other apps. I’m so sad that I lost Flappy Bird 😭"}},{"id":"6178357242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:48:35Z","userName":"gykncd","isEdited":false,"title":"Ehem","review":"So when I downloaded this app like it kept kicking me out my phone crash and every time I opened it the unicorn came back to my window and said TikTok lives matter no but seriously I did download it to see what it was like because I was interested about the whole president stuff but it literally crashed and also I went to see the stuff there and then SpongeBob came out of my sink and said TIKTOK LIVES MATER"}}]}
