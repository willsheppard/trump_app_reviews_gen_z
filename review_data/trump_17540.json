As I kept clicking out of them, more kept popping up. There must have been so many ads, that I’m assuming they’re the reason the app took so long to download. Approximately two weeks... I’m not saying that this app is bad, it’s horrible. If I could give it zero stars I would.","title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6173705532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"dnskxkakndbf24","review":"I am I proud trump supporter and was very adamant on downloading this app. It took very long for it to download, and when I opened the app itself it took even longer to load, it then crashed. The app itself also looks terrible. I am disappointed overall and wish whoever created this app spent more time and money on it. 😢👎","title":"Terrible performance.

I cannot believe there is an app like this! First of all, when you download the app, a Cheeto/ Orange appears on the screen!! I almost had a heart attack, not to mention that the Cheeto/ Orange is a ra(p/c)ist! I 10/10 DO NOT recommend this app unless you want to see absolute filth appear in front of you. Thank you and have a nice day. \n\nSincerely, a person who almost died.","title":"THIS ALMOST KILLED ME!!😡🤬"}},{"id":"6173689296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:52:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BLM 😘✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻","review":"This app is the worst thing my eyes have ever seen. My eyes keep hurting I think I might have an eye infection. It could be because I keep seeing a crusty Cheeto man all over the app.  The app took 3 hours to download and the app all together is not impressive at all. Who ever created this app needs help they might have an eye infection far worse than mine.","title":"🧚✨all apps matter but this one doesn’t✨🧚"}},{"id":"6173688168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sjdjsksjcdj","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app to support my wOnDerFul Orange president with a toupee, I heard something fall over upstairs and then I saw Bunker boi roll down my stairs with his Cheeto dust face. He then chased me down the street yelling: TRUMP 2020. Then, I slapped him in the face and then he made me eat my dog. I no longer have a dog. Pls do not download this app if you love your dog. I also lost a finger due to bunker boi biting it off. That finger was very important to me😢","title":"No❤️✨"}},{"id":"6173681034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:49:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Hhfyttrrdfffrdfftrt","review":"I was promised lot and lots of winning; he promised that I would be tired of winning. Sadly, we are the laughing-stock of the world. This guy is the biggest cry-baby, and so are his follower; all snowflakes, the whole lot of them.

I would very much NOT recommend getting it... It took hours upon HOURS to download. Not to mention the app would not even open, and when it did open-I saw a orange load on the screen...? What the heck?! It possibly took up WAY to much storage as well. I have saw there are some good reviews on this app, don’t let them fool you. This app is no good!!","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!"}}]}
