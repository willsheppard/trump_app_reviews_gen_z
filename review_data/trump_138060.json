I was left disappointed. The app asked for my number and it didn’t bother to ask me what my name was first :/ I don’t know, I guess I wanted my first time being asked my phone number to be more friendly and special. Maybe ask my name first, get to know me for who I am and not a number. I think they are mining phone data :(","userName":"iJenny7","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:38:11Z","title":"Bag of Doritos","isEdited":false}}]}
