Needless to say this app is absolutely HORRENDOUS!!! It kept asking for my personal info such as phone numbers and emails (I only give that information to Facebook). I deleted this app right away for my daughter’s safety. This gets a big 👎🏻 from me. Please don’t download this unless you want your privacy invaded.

The app lagged like crazy and I deleted the app so quick that my toes fell off. The app even gave me the worst diarrhea 💩 imaginable. It even smelled bad 🤮before I downloaded it.

That is no man, that is my child’s snack que se lama un cheese puff or como un animal like a pig. He’s so como unnaturally orange like what happen to him.

Not only does it represent a Cheeto, but it is beyond useless. The fact that the creator of this is a ra_ist (c,p), whichever you choose to fill in the blank, but it puts out nothing but “fake news”. I have never been more disappointed in an app. I will never recommend this to anyone. If I could rate this a -1,000,000 I would.","userName":"The baller41","date":"2020-07-08T23:25:53Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible.

Which then got me thinking that there should be a phineas and ferb app. They are known to be the best youngest architectures in the world, the can accomplish so much in just 30 mins. Meaning that they can literally build the worlds largest Cheeto and make that into an app instead. I would rate that app 5 stars🙈","userName":"Dogergirl18","date":"2020-07-08T23:09:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6174078315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s HORRIBLE I saw naked pictures of babies and adults it said that it will find your address and bring tigers to your house and burn down your house I cannot believe it 😖😖😖","userName":"lovelypeachesinmyhouse121","date":"2020-07-08T23:17:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I hate IT","rating":5}}]}
