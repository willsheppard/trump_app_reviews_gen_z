It smelled like hot dog water and crusty butt hole. I had to write this review on my GameCube because my phone is possessed. My cats started walking on their hind legs and started hissing and doing a chant while circling the phone. A crazy bird flew through my window and died on top of the crusty face that’s permanently displayed on my phone. This is truly the devils work. Please don’t download or you’ll be cursed forever.
