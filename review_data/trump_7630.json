It’s almost like even my phone knew better than to support trump! Also this app smelled bad like moldy Cheeto puffs almost, and when I first opened it there was a photo of this really ugly person, I don’t know why they would choose him to model their app or whatever but he was like bright orange and hideous! I couldn’t even stand having the app anymore! I deleted it like 5 minutes after getting it, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","title":"Worst app I’ve ever gotten","rating":1,"userName":"Laurenfg"}},{"id":"6136541520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:23:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i (a 45 year old mother of three) downloaded this app so that i could support the president i kept seeing in the news. i became extremely interested in him after i saw in the news that he was very close with russia and a group called the taliban (?) i don’t know much about them, but i am russian myself so it was very exciting for me! but when i downloaded this app, i saw nothing but propaganda and someone who looked to be making fun of the cheeto man. it was extremely mind-numbing and i hope to never be dumbed down like that again. i saw mention of a man named joe biden. he seems much more intelligent and kind. this other man gave me pedo vibes and as i mentioned i am a mother so i don’t need that energy. plus he seems like he can make america good, great even! this app surely convinced me to vote for mr. biden in november!","title":"completely mediocre","rating":1,"userName":"Lailah A."}},{"id":"6135938754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T13:25:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am beyond disgusted by this app. The moment I opened it, my Bertram bobble head fell off my dresser and broke into pieces. I was slightly concerned, but decided to continue to support my ✨🧚\u200D♀️✨amazing president✨🧚\u200D♀️✨. Then, my bob Duncan inflatable pool floaty I have for my separation anxiety deflated and caused me to have a mental break down. I do not recommend this gross app. Just to add the the already terrible story, I was at Starbucks and the lady just threw up all over me and my drink, uncontrollably. I just can’t with this app, I’m horrified by what it turned my life into this morning.

Due to this I have gotten chronic sleeping problems! Also, I have to keep my phone on for work and now I’m missing work calls for these! I might get fired all due to wanting to support this truly honorable and jenius man who we call our president","title":"How dare they 😡","rating":1,"userName":"Lovly_Lady-PINK"}},{"id":"6134110625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T02:18:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. It asked for my credit card information which I’m not sure what it was needed for. It also asked for my phone number as well. I feel this was a complete invasion of privacy as I do not want my phone number and credit card information out there. The app also started to glitch out on me and would not load properly. When I did get it to work, the information was biased and discriminatory.","title":"HORRIBLE!","rating":1,"userName":"Bob the candy king"}},{"id":"6133711329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-28T23:41:13Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ok so I have epilepsy and as soon as I opened this up it kept blasting red white and blue. I wanted to be apart of MY presidents app but couldn’t. I asked my daughter lily why my phone was doing that and she said I don’t know. So of course I had a seizure and almost died. I still love my president but as I opened the app again it said that trump doesn’t like anyone that isn’t a white rich Christian male named Christian. I am a boomer and a trump supporter. I am a veteran and shouldn’t be treated this way. It also blew up my phone killing my golden retriever. Trump 2020.","title":"I have epilepsy and...","rating":1,"userName":"yeetustothefetus1"}},{"id":"6078655055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-15T12:25:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I just downloaded this app yesterday to keep up with Trump and provide my support. As much as I really want this app to work, it just doesn’t. Every time I try to open it, the loading page comes up and then it crashes and I’m returned to my home screen. I have tried deleting and re-downloading this app but it hasn’t worked. I’ve resigned myself to the fate that I’m just going to have to try and keep up with Trump through a different spice cause this one is just plain BROKEN.","title":"Honestly Not Worth It","rating":1,"userName":"BookLover807"}},{"id":"6177717218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:15:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"after i downloaded the app, in random places i would find traces of cheeto dust. when it first started, my eye would be itchy and when i went to rub it, there would be cheeto dust on my finger. it slowly began to evolve into finding it in my face wash, my food, and even in my underwear drawer. after i deleted the app everything nearly immediately went back to normal. highly do not recommend as it seems to come with a curse of orange cheeto dust as a side affect. please for your own sanity and safety, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","title":"i don’t like cheeto people","rating":1,"userName":"ZoeyEliz"}},{"id":"6177680498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:04:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app was not user friendly to use and it kept crashing on my phone. Every time I opened the app, my phone would restart, the app would close instantly, and I would then have to manually restart my phone. This app is an utter plague to my phone, made things run slower, and I truly realized how disgusting it was when it instantly began to spam my phone with notifications even though I had turned off notifications.","title":"Horribly confusing with false advertisement","rating":1,"userName":"Helmslie"}}]}
