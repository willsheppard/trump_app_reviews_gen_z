Then I gave  the app another chance out of the kindness of my heart and this time the noise caused the rats to come to my house and attacked us , they ate my pet bird and my hamster (poor Oreo and chocolate r.i.p) then idk what happened but the noise to a different one and all the pigeons to the house and then the pigeons began pecking at us until we were out of the house and now Where stuff outside (this happened an hour ago) don’t get the app it’s not worth it.","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173018473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disgraceful 😾🙄😡","userName":"the gays & the girls😻","review":"So basically you have to give personalized info for this app which scares me because what if orange shows up?? 😹 that would be t r a m u a 💖💖💖 anyways trump what makes you racist? What makes you homophobic? Is it because there are different humans with different skin colors? Or a different sexuality from you? I’m sorry, go ahead and cry about only 6,000 people showing up to your rally in Tulsa some more and stop being so racist 😽✌️It’s pretty pathetic you keep getting fooled by gen z’s, just shows how out of touch you are. As for you Karen, so sorry to hear of your divorce from Chad 😿 Call up Linda and have some “wine time” and stop harassing all the beautiful people 🏳️\u200D🌈✊🏿😽✌️","date":"2020-07-08T17:06:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172924170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Problematic","userName":"isapan0110","review":"I was so excited to download this app when my friend first told me about it. I have been a long time trump supporter and I was sure our amazing president would create the best app out there. When I saw the reviews, I really did not want to believe how bad this app could be and still decided to download it. However, it was just like everyone said. This app was the slowest thing to download and everytime I opened the app it would turn off my entire phone. I couldn’t stand the app anymore. So I deleted it. And let me tell you, ever since I downloaded the app, I see trump ads everywhere. And yes, I am a trump supporter, but I would still prefer to not look at his face.","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172909966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Never Again","userName":"isssssssdss","review":"This app was created for Trumps campaign... the one where he has falsely claimed to “make america great again” when he has only done the opposite. He has increased the national debt caused a race war, created less jobs and continues to be unable to run our country. In the time of need with this virus he only provided false information and refused to take American lives seriously and has put more people at risk. He is openly racist and sexist and has been influencing those thoughts and actions to many Americans. Trump is unfit and should’ve never been our president and never been in office. He has only caused torment and pain to the United States and needs to stopped. Never Again!","date":"2020-07-08T16:33:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172859398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVERRRRR 😡","userName":"💥👄💥","review":"First of all this app took 15 weeks to download after it downloaded my phone started to get very hot so I put it in the Frezza to cool off then the app locked my phone in the frezza then my hand froze on to the Frezza then the app sent me and my Frezza in to orbit while it was crashing into all the planets my phone still in the Frezza on full blast was saying there’s a dumb Cheeto in the white house after that I came crashing down through the ceiling of my house while I was trying to sleep oranges and Cheetos came crashing down on my head. Little did I know that downloading this app would be the cause of my death .

I had to cancel my card but by then people had already bought multiple things from it and I had to spend HOURS with my bank talking about the next steps. The next week I started throwing up and the crumbs of my breakfast spelled out TRUMP 2020. I think I’m being possessed. I already called my priest and I will soon be having an exorcism to see if I can get this disgusting app away from me. 0/5 stars it deserves death. App Store please get revenge from me and take this app off","date":"2020-07-08T15:56:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172138818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t download","userName":"Breeze💜","review":"It took very long to download, and I have hella good WiFi. When I opened the app it started glitching, then it froze. And it messed up my software so bad I think it need a complete update.\nI tried to download the app to find some reason to support our president. But now I can’t do that anymore, that’s too bad. Because I reserved ticket for his Tulsa rally but forgot I needed to water my car, so I was unable to go. But lucky for me I go more ticket for his my rally, but I don’t think I’ll be able to make it because I have to walk my snake that day, so that will be to bad, at least I tried. \nBut overall this a bad app do not download it will ruin your phone and brain.","date":"2020-07-08T12:56:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177829006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"i’m so mad","userName":"Babydaddy420","review":"baby i downloaded the app and it took up so much of my storage, then a monkey showed up on my door with a trump2020 sign and i cried then the monkey started beating me. i finally made a good tiktok then it gets deleted because of annoying orange. not to mention the promise of spencer reid showing up at my door, WAS NOT fufilled, as another person in the review mentioned. I am so beyond upset because now my phone crashes all the time, AND we can’t get rid of the monkey at our doorstep, not to mention there’s a parrot screaming “trump 2020” every time i try to go to sleep. i haven’t got a good night’s rest since i downloaded it. will not be recommending this app to anyone.","date":"2020-07-09T18:49:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177723926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"this app is horrible👛✨🍒💞","userName":"hanmavda","review":"this is the worst app I have ever gotten. when I signed opened the app it asked me to do very PERSONAL things, I would never say. It should be deleted and banned it doesn’t even work. I got it to get some rally tickets and it didn’t even work! I hope this app is off the App Store and banned for ever should never come back. I hate it so much, it was supper slow and took a LOT of my battery percentage. I will delete it right after I do this truthful review on this app. the trump campaign should fix this..NO THEY SHOULDN’T IT WILL NEVER BE GOOD! this is the worst app I have ever downloaded on my phone.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP💔","date":"2020-07-09T17:34:37Z","isEdited":false}}]}
