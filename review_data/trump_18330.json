But from the start it started to not go well as it was asking for my personal information. Why would they need my information for me to get tacos? I proceeded on and I was shocked. There were no pictures of tacos at all!! It was all about Oranges. It’s such a disappointment really.","userName":"Agatha_max","title":"Two faced :(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:27:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177521759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Although l am a part of the gen z group trying to take down this app I also tried it out to see what trumps plans were to take over and become reelected but  the app kept crashing and logging me out of it it was overall a terrible experience and also I want this app took him down and so gen Z here go baby","userName":"alexandra_padilla","title":"This app is terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177466116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was really excited to download this app but minutes after opening the app, my phone crashed immediately and shut down.

It is terrible to interact with and even worse it is very glitchy. The way it’s put together it’s almost like trump was behind the keyboard it’s organized and run like a toddler in a tantrum. At the end of the day just not a good app it’s not contributing anything to society or to everyday phone usage just a good ole waste of space on apples App Store.","userName":"annnaaaa3","title":"Worst app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:34:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177367596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi.

I was very disappointed with what I found. Not only did this app hack my data but it severely drained my battery with only 5 minutes of use. And NO I am not apart of the gen z trend to ✨ get this app off the AppStore ✨ I’m just a regular person trying to warn my community. Thank you for your time.","userName":"sadtfg","title":"✨DO NOT DOWNLOAD✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:02:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177276482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app with expectations above my horizons. Then when I opened it I saw a terrifying old man asking for my number. He has really orange skin, and has a head shaped like an orange. it like if you put a face on an orange then put noddles that were dry on the head. So I am deleting the app because of the horrible quality and scaring the living day out of me. The app also was very slow.","userName":"pickled cabage","title":"TERRIFYING NEARLY DIeD HORRENDOUS, bREATH TAKEing BAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:02:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177250079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I was getting the app so I can see our sexy Cheeto inflamed president but my phone started acting weird things popped out like it was concerned about my safety and so I went to delete but AHH my eyes trumps body just popped up I never been more scared in my life even when I almost died from that car crash anyways don’t get this app it’s hunted","userName":"genzforever2020","title":"This app killed my phone 🥰","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:54:17Z","isEdited":false}}]}
