There’s nothing wrong with this app, they need to quit their whining and get a mind. Cuz clearly they left it at home along with their common sense."}},{"id":"6178411707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gracalicious","title":"Makes me contemplate whether or not to live","date":"2020-07-09T22:09:32Z","review":"This app is the absolute worst. In my time of app testing, this one is the worst one ever. It doesn’t make any sense. I am CONVINCED that there are spies running this app and taking all of our information. It is stinky like Donald himself. They both need a shower and cleanse themselves of this monstrosity. If -100 stars was an option, that would be what I’d pick🤢🤢 Never use again and suggests that everyone does the same."}},{"id":"6178300041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Pjbowman79","title":"My ferret jumped in a toaster thanks...","date":"2020-07-09T21:27:06Z","review":"I was so excited to support our supreme leader so I decided to download this app to further my knowledge about political stuffs when the app started to break down 😌 now whenever I try to open the app my phone glitches so I guess I also have a virus so thanks🙄 not to mention the other problems I’m having...

The first thing you see is this creature, kinda looks like an orange but also looks like a Cheeto. I didn’t even know things like it existed on our Earth. I’m warning you, please DO NOT download this app, you will NOT be able to recover from the Orange-Cheeto Hybrid thing that appears."}},{"id":"6178256369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"the must precious app","title":"Tiktok😘","date":"2020-07-09T21:11:03Z","review":"So Donald Trump wanted to take tiktok downI’m going to take his app down because that is disrespectful because I have nothing better to do other than be on Tiktok and now he wants to remove it I’m gonna remove his app now I wanna see if he gets angry I want to see his anger I’m coming for you Donald Trump and that’s on PeriodT I don’t like this president at all and this is just my opinion if you don’t like it don’t like it because he’s taking a TikTok away from me"}},{"id":"6178247045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"One gen z","title":"🧚🏽Very Bad🧚🏽","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:44Z","review":"I downloaded this to see what would be happing for the elections and after a week of having it my phone would start glitching. I guess the wonderful 🌟 trumpkin 🌟 doesn’t know how to develop a good app. I wouldn’t suggest downloading this app unless you want a virus bigger that the one we have and I’m not talking about corona. This app has terrible updates takes forever to load and doesn’t work half the time"}},{"id":"6178236319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Anegehlalocita","title":"❤️tiktok❤️","date":"2020-07-09T21:03:49Z","review":"EW JUST EW when i opened the app i  saw an 🍊orange🍊 help my eyes hurt so badly and now my parents are gonna ground. but before they do i just wanted to say that i saw things i should not have and then i saw trumps 🍤no no square🍤and then while i was in the app some random things saying 🙄ᴛʀᴜᴍᴘ 2020🙄started going in my room so i had to ask my mom for a 💫𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑡💫 and now im headed to the doctor❤️ so now ima just-hold up ima go put bleach in my eyes and take my fish on a walk:)"}},{"id":"6178169550","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"let down my trump again","title":"wow","date":"2020-07-09T20:40:23Z","review":"i downloaded this app a week ago and ever since my phone has been turning on siri without my command and she has been yelling racial slurs and very inappropriate things to me. i had to take my phone to the apple store to try and fix but they said there was nothing they could do, however, once i told them this started after i downloaded the trump app, they told me this was a common problem customers had in relation to the app. i went home and just before i deleted it, my phone made these horrible screeching noises. i had to throw my phone in the toilet to get it to shut up. somebody, i’m hoping donald trump, will reimburse me for the destruction of my phone, if he can finally own up to his mistakes. 😡"}}]}
