Trump. (The J stands for Jenius) But it was stuck on 13 and 12. Not sure why. Well, anyway, back the blue bc 40% of their salary goes to coronavirus relief.

Look up police 40 percent.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178867642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:06:55Z","rating":1,"title":"Waste of space","userName":"Tomaha leap","review":"You’re first greeted with his crinkled up ball face.
