I would expect more from the PRESIDENT but i guess I over estimate him. HORRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD. It just fills up your storage for nothing because it doesn’t work.

I immediately got a headache from opening it. I’m a bit confused as to why I was greeted with a picture of a big fat Cheeto? Maybe it’s a glitch. Nothing on the app works though.
