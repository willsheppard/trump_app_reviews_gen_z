As soon as I opened the app, it took me to some website trying to sell me drugs. All illegal drugs. I was quite shocked. So I reloaded the app and it was still taking me to that same website. So, like any other knowledgeable person, I restarted my phone. All went well when I opened the app. This time however, I was stuck on a loading screen that  continued to play YoungBoy, which I thought was an odd music choice. Certainly because it’s not even good music. What happened to the patriotic music? A couple days passed and I got a knock on my door. They said that they were collecting information for President trump. I gave them the information they asked for and they didn’t leave. Instead they broke one of my windows and stole my dog. They also took my family hostage, and made us watch Sniperwolf, which was one of the most horrific things I’ve ever seen. They proceeded to go through my things, like the kitchen and living room. They ended up leaving. But before They left, they told us that President trump had sent them. I was appalled. How could a great President do this. So I hopped back onto the App again, for it only to take me back to the site with illegal drugs. It offered me discounted joints and grams of coke. But since it takes me to the drug site everytime I open the app, I get calls from shady people asking for drugs. And to be honest, I’m afraid now. I’m getting threats. Death threats. My family can’t go outside without being held at knife point while being asked for lines. I’m truly scared for my friends. I haven’t seen them since this all started. Please. I’m begging you. Please do not download this app. I’m truly scared for my life.","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:41Z","userName":"Kyky162763"}},{"id":"6173620372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"The worst","rating":1,"review":"My grandpa had a seizure because she f how many colors there was","date":"2020-07-08T20:27:39Z","userName":"faqzc"}},{"id":"6173608417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Teribale scary app","rating":1,"review":"First of all it keeps jump scaring me with a orange face and I don’t like it but I love supporting the best president😑","date":"2020-07-08T20:23:21Z","userName":"zombieboy13x"}},{"id":"6173598854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"ewww","rating":1,"review":"this app disgusted me! it took months to down load and when i opened the app it was super glitchy! i don’t get why they made this app if it doesn’t work write. it disgusts me🤢","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:54Z","userName":"Roosielovesmustaches"}},{"id":"6173588457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Not helpful at all","rating":1,"review":"This app makes me want a new president","date":"2020-07-08T20:16:17Z","userName":"gbgfchhv"}},{"id":"6173572599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"What is this app?","rating":1,"review":"Couldn’t even open...
