It could have more colors and be more spontaneous. I also don’t appreciate having to give my phone number. It is unprofessional and inconsiderate since I do not want to have a conversation with this person nor do I want to have any contact with him. Another detail I did not find appealing was the slogan used as soon as the app is opened. It stated “Keep America Great”. Although I do live here and very much appreciate the country, I do not think America is great yet. We have a long way to go as a nation to create equal opportunity for all people and allow for everyone to be given their rights as humans. Treatment with respect and dignity that every person deserves is not yet given to all. For these reasons I believe this app is not worth anyone’s time and should not be downloaded. Anyone reading this I hope you have a great day and remember to spread love and kindness."}},{"id":"6173661649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP EVER","userName":"Jo1057828","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:42:20Z","rating":1,"review":"THIS APP GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS THAT I CAN’T GET RID OF, my phone was a BRAND new iPhone XR and I had to get ANOTHER NEW PHONE because this app completely broke my phone!! A pop-up message prompting me to rate the app and then text a number would come up every 5 seconds or so in the app, and then that number before I even texted it started blowing up my phone with messages. I tried to uninstall the app then because the pop-up message wouldn’t go away and my phone was being super slow and getting hot all the time, but it wouldn’t work, and eventually the app wouldn’t even open. No other apps will open either, they just close automatically after trying to load. This app is built like an actual virus, I managed to get into my settings shortly after getting this app and a bunch of un-deletable files were listed in my storage. I CANNOT recommend this app any less!!! Do not get this app!"}},{"id":"6173555017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just horrible 🍊🍊","userName":"whatever🤪","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:50Z","rating":1,"review":"If I could give no stars I would!!! It made my phone glitch terribly! I do not recommend this app to anyone it is just horrible! It also gave off really bad vibes and just was an awful experience over all. I do not simply get how people could like this app it messed my phone up and wasted my time! There are definitely other apps that are way better like tiktok or instagram I recommend getting those! It also doesn’t represent everything that is currently going on in this world like BLM!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so biased it’s sickening. I don’t get why the trump administration is not taking these movements seriously and recognizing the problems going on in the United States. I am very offended by the content on this app and everything it stands for now that I realize what is actually on it! Once again there are way better apps and presidents out there like tiktok :) #settleforbiden✨✨"}},{"id":"6173337664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Uh-uh honey no just no","userName":"watermelon diet doctor peper","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:49:53Z","rating":1,"review":"So I wanted to suppport the Cheeto racist molester🥳🤩 but then the app started playing this really bad music and would not stop. I eventually had to get a new phone, and I didn’t even have the app in that phone but it started playing the gross music too🤮idk what to do because then it started to play on my tv and my guard dog attacked it, and I had to get a new tv🤬😡😡 and then it played different monotones  music witch then began to attract roaches🐜 and then I was reading other reviews and saw that others had had this happen too. But then one of the roaches proposed to my dog so I kicked them out🦵🏻but they came back and took over my house so now I’m homeless and we are trying to fight for our house but the roaches are threatening to caugh on us and we don’t want the cOrOnA vIrUs so I think we might just hop on a boat and sail away to an abandoned island and just live there forever. So ya don’t buy this app."}},{"id":"6173181993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","userName":"Love girl <3<3","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:58:50Z","rating":1,"review":"all of the the CHEETO 🍊🍊 supporters are saying this app is FABULOUS 💕✨ and all I’m seeing is REAL reviews 👁 👄 👁 but this one is frrr cuz i’m a real one yk 💯 anyways, i was srolling through tiktok hearing how gOoD 👎 this app is and i HAD to download it, i didn’t even have to think twice🧠🧠 because i AdMiRe the orange bunker boy of a president 🍊and who has GORGEOUS hair, it is FABU 👩\u200D🦰 i love the way it barely holds on to his head 🧡 and my tan will never be as orange as him 🥕🥕 as i was  scrolling i was seeing all the reasons why he is the BEST pReSiDent 🟠 obviously because for the first time in forever ❄️ ⛄️ police shooting innocent black lives are at the top 💥 💥 families are being ripped apart for being a certain race and children are being put in cages like animals 🦕 🦖 ofc racism is at its worse ✨💕 the people parr of the LGBTQIA community are being treated badly💗💖 and more ❤️❤️ but what do i know i’m just a big dumb hispanic 12 year old girl :) \n\n(Copied by someone else)"}},{"id":"6173105056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is nonsense","userName":"savantina","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:34:24Z","rating":1,"review":"It took several  hours to download the app and I had to delete several apps to have it installed . Once having the app installed. When I went on the app it caused my newborn baby to cry and as a mother of 25 it’s unbearable. The noice is a horrific sound of bacon being fried, and that caused all the werewolves to come  in my little village and try to gobble up my kids. I lived in a wooden home on a cliff, notice how I said LIVED. I had to call the the village police to kill the wolves and instead of shooting the wolves they tried shooting me. The cliff became unstable my whole house collapsed with the cliff, and I lost 10 of my kids and the whole police department. Please don’t download this app unless you want to be attacked by the supernatural. Also I can’t support the president in the time being because I’m being drag into an ant hill to be eaten by the ant queen.\nPlease pray for my kids and have live, laugh, love day."}},{"id":"6173049362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"oh the horror!","userName":"Trump2020🤡🤡🤡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:16:30Z","rating":1,"review":"it took hours to download and when I finally did open the app, I was bombarded by some orange! the orange, it was so bright and disgusting that when my sister looked over at my phone screen, she fainted! The look on her face as she fell to the ground : pure terror. I put a pillow under her head and grabbed a glass of water for her for when she woke up, because I’m a decent human who doesn’t deny people the health care they deserve no matter their sexuality, ethnicity, religion, or gender. I went back to my chair to continue exploring this app. IT GOT WORSE! As I looked through, I saw all these racist, sexist, and homophobic statements and it was just horrible. I-I couldn’t risk my aunt coming in and dying from the horror, so I quickly got off the app and deleted it. From my very strong recommendation, unless you want to go to jail for manslaughter, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP AND GIVE IT THE TERRIBLE REVIEW IT DESERVES SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE KNOW NOT TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP!"}},{"id":"6172980026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m crying right now","userName":"j3nard0","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:10Z","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app in hopes of seeing great things our president has done. Unfortunately when I downloaded the app it took forever to fully download, so I went to go get food at a fast food restaurant. The must have downloaded and in president trumps voice it started saying really mean things to the staff and customers. He said things like, “I know where you live and I will leave cockroaches in your bed tonight and watch them eat your skin.” I tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me. So a few days went bye without more talking from the app. So I went to my great grandmas house. President trump said he was gonna drop a 100 cockroaches on us. This time it came true. 100s of cockroaches fell from the ceiling. My grandma ended up having a heart attack. And at her funeral he put 28 dead rats in her coffin. There’s plenty more stories of how he ruined my life. So just don’t get this app."}},{"id":"6172891495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app","userName":"laneydawe","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:27:36Z","rating":1,"review":"As soon as i downloaded this app i received at least 10 phone calls! they wouldn’t stop calling even after i deleted. Afterwards, 30 people came to my door telling me to sign petitions. when they left i realized my house was on fire! they even lit my cell phone on fire so i couldn’t call the fire department. i used my quick thinking skills from seeing trump on tv and decided to ignore this deathly situation. soon after millions of ants came into my house and formed a figure of donald trump! i didn’t even recognize who it was until i dropped pounds of cheeto dust on the ants. then they started calling me racist and threatened to grab me by the p*ssy bc i am a women. i will need years of therapy. \n\nthis app also gave me explosive diarrhea. the news is all censored to things that aren’t even true! this just wasted space on my phone and was a huge disappointment. also if you support trump you’re racist"}},{"id":"6177712620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0/100 DO NOT RECCOMEND","userName":"Dancer12345ballet","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:14:30Z","rating":1,"review":"I don’t even know where to begin 🤮 once I opened the app and it asked for a number I was uneasy because I wouldn’t want to give a rapist my number 👎🏾 so I closed the app. After closing the app I received a message from an unknown number saying “What do you have to hide?” I immediately blocked the number but various numbers continued to text me. After an hour my phone crashed and turned off. When I charged it and turned it back on there was pictures of a filthy, dirty looking cheeto plastered on my phone 😓 as soon as I unlocked my phone it just opened the Trump app. I tried to go home and delete but it would just open back up. I tried to text and call friends and family to help but the same voice would pick up 😖 I’ve turned off the phone but scared to get another one because there is no way to hide🤦🏾\u200D♀️ STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!!!!!!!"}}]}
