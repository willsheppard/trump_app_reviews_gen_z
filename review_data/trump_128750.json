Not only did it take months to download, it also made my pet raccoon bright black 😱 it even had orange 🍊eyes!!!! But that is perfectly okay because now it has our Orange 🍊 God’s skin color as eye ballz 🤠🤠 Our melatonin king 😏 #stanlilhuddy2020 🧕🏿🥵 Chille Anyways I expected more from you Donald! 😈😈 You’ve done so well at Making America Great Again and I thought this app would be great too. 😟😔 Sadly, it was not. My iCloud storage is now completely full even though I bought extra. 😖😖 Yes Donald, EXTRA storage for your “great app”! 😾😾 My photos app is full with pictures of Miss Addison Raecist 🤨🤨!!! I expected way more from you my king. When I first opened the app, they asked for my phone number?!?!?? 😒😒 I could not believe it. I AM A MARRIED DIVORCED GRANDMA OF 69 COWS. HOW DARE YOU TRY AND HIT ON ME LIKE THAT? 🙄🙄🙄#enddomesticabuse 🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫 I am disgusted with this. 🪐👄😽 Donald, don’t get me wrong, I love the red, white, and blue but I think we should change it to yellow and black, don’t you think? The Manny will not be televised 🤕👹😘😁😜. To my fellow conservatives voting for Trump on November 4th, please DO NOT 🚫🚫 download this app because it will make your pet horse 🐴 kick your husbands baby chicken 🍗 in the stomach causing it to lose all sense of birth 💔😿🥀 That is all I have to say for today, follow my Instagram @jcaquelyne 😺😺.

Nah this thing took 60 gigs and I had to delete all my games. Took like 10 weeks to download. After that you’d think this app would be the best thing ever right? 😂 not even close. It’s just a white page that says “this one more way D.J. Trump is turning America into his personal glory hole” with animations of Trump spinning turn tables and thrusting at me. Now I’m just creeped out and concerned for my safety tbh.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176429179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:12:10Z","title":"Would you rather?","userName":"Jck_woods","review":"I would rather do a a lot of things than use this app. I would rather live in North Korea.
