I do not recommend this app if you want to support Trump. This app is so bad it’s not only a 0/10 but it’s a 0/100 because it’s that bad on so many levels."}},{"id":"6172191080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash app for a trash president✨🧚\u200D♀️💕","userName":"alloftheabove2","date":"2020-07-08T13:11:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Considering the fact that the abominable orange couldn’t lead our nation through a global pandemic, and then formally removed us from the world health organization, this app really did not fulfill my needs. To all of his supporters downloading this app, I hope you come to realize that you are being brainwashed with his propaganda and empty promises."}},{"id":"6172151285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DEAR ORANGE","userName":"wjjfjs","date":"2020-07-08T13:00:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Please go back and give me my 4 years back because ive had to hear you and follow YOUR rules for 4 years and i am tired if i have to go through another 4 year i am going to have to talk to you , your skin tone is a carrot 🥕 and your shaped like an orange 🍊 leave the office aint no body like you there and if they do they are mEntAlLy unstable xoxoxoxo -your son \n😤😤😤😤😌😌🍊🍊🥕🥕🥕🥕😍😍🥰"}},{"id":"6171997221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hate this app do not think of getting it","userName":"d him hrkdvbkednco","date":"2020-07-08T12:16:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Please do not get this app it is terrible the lode times are the worst after I tried to use the app i had such a bad migraine because of how much stupid and not useful info in any way shape or form unless you nod your head after everything trump says to please do not use this app"}},{"id":"6171974422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download","userName":"user$$)18","date":"2020-07-08T12:09:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app and that’s when my phones quality went downhill.

I wasn’t sure if it was a joke or not, he doesn’t seem to be very nice. I’ll be honest, at first I thought it was talking about Donald Duck. I definitely recommend a different app for those interested in politics, all I saw on here was lies and false promises."}},{"id":"6169274056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","userName":"Hileena","date":"2020-07-07T19:05:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opens the app there was videos of a orange. I thought that this app would be more professional. But I was mistaken. All the videos and images persisted of a huge orange🍊. I can not believe the disrespect. I was here to see our leaders not a stupid, dumb, uneducated, fat, ugly orange. I can not tolerate this amount of disrespect. I do not recommend downloading this app."}},{"id":"6165145465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"scam! 😩💀👀✨","userName":"karen ray cism","date":"2020-07-06T18:37:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app to support our wonderful cheeto-brain president, but it’s a scam!!!! they dared to ask me to enter my phone number and text TRUMP to this weird number and i’ve been spammed with nonsense texts ever since!! thumbs down, i’m so angry for having my time wasted 😡😡😡. stupid app doesn’t even load, i bet i have a virus now😭 trump 2020✨💕🧚but on a tombstone😩😔😍"}},{"id":"6161506108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible 0 stars👎👎👎","userName":"Maturedeath","date":"2020-07-05T20:20:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this to stay up to date with the president little did I know it is full of fake news 📰and it keeps talking about this crusty Cheeto thing.
