But since I haven’t used it I can’t really say anything. So, I’m just going to say vote if you can. Vote for new senators. Even though a different president gets the majority of votes, trump may still get chosen for his second term. So it’s very important to vote if your 18 and above. 🙂","userName":"spicy biscuts"}},{"id":"6177447405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"We need a president who will actually help America","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:31Z","review":"Worst app ever. The US needs a president who will think more than himself. For the good of our country, we can’t have another 4 years of this man who thinks he knows everything and who is seemingly never wrong. This is only an app, but it’s all I can do until November. #genz #dumptrump","userName":"Eli174739572747357100846"}},{"id":"6177446859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrifying!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:21Z","review":"This app took two days to download, and then when I finally able to open it, it DELETED itself!

I opened it and immediately an error message popped up. Once I got it to FINALLY work the app made my phone start glitching. This disgusting app gave my phone a virus I’m appalled that a billionaire can’t even create a working app! Don’t download!!!

Does it still sound like something from a toddler? Yes. But still, i do not recommend this app due to its claim of being made by trumps team.","userName":"EJVDG5611"}},{"id":"6177399934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:29Z","review":"I was so excited to support Orange Cheeto man on this app but then I had an enlightenment. There was no way for me to touch his face through this app so what's the point? I can't caress the spray tan and straw on the top of his head 😔. I guess I'm going to have to go to his rally... wait I forgot I had to vacuum my yard! Sorry Donald I will caress ur face another time another day 😌.

I thought to myself “what’s the best way to ruin my phone?” And then I found this app. Now that my phone has Trump2020 on it, I feel comfortable throwing it right in the garbage.","userName":"f* the bunker baby"}}]}
