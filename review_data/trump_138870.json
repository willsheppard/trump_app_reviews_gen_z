I was going to go to every rally and volunteer and do everything I could to show my support, but, an hour after I downloaded the app my phone literally blew up!!!!!!😱🤯😤 Storytime: I was looking through the app, doing typical Republican things and I started to get weird emails saying they had my search history and if I didn’t donate a small loan of a million dollars to the Trump campaign that I was an awful human being and did not believe in America.😭 And of course I love America with all my heart ❤️ because we are the best country that there has ever been so I paid the money. Now, a tiny unimportant detail was that I definitely did hack into the banking system and stole this money from someone.👍🏼 Like the person who has the million dollars should understand, right? This is for America!✊🏼 Wrong. I was later contacted by the FBI and was told that they were coming to get me. Well, before they could catch me, I donated the money of course because #trump2020 and next thing I know I start getting random phone calls asking me for more money and my phone just starts to shake???? It caught on fire so I threw it and it blew up ON THE FBI!!! Can you believe it?🙌🏼 The ~power~!! But the police force and FBI are dedicated working citizens of our country that work diligently to protect our country, so I felt a little bad. But, being white I did not care about getting in trouble because I am ✨unstoppable✨! Well, more FBI agents found me after they got no response from the other FBI agents (oops) and we just talked, hung out and stuff, ya know? Well, the kind gentleman told me that this was a sign and if he won in rock 🎸 paper 📝 scissors ✂️ I would have to do whatever he said. So, he won. 3/3 :( He told me I need to “change political parties”??🤢 AS IF❌ So I “agreed” and tried to act like a..... a Democrat... yuck. Like what do they even do? Nothing! They are fake Americans!!!! I downloaded app on his phone as a “joke” and his phone blew up because he didn’t have $1 million!! Wow, he didn’t even attempt to rob a bank? #fakefan! Then out of nowhere a UFO  🛸 came down and took us and told me that I had to be a Democratic forrealz this time if I wanted to live. So, I chose to live! I would give up a lot for my country (including my phone that blew up) but I like living it up! So yeah😍 \n\nUPDATE: Day 10 of being a liberal and I feel 🎊free and very much alive🎊 I am still being held hostage by Κανδηδ and Ησβψπς but are chill and have become my family now🥰 The only good thing that came out of downloading this app was now I really living my best life and am a full blown liberal! Wow!","userName":"i luvv u!","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Major Glitches","review":"I downloaded this app to further my education on the election for 2020. Once it was downloaded I tried to open it. Immediately my phone went back to my home page. I tried again and it was the same result. Not very impressed with this app and the outdated technology it uses. It needs to be improved and educated.","userName":"Right wing bby","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678281","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"omg HORRIBLE","review":"People love that I hate myself\nYeah, they love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nI climbed out of my head\nAnd watched myself implode\nA thought without a body\nOught to be a shot to take a load\nOff my brain is poisoned\nAnd I'm searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream, \"Oh, no you don't!\"\nWoah\nBut it's fine\nNo, really I'm fine\nIt's just a matter of time\nYou'll lose your mind\nAnd not be fine from time to time\nI'm not crazy\nBut I feel crazy all a sudden\nIn a city never seein'\nSnow or rain or leaves in autumn\nLose yourself in seasons\nNot remembering that you forgot 'em\nKnocking on my door\nI can't confront 'em so I lock them out\nBut I don't mind\nNo, I really don't mind\n'Cause believe it or not\nIt feels good to be forgot from time to time\nSo forget me\nAnd please, God, forgive me\nIf you feel a touched underwhelmed\nBy all my overwhelming negativity\nWho am I and when?\nWhen's my work day end and where does me begin?\nAre these my colleagues or my friends?\nOn a scale of ten to one\nDo you hate who I've become?\n'Cause I hate who I've become\nI'm sorry for who I've become","userName":"libiashley","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Meh","review":"The title said it all.🤷\u200D♀️","userName":"blakeq28","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download this","review":"This app is horrible and I’m 9 years old I know I shouldn’t have it but it’s HORRIBLE do not download this I have so many reasons not to download this and plus it’s trying to ban tiktok for no plain reason so don’t download this it’s a horrible app and it’s rude and a horrible app","userName":"princessbtibrichoclatedrop","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","review":"Yeah.❤️","userName":"choose a different method","rating":1}},{"id":"6179677839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible ✨❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌","review":"Bruh trump start the war 🤣🤣🤣were not gonna go down without a fight!!!","userName":"Loveyourself:3","rating":1}},{"id":"6179678030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Good app","review":"It’s a good app","userName":"bathroom vaper","rating":5}},{"id":"6179677807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Racist","review":"I didn’t even tell the race I was but it called me the N word and said was going to be hanged if I wouldn’t vote for him✨🙈","userName":"tay tayzzz✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6179677753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible","review":"this is the worst app by far. it was a total scam. they now just send me messages to vote for this pig ass cheeto. i 10/10 would  NOT recommend that you download this bs of an app. but yea don’t vote for this cheeto and don’t support him cause he’s just a pig and doesn’t know how to run a country but yea. have a good day!!!","userName":"WORST APP EVERR!!!","rating":1}}]}
