When I finally got the app i started using it, but all of a sudden my iPhone 5 started shaking. The screen turned black and a MUSKRAT climbed out of my screen. Ever since that day I’ve had dreams of Donald Trump sending his muskrat army after me. Then I realized, It wasn’t a dream and that the muskrat army was after me! So like any normal person would do I took out my phone and went on TikTok. The millennials refused to help me because they were to busy, “ re-watching the Harry Potter movies.” And the Karen’s where at trump rally’s! Trumps rally almost got me killed! Luckily, Gen Z heard my call and saved me! Without Gen Z I would be DEAD. So, I tried to delete the app, but It didn’t work. Instead, my new iPhone 4 started playing Donald Trumps voice on the max volume causing my NEW phone to explode! Then, all my devices in my house such as my Alexa, 3 TVs, my son Billy’s five computers, and robot dog started playing the real women vote for trump song. This also caused them to explode. The explosion set my house on fire killing my husband and parents. Before you ask I live in my parents basement in Alabama. Me and my son billy barely escaped unharmed! Then I lived in the woods with Tarzan! But then, I found out that the gorillas were trump supporters! They kidnapped my son. Of course I called the cops. But they said that because my son was covered in dirt that he deserved to live with gorillas. They proceeded to attack my son killing him. I wasn’t even allowed to go to the funeral.😢. But then, Chris Brown saved me! So, I married him, until I found out that he was stealing all of my stuff including my clothes and money! Sadly, he threw me onto the moon. When I got there the aliens were skeptical at first but, welcomed my with open arms. Together we started an Anti-Trump association. The government called us terrorists. So, I got revenge by taking my army of Aliens and destroying the world, becoming the leaders of the new world! I, Barbra, will never support such a stanky, orange, and horrible president ever again! I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life! If I could give it 0 stars, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!","userName":"Barbra000001","date":"2020-07-09T22:37:51Z","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE🤢🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178476212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"it keept asking me for way to personal information and kept crashing 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽😹","userName":"wöah","date":"2020-07-09T22:34:42Z","title":"too glitchy","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178446345","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app is spreading false info about COVID-19. stay safe and wear a mask!","userName":"SuperWhoLock818","date":"2020-07-09T22:22:58Z","title":"spreading false info","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178367247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Gotta love the great big orange, but his app gotta get taken down before TikTok","userName":"lazuro -","date":"2020-07-09T21:52:25Z","title":"Gen Z= Greatest","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178393387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"review":"This is a great app","userName":"💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼","date":"2020-07-09T22:02:29Z","title":"Great","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178363844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Gen z is here to stay","userName":"zfirjsnxndnejs","date":"2020-07-09T21:51:06Z","title":"Awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178357361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Terrible I found a hair in my food\n🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","userName":"olivia3211","date":"2020-07-09T21:48:38Z","title":"Ewwwww there was a hair in my food","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178356586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Ew take this app off the page.
