Well..... we did. Now look where we are.....\nwith a president that has failed on so many levels.....it’s going to be sad to look at history books in 20 years","title":"It gets worse","isEdited":false,"userName":"sadddddddperiodtttttt","rating":1}},{"id":"6178939075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:33:11Z","review":"Look, this app is just terrible. It took control of my phone and started digging up all my passwords. Then out of no where, smoke starting coming out from the speakers of my phone and nearly blew up in my hand before I had the chance to throw my phone across the room😭😭 Don’t download this app, stay safe..","title":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"VHO123456","rating":1}},{"id":"6178909437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:22:10Z","review":"🧚\u200D♀️✨this app makes me want to throw up✨💞 but seriously it is full of racist news, and it is unbelievable that the PRESIDENT of a country is so, completely horrible. This app makes everything worse in the world from spreading fake rumors that trump is actually helping the country. Even the app itself is so glitchy and slow.","title":"AWFUL APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"Katie E :)","rating":1}},{"id":"6178895135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:16:56Z","review":"Let me just start off, it is very poorly done. the graphics look messy and the codes are not well written. Second off you are trying to ban tik tok from the US and that is completely unfair to us. You are a racist, sexist, homophobe with over 30 sex allegations. this app needs to be removed from the appstore as soon as possible.","title":"Worst App Ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"rravanhahah","rating":1}},{"id":"6178893034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:16:08Z","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of staying up to date with everything Trump #TrumpTrain #Trump2020 😬 but this app has done nothing of the sort. First of all, it took 4 days to days to download and has yet open up past the home screen. Apple should be ashamed of displaying such an awful app 🤢👎🏾.","title":"This app is truly awful!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"RodneyBottemfeeder","rating":1}},{"id":"6178876977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:10:16Z","review":"This app took a whole week to download!!! I am outraged on the fact that people want to download this app to support Trump! We need to get him tf out of office! We need Barack Obama back!!!!!! He is a disgrace to mankind!! He is a racist, white loving, homophobic, walking piece of garbage! This app completely trashed my phone and gave my phone a virus! This app should definitely not exist!

Now it’s been 8 days and I can’t stop puking. I also have a chronic case of constipation because of this app. I hope trump understands my pain and decides to drop out of the race so I don’t have to throw up anymore.","title":"Trumpy Dumpy","isEdited":false,"userName":"Phil Phillips Phillington","rating":1}},{"id":"6178800997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:41:39Z","review":"I gave the app a shot, hoping to learn more about my president and his goals. But the app always crashes, and hardly ever loads. After downloading it, most of my apps began crashing.. Not sure if it was this app specifically but it wasn’t happening prior to downloading it. I gave it a chance, but I will be deleting this app.","title":"This App is Useless","isEdited":false,"userName":"Devin Jabari-Shakur","rating":1}},{"id":"6178800965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:41:38Z","review":"Right after I downloaded the app I got spammed with messages on all my social media platforms from Trump supporting sites. They were being really inappropriate and one guy even went so far to text me MY ADDRESS and my sons name. Saying that if I didn’t vote for trump they would come to my house. It’s not safe to download this app.","title":"He’s Watching","isEdited":false,"userName":"BulogaWhale","rating":1}}]}
