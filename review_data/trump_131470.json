But when I accepted, someone immediately knocked on my front door.🚪 I went to open it and found a giant orange 🍊 man COMPLETELY NAKED 🥕 and he proceeded to PISS ALL OVER MY FACE. I tried to close the door frantically but he started screaming incomprehensible gibberish and BARGED INTO MY HOUSE 🏠 then he ran all over my house PISSING ALL OVER AND SCREECHING. I could only make out a few words, something that sounded like “thank you” and “trump app”. I am absolutely DISGUSTED. He’s still in my house. I’m hiding in my locked bathroom 🚽 as I type and he is attempting to KICK IN THE DOOR. Right now there is a ONE INCH LEVEL OF PISS on the floor of my entire house and it is fast growing. Please send help. 😵","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:46Z"}},{"id":"6174276255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Buffgghhhhhgjghgnhnhb","title":"no. no. no.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"can we all agree that we don’t want a cheeto who acts like a 2 year old as president? he’s honestly so embarrassing. we don’t want it.

BIGGEST LIE EVER. All I wanted was to pay my respects to our wonderful president  but I kept getting pop up adds from Trump’s personal tanning salon. They even started sending me flyers in the MAIL. I am disgusted at this app’s violation of personal privacy. Before I knew it I was getting spammed with emails and voice messages asking me to donate to a fund I believe was called keepthetrumpets.orange. One time a middle aged women SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE asking me for money on behalf of this nasty campaign. I was horrified. Do NOT get this app it is a waste of time and all they’re doing is trying to steal your money for Trump’s personal beauty care routine. I can’t believe my beloved dictator would ever promote such a despicable piece of garbage.","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:33Z"}},{"id":"6174275652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chdjdndn","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!🙄😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:27Z"}},{"id":"6174275277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"itzkaylah1022","title":"Ew 😵🤢🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🤢🤮🤮🤮 ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.
