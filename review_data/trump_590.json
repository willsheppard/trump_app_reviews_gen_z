Literally not even seconds after, the kool-aid man bursts through my dining room walls and yells “OH YEAHHH” little did ol’ kool aid man know that the wall he bursted through was a support bearing wall. my entire childhood home collapsed on top of me and my family. i woke up in the middle of all the debris to see shattered glass, blood, and kool-aid. i blacked out once more and woke up at grey-sloan memorial hospital where doctor gray and doctor karev gave me the unfortunate news that my entire family, and kool aid man, had passed away in the collapse of my home. how did kool-aid man find us? i backtracked the call log from the number the app sent the message from and KOOL-AID MAN WAS CALLED RIGHT BEFORE I RECEIVED THE MESSAGE. i have the proof, your serve. doxxed by an app?! no...doxxed by your former idol trump.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175185820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:08:09Z","userName":"ACAB 😼","title":"CANT ❌ BELIEVE 💭 THIS⬇️ HAPPENED 😓😱😨😨","review":"Okay 👌🏼 so my name is Kim “First artist EVER in history to have 105 #1s” Taehyung and I downloaded this ⬇️ app 📲 too see 👀 who this orange 🍊 cheeto pedo- president (lol auto correct 😹😹) is BUT as soon 🔜 as I opened it, the microwave ♨️ exploded 💥🔥😱😨.

This man and his bedonkadonk!","review":"Where to even start- Oh! So one day I (a 41 year old woman) decided to go to the store to buy sea monkeys with my beloved daughter with down syndrome. While I was checking out at the self-checkout, a big orange Cheeto man came up to me. He insulted my daughter's face and stepped on her mouth with his tiny feet. He threw the sea monkeys and my daughter into the bananas and said, \"Monkey see monkey do, I'll pee all over you.\" He then preceded to pee all over the bananas, my daughter, and the sea monkeys. In shock, I stood at the self-checkout staring at the fat man with a wig and ran over to my daughter. I couldn't, however, because his phat bedonkadonk  blocked my path. I soon started to be absorbed by the Fergalicious behind. I tried to scream, but my shrieks were muffled by his fat. It took 17 workers to get me out. When I was, the man was gone and out of sight. I have no clue how because he was so huge. My daughter and I have PTSD from this incident and cry everyday. Thankfully, we got new sea monkeys, but the raging piece of flapjacks took our souls. Now we are dead. \n\nXOXO Karen","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174960964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:55:13Z","userName":"daddytrumpcheeks101🤩🦄✨💖","title":"This app is NOT🖐🏽invited to Dë tRëē😡🌲✨😌🧚🏼\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app to show my dog what the hype was about daddy trump cheeks was all about ✨. As soon as I opened this app and the first picture that showed up was a picture of his shrimp attached to daddy trumps lower body . That was ALREADY a red flag 🚩.  I wanted to see what else would happen so I stayed on but that was SOON the worst idea of my life. 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨. A random wig flew out my phone and screamed daddy at me. 😢😖. I was terrified because it had woken me up from cuddling with my pet cow 🤩🤬. I let it pass because I would do anything for daddy trump my lord and savior but then LOARD FARQUAD 😰 came out wearing daddy’s MERCH 🦄 and didn’t even offer to give me any. I was gonna call the police but then remembered that this app had given my phone a virus🙄. My phone had countless pictures of a Cheeto looking man but I couldn’t delete them because it gave me a warning they would send gabby Hannah after me to kill me. 😓 I will ñëvër download this app because my dog is now blind and loard Farquad is now the dad of my children.

Now, I dunno about you, but this app shot me down. I got back into the water and saw these books for sale, I couldn’t understand why a cat was in the sewers but it ended up going sideways and landed on a leprechaun. I thought it had gold but when I saw captain hook having a dance battle with Snow white, I know it was gonna start raining. Worst part is, the dinosaur couldn’t even high five me, I tried to jump on the mountain but the yeti ended up fist bumping my face which throw me in 2050. Everything looks so nice here, There’s an asteroid running away from a pig but I couldn’t quite seem to catch it. I then got yeeted back to me time and noticed a raesengan fly pass me, that was the most awesome shoot over ever seen, but back to maleficent, I don’t understand why the donkey jumped the bird, all he did was flap his wings... terrible sight. Which is why I can’t keep this app. Thank you for my time, Goodmorning.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174594483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:39Z","userName":"roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳","title":"Truly Disappointed","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up to update with the info. However, I was beyond horrified when I saw a big, scary man asking for my personal information. Since I was a child, I was consistently told about Stranger Danger. The said big scary man was screaming how he was rich and could violate women all kinds of ways due to his clear privelege. The best description I can give is that he was very orange (the color of a cheeto for reference) and hair whiter than his aforementioned privilege. He asked for not only my phone number, but my location! Which is very Stranger Danger vibes if you ask me, along with the remarks about women. He also said “Make America Great Again”, however America is stolen land and was never great, so I am not entirely sure how he got that into his mind. Perhaps it was the white saviorism taught in schools. Regardless, this man is a danger to not only society, but this country. So take down this app, I wish I could give it 0 stars, but apparently that is not allowed or something, so 1 will have to do. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 🥰🙈","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174502430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:40:27Z","userName":"riverboat8736","title":"RLLY RLLY BAD 🤬😖😭😤","review":"i downloaded this app to stay informed about our country’s politics, but as soon as i opened this app a photo of a DISGUSTING NAKED ORANGE MAN appeared and guys lemme tell you it was a 🦐🤏🏽like BRUH 😭😭 then the photo proceeded to save to my camera roll without asking me!!!😰😰😰 i opened my camera roll and was absolutely shocked, all of my 752 pictures were gone and instead was replaced with that HORRID picture. i reopened the app but all of a sudden i get a bunch of messages from ALL my contacts my mom, dad, brother, cousins, nephew, aunts and uncle, grandma, my BOSS, my boyfriend, my friends, and many more people. and it turns out the app sent out that PUTRID photo to ALL OF MY CONTACTS 😡😡🤬. my whole family DISOWNED me, my bf BROKE UP with me 💔, my boss FIRED ME 👿, and i don’t have any friends anymore 😾🖕🏽.

It was very threatening to my young daughter. She felt as though the weight of the word was on her shoulders. And between the sobs she saw a picture of a Cheeto on the screen and her eyes started bleeding. The blood permanently stained my carpet. Not happy. The scream traumatized my pet emu which then ran out of the house, and went on a rampage destroying multiple peices of lawn decor and knocking my son into a 10 gallon bucket of cheese sauce which he sadly, drowned in. My daughter, tried to save him but tried on a broken peice of a Danny Devito statue and punctured her foot. My husband took the kids I was babysitting that day with him as he drove my daughter to the ER. My daughter sadly didn't make it, which devastated my husband. When he saw the price of the hospital bill he decided he had nothing left to live for and jumped out of the window, still holding the other children.  After many hours of full time therapy, I was ready to share about the horrors that this app holds.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174039438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:01Z","userName":"refundnoowwww","title":"Ewww just ugh🤢🤮","review":"I can’t even explain how disgusting that app is when I first opened it all you see is this ugly racist Cheeto🤢🤢at that point I wanted to die😩 but luckily I was wearing my glasses to protect me but my baby brother wasn’t his eyeballs flew out and now we’re at the hospital because they have to cut his eyes open😳🤭😩🤢🤢🤢it was disgusting this is the worst app you can get and my dog started yelling in a demonic voice Ïf ÿøū gó tò THAT TRUMP RALLEY I WILL KILLL yOuuuuuuu And aLl truMmpPP SUporTerS so I would give this app a zero out of five if I could but luckily my dog reserved so many seats with a lot of money and then didn’t go he’s such a savage😏😘😗👁👄👁💄🤤💦 but as I was saying this dude deserves to be in a prison with lots of psychopath so they can eat his brains🧟\u200D♂️🧟\u200D♂️I also forgot to mention this app deletes my pet fish this morning I was feeding my fish I downloaded this app because I wanted to see it in my fish it turned into a zebra and now I want a refund😪😭😭😭 but the good thing about this app and made Harry styles appear🥵🥵🥵🤭😩🥴but then he disappeared because it was a hologram😪😪🤧🤧😭😭😭😤","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
