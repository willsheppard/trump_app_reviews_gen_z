When it started asking if I give up my life for trumpet and worship him. I was in shocked and terrified and immediately came to the reviews. This app wants you to give up your life for this orangutan😭😖. It literally tried to hack into my phone, terrible. I ask you to remove this app now. It’s not good for anyone.","title":"Satanic 😰","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"shrimp 😰"}},{"id":"6176961099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:34:10Z","review":"After waiting over a week for this app to download, I opened it and immediately ran to the bathroom to vomit upon the sight of our ✨mighty orange✨ \n\nThe app hijacked all my data and wiped my phone out. Now my phone only shows screens with Russian text and everything has an orange filter over it. \n\nMy phone has been blowing up with calls from blocked numbers calling to inform me about Trumps candidacy. \n\nThe worst part is that when I tried to tell my mom what happened she actually had a heart attack as soon as I said “Trump.” She’s very upset with me and has even taken me out of her will. \n\nDo NOT download this app.","title":"This app will kill you","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"idontlikethisapp123"}},{"id":"6176897240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:17:25Z","review":"I downloaded the app with high expectations but turns out it's just a disappointment 😩 Once I downloaded it my phone got so slow. Not to mention the app itself wasn't stable enough. It kept kicking me out and I struggled to move it around.

WORST IDEA EVER. After I got the app, I started feeling terrible. I ran to the bathroom and started to empty my body into the toilet. I mean everything was coming out. I looked down and saw all of my organs. I didn’t think that was possible but My heart was right on top, beating away. Then it stopped beating and I died. \n\nWound not recommend to a friend.","title":"This app killed me","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Purpleshark99"}},{"id":"6176832664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:00:27Z","review":"this app was AWFUL. the software design and thought process must have taken less than an hour because this app is so confusing and poorly laid out. my phone not operates slower than ever and makes my phone calls drop.

This is what my tax dollars are being spent on? disgraceful","title":"Pen Island","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"maddygrantt"}},{"id":"6176758265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:40:46Z","review":"This app is a SCAM😫 For starters, it took an ENTIRE WEEK to download!

The app took multiple weeks to download and when it finally did I had to put in my apple ID password again to open it and the next day I open my phone to find that all of my accounts have been hacked and it was done by this app. My dog also got this app on her phone and did not like it.","title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"jdsjkdhxysjsjsbd"}},{"id":"6176746965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:37:49Z","review":"I wish I could give this app 0 stars because it is a disgrace. First of all, I couldn’t even get into the app until I gave it my phone number and there was no opt out button. I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to cancel. Also the use of an app to get voters is digustang and i hate the state of the world we are in. This app is racist and sexist and I hope it gets deleted.","title":"This app is disgUSTANG","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"thatbaldqueen"}},{"id":"6176708316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:39Z","review":"The app wouldn’t open at all. Every time I opened it, the screen would go black and then close the app. I’ve only had it downloaded for a few days, but I’ve also noticed that just trying to open the app drains my battery by 20%? I think that there is something seriously wrong with this app.","title":"It didn’t even work","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"🧚🏿\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️🧚🏿\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6176698606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:25:06Z","review":"First this app took forever to download like at least over a month. Then when i opened the app it crashed and took me back to my home screen. I tried again and it then deleted everything off my phone. I would literally never get this app again so awful. Why would someone create an app with so many issues is beyond me.","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Why Don’t We"}}]}
