Once I opened the app it started tracking me by the time I realized it was too late the white supremacist were already at my door step. They pulled up with big trucks and flags they literally smacked my grandma right off her wheelchair straight to the floor😢 . 10/10 don’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T08:51:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175755957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE","userName":"Gdhshdhdhhdjfbshdv","review":"Heard people saying that I should vote for Trump. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and decided to download this app, but then, OOPS!! I remembered that he is a racist, sexist, terrible person who should never be in ANY position of power! So embarrassing that I forgot that, can’t imagine how embarrassing it would be to deny those things in the first place. Also the app is tacky. -8 stars.","date":"2020-07-09T08:40:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175754949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"trash✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","userName":"jdkdhfur","review":"this app was not only full of worthless information, but it also contained a lot of bugs. I would watch out if anyone is even considering on downloading this app for it can make ur phone crash. To get to the real stuff... I hope that this makes it clear that us, Gen Z’s aren’t playing. \n\nwith love, \nGeneration Z 💗","date":"2020-07-09T08:40:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175674982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"BAD LUCK DONT DOWNLOAD","userName":"MikaOwO","review":"So while I was downloading this app and it made my WiFi slow, my WiFi was so slow I couldn’t watch my spongebob 😡 I was angry, so I went to McDonald’s and got some chicken nuggets but the chicken nuggets were cold. This app gave me bad luck 😔 I went home and asked my mom for robux and she said no. After deleting the app I had fast WiFi, fresh chicken nuggets, and robux 😎","date":"2020-07-09T08:13:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175640638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Someone with tiny hands made this app","userName":"Tiy534","review":"Took way too long to download. When I answered some of the demographic questions, it told me “CONGRATULATIONS! YOU CHOSE RIGHT!!!!” Can you guess which one? Then there was this weird diatribe where the app recommended I watch several hours of InfoWars a day, before quickly diverting to the topic of North Korea and how the app sent a copy of “Rocketman” by Elton John to KJ.","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175622033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app took all my storage.","userName":"•blueeeeee•","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app, I got all set up, and then I started noticing that my storage was very full. Before, I had a ton of storage left, but when I got this app, it was literally sucked away. I do not recommend this app for anyone of any age or anything. I wouldn’t even give it one star, I’d give it zero.","date":"2020-07-09T07:54:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175606119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"hailey.arias","review":"This is by far the worst app you could possibly download. For starters it took forever to download and it takes up so much storage it’s not even worth it and the app is so slow and poorly designed and don’t even get me started on the moron who created and funded this app which serves no purpose except to waste your time and storage.","date":"2020-07-09T07:48:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175595707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Chill bruh11","review":"i downloaded this app to reserve tickets to rallies and i’m sorely disappointed. they want me to give them my name and number like they’re going to call me when i don’t show up. absolutely ridiculous. they act like it’s MY fault that they keep scheduling rallies on days that i have to wash my fish and can no longer make it, this is an outrage.","date":"2020-07-09T07:44:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175589449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🍅🖕🦋","userName":"frank DANKIE","review":"Dear lord this app is just god awful! Once I opened the app it hacked into my phone and now my camera won’t turn off its like he’s watching me!! It took forever to download and lagged the whole time. All it does is glitch and make it seem like you don’t need this app because it just exits out! Don’t download not worth your time🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏽🧜🏼","date":"2020-07-09T07:42:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175539673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"dabmya","review":"this app is horrible it took 2 hours to download on an iphone 11 this is unacceptable this app should be deleted and ban from every app store 100% do not recommend waiting 1-7 hours for this to download plus trump is racist and homophobic we do not want this app because he doesn’t deserve one and it’s just an unacceptable wait to download the app","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:13Z","isEdited":false}}]}
