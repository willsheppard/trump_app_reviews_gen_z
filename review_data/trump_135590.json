I was dumb-founded when i got this app. It’s horrible, so glitchy. It needs some flavor it’s like white people fried chicken but instead of seasoning it with only salt they seasoned it with grass and Donald Trump’s wig. If your gonna have an app at least make it good cause your a billionaire but some money in your app cause it’s worse than your looks and your a whole -100000000000/10, maybe consider gender transformation or just plastics surgery."}},{"id":"6136166197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sketchytruck","date":"2020-06-29T14:28:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very important message","review":"When😤you🤯treat😒me😠like🤔DIRT😡ALLL🙄because🥱 you😫 have😢 SOO🤩many😭girlfriends👯\u200D♀️on🌚roblox😰THAT 😖does🤒HURT🔪ME🩸"}},{"id":"6136160585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hnoellep","date":"2020-06-29T14:26:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app is stupid","review":"We're no strangers to love\nYou know the rules and so do I\nA full commitment's what I'm thinking of\nYou wouldn't get this from any other guy\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nAnd if you ask me how I'm feeling\nDon't tell me you're too blind to see\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\n(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry"}}]}
