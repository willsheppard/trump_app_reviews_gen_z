But then an unknown person showed up in my text messages and he started asking me “what are my approval ratings” and “ vote for me please please for gods sake, vote for me”. And when I first logged onto the app it asked me if I wanted notifications I clicked yes because I am a hard-core cheto lover but they started sending me pictures and they got weirder each day. on the first day it was of a family a nice family relaxing by the pool on the second day it was a picnic by a tree and some cloudy weather but now it’s the third and it’s a picture of a clown doing inconceivable things with a Banana. Please for gods sake don’t download this app, and if you do the samurais will come after you like they did with me I missing a finger now. holy crap I think I just heard them.

I clicked the search bar and typed the name and when I went to download it it asked me a lot of questions. One of them was my address so OBVIOUSLY I put my address because I love and trust Trump. Finally it let me download it. Very excitedly I clicked on the app. Next thing I know my phone starts vibrating, getting hot and I get a spam of notifications from THIS app. Then BOOM my phone exploded right in front of my face. I passed out and I woke up in the hospital. My hands have been blown off and my face is melted. I am still waiting for a plastic surgeon to try and restore my face. Sadly my hands will never work again and have to be amputated. On top of all that I had to get a new phone. The only way I can write this review is with my toes. Overall a HORRIBLE app and I do not suggest getting it.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:33:30Z","title":"I had to get a new phone AND I almost DIED","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173379472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dhndgdjbd","review":"When I was a kid I used to wonder if there could be an app so bad so horrible so obnoxious. But when downloading this app I did not just take a month to download when it downloaded it attracted many birds many cockroaches in many snakes and scorpions to my house. When the app finally downloaded it said the app was unable to work one day I was in the car and my car is a smart car and when I open the app it completely just blew my car off and I got into a horrible wreck and at this moment in time I am currently unable to walk and my spine will forever be damaged. The doctor says I walk forever for endless pain until the day I die. Is the worst app ever to be made and save yourself now see if you guys are selves the trauma the destruction the waste of relationships and do not get this app you’ll be doing yourself a favor please.\nIf you like this app, I wish you the worst.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:29Z","title":"How this app ruined my life forever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172676518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hapeiner","review":"I used to be like you. I, a young man, once played online with friends. I once attended a school. I once talked to my friends. I never wanted to go down this road.\n\nIt started when my brother downloaded the Devil’s game. I never let him beat me in anything, so naturally, I downloaded it too. It seemed easy at first, tap the screen to get the bird/fish/whateveryouwanttocallit through the big Mario tubes. Then I died. I tapped between the tubes and died. I laughed at first. I’m far from laughing right now.\n\nI beat my brother’s high score, but kept going. I wanted to get to 100, I’ve already created this addiction, I’ve already made it to 70, so why not? Don’t set a goal. I got 99. 99. My mother has stopped feeding me. I don’t talk to anyone. I sit here and play. I’ve wet myself countless times not wanting to go to the bathroom and ruin my game. I’ve threatened to cut the fingers of my relatives off. I’ve thrown my cat out the window. I’ve created this addiction. I need help.\n\nI locked myself in the bathroom. I’m sitting in the bathtub writing this review, warning you NOT to download it. My family doesn’t dare to enter. My brother hasn’t taken a shower in a month.\n\nI’m cutting my fingers on the sharp edges of my cracked screen, but it’s worth it. A person reading this that doesn’t download this game is a life saved. Don’t end up like me.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:25:27Z","title":"Devils App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172180912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sunflower17xxr","review":"I download this app to see how and what our president will do for us as a non republican or democrat i was hoping for the best... but when i entered and used it for two weeks i started feeling nauseous and found myself vomiting every day!! and i said maybe i had some kind of food poisoning but when i went to the doctor she said i was pregnant! and thats not possible im a VIRGIN and she said have you been on any certain apps the past few weeks..? i said yes the Donald Trump app and she gasped in worrisome and said that girls have been getting pregnant after downloading the app!!! and i didn’t understand why no still doesn’t understand!! today i am six months and in the “pregnant by trump anonymous” program. i didnt want to have the baby because what if it comes oit like the president but then i thought that wont happen.... i hope it doesnt.... so please don’t download it dont let trump disrespect women anymore!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:08:43Z","title":"IT GOT ME PREGNANT!🤯","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177680530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨😻🧚🏻\u200D♀️Gen X😻😻","review":"I was very excited to open this ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️magical🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ app but when I did this mans face was displayed right in front of me with no warning💅🏻😻✨ Then when I logged in I was ‘enlightened’ with the president’s nudes😻✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💅🏻 I was scared for life but yk whatever cause trump 2020😻✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💅🏻💫💫 Then I was spammed continually for a week✨✨ Should have turned off them notifications😻😻 But anyways upon farther inspection my room was scared for life😻😻✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️ Do yall sell bleach cause I would like to bleach my eyes after that view✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️😻 I’m going to restart my phone so it doesn’t need to see it ever again✨✨✨ Then I was bombarded with trump wanting to shut down tiktok bc we’re ruining his public eye✨😻🧚🏻\u200D♀️ we also going to buy out more stadiums bc we want to✨😻🧚🏻\u200D♀️ Anyways I deleted this app and I hope to get it off the app store so no other children have to be scared for life✨😻🧚🏻\u200D♀️ bye bye✨✨😻🧚🏻\u200D♀️💅🏻🧚🏻\u200D♀️😍💫✨❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:04:40Z","title":"Horrible cheeto man🧚🏻\u200D♀️😻🥰😍💫✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177495115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ariasi1073163839171628191","review":"I’m giving this 0 stars because it is what it deserves.  The Trump administration has done nothing but oppress communities and cultures simply because they are different, allowing for violent racist behaviors to flourish from its supporters.  With the recent events regarding historic events like the Black Lives Matter Movement and COVID-19, the president has made it all to clear that he is not informed nor capable enough of getting the United States through the trials and tribulations that 2020 has brought forth with it.  This app is simply a reflection of the corrupt, biased, and violent misinformation that has lead young Gen Z activists from TikTok to try and contain his tyranny.  Now, when his Secretary of State is threatening to remove the app that has done a better job at bringing his country together, TikTok users feel it is their duty to get their revenge, or at least make their grievances known to the people trying to remove their freedom of speech.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:05:46Z","title":"STOP THE OPPRESSION","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176106322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hajakaksmxmx","review":"It took really long to install and when i opened it my phone died! I tried turning it on again but I couldn’t! I tried once again and it started burning! When i stopped the fire i went to the apple store to ask what was wrong, turns out it was all because of the app! I had to get a new phone and when i turned it on, I saw donald trumps nudes everywhere! There were all kinds of pictures, they ruined my life! I had to change my phone number and all my information and I still get weird messages and donald trumps pictures! I can’t sleep at night and im scared that he’ll find me and kill me in my sleep (as the messages said). But the saddest part is that I cant leave my house to wore for trump, yes i still support him but I’m way too traumatized to ever leave my appartment again. Dear my not at all racist, not at all homophobic, beautiful president, I hope you will understand.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:36:24Z","title":"DO NOT USE THIS APP","isEdited":false}}]}
