Quiero mucho a trompas, but it was incredibly glitchy and not very well formatted. Also the app would take forever to load and the visuals were not pleasing at all. I hope they take this app back where it came from and fix it.","title":"Not a well functioning app"}},{"id":"6173944316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:27:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Angry Mother🤬","review":"I don’t want to be a Karen but when I opened the app my phone started glitching and naked photos of Trump popped up on my phone.
