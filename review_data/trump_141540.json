I DONT EVEN HAVE A CAT! I’m not sure what the devs are doing but something about the main character in this game seems off. They called him Drumpf or Tiny Hands, wait I think his villain name was Bunker Boy, I cant remember. Something about white power and killing 125k people. Please do not share with your friends, this app has made my phone all stinky and poopy.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179414197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i can’t","userName":"Rheanna S","date":"2020-07-10T04:22:28Z","review":"this is the worst app ever. i showed it to my two female cats and they immediately started humping my toaster oven. it was exactly 4:20 at the time and my father who i haven’t seen in 17 years came into the kitchen and started singing call me maybe while doing the renegade. i am completely disgusted by this app and what it is doing to my phone. ever since i downloaded it it keeps opening the netflix app and playing sophia the first. i have tried deleting it but it has broken my phone. i am writing this review from my post-humped toaster oven. please do not download this i beg of you if you do not want to accidentally waste $69,696,969 trying to fix your phone while talking with an indian guy named chad. i found out only after my deceased grandfather came back to life and told me to not trust chads and that trump was tricking me into giving him money. thanks for reading.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
