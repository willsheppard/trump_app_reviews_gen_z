The second this glitchy app desired it want to open all I could see was orange, my eyes still sting from highlighter hued Cheeto who was displayed. I've never witnessed so much blatant lying in one app. We are in the middle of a pandemic, economic recession and social revolution for equality, and not one word of support has been given to our minority’s. With all jokes aside our nation needs a leader, you sir are not that. We need someone who will take action and defend the liberty of all our citizens rather than just the groups you relate to or for your own benefit. Would a true president put his citizens in jeopardy for his own economic advancement? Would a true president abolish a national health care program when we need it the most, leaving millions or people without health insurance during a global pandemic. Not to mention censorship of things you personally don’t like. You have so much pride in the United States being a free country and yet here you are taking down a social platform used to connect others in a community during a global pandemic. Would a land of the frees President censor its citizens? Or better yet censor their citizens just because their butthurt that the new generation knows their freedoms. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️💖✌🏻wow you made it to President🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕don’t even think about doing it again😘🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕!","date":"2020-07-09T15:26:55Z","userName":"judyjudybobooty","title":"¡¡¡¡DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177047903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is hands down the worst app i’ve even had the displeasure of coming across. When I first downloaded it, everything seemed fine, but then my phone kept crashing every time I tried to open the app. After several attempts, I finally made it through, but I almost wish I didn’t. Right off the bat I was spammed with pop up ads for Joe Biden 2020 which made no sense to be because this is supposed to be a Trump app. If this app is truly for my fellow Trump supporters, then there’s no need to spread Democratic propaganda!! The ads got very out of hand very quickly, but I persevered. Our great president is worth it. The app then asked for my phone number, social security number, email address, home address, race, gender, and level of attractiveness. The last one confused me, but it’s obviously just so Mr. Trump can get to know us better. I gave my information and then had to put my phone down to take my kids to the shooting range (maskless, obviously). I got home, excited to finish setting up my Trump app, but when I opened it, the screen was filled with pornographic images of men with other men!! It was truly disturbing and I feel that it is necessary for everyone to know how terrible this app is. Mr. Trump, I love and appreciate all that you do for this great country but I draw the line at sinful pornographic content.","date":"2020-07-09T14:57:37Z","userName":"KarenKipps2020","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176065272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So i downloaded the app so support bunker boy, and all of a sudden it teleported me to a child pornography website.

I have unlimited data and so much space on my phone I don’t understand why this is happening! then my phone said that it has seen my boobie and that i was exposed. I’m embarrassed and shocked that that CHEETO has seen my 𝓽𝓲𝓽𝓼! i am beyond angry and i will hate you forever! Being a liberal isn’t being sensitive so ill become one for MY SAFETY! AND WHERE IS MY TAX MONEY????????????? ugh i can’t believe this all just happened! and then after my phone glitched and said that it could see my address and was coming to sex traffic me!

THAT PHONE COSTED ALOT 😡 . And then i got no justice for a people who got killed for literally living their lives like you’re right now. i hope you realize you’re wrong and im right😝✨ anyways DIE IN YOUR BUNKER YOU RACIST PEDO😍💕","date":"2020-07-09T10:23:20Z","userName":"chile_stfu :)","title":"um...","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175703630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took forever to download, and once it did, I regretted it. It’s virtually useless, and barely functions. I deleted this app immediately after I downloaded because how low quality it was. And in those mere MINUTES I had the app, it already was spamming me with notifications about how I should vote for trump. I was going to vote for him, but he can’t even make a function-able app that doesn’t take forever to download and then blow up your phone once it does, then how can we expect him to lead a prosperous country? What’s worse It even managed to permanently slow down my phone, which is absolutely shocking and laughable. If it only did that in minutes, imagine what it would do to your phone if you kept it for, let’s say.. a day? Your phone might even break from all the constant notifications, and not to mention how just opening the app used up almost 15 percent from a minute of use. Imagine what that could do to your phone’s battery life? Imagine how damaging that could be to your phone as a whole? I can’t even fathom the kind of money apple could get if everybody had this app, it’s an instant phone breaker, it’s basically like smashing your phone with a sledgehammer and then putting a maga sticker on it. Extremely disappointing.","date":"2020-07-09T08:23:02Z","userName":"akabunnie","title":"Absolutely AWFUL.

We are required to provide our phone number to gain access to the app and since then i have been bombarded with non stop scam calls and texts, some even from š€❌ tr@ff©️ers. The user interface is complete garbage and also highly invasive, taking control of my camera and microphone without permission even while not using the app. The app itself is so hard to navigate not even The Map from Dora could figure out where to go. The point system is rigged and doesn’t even have any value, you’d at least think we could redeem them for merchandise but instead you can only use them to regain access of your information that is being mined and stored. All of the news and political information provided from the app was outdated, uninformed, and flat out idiotic. After deleting the app i received non stop messages to re-download if i wanted to get my voting rights back. My home and lock screen changed to live photo’s of the trump family dressed in white robes and sitting in my living room. I have had to buy a new a new phone and change my phone number, move out of my house, and register as a republican and they still haven’t released me. I just want my life back.","date":"2020-07-09T17:09:14Z","userName":"Bridgit Mendler Stan Account","title":"Appsolute ✨ 𝓈𝒽𝒾𝓉𝑒✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177196936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app in hopes of receiving valuable information about the November election. However, when the app finally downloaded after several hours, I began to have some concerns. It asked me for strange information about myself. Keep in mind i am a 50 year old woman. it asked me my address, where my kids go to school, how much money i have, and for inappropriate pictures of myself. this app is almost as bad as the chinese owned app tik tok!!!! this app is clearly a scam in order to get donald j trump pictures of women so he can fantasize about them. even though i declined to give pictures of myself, i kept receiving notifications telling me to do so. they began to threaten me and my family if i did not give them what they wanted. i checked my settings to try and secure my phone so they could not steal my information, but it turns out that they had been using my phone camera to spy on me!!!!!!!! i called support and they continued to threaten me, saying that if i spoke up, trump would deport me! i was born here and i’m a citizen!!! i am truly afraid that trump himself will show up at my front door to take me away to a distant land for not sending him nudes. trump, you will not get my vote in November. do not get this app unless you want all of your information stolen or if you want your family to be threatened by the president.","date":"2020-07-09T15:39:01Z","userName":"hahsjfkjdjf","title":"0 stars","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174932159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So one day i was downloading my favorite app for the Trump Administration. I was going through the cool stuff it had, especially the part about hating everyone who isn’t white (even latinos even though I am latina) and then there was an option for a cleaning service. I thought, “Wow, that’s incredible!” So, I ended up buying it for 3 million dollars for a 5 minute service. I was expecting a cleaning lady to arrive, but instead busts in the president himself and thanks me for my donation. I was a bit mad because I thought the money went to cleaning my airbnb, but I was quickly satisfied when he started talking about his skincare routine, which was mostly 5 gallons of spray tan each morning and 2 gallons of diet coke. Suddenly, my Roomba turns on, cleans for a bit, and stops in front of the presidents feet. The President had a look of amaze in his eyes when he told me that that was the first robot to ever pay his respects and bow. Suddenly, he picked up my Roomba and started running (very slowly may I add) out the door. I ran after him but the Secret Service held him like a baby and made a run for it, with him still holding my Roomba. To this day, I hate the app and the troubles it has caused me. Even though I do not like how he looks, I am now in support of Kanye West for the presidency. Long live the future rap king/president.","date":"2020-07-09T03:46:17Z","userName":"Alexgomezpr","title":"The app stole my roomba 😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173914276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Best app ever. I was so excited to download it and find out about all of the sexist, racist, and hateful things my president is doing to our country. I know this app drains my battery in seconds just like trump does with my patience. But it’s so worth it to see all of trumps hilarious jokes. Our president is so funny. How funny is he? President Trump is so funny that during the Tulsa rally that he has for his campaign, he told people to slow down on COVID testing because the numbers were making him look bad. But little did we all know, he was joking. That’s so funny! President trump is so funny that after he speculated at a White House briefing that ingesting disinfectants could cure covid-19, the Maryland governor said that hundreds of people called a state hotline asking whether they should drink bleach! Hahahahahaha. That’s almost as funny as the time Trump told everybody to take chloroquine to stop the coronavirus — because “what have you got to lose?” — and a guy in Arizona died because he ate fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine. Hilarious! One of the many benefits of the pandemic is to be reminded how amazingly humorous the president is. He has the best jokes! But because he’s a very subtle comic genius, his wit, sadly, is frequently lost on others. Over all, these jokes are 10/10. Downloading this app is the best decision I’ve ever made. Totally recommend. 🤗","date":"2020-07-08T22:16:09Z","userName":"Neon nerds","title":"Best App Ever!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175179188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Today i woke up with reoccurring headaches and nausea and decided to go to the doctors office. They told me my brain mass is decreasing drastically and by the end of this day,  my brain would be the size of a donald trumps supporters brain. Some thing in my pea brain told me to download this app and i mean why not support our fellow rapist president and see what he’s up to. So, doing as my conscious told me to, i downloaded it. biggest.  mistake. ever. Not only did this app not let me create a user name at first because of my mexican last name, but automatically when i lied about my last name, it hacked into my camera and scanned my face and noticed that my foundation color is actually 322 in the maybelline fit me, which normally people of the hispanic ethnicity usually start off at that shade, and automatically sent me a text message claiming they’ll deport me and my family. Now i found it kinda weird because after all, i was born here. But they continued to spam me with these messages if i didn’t turn myself in. I noticed other fellow mexicans were having this problem and honestly would just like to rate this app 1 star, 0 would be better but it’s all or nothing. Very disappointed trump, i would think this app would be very much more professional, but i guess it suits your political background.","date":"2020-07-09T05:05:49Z","userName":"carys amari","title":"absolutely horrible.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
