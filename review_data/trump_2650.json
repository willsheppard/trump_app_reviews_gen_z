However I recently went up to his rally in Tulsa and let me tell you. I was sitting a the front row closets to trump. I was very excited so I was chanting his name and holding up a sign that said \" I love America's Cheeto!\". I guess he took in the wrong way because he turned and SPIT ON ME. It was a shower of stinky, hot, and STD infested spit onto my face. Not only that but it was so much it had soaked the floor and had me slipping and sliding like I'm at a water park. I then accidentally slipped into this man next to me who said no \"n-word\" is gonna touch me and WWE body slammed me to the floor. Now I'm in the hospital all because of the president degrading me. Girl I'm gonna get covid in here all these people coughing, I can no longer support him!","userName":"Taylor4703","rating":1,"title":"I can't believe Trump did this","date":"2020-07-08T16:03:21Z"}},{"id":"6172801019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app shows you all of Trumps “good moments”. This app doesn’t show the racism, the sexism, and the worst moments our so called “president” has. I been waiting for this WALL you say that we will have. You don’t care about the corona virus. Trump doesn’t even WEAR a MASK. He put aside all the debt that he put America in because he’s ashamed in his work to “make America great again” if you where going to make it great again I would try and make a change and not keep it how it was. The only thing going for this so called “president” is the second amendment, and the unemployment rate gone down. Other than this the 70+ man runs our county like a 10 year old child. I can easily say his son Barren can run this country than himself. SO I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO GET THIS APP ITS DISGRACED TO THE UNITED STATES IF AMERICA.","userName":"GENZVALERIE","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T16:00:55Z"}},{"id":"6172783656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"First of all...this app took a whole MONTH to download! And when I tried to call for help, they were EXTREMELY rude to me! They kept calling me a tree! They knew I was very sensitive of my size! And every time I open the app a giant Orange 🍊 flashes on the screen!😡😡😡 THE SCREEN KEPT GLITCHING TOO! I would try to see when his next campaign was, reserved the tickets and not go, but it just Kelly glitching. I think I saw even more 🍊 🍊  than before! My dog also almost DIED when using the app! He passed out at the sight at the amount of 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊 on the screen. They were so mean to him and called him names. He is now never gonna be able to look at an 🍊 again but thank GOD he is alive! Please DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!!! Horrible service and quality!😡😡😡 also......BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"mayo is cool","rating":1,"title":"Horrible App! 👿👿👿👿","date":"2020-07-08T15:55:54Z"}},{"id":"6172529645","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate this app. Not only is it teaching kids that being racist is okay but it’s teaching them that being homophobic, transphobic, and sexist is okay. Not acceptable. The trump administration really needs to get their  act together and build a better future for our kids and having this app is not a good one. Actually please scratch the last sentence. I don’t want you anywhere near our younger youth please and thank you✨😌 \nPs. If you really wanna help this country please step down as a candidate and turn yourself to jail🤠 I didn’t even say president cause I never really considered you one 😍🥰❤️✨\nThis ones for the boys with the booming system top down ac with the cooling system and when he come up in the club he be blazing up got stacks on deck like he saving up. 😗✌️","userName":"MandySakamaki","rating":1,"title":"This is just NOT it 😌✨","date":"2020-07-08T14:44:26Z"}},{"id":"6172008450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i want to see the rise in our country but all i have seen is the fall. our “great president” has down played the virus from the start, lies about things he has done to MINORS, and is over all terrible. all you small minded people say that he is a great president but some of us are the future of the country and we want to see it thrive not fall apart.\n\nso i ask all that we do something and vote for the person who is best for the people. some may say that Obama was bad but he got all the terrible things that Bush had left our count with and brought the numbers down. Obama doesn’t deserve hate for doing something great for the country.\n\nso Trump supporters if you really want to make America great again then make the right choice for who you vote for.","userName":"sup dude sup","rating":1,"title":"not helpful at all","date":"2020-07-08T12:19:17Z"}},{"id":"6177828959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Me and my family have been following Mr. Trump since 2016, and like most conservatives, supported him. This app single handedly changed my mind about him. As soon as it downloaded onto my phone, my dog was hit by a car. when I stepped outside to go see what happened, my first step out the door snapped my ankle, broke my femur, and tore my ACL. When my family came to help me they suffered the same misfortune, in a comically one after the other fashion. At first I thought this was an isolated event, but as it turns out from others , this app has caused misfortune to them as well. I currently live in fear of any sort of app now and have ptsd problems whenever politics are remotely mentioned. Please do not download this app, think of the children.","userName":"Some real kid (legit)","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app, DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T18:49:21Z"}},{"id":"6177711806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Hello, I was so happy that the app had downloaded AFTER A MONTH because it said that Harry Styles would show up to my house but THAT DIDNT HAPPEN EVEN AFTER I FILLED OUT ALL OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION!

I threw up and fell off the building I was sitting on, luckily I landed on Trumps daughter.... But when I got back on the app, I tried making a account but it ATE my information I was getting so many scam text messages than my phone kept crashing !!! The text messages were telling me to say all this racist, creepy, and homophobic stuff, and that’s kinda weird because I’m Pan myself... When I stated my sexuality I was getting told to kill myself!! All I wanted to do is support America’s orange, you know “Trump2020” but now, I need to get to Satan, I was saved but then I ended up hearing Trumps voice...
