First thing I notice when I go onto the app is it’s set up almost like a cult. Help donald by doing this and that. This to me shows that he is not confident in winning future elections and that his stance is unsure. How can someone lead this country if they aren’t even capable of doing things solo, requesting the help from his followers."}},{"id":"6177881988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:29Z","userName":"Rain boot","rating":1,"title":"Nasty","review":"I downloaded this app to educate myself on the beliefs of the opposing side so I could understand the way they think. The second I opened this app I was disgusted. It functions like it’s older than the dusty crusty Cheeto himself, by crashing all the time. It is an absolute disgrace of an app, much like the toupee the orange man wears to protect his bald head from the sun. If I could give this app a lower rating I would."}},{"id":"6177871907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:02:19Z","userName":"Stradigys","rating":1,"title":"Very bad fat orange","review":"Alright so this app took forever to download it took two weeks!!!

If you’re going to try and take Gen Z’s most prized possession (tiktok), then you can bet we aren’t going down without a fight. We almost took out google classroom, and we are the ones who threw the tear gas back at the police. Don’t be surprised when your app is gone, trump. 😌💅✨💕😋"}},{"id":"6177832792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:50:28Z","userName":"AD on lakers","rating":1,"title":"✨ew✨","review":"i downloaded this app so i can stay up to date with the “president’s” horrible campaign along with his racist and homophobic beliefs that only benefit rich white cis men.  i was deeply saddened when after waiting TWO WEEKS for the app to download that, this app constantly glitches and malfunctioned.  i was horribly depressed that i couldn’t see the president’s uneducated opinion.  anyway #settleforbiden and stan nicki😹."}},{"id":"6177831425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:50:05Z","userName":"🎷🐀","rating":1,"title":"✨This app has ruined my life✨","review":"I got the app to see what the great ✨ORANGE✨ had to say and in the process of downloading the app my son tripped over my big phat juicy kankles and broke his knee caps and his spleen fell out and his kidney burst and now we are drowning in debt and on the way to the hospital we hit a deer and it broke the car window.

He needs his own special place 👁👄👁. Now time to say why I got this app, I didn't I was scrolling to find some stuff and I saw this😭😭. Like... I didn't need to see this pumpkin🎃 pie 🥧. Like even me, satan was terrified of this. No human should ever need to see this. Now every gen z do your job and get this ✨app out of here✨ \n✨👁👅👁✨"}}]}
