First of all, the application took up a lot of my storage space and I had to delete a couple apps just for it to download. Then as soon as I clicked on the icon it was just a black screen for a few seconds before it glitched out. I tried again and the same thing happened. I had to delete more apps and redownload this one for it to even open. Then as soon as I opened the app I was assisted by a picture of the Trumpkin. All jokes aside, I had to enter my mobile number to go further, which Iâ€™m quite mad that it isnâ€™t even taken into consideration that not everyone has a phone. I had to use a friends number just to get in. Then from there the app only got worse. It came to a screen with articles and other things, and when I tried to click on one of the links the app shorted out again. None of the links worked, and I kept getting pop ups asking me to donate, which is fine and all, but as soon as I exited out from one, about a minute or so would pass before I got another. Overall I wouldnâ€™t recommend this app, itâ€™s super glitchy, and annoying. Iâ€™ve seen in other reviews that they talk about the app asking for your credit card information, but it doesnâ€™t, unless youâ€™re trying to donate. Plus if you read the privacy policy it says the app may share your information with a third party I donâ€™t support Trump, but this is an honest review of my experience, the developers have a lot of work cut out for them. And in case you might ask, it wasnâ€™t a problem on my end, this was a new iPad (I got it around 1-2 weeks ago) and I did have enough storage space for the app, my WiFi connection was also stable and secure.","date":"2020-06-28T06:02:40Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6125941578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rewards collector","title":"Awful App","isEdited":false,"review":"The app leaked my personal information and kept spamming me with notifications!","date":"2020-06-27T00:36:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6116775696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jdjfjifk3459'fk","title":"EWWWðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app ever!
