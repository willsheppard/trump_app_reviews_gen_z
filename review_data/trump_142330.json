It took 2 hours for the whole app to download and to do stuff on it. I have an iPhone XR. This app is such a disgrace to the App Store and America. It should be taken down, and don’t ever make another Donald trump app unless for are killing him, tearing him limb for limb or any cause of pain to Donald trump. Then many people will be happy. That’s why this app has 1 stars. Donald trump is a rapist and a racist.Delete the app before the App Store deletes it. Thank you","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:49:12Z","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1}}]}
