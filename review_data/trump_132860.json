I definitely DO NOT recommend. Asks for way too much personal info that I don’t feel comfortable sharing. Don’t waste your time on it. Also it took way too long to download and I couldn’t do anything on it. It kept shutting down and bringing me to a video on YouTube showing me koi fish talking to each other. It was traumatic to me. I now have a terrible fear of koi fish that I have to live with everyday. I can’t visit my uncle anymore because he has 7 koi fish in his pond.","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:01Z"}},{"id":"6173737155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"CougaRAWR","title":"Balls","review":"This app sucked more balls than Kim Kardashian ever has in her entire life... also the developer of this app is a homosexual and should be burned...\n\n anywayssss\n\nNOT ALL THE LOVE -H\n\nAlso treat people with kindness but not the developer of this dumbass app \n\n😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛😝😜🤪🤨🧐🤓😎🤩🥳😏😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵🥶😱😨😰😥😓🤗🤔🤭🤫🤥😶😐😑😬🙄😯😦😧😮😲🥱😴🤤😪😵🤐🥴🤢🤮🤧😷🤒🤕🤑🤠😈👹\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","date":"2020-07-08T21:09:52Z"}},{"id":"6173735594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"chimpkin","title":"Quite gæ indeed","review":"Pee pee poo poo haha lol😹😻💕😋✨🧚👾👀😸✌️😽","date":"2020-07-08T21:09:16Z"}},{"id":"6173735388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Weird Stranger","title":"ew.","review":"ew. ew ew ew ew, ew ew. ew ew, EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW!!!

The app took me 3 MONTHS to download and it gave my phone viruses while it was downloading. Finally when it downloaded, a tiktok of trump doing the “hit it for free” trend popped up. Very unpleasant. Then, 2 days later with the app on my phone, i started to notice that everyone that i would see out in public were slowly turning orange and i freaked out. I came back home that day and decided to relax and open the app to see our lovely presidents polls and what not, and this very odd music and smell started coming out of my phone... So i took a wiff and when i say it smelled like poop, im not joking it smelled like literal explosive diarrhea. I thought this was all a coincidence till that night when i walked into my dogs room and he started glowing orange and flying around everywhere. Please do not download this app i am so scared for my safety and privacy. VOTE KANYE 2020 so “Wolfes” can be our new national anthem and the diary of a wimpy kid flag can be the new flag.","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:53Z"}},{"id":"6173734504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bacen biscuits","title":"No banning tiktok","review":"Trump wants to ban tiktok for NO reason and it’s not fair bc a lot of people enjoy tiktok and making dance videos.they also love that they all can get a chance to get famous when people follow them.Im at 439 followers on tiktok I really love the people who follow me and I love tiktok so I shouldn’t be taken down just bc of are STUPID President plz do a review if you agree with me","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:52Z"}},{"id":"6173734395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nenewton","title":"bad app. it broke my phone","review":"like i said. it broke my phone.\n\n__________$$$$$$\n_________$$____$$\n_________$$$__$$$\n_________$$_$$_$$\n_________$$____$$\n_________$$____$$\n_________$$____$$\n_________$$____$$$$$$$\n___$$$$$$$$____$$____$$\n_$$$$$___$$____$$____$$$$$$\n$$$_$$___$$____$$____$$___$$\n$$__$$___$$____$$____$$___$$\n$$__$$___$$____$$____$$___$$\n$$__$$___$$____$$___$$$___$$\n$$__$$___$$____$$____$____$$\n$$____$$$__$$$$__$$$$___$_$$\n$$________________________$$\n_$$_______________________$$\n_$$$_____________________$$\n__$$$$_________________$$$\n____$$_________________$\n____$$$_______________$$","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:49Z"}}]}
