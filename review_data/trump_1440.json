Where to meet other like minded bigots? The app needs to stop using double-talk and just tell me who to blame and to whom I must direct my toxic masculinity!\nI’m not smart enough to think for myself. Duh! That’s why I downloaded this app in the first place. \n* Just want to say that as a fiscal conservative: keep politics off my face and between a woman’s legs (where they are supposed to be), cut all spending to the government (except to fund the militarized police state), protect hard-working corporate entities from money grubbing “employees” (so that really great Americans like Linda McMahon, Lorenzo Fertitta, and Isaac Perlmutter can do their part to fund this series of military operations <cough> campaigns <cough> against these (so called) Americans, and MOST importantly!!! \nStop all these mean, spoiled-sport, brown, poo-poo heads from saying mean things about our founding great-grand daddies!!! Those perfect men... <neighing> nay, God-like, men never done nuttin’ wrong....\nCuz its makin me have to confront the fact that they was just men that did great and terrible things. That they weren’t perfect and infallible <slowing down>.... and that just, like Meemaw, we only want to remember the good things they did and said and gloss over how racist she was...\n\nOh-okay... Yikes. 😬 \n“","isEdited":false,"title":"Not Inflammatory Enough!","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:48Z","rating":1,"userName":"justgotdarker"}},{"id":"6172625245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay. Just to start off I wanted to see what this app was about so I decided to get it. But it took about two months to install fully on my device. Then after it actually installed, I opened the app and this page popped up and it said “your tracker is now attached to your device, prepare for the police.” And me and my pet cat were scared to death sitting in my room. But we though that it was fake so I clicked the next button and five minutes later I heard a scratch at the door and when I opened it, 2 guard dogs starting attacking me and ripping up my clothes and one of them ate my glasses. There were no cops or cop cars around though. But then my cat beat up the two guard dogs and we kicked them out of our house and I deleted the app. I would not recommend getting this app unless you want animals beating you up.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app might be the worst app I’ve seen in years and it’s so scary","date":"2020-07-08T15:11:00Z","rating":1,"userName":"Ronald Mcdonalds brother"}},{"id":"6177815478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok so I got this because it told me that Billie Eilish would come to my doorstep and that DIDNT happen. The next morning I started to feel all woozy but I ignored that and started going on with my day. I started hearing horrible racist/sexual remarks and had the urge to say those terrible things, next thing I knew I saw my hand turning 🍊orange🍊 and I just knew and went to the mirror to see that MY HAIR WAS LIKE SPAGHETTI STRANDS AND I HAD ORANGE SKIN. I got so scared and mad because I looked like an Oompa Loompa. As I started turning into Donald Trump I heard a woman’s voice and it sounded like Melania Trump! I went downstairs and saw her. It was the weirdest thing. I saw DONALD DUCKS CHILDREN COME TO ME AND I JUST STARTED SCREAMING. I did what the app was supposed to give me and I went to Billie Eilish’s house. SHE REFUSED TO SEE ME AND SAID SHE DOESNT ALLOW OOMPA LOOMPAS IN, I WAS SO HEARTBROKEN THAT I TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED AND SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVED ME! I still am an Oompa Loompa and I hope that whoever gets this app, be careful.","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT GET","date":"2020-07-09T18:45:24Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kaitlyn Reyes"}},{"id":"6177561630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I was sitting there on my bed, scrolling through daddy d’s favorite app ✨tik tok✨ when I saw that they had a new app for Donald duck🦆 smh I whent on the App Store and looked for the app and found this...😳 Idk if it was the orange skin or it was the flipping yellow hair that made me think this was the Donald Duck app😝😔 I downloaded this one in hopes that I would finally get to be with my daddy Donald the duck😭😞 instead I was met with an orange🙈🍊 but they scariest was yet to come.... right after I opened the app, my phone started glitching and playing gabbies butthole clenching song, “I climbed out of my head...” the walls started to shake.

I had more trust in our president than any other patriot and his app did this to me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT WILL GIVE YOU A VIRUS. Worst app ever. I really thought that I would be able to support my wonderful orange Cheeto president by getting it. I heard that this app will automatically make you rich! Since trump has been doing so ämàźînñgggg with the economy, I thought well of course his app would give me money because he’s a billionaire!!! And his supporters only get the best of the best. Well I’ve been waiting for over several months now to get rich and I haven’t. Since I thought I was going to have a huge amount of money after downloading this app I went and spent my life savings on MAGA stuff and now I’m in immense debt. It’s all this apps fault. Nobody ever download it because you won’t get rich you’ll only get a VIRUS. The Coronavirus to be specific.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T16:57:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"Freeplay junkie"}},{"id":"6177092966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about our sexy president ❤️🍊❤️  but I found out this app was very much brainless and brainwashing. I saw a lot of posts about racism and sexism and I was convinced they were fine. The app literally tells you to be a wall builder and sexist person. My experience was horrendous, while thinking about our beautiful 🧚🏿\u200D♂️yankee🧚🏿\u200D♂️ I was brainwashed. Thanks to God my parents are immigrants and they let me see the truth of our 💅🧚🏿\u200D♂️orange🍊💅. It was a journey of self-discovery, I learnt with this app that “sometimes you need to meet a bad person and learn from them how not to be like them” our president is really good at doing the bad guy job. Thanks to him we all most got killed by corona and got protests 👁👄👁.  And he also started a whole revolution and opened our eyes to PEDEPHILES in power. Thanks beautiful ORANGE O 🧚🏿\u200D♂️ORANGE 🍊MY LOVE 😍 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ORANGE 🍊YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ❤️ARE 🧚🏿\u200D♂️😍😍","isEdited":false,"title":"Definitely not tik tok 🐊","date":"2020-07-09T15:10:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"old fan213"}},{"id":"6176981694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a month to download and when it was finally done I stated to receive death threats from Donald Trump saying if I deleted the app there will find and kill me but when I tried it wouldn’t let me delete the app I tried day after day and weeks after weeks trying to delete the app until finally it deleted...But ever since thin the fbi has been taking photos of my house every day from a mysterious black van and knocking on my door asking did I have the Trump 2020 app but I lied and said no so I just moved and when I came back to my old house I seen my dog was dead and with his blood wrote on the right side of my house said why did you delete the Trump 2020 app... so when I seen it I called the cops but they said they had better things to do like killing minorities but they still wouldn’t listen to me even tho we I was white and needed help","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP THREATEN TO KILL ME!!","date":"2020-07-09T14:39:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"BallinJahvon"}},{"id":"6176454089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app I TERRIBLE it needs to be taken down immediately from all app stores. Not only did it take such a long time to even start running but it was glitching all the way out! I think it even took my personal information! Personal information I didn’t even give it! The design of the app is cheesy and bland it doesn’t have any flavor to it. The nonsense this app says can’t even be deemed as funny for I can not laugh at stupidity at this degree. This app is so bad I wish I could give it less of a star. In the end the design is horrible, the app is not well managed it’s like something they put together and for it to be in the #1 spot for news is a joke, and it’s not developed properly as seeing they tried to take information and the app started glitching out. There is so much I want to say but this review would become a book.

I now feel really weird. like I think the government is watching me - hey guys 🙈😹- but it’s just simply an odd app! ever since I got this app, strange things are happening.

All my neighbors were very shocked but one ended up throwing a 900 ton Dyson V11 Torque drive cordless vacuum on me😥! She said it was because the sounds of the enderman teleporting woke her and her husband up. I tried to sue her😤😠👿but forgot that my parents were gone.
