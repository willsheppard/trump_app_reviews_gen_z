I wanted to support my beloved president by downloading this app and once I did my phone immediately began glitching. The app opened on its own and would drain my battery within minutes! The amount of ads is ridiculous also! There is literally a pop up ad video every 5 minutes and it won’t let you exit out of it! I have gotten so many emails and messages from family and friends saying that I supposedly sent them links to support the president when I never did! It’s sending our random messages to random people. I just can’t believe he would create an app this horrible!"}},{"id":"6174942866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS FOR DWEEBS","userName":"DIXXXIE_NORMUS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:49:34Z","review":"I’m glad you’re safe and I don’t know if you’re gonna is that a little thing you want us just like to come over and do it for me a lot and I’m just trying to come home now I love y’all so I’m sorry I’m gonna is it gonna is a way I gotta is this one time for ya I wanna I love y’all so I’m glad you got it I wanna I gotta is that the time you wanna was it was just like the baby you are gonna I love you so much and I’m sorry baby I’m gonna is your mom I wanna was the time I wanna go get back with my baby girl I gotta was gonna was your birthday so you’re gonna you’re not all the way back home now I just wanna is a good day I was just like I gotta is a way to go home now I love ya!"}},{"id":"6174881778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ASTRONOMICALLY TERRIBLE APP!!!","userName":"Kylex37<3","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:31:18Z","review":"This app literally is the worst! Not only does it glitch and crash all the time but it murdered my pet iguana. I was just chillin looking at the news and then BAM my phone started going CrAzY!!! it was shaking around until it was standing vertical on the table. It then proceeded to leap off the table, go to the kitchen, zoom in on trumps hand, grab a knife and skrt skrt upstairs to my iguanas habitat!!! The lights started flicker Wong on and off, so I decided to follow it and see the evil it was about to do! I sprinted up the stairs to see my iguana laying on the floor with blood everywhere! Then I turned my head and saw the knife leaning against the phone screen with the most horrific photo ever. Trumps wig!! 🥺😫😡😱😰🤭"}},{"id":"6174860222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App!! Sad!","userName":"Etanon","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:25:02Z","review":"I used this app because I was all about supporting Trump! He is everything I aspire to be in a person. The way he cheated on multiple wives and inappropriately persuaded girls to do his bidding. The way he promised to make America great like before all this Civil Rights nonsense, back when the whites were on top! That’s what I wanted. But sadly this app does not live up to the greatness I thought Trump would be capable of. This shoddy app is poorly designed , impossible to figure out how to use, and over all poorly set up! I can’t believe something like this is on the on the App Store! Soon we will get it off my people, and don’t forget to arrest the cops who murdered Breanna Taylor"}},{"id":"6174705172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"just horrible","userName":"Poojiepoodepoo","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:38:31Z","review":"my grandmother is a hoarder and is getting a house inspection soon to sell her house. she needs to get the trash out fast so i got this app assuming the Trump Association was a trash company. as it turns out the app is for a cheeto running for president. who knew!! anyways, i had to put in my phone number and the president called me himself!! i asked if they could pick up my grandmothers trash and he laughed at me but got her address. i find out a week later that he came to her house himself and killed her! totally don’t recommend this app to anyone, also the app had so many glitches and was so hard to maneuver!!! if i could give it -1 star i would!"}},{"id":"6174665385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app made my rabbit eat it’s babies","userName":"my tiktok is @eat_a_brick.c0m","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:46Z","review":"Absolutely not😡😡😡 \nI lost my 7000 dollar pet RABBIT because of this stupid app and I will never ever EVER recommend this to my friends because then they will eat there babies too and I don’t want poor little susy to be eaten she has a whole life ahead of her.

I don’t know how this app thinks it’s going to stick around for very long, personally I predict it will be gone before November but that’s just a hunch 🤷🏼\u200D♀️. Updates I would recommend would be to remove the racism and outright white supremacist language and behavior, the homophobia, the xenophobia, the ignorance, the stupidity, and maybe have this app start reading books and credible news sources, or at least its daily briefings to stay up to date. But like I said, I don’t think it will survive through November or so, so don’t hurt yourself trying to think too hard about accomplishing those very basic common human decency goals."}},{"id":"6174582484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wish I could give this 0 stars","userName":"madisynpri","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:03:14Z","review":"I HATE THIS APP!!! It’s horrendous and appalling! The first thing I see when I opened this app was “keep america great” and for that, this deserves a fat -5 stars. This country is not great, far from it!! I could never ever join a campaign that believes such lies. Our country has so so so so so much to learn right now, needs so much healing, needs peace, and it needs to be united. If you are a lover of the United States Of America, you would be doing our country a disservice to download this app and join the campaign that believes this country is great. DELETE THE APP!!!!! Not to mention It is very slow and it takes up soooooo much storage on my phone. Thank you."}}]}
