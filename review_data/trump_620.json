I downloaded it in hopes of supporting are wonderful, respectful, handsome president in the upcoming election but what I got was very different. It took about two hours to download and when it was finally downloaded, my phone was glitching so much that I couldn’t open any apps except this one. When I did open it, I was greeted by a red screen one large piece of text that said “SATAN IS AMONG YOU”. Obviously, as a good christian woman, this startled me. After about 5 minutes of that screen, it moves onto another one. There was now a pentagram in the middle of the screen and my phone started making weird noises that sounded like Satanic chants. I burst out in tears and immediately called my pastor on the landline. When he arrived at my home, the chants were even louder. My phone eventually burst into flames and thousands of rats came scurrying into my house and sacrificed themselves to the flames. I am very disappointed. I had to buy a new phone, and I have thousands of dead rats on my kitchen floor. 1 star."}},{"id":"6173556908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app made my family die so thank you very much😌✨💖⚡️💘😘💕","date":"2020-07-08T20:05:28Z","userName":"jendnejd","rating":1,"review":"hello I have a story time. So I downloaded this app because my mom told me to and well it didn’t go as planned, I open the app and it tookWeeks at a time to use the app and I was very frustrated with that.🤬🤬🤬After it finally loaded it’s starts playing this horrible music it  made my ears bleed. But after that horrible music started playing all of these flying bugs came into my house and I couldn’t do anything because I’m so freaking  afraid of them. so I had to ask my dad to help me and he said he wouldn’t. I was so upset but then the flying bugs decide to leave and I have a sigh of relief come over me. And then a day later all of a sudden all these rats start coming into my house and they all look orange kind of like your trump. So I then proceeded to run around the house while being chased by them it was a horrible experience let me tell you that. I then decided to delete the app and once I did  my whole house went up into flames. so my family is dead now ☺️😌💖👄✨👅💕👁👅👁"}},{"id":"6173489549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-08T19:42:29Z","userName":"BLM HLM 😎😼🧚\u200D♀️👾💇\u200D♀️😤🐮🦧","rating":1,"review":"After this app took weeks to download the first thing I saw was a screen of his NOODS, causing my great grandpa to pass out and die!!!! I was traumatized I  even had to get EYE SURGERY. One time when my turtle saw the app on my phone he DIED!! Because of this a goat came into my house and took my turtles corpse to sacrifice to the goat satan, who supported señor Cheeto. Because of the goat my house got RATS, and my sister is allergic to rats!!! And when she saw them she had a severe allergic reaction, when we tried to call 911 they said that they wouldn’t sent the cops because we believe in ACAB, and also they wouldn’t  send the medics because we are a hispanic family, on the phone they even called us BEANERS, and threatens to call ICE even though we are all unfortunately citizens on the USA. Also this app hacked my tiktok and made my bio say Trump 2020, and changed my for-you page go straight tiktok, which I am severely allergic to, cousins me to DIE! This app should be DELETED. Señor Orange Cheeto OWS me a brand new turtle, funeral, and multi-million dollar house.                😳🚪😤🐢✨💅👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️🦆😿🕺🦧🐮"}},{"id":"6177866593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This app promised things that were not true","date":"2020-07-09T19:00:40Z","userName":"erase Trump","rating":1,"review":"I saw on the news if I went on this app I would see the sexiest man alive. He was supposed to be sexier then Harry styles. I did not believe it at first because Harry styles is the sexiest man alive no matter what but the racist people said that I would see someone sexier. I thought that maybe I would give it a try. I got the app and instead I saw the nasty orange man who has weird hair is racist and is a rapist. I was so scared that I went into shock and died at the ugliness I saw at the screen. I am now in hell and typing this just to let everyone know that you to will die of shock due the the organs mans ugliness. It is much better to save your life and just look at shirtless pics of Harry styles because he is the sexiest, kindest, sweetest, respectful, and humble man on the planet. \nTo conclude, Harry styles is Jesus but the orange man ( which name I can’t say because I get flash backs of his face)is the devil. Actually sorry that is being rude to the devil (tpwk) the orange man is like a scooter to the ankle. \n💅💅💅 \n \nHave a nice day 🥰🥰#savebarrontrump"}},{"id":"6177688674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Caused a trip to the ER","date":"2020-07-09T18:07:14Z","userName":"bobbyswheels213675","rating":1,"review":"I was very excited to see that trump had his own app but so stuff happens. This app took over 4 days to download which made me very disappointed. Once I got onto the app my phones battery started going down till it died. Once I was able to get onto my phone again I noticed that every app and my screen saver had been changed to a picture of our 🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨amazing president💅🏻✨ I also noticed that my camera roll was full of pictures of him🥵 and there were pictures of him on my instagram that were not there before. After deleting those photos I returned to the app to try and open it again. Once on the app my phone started to over heat and made terrible noises. These sounds could be heard all across my house and my little brother has very sensitive hearing so these sounds caused him lost of pain. He ended up in the hospital over night after having a seizure from these sounds. My family has been hurt by this app I’m so many ways. I am very disappointed. #savebarron2020😘"}},{"id":"6177501066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨💥terrible💥✨","date":"2020-07-09T17:07:34Z","userName":"😝ihatethisbs😛","rating":1,"review":"okay to start off this app is soooo soo sooo terrible, it took a whole 4 months to download and then once i tried opening it up it literally deleted and then i had to wait 4 more months and now i try to open it and it doesn’t let me open it, it’s so terrible please don’t download i don’t recommend 🙀!. this app is also so terrible because every time i open it all i see is a weird ugly logo, it isn’t very cute. i’ve said enough now let me let out some of my feelings uGh 😫 i just need a place to VeNt, so today i was watering my pet snake and it died instantly and i was shocked hunny i was, i was also very upset 😢 but then after a couple mins it came back from the DEAD 💀😝!  but then i decided to drown it and now it’s officially officially dead thehehehe #🥳🥳🥳🥳 #mysnakedrownparty🙀😉, also any one have any tips and tricks on how to have a gorilla 🦍 grip ykyk plsplspls lmk 🤠, anyways i’m having a party at my house, eVery OnE iS iNvitEd ✨💥🥳 pull up to ihatethisappandwannadie ave st. hehe starts at 12 pm ends whenever we die 😫😛"}},{"id":"6176648814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T13:11:59Z","userName":"ignatius.thistlewhite","rating":1,"review":"downloading this app was one of the worst mistakes of my life. everything was normal until i started gaining points on the app. unsure of how to use these points, i decided to contact trump’a team and ask. i was surprised to get a note back from trump himself saying that the point system on the app worked “like my favrite sport golf” (he misspelled favorite which was a bit worrying but i let it slide). he explained that i was now indebted to him due to the points i had accumulated and was at his beck and call! i was flabbergasted and was rethinking my support for the president. a day later i got an email from trump demanding that i infiltrate north korea to see is kim jong un actually likes him. i told him that i absolutely could not, what with the coronavirus and the danger of going to north korea, and asked for a different assignment. he replied that the virus wasn’t real and i was stupid for worrying, and promised to send me to “the next best thing.” i am writing this review from federal prison. unless you want to end up like me please don’t download this app!!!!"}},{"id":"6175966635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T09:51:32Z","userName":"Hunter🇺🇸🐟🥵","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my great president (took hours to download btw).And everything seemed normal when I opened it BUT, the problems started happening after I closed it. As soon, as I did I got a text from a unknown number to go to my front door. Because I follow everyone so blindly I did this that when, I opened the door about 6-8 small orange men in suits telling me to open this app again. In response I simply said “No, I just spent hours on the app learning app our wonderful president.” they forced me into their American flag van. I was the taken to some warehouse house were I had to around 10 rallys of Trump’s. The men from earlier then proceed to spray me with orange spray tan so I can be orange like them and Donald. Afterwords, I was finally untied and given a red ‘Make America Great Again’ hat but I already have 7 (one for each day of the week). I suddenly made a run for it and I’m currently hiding right now. Update: I’ve been hiding for couple hours and the guys for looking for me.

This resulted in a long talk with them all night! My dad blames everything on me even though the trump app did it🤬🤬. I swear to god if I could give this app zeros stars, I WOULD!! I am currently writing this while I have the time. Right now I am in court waiting for our turn and deal with the divorce papers.

Please do not unless u want this to happen to u but yeah this app is not the best and never will be! Keep this in mind this happened about a week ago until I found out I could write a review. My phone still has the virus. And because of COVID-19 no phone store is open near me. Thanks a lot to this app. And because of what happened to me this app is getting a 1 STAR REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}}]}
