When I first entered the app, I saw a large orange figure with corn like hair who also happened to look like a turkey and it scared me. I did not know why this app, which was supposed to be educational, gave me such a jump scare. Like, I didn’t notice Halloween came early?? This figure looked like a giant Oompa Loompa and I got reminded of all the nightmares I had from watching Charlie and the chocolate factory. And the fact that he’s holding up his fist is making me FEAR for my life. This figure could literally show up at my doorstep and beat me up like the lady leaving a voicemail for Rachel the big, fat, white nasty, smelling a** bxtch, why you took me off the motherfxcking schedule with your trifling dirty white r*c*st a** big fat bxtch. Its making me fear for my life. Secondly, the reason why I got this app was to get informed and the first thing it asked for was my phone number?? Like hello!! It’s 2020 who uses phone numbers and texts? We all have social media so why bother asking for my phone? Anyways, this app is terrible and I have never encountered such a terrifying experience that genuinely made me fear for my life.","date":"2020-07-10T07:16:20Z"}},{"id":"6179900991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","userName":"send trum","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Hey y’all so I just want to inform u of the disgrace of an app that this is.
