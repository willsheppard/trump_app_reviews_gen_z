Not only was it disgusting and a bit enjoyable, but it definitely is not what I was expecting when this is supposedly the official Donald Trump app. Extraordinarily disappointed and I expect a full refund and to hear an apology straight from corporate.","rating":1,"title":"Naked photos upon opening"}}]}
