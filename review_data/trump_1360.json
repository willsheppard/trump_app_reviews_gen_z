It took WAY too much storage space and completely glitched out my phone. As the app downloaded, no other apps were allowed to run in the background without the download completely starting over. They ask for your mobil number right away, and immediately after providing it, I receive a text notification stating that my location and all saved passcodes and private information would be in their possession to share whenever, and to whomever they would like. After a few days of attempting to delete the app, it began to delete data such as apps and photos from my phone and never actually deleting the app. I finally managed to delete the app but I unfortunately had to do a factory reset on my phone and lose everything I had stored, just so my phone would stop glitching!","title":"hacks phone! do NOT download!","userName":"Taylor Rain Sanchez","rating":1}},{"id":"6172184979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:09:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hello everyone. I’m so angry and disappointed at this app. I’m dead serious right now. I downloaded this app and what I saw was truly horrid. When I first opened the app there was a video that made my eyes bleed. It was a video of the My Little Pony characters cutting off babies toes. I know that may seem bad enough as it is but that’s not the worst part. There weren’t any white babies, there were only immigrant babies. That makes me quiver in fear of what Donald trump is planning to do to our immigrant children. After 9.7 seconds of the video playing 37 police officer came bursting in my house and said that I am under arrest for not enjoying the video then proceeded to shoot at my baby cousin in the jaw and kicked me down and shot me in the back of my head. I am currently writing this on my way to the underworld so farewell. I hope none of you good people get this app so this won’t happen to you. Thank you.","title":"I’m dead serious.","userName":"sAsa berg","rating":1}},{"id":"6177911233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:15:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"SO I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY LOVELY ✨orange✨🍊 cheeto puff lookin mf HAD TO OFFER IN HIS APP💖i was so beyond very very excited to get this app that our very 🍊lovely🍊president has to offer. but then once i got the app it started making my phone glitch and do weird stuff i also noticed that the app has some very very inappropriate stuff that our generation should not be seeing smh😒ALSO i noticed that after i downloaded the app i started getting weird messages like saying “vote trump 2020” like who wants to hear that at this time we should not be worried about our wonderful ✨president mr donald cheetopuff we should be worried about bigger problems in the world right now 💖and the app is just weird like who tf would want a app about a president so weird smh 😒so in conclusion this app is the worst app i’ve ever EVER DOWNLOADED LIKE IT WAS NASTY DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE EW NASTY🤢🤮BYE-IF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU WILL ACTUALLY DIE 🤮🤢🤮","title":"NASTY APP🤢🤮🤬DONT DOWNLAOD","userName":"✨big booty birtha✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177806833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I wanted to download this app to see👀 my favorite cheeto🥵 but once i downloaded it my phone exploded💥 then i heard a knock at my door, who is it? sofia the mother fricken first! i walk over to her and she was cursed by the cheeto! she could only see the color🍊 and say trump 2020🇺🇸 after every good argument. so obviously i had to call addison ræ to dance away my problems😉 then i heard something crazy 😤 my mom was selling me to harry styles! 😭😭 i put my deep brown hair into a messy bun and then my blue orbs met his green orbs💙💚 he told me he was actually apart of the secret service and was protecting me for trumpie dumpie.. we ran away together and next thing i know we were getting married on an island 🌴 which seems good but lil huddy our black icon 🖤 showed up and ruined the wedding😔 he works for bunker baby 👶 🍼 then we all died! so if you don’t wanna die and don’t want your loved ones to die do NOT download this app!","title":"Bunker Boy","userName":"Bunker Baby🥵","rating":1}},{"id":"6177555692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Okay so I downloaded this app because I saw a lot of reviews saying that it killed them. I had high hopes that it would kill me too. It didn’t im still here. So as I was downloading the app I heard my dog start meowing, I though that It was normal and that my dog was just bilingual. So I went on about my day, once the app was downloaded I started filling out the information thinking it would send ted bundy and he would stab me in the gut, he sadly never did... as i was chilling in my room listening to “girl in red” I started to hear a tapping under my bed. At first I thought it was my pet demon but he never came out. I looked under my bed and to my surprise it was TED BUNDY IN A PEPPA PIG COSTUME. I can gladly say I was happy but his intentions weren’t to kill me! He took my bilingual dog and left like it was nothing. I’m sadly still alive. I hate it hereeee. Don’t download this app unless you want ted Bundy to kidnap your Latina dog 😭.","title":"I hate it here","userName":"barron trump is my daddy","rating":1}},{"id":"6177353820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:23:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Okay so, I’m not really a political person. So I wanted to download that app to see Donald Trump’s plan to “keep America great.” The app is VERY glitchy and tbh, I realized that Trump isn’t ready to lead the country other 4 years. Here’s my reasons>>> In January, he had the whole United States worries for WW3. My family especially. I done so search, to only find out Trump wanted to start it to prove we have a better army. Smh. That is pretty childish to me🤦\u200D♀️ Next reason, he’s racist. Now, I know some people doesn’t think he is but💀. Idk my FACTS on this bc i know he was building a wall or something. He was doing this bc he didn’t want Mexican’s to come into our country. 💀💀💀💀 He lowkey hates women. My reasons>>>>> I’ve saw MANY videos of him being rude to GIRLS AND WOMEN. In this one video he picked this women and had to ask all rude saying he didn’t pick her. this app needs to be deleted bc Trump is NOT ready to be in office.","title":"My story abt Trump","userName":"my story on things","rating":1}},{"id":"6177202787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:40:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Once I downloaded the app I was immediately bombarded with an image of an orange wrinkly leathered skin man with two teeth sucking on some toes. It was horrifying! I closed the app but it took over my entire phone and shut my phone down completely. I couldn’t get on my phone for days! Then after four days my phone turned on and guess what I saw........ Shane Dawson and you know what I was terrified at this point because  he was singing r-r-r-roll 🥖 up ⬆️ to ❌ the 🧡 party 🧚🏻\u200D♂️ with 👥 my 🧠 crazy 👹 pink 💓wig🌊 but 🍑 I 🌈 can’t ⭐️ get 🌸 through 🍀 the 🐁 door 🐴 because 🙅\u200D♂️ my 👁 my🤲 booty’s 🤡 too 🤢 big 🥴 like what even is that?!  I was truly scared for my life. So do you know what I had to do? I had to smash my phone to pieces and eat it like NOM NOM 📱 I had to go to the hospital  for weeks so the doctors could take each piece out of my body because of this app. Definitely not worth your time 👺👹👿💩🤡","title":"✨No 🥰✨","userName":"Holà Niño","rating":1}},{"id":"6177185483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app with my younger brother next to me and he was traumatized. He said that the “weird looking guy” on the front gave him nightmares. For multiple nights in a row now he has woken up SCREAMING because he saw a cheeto with eyes running at him in his dream. If you are one with small children around, DO NOT download the app because I think it somehow gets into the part of their mind where nightmares are produced. You wouldn’t want one of them to go on your phone or see over your shoulder. But besides that part, the app is also just awful in general. It glitches your phone to say “it came from cHiNa” really loud or “the J stands for genius” not only that but it has a bunch of pop up ads for “all lives matter” which then when you click them a jump scare of Donald shows up. Over all would not recommend at all.","title":"Would not recommend for families with small children","userName":"faith benn","rating":1}},{"id":"6177122081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Not only did this app take a week and a half to download, but it also made my phone crash every time I tried to open it. I had basically all of my phone storage left but after downloading this app all of my storage is gone and my phone not only won’t let me delete the app but the app basically crashes my entire phone. \nOh and on top of that every once in a while when I’m trying to send a text the app will open out of nowhere and show me a picture of some fat old Oompa Loompa?!?!?!?! This is first and foremost a complete disgrace to the Willy Wonka legacy but also is an Insult to Oompa Loompas EVERYWHERE. \nEssentially at the end of the day this app ruined my phone. I have to type this review from my computer because it turned my phone into a useless brick, and on top of that it shows vulgar and repulsive context. 0/10 would recommend.","title":"If I could give 0 stars I would","userName":"KayleeRuth","rating":1}},{"id":"6176860445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:07:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Let me just start by saying I had very high hopes for this application. My uncle downloaded it and we both came to realize the DISASTER that is the Trump 2020 app. Upon signing in to the app I was immediately charged $10 as a “donation”. I had no intention of donating, I only wanted news. I thought it was a fluke, but over the next I was charged FOUR TIMES for $10 donations. I lost $50 in a WEEK to the Trump 2020 app because they EMBEZZLED MY FUNDS. My Uncle, who also had the app, experienced similar fraudulent transactions and lost $40 (and hasn’t gotten it back). I sent multiple emails trying to correct this error, but I haven’t gotten my money back. I would have been happy to donate on my own, but they took away my First Amendment Right and denied me my FREEDOMS. For a presidential sponsored app, I must say the illegality is EGREGIOUS. Do not download this app, the Trump admin will steal your money like it stole mine.","title":"PLEASE do not get this!!","userName":"hottopicswish (my tumblr😂)","rating":1}}]}
