I saw this app on the App Store and thought, “my lord and savior has his own app?!” So I immediately downloaded it. That was two years ago and it just now downloaded... So glad I did tho! As soon as I opened Trump 2020 ✨🥰 I was transported into fantabulus dimension filled with Cheetos and oranges! I was surrounded by my beautiful perfect president 🤩. Who could want anything more than that? Anyways, they all started to sing to me It’s a Small World but every word was replaced with “Donald Trump” and then they set off fireworks that looked like his face!! To finish the night off, he himself appeared and said to me “are you lost baby gorl”. No I wasn’t 🤩🤩. Anyways, best day ever and if u want to be transported to Trumplandia and never be able escape, download this app!!!! Trump 2020 ✨🧚\u200D♀️ 🥰","userName":"abbeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"}},{"id":"6179810605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:42:16Z","review":"Kept crashing on me.
