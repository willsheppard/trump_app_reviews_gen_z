It was quite disappointing. I may be old but I know when Im getting played! This was just extremely disappointing! And on top of the poor service it kept on asking for donations when the darn app wouldn’t even load properly."}},{"id":"6136248262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I Don’t even want to look at it","date":"2020-06-29T14:52:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MiaaaaaaaaN.","review":"So just like everyone else in these comments ❤️✨ I wanted to support my president🧚🏼\u200D♀️👍🏼 so I got this app hoping it would help me do so🧚🏼\u200D♀️ NO🧨😡 I was wrong. I immediately began having bad luck. I stubbed my toe on the very table I was sitting and anddd spilled my apple juice 😫 then like all these people, my phone starting glitching and IT SHOCKED ME.

If you still do then you’ve seen all he has done and your head is too hollow for me to even get through to you. Anyways, for my fellow superiors that have already acknowledged that trump is anything but a proper president, get the app so you can leave a review. If we get it to 1 Star then Apple will instantly take it down. I believe in you gen z 👏😘"}},{"id":"6132597231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-06-28T16:34:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mackayleigh","review":"I downloaded this app and was quickly disappointed. The app has many bugs and asked for my social security number and credit card information. I was appalled. After exiting the app, I noticed that little Trump figurines were popping up wherever I went. I found one in the toilet, and another in my cabinet. This wasn’t happening prior to downloading this app. I do not recommend this app!"}},{"id":"6123708495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"They call this an App?","date":"2020-06-26T10:55:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"phuongkb","review":"As a trump supporter? I’m surprised that the banana store allowed this low level app to even enter the market. I run into problems all the time and the customer service is just very bad. I think that they run their leadership through like China or something. Just overall a very poorly made app. They should fire their developer. They’ll also take all your money away and convert you into an extremist."}},{"id":"6080727756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Anonymous 2020","date":"2020-06-16T00:16:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hebdjai","review":"After using the app once a gang of Karen’s who wanted every one to speak English in America kidnapped me and told me I was to young to join their Karen cult and had to become a 40 year old homophobic with three kids to join but I don’t like Karen’s so I turned down their offer but the next day all the trump supporters tried to kill me and I was forced into hiding after one week of hiding Anonymous saved me and now I’m protesting blm freely"}},{"id":"6064397152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ATTACK OF THE OBAMAS 🤡.","date":"2020-06-11T20:56:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"omgbroallthenamesgone","review":"I downloaded this app to worship my favorite Cheeto, my president and savior 😩. But when I opened the app I was greeted by a bunch of Obama’s. Picture after picture of Obama, there was even one of him holding his papers. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I tried to refresh and all the screen said was “KING OBAMA”. Not sure if I was punked out or something but I just wanted to see king Cheeto 🥺. Very disappointing, this is a scam and I think I’m gonna vote for Biden because of this 😔."}},{"id":"6179200907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app owes ME A DOG I DONT RECOMMEND","date":"2020-07-10T03:09:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"I need a new dog","review":"So I got this app and my dog a black Yorkshire terroir was barking at my phone for the past 4 HOURS. Then I couldn’t get any sleep so the next day/TODAY I woke up and took my dog to pee and my dog was walking and I was chasing him and a car was coming so I ran to the sidewalk but sadly he died😭🥺 and for some reason every time I open the app I see a Cheeto? Can someone explain why? ALSO DONT GET THIS APP AND KEEP YOUR DOGS AWAY FROM IT IF YOU GET IT 🐕 🐶 any type of dog!"}},{"id":"5938175995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":3,"title":"Not giving you my phone number","date":"2020-05-13T02:27:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mick@nite","review":"I'm 100% a Trump supporter but any app that can't operate without my phone number is gonna get deleted. It's like saying \"hey let us hold your wallet\" Ain't gonna happen. Nota, Nope, Nebbs, Never. The temptation to text me every 5 minutes or sell my personal information is to great.  Rethink that and try again."}},{"id":"5891254559","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"One stop shop for campaign news","date":"2020-05-02T02:49:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"shaneadopts","review":"This app makes it easy to get news, notifications and events in one place compared to going separately to twitter, text messages and emails. 💪🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}}]}
