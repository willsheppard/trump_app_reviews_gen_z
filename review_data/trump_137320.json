I thought to myself 💭 what a ✨wonderful✨ wo- ACTUALLY NO❌. I thought to myself hey what about the people who don’t have this app. Don’t their information matter? DONT ALL INFORMATION MATTER?! Anyway i put my phone number in and then they asked me to take my moms magic card with all the numbers on it so I thought WHY NOT! So I did it. Then my mom starting getting money taken out of her money account thing whatever that is so I deleted this app. I thought it wasn’t my fault until LITTLE TINY TRUMP HEADS FILLED MY SCREEN🍊🍊🍊!!! They were EVERYWHERE!!! I soon smashed my phone and threw it away to find trumps EVERWHERE!!! Even in my FRIDGE!!! I didn’t know what to do. I soon got a new phone and the guy giving it to me stared at me WITH MINY TRUMPS IN HIS EYES!!! This was a sign. I quickly downloaded the app. It all stopped.

I am disappointed as I expected the president of the United States to be, at the very least, a man who understands fractions. After three years of his presidency, I could not tolerate one minute of his app. Disgusted that this app even dares to call itself an app, as it is more of a way to spread the horrible disease of stupidity across the nation."}},{"id":"6179945065","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0 stars","rating":1,"userName":"jrnscaghr","date":"2020-07-10T07:32:43Z","isEdited":false,"review":"To actually sit their and actually support this man after his past and sexual assault accusations baffles me."}},{"id":"6179944947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"userName":"Elle G beetea","date":"2020-07-10T07:32:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Shut it down🙈❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6179944560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"annoying","rating":1,"userName":"peopledontneedtoseemyname","date":"2020-07-10T07:32:32Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i got this app to learn more about trump and his campaign since i just registered to vote. you have to put in your phone number to get further in the app but ever since i did i get messages non-stop and can’t seem to stop it. i turned off all notifications and even responded to the messages with STOP but i kept getting them. not only this, as i began to learn more about his campaign i really started to understand the hate people have for him. this app is promoting hatred and would NEVER recommend anyone to get it.
