Turns out that it’s just the comeback of the annoying orange. 🍊 I am not surprised as to why people are disappointed, the annoying orange was never that funny or entertaining anyway.

I was annoyed by how many times I was bombarded with notifications while i was doing much more important tasks like scrolling Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and while staring blankly into space. Sorry, but it’s a no from me. 😬🙃","title":"👁👄👁 *disappointment*","isEdited":false,"userName":"🌺✨🌸🧚🧚🏻\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6180283941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T09:35:54Z","review":"i wanted to see what this app was about and i was very disappointed. i had this app for less then 24 hours and have already deleted it. this app is completely useless and has no reason to even have been made.","title":"not worth your time","isEdited":false,"userName":"olivia7741","rating":1}}]}
