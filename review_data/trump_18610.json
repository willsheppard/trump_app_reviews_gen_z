No wonder this app has only one star but if the trump administration does read this you’re app needs to be banned😁🥰"}},{"id":"6178493882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:41:42Z","userName":"evan__029","rating":1,"title":"will NOT be voting for trump after this!","review":"i downloaded this app to view all of the heroical things our 45th POTUS will do to save america. i was UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED to see that after it took me 69 hours to download, it CRASHED! not to mention my beautiful stay at home wife caught a VIRUS on her cellular phone from this app! donald trump is trying to take away our freedom of not having viruses and it’s sickening.

Then I was scrolling through the app and got a virus the “trump virus.”\nI came to my sense that I don’t need negativity in my life and that I ain’t racist. don’t get this app. \nBlack lives matter \nAbolish Ice"}},{"id":"6178485479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:38:20Z","userName":"pamdaloverg12","rating":1,"title":"Save ur time","review":"Okay whyFirst of all why would he even be buying this is a bunch of junk and trash from a trashy president also we don’t stand the color orange can I see it way too much that I decide to hate it yeah horrible app glitches way too much is he too many orange pictures here and end to white people too many of them"}},{"id":"6178465649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:30:33Z","userName":";) :)","rating":1,"title":"your worst nightmare","review":"This app took forever to download and then once it did, what I saw was shocking. There is evidence that Donald Trump is in cohorts with President Snow from the Capitol to start a hunger games here in the US. I plan to evade becoming a tribute by saying I have bone spurs. I hope awareness is raised about this pressing issue that threatens us all and this app is removed before his manifesto is spread further. *three-finger salute*"}},{"id":"6178377675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:56:29Z","userName":"marissabrae","rating":1,"title":"looks and smells bad","review":"this is absolutely the worst app i have on my phone. it’s disorganized, with no clear instructions on how to navigate. tr*mp supporters need more assistance and instructions as they cannot think for themselves. the app is FULL of fascist propaganda. nothing educational or progressive about it. mostly just a nonfunctional app that takes up space on my phone (similar to tr*mp)."}},{"id":"6178365002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:51:34Z","userName":"Gasp gasp hasp hasp","rating":1,"title":"This app broke my phone 😱","review":"So I downloaded the app to get 𝕖𝕕𝕦𝕔𝕒𝕥𝕖𝕕 but then my phone started cursing me out! I was SHOCKED. It started called me a “Homeless ew ew girl” IDEK WHAT THAT MEANS! Then all of a sudden hot men started popping up on my screen. Hot 𝒶𝓃𝒾𝓂ℯ men 🤤. I was kinda happy then the app started dissing the anime boys. I cried so hard I died. I am writing this review in hell. I have never been so disrespected in my life.

I had high hopes when downloading because I really wanted to support his 2020 campaign but the app was so hard to navigate and was just cluttered as hell. Too bad the app isn’t easy to work with 😢"}},{"id":"6178336579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:40:37Z","userName":"EastYT","rating":1,"title":"Do not download","review":"I took a walk down my street a little bit ago. It was so quiet in the snow, in the street, with no one else outside. I don’t know why but I thought of him in this moment as I stood by myself for a bit, looking down in the direction of the street he lived on a little more than a few years ago. I missed her.
