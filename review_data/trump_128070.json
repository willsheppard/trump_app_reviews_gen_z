You know-- back to a kind old city in Germany in 1933. I wanted to scroll through while I groomed my moustache, and maybe even talk to good, like-minded people like me. Never have I been so disappointed, though!\nThe app was tricky to navigate and hard to use! When it texted me a verification code, I texted it back and asked it what Trump thought of all those nasty women and libtards who want to destroy our history, and it didn’t respond! I’m starting to worry that Trump doesn’t have a plan for us after all. :(\nWhoever is texting me from the app shows no emotion whatsoever. I’m starting to think that they might be a sociopath like the Führer-- I mean Trump. Anyways, I’m throwing away my red armband-- my bad, hat-- and buying a Biden shirt instead. Sleepy Joe can take my vote! At least he cares, unlike Trump.\nIf you want to serve the fatherland, don’t download this app; vote Biden 2020!\nSincerely,\nAnne T. Faa (It’s my grandmother’s name, don’t laugh! We built this country after taking it from the uncivilized savages! I'm not privileged, though-- I've had a very hard life. Somebody called me a boomer one time.)\nPS-- the app tried to offer me a complimentary MAGA hat. “MAGA” is such a stupid slogan; why would I want a hat that says “witch” when translated into Latin? I don’t think we should indoctrinate the children and make them think that unholy, dark magic is okay! We’re not all witches; Betsy Devoss doesn’t speak for all of us.","date":"2020-07-09T15:41:37Z"}},{"id":"6177205158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ChiNesE ApP","userName":"billy-bob the guy","isEdited":false,"review":"I was at my cousins👯\u200D♀️ house🏡 when a giant troll🦧 came up to my window🌅 and vomited🤮 on our heads🙆\u200D♀️. After cleaning up, we opened up the app again to see that there was i giant button that looks like harry styles💁🏼\u200D♂️ head. Obviously i HAD to press it, and it took me to my settings🧮 and messed them all up. It turned everything off🚫 and i couldn't turn it back🙅\u200D♀️. Then once i went off of the app📲, my lock screen was a picture of a giant turd💩 on Donald trumps hay🌞, oh i mean hair🦁. Naturally, i knew he did this on purpose because he wants everyone to think🤦\u200D♀️ about him at every moment so i understand. But i was annoyed enough so i left my room🏠 with the app📲 opened🎬 and my brother👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 had a horse🐴 face on so i told him to take it off and he couldn't. At that moment, i knew it was the doing of this app📞 because nothing📵 it does is reversible🔙. So i opened the app back up and there was a shiny purple🟣 button at the top that said take me to instagram. I LOVE💖 instagram so i pressed it only to see👀 that my feed contained exactly 74 pictures of Donald🦆. Ironically, that is how old Trump is. I wanted to see 👁 👄 👁 if i was powerful🧚 enough so i pressed the three🔘🔘🔘 dots at the top⬆️ and there was no❌ delete🗑 option. Keep in mind, all of this happened within the first 15 minutes🕓 of having this app📲 on my phone📱. Whatever you do, don't download this app. I still have it because of corse, Trump never gives up so it doesn't delete🗑. I messaged my friend and she said👩 that lil old Donald🦆 forced the rest of the board to download a “cHinEse VirUS”.🦠 into it so he can make my phone stop🛑✋ working properly. The only reason it got even one star was because my phone was completely unusable so my dad🎅 was forced to buy me an iPhone 11. Thank you for your time Donald🦆 but it wasn't worth it Making ppl hate you by banning tik tok🕑.","date":"2020-07-09T15:41:20Z"}}]}
