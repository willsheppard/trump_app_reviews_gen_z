It’s very slow with loading and the whole demographic is screwed up. I’ve noticed many spelling errors and misplaced words so makes it confusing on what you’re reading exactly. In a whole this app I like a 2nd grader made it and I think it would benefit a lot of people if it was taken down. The reasoning for it being taken down not only for the reasons listed above but also because it’s just an eyesore, and an embarrassment to other like apps in the world.","title":"The worst app ever created","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Sadie Coon"}},{"id":"6173219128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:10:57Z","review":"I wanted to see what this app was because some people have been recommended this for a long time, but when i downloaded it my phone died. I thought maybe it was a coincidence, so I put my phone to charge and waited till it got to 100%. I tried It again and it instantly dyed again. Never thought I would say this but if your a Trump Supporter DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! Im so disappointed with the app that I told my friends from Facebook about what happened, and they ALSO SAID IT HAPPENED TO THEM TOO! Never downloading anything that has Trump in the name ever again. 😡","title":"Makes your phone dead in seconds","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Fernanda Jenkins"}},{"id":"6173080086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:26:21Z","review":"This app was terrible overall and was extremely glitchy. It took at least 30 minutes  to download and never opened right away. The app also constantly freezes and is very laggy. This app will also start freaking out and taking you to random pages of the campaign. Overall this app significantly slowed my phone down and has not been helpful. The content is also not very good or educational. It is often filled with biases and the content is unorganized. This app is horrible and I definitely do not recommend it.","title":"Glitches And Bugs","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Gobblygook14"}},{"id":"6173015857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:06:04Z","review":"This idiot tried to take away health care during a pandemic. Wants to open schools ASAP to boost his ego putting children at risk. Kicking out foreign students and pulling funding from schools that don’t open. Openly racist, doesn’t even try to be a leader of all of America. He wants to be the president of the confederacy. Man disrespects facts and science like an idiot. Literally like he’s out of the 1200s. Also has assaulted numerous innocent women. This baby is a dictator plain and simple. I don’t care what your policy positions are if you support him. If you still stand by him, you’re racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and just plain brainwashed.","title":"Worst app worst President","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"LastOne122"}},{"id":"6172919908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:36:28Z","review":"i downloaded this app just to get alerts to see what the president doing in regards to making america “great”. however, that is not what happened at all. when i downloaded it, they asked for a bunch of personal information which i think they gave to telemarketers. after that, i looked at the alerts and it was just a bunch of propaganda. he rarely told his future plans with america. i would not re-elect him as president if i were you. his intentions are clearly in the wrong place as he’s focusing on ticktok and other social media’s instead of what he promised.","title":"would NOT recommend","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"kennedy;)"}},{"id":"6172908654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:32:57Z","review":"I downloaded the app. Trying to support our 🍊king. But the app was super glitchy. It would randomly pull up 🥕 kings website and donate money every time I turned on my phone. I ended up “donating”the equivalent of 20 spray tans his “campaign”. I am a fan of trump. I really am. I have an entire room in my house dedicated to him. There’s even a life size wax statue of him. But my spray tans bring me closer to him. They make us united under than 🧡 community. But this app has taken so much of my money I cannot afford to get spray tans done anymore. This has caused me so much stress I had a heart attack last Thursday.","title":"It gave me a heart attack","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"🥕👑 lover"}},{"id":"6172864772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:31Z","review":"So I decided to download this app because there was a lot of people who said that there were glitches to your phone once you download this app. So I decided to try it and see if that actually happed. Here me out..... first it took a whole day on downloading this app like people have mentioned, second there were these beep sounds coming from the app when I opened the app and Almost burn myself with my coffee because of that, and third this app reminds me of of someone  that’s a white supremasist which offends my dog, therefore this app will remain the worst app in my app history.","title":"What’s happening?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bdjkdneksnbf"}},{"id":"6172851023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:15:23Z","review":"The app took so long to download I almost cried😭. So to fix my problem, I went to Mr. Orange Drumpf himself in the White House. Once I saw him I threw up. Thankfully he got some water for both of us, but when he drank it, he looked like a T-Rex 🦖. He couldn’t hold the water with two hands🥛👏🏻👎🏻, so I asked him about it, but he stormed down the stairs waddling. I was so confused, so I tried to make a tik tok with him, but because his face looked so bad in the video, he threatened to take tik tok. In conclusion... if this app had just loaded a little quicker, maybe none of this would have happend🤷🏽\u200D♀️🤦🏽\u200D♀️.","title":"The app took way to long to download🥱🙄","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Biden 2020 4 life"}},{"id":"6172772852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:52:50Z","review":"I was trying to download this app but it made my phone overheat, and it took about 4 hours to download!!! Now I’m a snowflake conservative with idiotic views that don’t make sense and I can’t think for myself, so that’s why I follow our fat Orange Dorito lord 😍🤤🎃 but I can’t even do that through this app! Now I DEMAND to speak to a manager because I’m such a dumb Karen! This is outrageous! After the app downloaded, I just just met with a quote my our orange lord saying “grab her by the p****”. Now even tho that’s my favorite quote by him cause I’m dumb😍🥰 I wanted to actually be able to use the app, but I can’t! It won’t let me!!!!","title":"So upsetting 😟","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Wogkvnanto"}},{"id":"6172758751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:48:48Z","review":"This is the worst app ever.
