I would recommend changing “Trump 2020” to “Black Lives Matter”. If that is too long we can use “BLM” secondly the app is very distasteful and now I can no longer sleep at night. I have had bad dreams about an orange chasing me. Please do better. Do us all a favor and delete the app."}},{"id":"6177986059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"userJenZ","date":"2020-07-09T19:39:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible. That’s all I can say.","review":"Set up was confusing and repetitive. Next time Donald wants to make an app, he better make it easier to understand. It provides misinformation. His Tulsa rally was not where I read on his page, next thing I know, I’m in Hong Kong behind a restaurant dumpster with a rat chewing on my make America great again hat. Over all terrible work. I hate it here."}},{"id":"6177979532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BriW✨","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨Extremely disappointing ✨","review":"I downloaded this app expecting a president but when I opened the app all I saw was an orange clown.🤡I thought “hmm this is weird maybe I got the wrong app” but as I went back into the App Store and saw that it was right. I was shocked and horrified. I’m extremely extremely disappointed with this app. This is some clownery that needs to be deleted. #SaveTikTok"}},{"id":"6177930925","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Elea H.","date":"2020-07-09T19:21:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Spam","review":"As soon as I put my email and phone number information in I’ve noticed I’ve been getting wayyyy more spam than normal and I think it is because of this, I haven’t signed up for anything else lately and I’ve noticed it in just a couple days. I’m sure they are selling your information to telemarketers."}},{"id":"6177924563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FanaticJarlEmma","date":"2020-07-09T19:19:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"...","review":"As soon as I opened the app my cat started having a seizure, when I closed it to tend to him he calmed down. I opened it again and he started projectile vomiting all over my confederate + Donald trump mashup flag and it burst into flames. I called Donald trump to report this and he told me to give him $5 to build the wall. The third time I opened the app my house spontaneously combusted and my fish swam away."}},{"id":"6177922096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"a fellow tik toker 🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨","date":"2020-07-09T19:18:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Me ReViEw🥴","review":"Omg I had such high hopes for my AMAZING OUTSTANDING PRESIDENT DONALD JANKY TRUMP, but once again like he usually does he didnt serve me in the way I needed... I texted him constantly about how tik tok helped the gen z community but he never listened and went against my will and attempted to ban the the app. Ofc this orange sack of potatoes failed... AgAiN like we expected this BaBy BoOmEr to do 🌝. I will never recommend this app ever again to any of my gen z peers!!! 🤮 🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6177894367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"homicphopic ass","date":"2020-07-09T19:09:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i don't like this app.","review":"This app has been the worst app to appear on the apple store. Honestly what is the point of keeping it on there? When I open the app I only want to get myself ran over 37 times in a row to slowly tear off my limbs. The idea of trump on my phone and his face appearing is horrid. It only gives me the urge to stab forks into my eyeballs and peel off my eyelids. Take it down."}},{"id":"6177890214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Queen9557","date":"2020-07-09T19:08:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","review":"I got tickets to go to your rally and i am very disappointed. I really wanted to go but i forgot the date of it so i downloaded this app to figure out when it is. I am very sorry to say but i can’t go anymore because the date is whenever i have to walk my caterpillar. Guess that will just be an empty seat ❤️"}},{"id":"6177877224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alltime best","date":"2020-07-09T19:03:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting app 🤮🤢","review":"This is the most horrible disgusting app I’ve ever seen, right away when I opened it I was horrified to see a picture of what looked to be an orange donkey with a man-gina I also had horrible connection while using this app I think the wall is blocking my cell reception. Anyways just don’t get this app I’m scarred for life after seeing an orange Cheetos face on this app. 🎃🔥💥🤵🧶🦁☄️🥕🥕🥕🥕"}},{"id":"6177858469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chodballs","date":"2020-07-09T18:58:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🤢👹👺🤮🤬😾😾😒","review":"this is absolutely the worst new app ever. i opened up the app and i saw some ugly orange face that i could definitely punch in the no no square 😹 who is this guy and who does he think he is😱? anyways i heard that tik tok got banned in the us which is totally unacceptable. the disrespect and you call this our president 😹. there was porno and spam when i opened up the app to go see his ugly face 🥰. i had to go see a very special therapist to go clear my brain and also had to get brainwashed by this amazing machine 😏. i definitely do not recommend this app unless you want to have the same experience as i did 😔🤪😒😞."}}]}
