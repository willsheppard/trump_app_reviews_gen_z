PLEASE DON’T BUY APP if i could i would rate 0/5.","rating":1,"title":"black lives matter","date":"2020-07-08T16:04:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172796676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"orange man w small pp","review":"Horrible app, as soon as I downloaded my phone crashed and turned off. When I tried to turn it back on my phone literally became alive and started running around my house screaming “PLEASE NO I CANT TAKE IT IVE SEEN HELL I CANT DO IT ANYMORE.” Then my phone began smacking itself against the wall and throwing itself on the floor until it managed to climb my window and threw itself into the water 😳 I had to get a new phone, which I had to buy w the money I was going to donate to trumps campaign, so sad. I don’t recommend this app to anyone,unless you don’t want to be able to support ou- our- our pre- I cant even say it 🤢. Overall just no 👎🏽","rating":1,"title":"yuck yuck it’s a no no","date":"2020-07-08T15:59:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172756800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"barb nikki 2020","review":"I support trump %100 but a man like him should not be working a app this poorly. It keeps kicking me out and it doesn’t give me notifications when I asked to keep me updated. it doesn’t give me all the information I need to know, and the things I would love to learn about our president. I thought it was my phone at first, so I gave it a few days later to see what happens but still, glitches and doesn’t work  properly. My percentage is also draining while using this app, even when I charge it. I’m sad that this app can’t give what it says it can give, but I guess trump and the app are very similar.😢","rating":1,"title":"This app is not okay","date":"2020-07-08T15:48:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172656147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"____erica.s____","review":"I was at my pro-trump family’s house and they told me about the new trump app. so i downloaded it onto my phone and had to wait 48+ hours just to use it. As soon as i opened up the app my phone started glitching, it turned my volume up and started saying stuff like “VOTE FOR TRUMP OR DIE” or “WHITE POWER” and it wouldn’t stop. i restarted my phone and tired to delete the app but it won’t let me. I don’t know how but my phone opened up the app and all i could see was trumps Cheeto puff flashing on my phone. not to mention my niece was right next to me and she started screaming because his little puff scared her. She’s now in therapy because of it. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!","rating":1,"title":"I am HORRIFIED!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T15:19:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172614738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"𝔼𝕞𝕞𝕒🌻","review":"Now I was completely shocked that this app was almost as bad as our “president”. He’s definitely not my president because he is a terrible leader and a disgrace to America. Bunker boy cries over the fact that gen z ruined his stupid rally news flash there’s bigger problems in the world. Problems he needs to stop running away from. And another instead of acting like a child and taking everything to twitter when something doesn’t go your way be a man. Children in this country know better than you. That’s embarrassing. And this is a not specifically for the Cheeto himself:keep climbing✨💕🧚🏽\u200D♀️when you get to the top jump🦋💕🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"title":"Yeah no❤️","date":"2020-07-08T15:08:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172486848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"\"just keep swimming\"- Dory","review":"I wanted to get the fruit slicing game. The one that slices oranges and other fruits. I was looking threw the apps and I found this app. It looked like the fruit slicing app so I got it. I was so excited to open my app and slice all the fruits. Then, when I opened my app it was a picture of a orange and I was so happy that I found the app. Then, it wanted my phone number and I was confused. So I looked at the terms and stuff. After I was looking threw it for a while I learned that Donald Trump operates the app. I am not happy that my president was on a fruit slicing app. If any of you have any recommendations of fruit slicing apps I am more than happy to try them out.\n\nSincerely, Dory","rating":1,"title":"Fruit slicing game","date":"2020-07-08T14:32:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172479248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"darklord12344","review":"I hopped on this app in search of a reason to vote for trump but as soon as I got on the app it only let me on for a couple of seconds. I was getting furious and then the app started crashing I  couldn’t quite figure out why so I restarted my phone a couple of times and the third time i restarted it, it linked a virus to my phone my brothers a hacker and coder so I asked for his help, and asked him why my phone had a virus and he said that the virus link was from this app it made me angry and I deleted the app and had to get a vpn so that this wouldn’t happen again I DO NOT RECOMMEND horrible app and you can or will get a virus","rating":1,"title":"It linked a virus to my phone","date":"2020-07-08T14:30:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172071743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕘𝕖𝕥𝕨𝕙𝕒𝕝𝕖1800","review":"The app just doesn’t work It glitches and just is asking me SO many questions about Joe Biden it’s like I didn’t come to answer these questions I just came to know more about his campaign. It absolutely fails to provide reasons as to why I should vote for him I’m deleting the app and I don’t recommend for anyone to download. It also fails to explain what taking down a social media app would do in the middle of what’s going on right now. That’s really the only reason why I downloaded this app ever since I found out he might take down the app called TikTok. That’s all I have to say besides not recommending the app.","rating":1,"title":"I don’t recommend it","date":"2020-07-08T12:37:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171984030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"guygfj","review":"I didn’t even start the app I just wanted to say you shouldn’t vote for that stupid idiot of a president I could be a better president and I’m 12 and he saying that stopping the Covid testing would stop Covid from happening but in the true fact is that it wouldn’t stop COVID from happening what would happen is that no one would know and I’m not saying you should harm him in anyway but you should at least give him hate and if that doesn’t rub you the wrong way already he’s also racist towards other races then his own and if you didn’t know it is wrong to be racist so get that stupid Country Bunkin out of this country that orange wannabe.","rating":1,"title":"💯","date":"2020-07-08T12:12:08Z","isEdited":false}}]}
