I had to let it download overnight. Upon downloading, the app would open for a few seconds and then shut down. I was finally able to log in, only to have to struggle with the disorganized, outdated formatting of the app. One star for sure."}},{"id":"6176127303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:43:06Z","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"vcynidrinix","rating":1,"review":"There’s MILLIONS of words in the English language but I can’t find ANY to explain my HATE for this app. Literally I payed $50 for extra space on my phone, AND THIS APP TOOK 45 MINS TO DOWNLOAD!!!!

When it does randomly open, it causes super loud, obnoxious noises to come from my phone (many times at work, school, and even in the middle of the night). I would NOT recommend this app to anyone. The content is pretty ludicrous too, I must add."}},{"id":"6175941130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:43:14Z","title":"foreigner💕🤢😭","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lyss Park","rating":1,"review":"it took me 69 hours to download. then it took 420 minutes to update. outrageous!!! if that wasn’t bad enough the app took me to a pornography website where there was a loop of a foreigner💕 edit of donald trump.
