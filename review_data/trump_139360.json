And I downloaded His app because I wanted to stay up to date with the unfiltered truth as Mr. Trump continues to wage righteous holy war on the liberal elites (may he rain down fire upon them with the fury of a thousand suns!) And at the beginning it was fine! I mean, I kept getting these pop-up notifications every few minutes or so, but they only asked me for my credit card information, my mother's maiden name, the last four digits of my social security number, all my previous addresses and known aliases, and whether I stay with my husband because I really love him or because I've already sunk 20 years of my life into this marriage and the prospect of all that time wasted haunts me, and maybe that's why I can't remember the last time I was able to fall asleep without half a bottle of merlot and 15mg of ambien first-- you know, pretty minor stuff. But after a few hours, the notifications started getting really...weird? Like, when I checked my phone on my lunch break, I had 7 missed calls from a blocked number, along with this message that just said \"We know you're seeing this, Madison! Donate now or we'll frame you for tax evasion, Madison!\" And then they sent me a screenshot of my checking account balance with the caption \"We know you can afford it, Madison! Help Him lead us to victory against the antifa scum! Your donation funds more teargas to silence the dissenters (may they choke on their lies!)\" And then next to the paypal button it gave me the option to \"sacrifice my firstborn in place of a monetary contribution\"? So then after a few more days of this I finally just decided to delete the app, but right as I was going to hit delete my phone lit itself on fire? I dunno, I'm still gonna vote for Mr. Trump (long may he reign!) but I would recommend sticking with Tucker Carlson for your news and updates :/","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:52Z"}},{"id":"6179617521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible horrible horrible","userName":"Elle Gonzalez","rating":1,"review":"I hate this app. I saw an ugly orange dude and that’s all I have to say!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:30:52Z"}},{"id":"6179617526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is making my skin turn orange","userName":"Rhonda_2020","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this and immediately noticed my skin started turning a Cheeto-ish color.
