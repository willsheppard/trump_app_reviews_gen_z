If he thinks he can take something away from the gen Z generation he must be Waky. Because he can just do that. He must be a sour president to do sum like that. Numba 2 TikTok is everything and don’t think that a protest won’t break out again because clearly we made him go in a underground bunker😂. So we are not scared of Anything sorry baby grumpy 😋😛😚","date":"2020-07-09T19:52:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"GET TIKTOK BACK!"}},{"id":"6178024788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful","review":"This app is just as cheap as you could expect from Trump.  He loves to cut corners and you can definitely tell.  It’s glitching every 30 seconds and it froze my phone on multiple occasions.  The only way to get it to close was to shut off my phone.  I feel like I downloaded a virus or something... it’s terrible","date":"2020-07-09T19:52:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ccdominiospizza"}},{"id":"6178017716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🍊","review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted updates revolving around the worst president ever. It took a week to download so I decided to just delete it and it wasn’t worth my time. \n\nIf you’re going to make an app for the worst president ever, which I don’t know why you would in the first place, at least put some effort into it. \n\nPeriodt 💅🏻 xoxo","date":"2020-07-09T19:49:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"emmoemma"}},{"id":"6177988847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Mental health risk, very misleading","review":"If I could leave 0 stars I would, this app is misleading and gives false information. I wanted to become educated but this app is not helpful at all. Do not get it, you will regret it. It makes it very hard to understand anything, I wish they would take this down because it has harmful mental health risks.","date":"2020-07-09T19:40:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"B.ella.p527"}},{"id":"6177992651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"APPLE NEEDS TO DISABLE REVIEWS OF THIS APP","review":"You can not try to take down an app because you do not agree with their politics. Democrats will be the destruction of free will and personal opinions. Totally unacceptable!","date":"2020-07-09T19:41:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Your mom studios"}},{"id":"6177988255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"bad","review":"This app is literally a hot mess. No useful features, crashes constantly, often contains incorrect information, uses a ton of battery, always sending annoying notifications. I don’t understand how they made this app so bad. I didn’t know it was possible, to be honest. Yikes. Don’t download this if you want to stay sane.","date":"2020-07-09T19:40:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"sidehug"}},{"id":"6177965894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Can I leave less than a star?","review":"This app only crashes and is complete bs, I wanted to see what our trash president was up to but only makes my phone glitch.
