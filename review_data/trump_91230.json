I hesitantly agreed, worried about what she had gotten herself into 😬 I barely slept that night 🌙 I kept thinking what to do 🤔 I decided that a snack would help, so headed to the kitchen 🍳 to eat. I was almost done with my food 🍗 until I heard a loud bang 💥 from the front door 🚪 I hid behind the kitchen counter and what I saw SHOCKED me 😮 There were FBI agents 🕴🏻taking my sister! I heard one of them say, “lets take her to the White House” 🏠!!! My sister 👧🏻 was just chilling on her phone 📱 while I was PANICKING 😰 I just decided I had to do something, but what could I do when an agent had already saw me and drugged me to sleep 😴?? \n~NEXT MORNING~ \nThankfully, I woke up at home 🏡 and not at some pervs 😈 house 😅 however, I still realized my sister was missing ❓she wasn’t picking up her phone 📱or answering my messages 😡 so I packed my bags and got ready to break her out 🤩 before I could even get out the door 🚪, melania trump and her son barron 🥵 walked in❗️❗️❗️melania told me that she was heartbroken 💔 that our Cheeto president left her for MY sister, and she said that she needed my help to stop trumpity-dumpity 😖 of course I was worried, but I needed to ask! “HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE YOU STALKER?!?” 👀 she replied with \"trumps the president hun ❤️ him and the government will track you down ❤️❤️❤️” (AND I OOP) 😰 I agreed to help her, so we booked a flight ✈️ to Washington 🤍 melania suddenly said that only me and barron should go, since she was too sad 😔 and mentally unstable to go with us 😬 I had barely talked to barron, but I’m not gonna lie, he was kinda hot 🥵 we both agreed to go, so we hopped on a plane ✈️ a talked for a bit 🤏🏻 barron said that he was worried about his mom, and that he really wished he had someone to hold onto these sad moments 🥺 I said I would always be there for him, even if I barely knew him 😝 we sat there in silence for a bit until I decided to go to sleep 💤 hours past until I woke up finding that Barron was sleeping on my shoulder 😙 it was at this moment that I realized that I liked barron 🥰 !! I went back to sleep smiling on his shoulder again for the rest of the flight peacefully 💘 \n~AT THE WHITE HOUSE~\nAfter our flight landed, barron and I were taken to the White House 🏠 as soon as we walked in 🚶🏻\u200D♀️🚶🏼\u200D♂️WE SAW MY SISTER AND TRUMP WAITING FOR US!! 😲 i was scared 😱 but barron held me tight and said “it’s okay” 🥰 I felt better 👌🏼 but I went back to look 👀 at my sister 👧🏻 and saw that she was wearing a RING?!? 💍 THEY WERE ALREADY ENGAGED??? 🙊 My sister told us that they were getting married TODAY 📅 omg 😱 Barron and I had to stop this 😾barron led me into the house and into one of the rooms, where we planned out what to do 🤔 we decided to hire an anonymous assassin to kill the prez 😼 barron never liked him anyways, and even though I used to think he was the best 🏆, NOBODY steals my sister 😤 the anonymous assassin agreed to do it, even though he had a risk of being in severe danger ☠️ while we waiting for the task to done, barron brought me in a room and said, “are you lost baby gorl? 😈” we suddenly started to do the dirty 🤭🍆🍑💦 when we were done 😼 we heard a loud bell 🔔!!! The wedding 💒 was starting, and we needed to see the plan go to action 👀 barron and I stood on a balcony, looking down on the events that were about to happen next 👁 but alas 😔 the wedding did not go the way WE planned 😬 somehow, my sister 👰 spotted the assassin right before he was about to shoot ❗️and leaped infront of the president 😦 I was heartbroken becausetrump was supposed to die not my sister 😭 however, what happened next was surprising 🤭 trumper dumper picked up the gun 🔫 and shot himself ❗️it was like Romeo and Juliet all over again 🤧🥀 suddenly barron and I were both on the ground crying about the turn of events that were all OUR fault 😪 we sadly went back inside the White House 🏠 and barron took me to the roof, where we cried together about what had happened 😭 we suddenly hear a helicopter 🚁 above us, and see the anonymous assassin! I was terrified 😱 that they were back to end our lives, so held Barron close to me. Alas, the anonymous killer didn’t shot but rather take off their mask! It was melania🤭!!! Not only that but ANONYMOUS was there too!!! They explained that they were actually secretly dating 👩\u200D❤️\u200D👨 and that my so-called parents were actually evil agents 🕴🏻👿 , so I would be living with melania, anonymous, and barron from now on!! 🥳 then anonymous said he would be running for THE NEW PRESIDENT JOB!!!! ✊🏼 soooo if you’ve learned anything from this review, it’s that 1) ANONYMOUS 2020 ALL THE WAYYY and 2) y’all don’t need to save Barron because he’s already with me 😽 k byeeee boo 🖤","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-05T11:40:47Z","userName":"ally926392","title":"No ❤️ he stole my sister 😭I did get myself a man tho 😼","rating":1}},{"id":"6157805868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app so i could support my amazing president but it wouldn’t stop glitching. i bet the liberals and sleepy joe are behind this","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-04T21:02:14Z","userName":"JCW_1","title":"horrible app","rating":1}}]}
