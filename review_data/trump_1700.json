First of all it asked for my number and ever since I have been receiving so many phone calls saying to vote for orange 🍊 potato 🥔 man 2020. I feel so uncomfortable on this app, it wants me to waste my money 💰 I feel like their a cult and I do not want to be part of it. My Facebook friends think I’m overreacting and calling me a Karen 👁👄👁 but this shrimp 🍤 guy has brought so much negative vibes  into my life 🤩. I was going to go see him at his rally 🤗 but my dog 🐕 🐶 told me I couldn’t go 🤭 bc he wanted to go for a walk 🏃🏽and I can not argue with my dog at all.   The other day I went to the store to buy onions 🧅 and guess what 😲 !! He was there and cough on my onions 🧅 now I have the \n corona virus 👑 🦠 all because I didn’t buy his merch 😤"}},{"id":"6174310844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:41:19Z","userName":"HBirdie7","rating":1,"title":"TRUMP 2020💕✨💅🏼 ON A GRAVESTONE 🙈👾✨","review":"I downloaded this app for educational purposes only to open it and find a picture of trump eating Timothee chalamets hair!!! This photo absolutely traumatized me! After seeing it I thought “maybe it’s only bad in the beginning” so I of course scrolled down more only to find more photos of trump eating celebrities hair!!!! Now joe bidon sniffing children’s hair was one thing but this, this is disgraceful!! I saw him cooking,frying,even microwaving celebs hair! (Of course he had lots of microwaves because this app steals your appliances as you have seen in other reviews) and I saw many more traumatizing photos! Including foods working out, wet socks, pigs being forced to pull hay to horses, and not to mention Donald trumpet himself... bathing in ketchup!!!!! My eyes burn from these horrible things I’ve seen, please don’t download this app.  And give it bad reviews!!!! 🤡🤡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼"}},{"id":"6174201864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:02:55Z","userName":"Guitarlove1234","rating":1,"title":"I want to bleach my eyes","review":"I don’t know why but one look at this app and I vomited like all of the Cheetos I ate earlier and corn and guess what when I looked at my vomit on the floor it looked exactly like Trump! Who would’ve thought and then I vomited again not because I looked at the vomit the first time but because it looked like Trump and now I can’t stop vomiting please for the greater good don’t use this app it’s horrifying to the eye and I wish I was a step sister in the original Cinderella so that my eyes could get pecked out by birds because I need it after seeing that I think I finally found out what kind of creature my sleep paralysis demon is, it’s this app literally I go to bed and I see this app and I wake up in a cold sweat I don’t know how all these boomers look at this app and think “that white racist homophobic perverted man is out presinanidant and I respect him and his actions”"}},{"id":"6174069609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:14:19Z","userName":"cockaroachcrotch","rating":1,"title":"This app is worse than trumps spray tan 🤡","review":"The fact I have to open up an app and see a fat  Cheeto 🍊 is awful.

When I first opened this app, a very friend and distorted version of our nation’s beautiful national anthem started playing from my phone speakers SO LOUDLY THAT IT WOKE UP MY BABY TWO ROOMS OVER. There was no warning. My eardrums are still in shock. \nThen, it kept opening a link taking me out of the app and into safari where it tried to have me take a 30 min survey of how I feel as a white supremacist, and since it took me out of the app, I had to keep sitting through the FRIED NATIONAL ANTHEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN because it automatically plays when the app is open. I figured out that I could continue to use the app after I took the survey, which was such a disappointment. After that, the app had nothing to offer me. I decided to just delete this app altogether. I do not recommend this and neither does my newly-deaf baby."}},{"id":"6173933101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:22:59Z","userName":"random67675","rating":1,"title":"no just...

As I opened the app I noticed an unsightly, repulsive, ghastly, reptilian, grotesque, obese orange man who I realized was the president of the United States! The audacity this man has to just walk out of the house looking like that!!😃 He is an abomination to human kind!!😹 Not to mention that he is a racist and has 43 claims of sexual assault one from his own daughter!!!💀 Donald, if your reading this I just wanted to let you know that I will come to the White House and pound you with my monster c$&@!🍆But you wouldn’t know what one of those looks like would you!😝 Donald, you disgust me and make me want to jump off a bridge wearing weights around my ankles so I sink to the bottom and never come back for air ever again✨🙈❤️🌟🥴👻💕🤞🤪🧚\u200D♀️🧞\u200D♀️#Sleep but make it forever🤪🤪# Chair but make it electric🙈🌧🧞\u200D♀️#rope but make it a noose🥴👻🤱🏻"}},{"id":"6173814023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:38:32Z","userName":"cream chees","rating":1,"title":"This app gave me chemical burns. 🤒😭💀🧪🔥","review":"AFTER I DOWNLOADED this app I was horrified to see that it summoned a 50 ft centipede wearing a green jumpsuit. I WAS HORRIFIED. It then started to insult me and spat out privileged baby trumps that began to crawl into my kitchen and my carrots. I think one slapped my child. I was so shook I called the police but when they came the only thing they did was shoot my back furniture. They said it was threatening their lives. So I decided to take matters in my own hands. As a civilized POC I calmly asked the centipede to leave. Then it began to get violent and yelled at me to “go back to my country!” It proceeded to spit boiling toxic sludge on me and burned my eye brows and hands. Suffering from serious third degree burns I collapsed and decided that my lass actions were to write this review. Now as I my fingers are starting to look like rotten mashed potatoes I THINK THEIR TAKING MY KIDS TO ICE DETENTION CAMPS.

Let’s just start by acknowledging how long it took to download this app! This took 5 hours which is unacceptable. I have never in my life had to wait for something to download for 5 hours, let alone 1 hour. The developers say it is updated regularly but as soon as I opened it all I saw was orange so clearly there’s a bug. I wanted to educate myself on our president as I was sure what everyone was saying about this app was wrong but this is so unprofessional I’d rather take my fish for a walk. Lastly the app kept crashing and let out a loud screeching noise which was totally not okay for my fish!!! This app also continually started chanting and asked for my credit card. I don’t know what this app is for but it is definitely some kind of cult that I do not want to be in.\nUpdate: my fish is now dead."}},{"id":"6173684008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:50:24Z","userName":"-Niyah-","rating":1,"title":"This App Needs to Be Removed!","review":"Let me just say this first: I am a PROUD American who loves OUR president, Donald J Trump. That being said, I am VERY disappointed with this app. Everything was fine and dandy until I actually opened the app. All I got was a flashing black and white screen. After opening and closing the app, I got a black bar in the middle of a white screen. Now I’m all about supporting President Trump, so I deleted and reinstalled. It then took about 30 minutes to download (mind you my wifi is very good and it only took 2 minutes the first time) and when it finally installed, it would open for 2 seconds then close automatically! I never thought I’d agree with the libs up here, but this app needs to be taken down or fixed! I can’t support my president if I can’t even get into the app! One star until something is done about this issue!"}}]}
