Do not let the orange man 👨\u200D🦰fool you. He is a homophobic, sexist, and racist man who has fooled many of my children into following him.” Then the orange man 👨\u200D🦰himself busted 💢the door to my sanctuary🍃✨ wide open (without knocking 🤦\u200D♀️) and screamed “🤏🏻I will have my military raid this dump in a heartbeat🤏🏻” and I looked directly at the nasty mop on his head and said “bring it on 🙀old man” then a army of roaches 🦗started swarming my sanctuary 😿Jesus knelt down to the floor to the roaches and he whistled a tune🙊 thank God he was there 🤗 anyways Trump started chanted “All lives matter” and then all the roaches stopped dead in their tracks and turned around to face him😑 they started running after him and trump ran for his life!!! Anyways... 4 stars for the roaches but 0 stars for the BIG ORANGE MAN AND HIS APP THAT BROUGHT NOTHING BUT HARM 😥","date":"2020-07-08T18:53:53Z"}},{"id":"6173347278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump's Sugar Daddy","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD - Terrible App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Of course I downloaded this app to learn all about OUR presidents plans for America. Although there are many HORRIBLE things going on, such as the discrimination of black people in the US, children being held in cages, immigrants being compared to animals, etc, I believe that OUR president would do everything he can to help all these issues and try to stop them. And I thought that he would broadcast his plans and speeches on this app, but unfortunately, the app keeps glitching and closing every time I open it. I also think it did something wrong to my phone because my phone randomly turns off, even if it’s charged. It stays off for about 2 hours and I can’t do anything about it. Now I have to spend money (that I need for rent, food and necessities) to fix my phone, just because I downloaded this app. Please read reviews and don’t download this app. Leave your reviews if something happens to you as well. Have a good day guys 🥰🧚🏿\u200D♀️✨❤️","date":"2020-07-08T18:53:15Z"}},{"id":"6173137800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bejsnaikd dksn","title":"read if you want😙.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I don’t appreciate the fact that my phone is being blown up, and ever since i downloaded this app it started to happen even more than usual😡! I mainly downloaded this app so that i could leave a bad review. Most of you may or may not know that tr-😷 tru-🤢 trump🤮 is trying to band tictok because some teenagers (who are smart for doing this) trolled trumps campaign using the app tictok, and just because this is happening I suggest people who are against trump should leave a bad review and give it 1 star so that his app is rated 1 star overall and is deleted from all platforms that allows you download apps. \nAside from all that I think my opinion about trump should be shared. Me being an African American I am truely STILL offended by the words trump uses not only till this day but from the past too plus he is able to get away with it! This is the united states of america🙄, so why doesn’t it feel like we are united. \n\nNow for my opinion about this country😒. It’s known for being “free”, but i’m guessing back then African Americans working as slaves is know as being “free”🤨, or all the massacres orchestrated by the racist inconsiderate unfair white people is also known to be “free”🤔. Let me guess police brutality is also know as free? Lord knows how much longer i could go on.\n\nWhen will it finally click that people who are african americans/ brown skins/ dark skins (not black) are tired?","date":"2020-07-08T17:44:47Z"}},{"id":"6173061359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hdhevdjdbfjfbifbf","title":"🚨DO NOT DOWNLOAD🚨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support our AMAZING president. I was expecting to be caught up on everything going on in the campaign but that is not what happened. When I downloaded this app my phone started bugging out and glitching and it caught on fire. (I’m typing this from a new phone). My phone then exploded and caught my curtains on fire. Then what happened next will shock you. Someone broke my window and I heard “5 STARS FOR TRUMP” and these people is ski masks and trump merchandise came in and stole my dog and proceeded to throw rats at me. At this point my room was on fire and rats were running everywhere so I ran out to call for help but my family was tied up. So more people is ski masks held me against my will on the floor and put out the fire and pigeons came flying from nowhere. The rats and pigeons started Dancing around me and my family and singing a song in attempt to sacrifice us. I managed to escape but I have never seen my family since. I am now petrified and I will need therapy for the rest of my life.","date":"2020-07-08T17:20:18Z"}},{"id":"6172274487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Niall Horan for President","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely awful. It asked for my phone number and insult like everyone to know that I don't know where these phone numbers are going. They could be going into spy databases or they could be sent to human trafficking rings (because we know Trump is involved with them) and I do not want people to be put in danger like that. This is disgusting and undeniably wrong. It is even possible to drain bank accounts with just a phone number according to multiple thieves and hackers. Need I remind you, Donald Trump's companies have filed for bankruptcy more than enough times. How do we know he isn't going to take all of our money? Oh wait, we don't. He can use some of the money that he is taking from us to cover up the fact that he is robbing us. Just like how he covers up the documents saying that he is a child trafficker. Donald Trump is robbing us. He is robbing us of our money, our children, and robbing minorities of equal rights. And this time, there is actual proof.","date":"2020-07-08T13:34:29Z"}},{"id":"6177660533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Notorious nodis","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was a huge fan of Donald trump until I opened the trump 2020 app, at first it started off with a normal looking campaign speech but something was off, everything but trump was really blurry, I figured it was just a weird focusing error so I kept watching as his speech went on his voice got louder and louder so loud in-fact I had my phone on the lowest possible volume and it was still ear piercing, but then things went dead silent and trump looked dead at the camera and said “what do you think Gerald (my name)?” Soon after his eyes turned obsidian black and started bleeding hyper realistic blood! I tried to close out of the app but it kept reopening eventually it wouldn’t let me close out of the app at all and trump looked at me and said “no more running, I am god” and reached his hand towards the screen, after that the app closed I still don’t know what happened I even asked him on Twitter about it and he blocked me in response. Please please please don’t get this app!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T17:58:16Z"}},{"id":"6177534761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DANNY DORITIO69","title":"TERRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is perhaps The strangest up on the universe when I opened it up transported me to an alternate dimension where everyone was an Lupalupa and they kept saying some crap like trump 2020 I was so confused then it’s skyrocket with me up into the sky and exploded me with fireworks! I’m not really sure why it does this but I’m really confused and I would really like to know why they were demonic symbols all around the app it seemed a little strange to me and I’m wondering if you could remove that because it’s not very appropriate also, I’d like to speak to your manager because this is so inappropriate and disgusting I hate it so much and like it’s just very bad also my little sister decided that she wanted to look at the app and then it’s skyrocketed her into the sky to except she didn’t get exploded she got hit by the Titanic which was soaring through the sky at the time. I’m wondering why it was like this but I don’t really care because I hate trump but whatever🤗😱👄❤️🥺☺️💋🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧞\u200D♀️🧜🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T17:18:04Z"}},{"id":"6176461118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"a7med kehdr","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"It took me 2 months to download the app and after I downloaded it it asked me for personal information then after I closed the app without signing I got death threats and my tv started playing news without my permission then my Alexa started saying “ vote for trump or your cat will be killed” the next day I couldn’t find my cat and then I went to my back yard to find her dead with a note “ you should vote or we won’t stop” then my bank account was completely empty, it had all my money and now I am broke and can’t pay my rent and when I signed up hoping it would stop I started getting nude pics and messages from strip clubs asking me to join them cuz the nudes I sent were fire but I didn’t send anyone anything and I didn’t even take nude pics after that when I came back from work my whole house was egged and there was a message painted on it and it said “ VOTE FOR TRUMP” the next day my house was burnt down.

I tried downloading it and then as soon as I started doing that my App Store crashed! Then my phone started glitching like crazy and I wasn’t able to use my phone for 2 days 😔 then when the app finally downloaded it took up all my storage👊🏼 so I had to delete so many other apps just for this one, and photos yeah I ain’t forget. As soon as I opened the app I started hearing weird noises coming from my closet as if someone was moving things in there. I got extremely scared and my first thought is Donald Trump is in my closet! Thankful it was just my grandma looking for her diapers. But then something even weirder happened! Later that night I was trying to sleep but then my phone turned on and went to the app and it sounded like Trump was trying to talk to me, he was saying USE MY APP OR I WILL FIND YOU.. yeah I know one of the most traumatic experiences OF MY LIFE ✝️ I had to get rid of the app because it just started ruining my life. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!! 😗💅🏽","date":"2020-07-09T10:08:09Z"}},{"id":"6175875683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Melania Trump 2.0","title":"stinky poopoo 😌✨🧚\u200D♀️❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"TERRIBLE APP!! I do NOT recommend this app at all. It has caused me so much misfortune. First off, the app glitches various times, after that, I started to receive many text messages from random people saying they were going to hunt me down and bully my garden hose. Not only that but they threatened me saying if i didn’t help them build a new house in ROBLOX then they would send people dressed up in peppa pig costumes to my house and watch me at night while I sleep. If you think this is bad just wait, it gets far worse... after all this I find out the app not only caused all of these problems but it also sends me photos of evil elmo at random times of the day and leaving notes on my doorstep saying they will hunt me down until I agree to stan Donald Trump which now means I will be hunted down/stalked for the rest off my life all because of this TERRIBLE app. Worst app ever, definitely do NOT install!!
