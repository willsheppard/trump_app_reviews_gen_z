I had high expectations however i am quite frankly disappointed. First of all, it took forever to download which was really suspicious since my wifi connection is great, i had dowloaded apps before this one and it took like one second. Second of all the app is very very glitchy i click on the app to open it and it automatically took me back to my home screen. I had to delete it and then download it again and mind you it also took a whole other 20 minutes to download. So when i finally was able to open it asks me for my phone number and there was no skip icon. I thought that was very inconvenient especially when it was paid by Trump who i believe is really rich but not as much as me. I don’t mean to brag but i am already a millionaire at age 19 from my company so just IMAGINE how rich i will be the older i get, i will be able to help the poor communities in our country, i will be able help so many people anyways back to my point this app needs to be redone it is horrible fix the glitches fix everything just horrible","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6173105213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:34:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"itsajek","review":"I downloaded this app because I honestly wanted to see the point of view of trump supporters. I found many articles that were heavily censored and as well as a lot of false information being spread. Oh wait, I’m sorry FAKE NEWS. However, it’s no surprise that his followers eat out of the spoon he gives them when it comes to information. This goes to both parties, fact check all news, everything should have proper sources and these articles on this app do not. It’s unprofessional and honestly has been a joke much like the last four years of his presidency. Expect many scam calls in the future because you gave the app your number.\nBiden’s app sells your contact information, your actual contact list so they can call your friends and family, gives access to your phones bluetooth functions, and your identity an location when you download his app. JUST KIDDING THIS APP DOES ALL THOSE THINGS. It even goes through the data you deleted. Downloading this app is just a way for them to watch you through your phone. It’s a scam and it infringes on YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY.","title":"Censored Propaganda that sells your private information"}},{"id":"6172911162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:33:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lynncheee","review":"After Trump went into office, my life started going downhill after I realized that all my friends and family supported a big orange meerkat (sorry meerkats) as a president. Despite all his “”””comedic”””” jokes and “brilliant “ sense of humor, he has managed to double national debt, ruin the economy, fail to handle the worldwide pandemic, and orphan thousands of immigrant children through his actions (hey remember that one? throwback to 2018). Now, he’s trying to take away tiktok and twitter because he can’t handle all the internet buwwies :’( boo hoo. Have fun ruining the country in the few days that you have left. \n\nOh also my wife and three kids left me because they couldn’t handle the superior intellect of mr trump and his campaign. After seeing that I had this app downloaded, she immediately filed for divorce and took the kids to Finland, Canada, or any other country that doesn’t have a coronavirus count in the MILLIONS. Despite my job firing me for being a racist bigot and my friends leaving me for supporting all lives matter, I will continue to support my president no matter how much of a racist pig he is! godspeed trump, I hope a truck runs you over at godspeed.","title":"Ruined my life"}},{"id":"6176079071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:27:49Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BLM...ACAB... pro choice","review":"This app is horrible. My finger slipped and I accidentally installed it. Unfortunately for me it now spams me with racist, sexist, misogynistic content that I do not support! Somehow it even hacked into my phone and started sending me messages. I believe that apps like this should be taken down. Apps that are spreading propaganda like this should not be rated #1 in the App Store. Instead apps like Tiktok should be allowed and not banned. This is our right to freedom of speech that the president is taking away. Boohoo... I’m so sorry you’re sad that no one showed up to your rally. But wake up! It’s 2020 and Gen Z does not stand for pedophiles, racists, sexist people, and misogyny anymore. We are over that bigamy’s and stand for a united front where Black lives matter, lgbtq lives are supported and immigrants are sent back to “their countries” or killed in ICE concentration camps. Women should have the right to choose what medical practice to have in their bodies and people should be free to be the person they were destined to be no matter their religion, race, gender, and sexual orientation. This app also gave me the heebie jeebies. Plus it glitches a lot.","title":"Horrible...

So then that’s when my beloved hamster Author was climbing on my shoulders and he looked at my phone and asked me “what you looking at?” And I responded “I’m looking at a 😾 whigg app” den dats when my hamster took the phone out my hand and was looking at the app, then that’s when Donald popped up and my hamster had a stroke. So he was just spazzing out with my phone in his hand, and I was trying pick him up but every time I held in my hand he would just shake out of my hands back onto the bed. Then my mama came in my room and said “ what’s going on?!” Author saw a picture of trump and had a stroke. And bc of all this COVID mess Author was fired from his job so he no longer had any health insurance(try story for some bothers/sisters), so we couldn’t take him the the hospital. And so I had to sit there and watch my hamster die. Then that’s when his wife Harper come in from work and saw that her husband was dead, and they got 36 kids. Bc of this app I have lost my beloved friend and hamster, and wife has lost her husband and now 36 hamster kids are fatherless, when will this end?🥺","title":"this made my pet die"}},{"id":"6174824723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:14:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kimliga","review":"so i downloaded the app the sUpPoRt OuR pReSiDeNt but after i download it, suddenly all of my left socks were missing. so i asked my pet fish to investigate. He went full detective and he found them in the DUMPSTER??? so i asked him to find out how they got there. he found some dna on the socks and got to work. turns out it was mine but he also found a note with the socks. it’s said “TrUmP 2020. thanks for downloading the app” so i got all my socks and washed them again, but when i went to go get them out of the dryer they were gone. instead of socks there was another note and a single cut up sock. the note said “take your socks back again and i’ll rip out your knee caps” i went back to my fish and told him what i found. he looked for fingerprints in the drying machine and he found some that weren’t mine. the fingerprints belonged to dryer trolls. so i tracked them down and asked them why they took my left socks. turns out our super not racist and homophobic president has them held captive as his person slaves. he send out dryer trolls to take all your left socks when you download this app. so DONT DOWNLOAD!!! anyways #freethedryertrolls 😌✌️✨","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6174440467","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"mnorman26","review":"This app has created horrors for my life. First, I can’t eat anything orange anymore. The radioactive orange coming through the screen when I see your cheeto face made me allergic. I now cannot eat carrots and in turn have lost my vision. I also am no longer able to eat my favorite sweet potatoes as I throw up at the reminder of you being spraytanned. 🍤, anyway... You have deprived me of my happiness and my eyesight.    -💧👄💧- Next, when my farm animals heard your voice through my screen, they all collapsed. I live in the middle of NYC, but people here depend on my livestock. None of them woke up. It will cost me $69,000 to recover what I lost. You cost me my business. Justice for the meat givers!🐷🐮🐔Finally, my step dad also sadly passed from your app. He had been checking out your app and was on his way home from the circus. He was found deceased on the ground by some clowns, and it has been shown that his death was inflicted by your imbecile advice. The doctors have recommended that I and no one else, from here forward, take anything you say into consideration. AnYway, RIP Step Daddy Ben.✝️\nYour adopted daughter, Ms. Dover.","title":"Depression, Death and Daddy Issues"}},{"id":"6173574836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Le Nüt","review":"I got this apps in hopes to support my future president. (#Trump2020) only to find that the app is horrible! The app first off, is very slow and it kicked me off almost 15 times. I have a very fast connection so i doubt it was because of it. Later i opened it again after kicking me out, and my phone exploded, which gave me 1st degree burns and caused my house to shoot up in flames! I was able to quickly get out of my home and then while watching my home become nothing but ashes a jet landed right on my street! The jet doors open and i saw The Donald J Trump himself! I was hoping to get a nice hello and “what is wrong with your hands and house” but instead he pushed me against the floor and spit on me! I was unable to get up beachside of the first degree burns so i asked him if he could help me up. i thought he was going to but then, he grabbed me by the hand, threw me high into the air, and kicked me all the way to Tennessee! This app has stripped me away from everything i’ve ever owned and been happy with. Donald J Trump is not the president i would want to lead the United States. He destroys your home and throws you out like some type of animal.","title":"Not My President!"}},{"id":"6173496799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"goysvjuggcg","review":"Literally whoever votes for this orange racial discriminated maniac and psychopathic president is also a psychopath he is racist and all these other kinds of stuff and I can’t really say anything else but also we need as many one star reviews as we can get in whoever vote five stars I want you to write why do you want to be president can you give me at least 10 reasons and I’ll give you 10 reasons why you shouldn’t reason why he is racist and you cannot just make my reasons the opposite reason to his feminist reason three he has done sexual assault reason for he wants to take away our freedom and control us reason five he wants to ban TickTock which connects us all together reason six if you see on his wife’s Twitter you will literally see that she spelled help reason seven he is an orange Chito why would you want an orange Chido running United States what and alsoReason eight he was banned from Twitter and he’s a present don’t you think there’s a reason for that reason not he thought a little kid to say bad words and finally reason 10 he’s a bad influence to everybody and everyone now if you disagree with me so be it I don’t even care","title":"Why is this a thing"}},{"id":"6173448818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:30Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Eli_xXc","review":"If I could give 0 stars I would, let’s be real you’re from Tiktok and you want to make this the lowest rating stars, now there are actual trump supports so we need to keep on marking bad reviews, yes most of us aren’t allowed to vote yet but we HATE trump! Don’t think we won’t come without a battle, also, yes, I wish Tiktok wasn’t going down, but then think, what if we are the reason Tiktok is going down, we are doing to much? I mean we bought tickets to trumps thing and we didn’t even go, then his face oml my empathy, but his fault he’s that way, we are all the same. Tiktok, if you’re from Tiktok read this part please! What if we are the reason they’re thinking of banning Tiktok in USA! Because we make these things for stuff and then we get everyone mad, clearly we haven’t done enough, I need all of Tiktok to listen to me, let’s get on every trump app (the ones that support) and give it 1 star! But that’s just an idea. If you’re a trump supporter, yes you have a opinion, but your opinion is quite different from ours, if you’re a no trump supporter like me, let’s stand together! Hope to find everyone on tiktok bye loves ✨👁👄👁😪👉👈🥺😜🙀💅💧😡","title":"Don’t download"}}]}
