DO NOT SUPPORT OR DOWNLOAD. Had this app to get valuable information on the upcoming election, but can‚Äôt trust it coming from this man. MANY sexual assault lawsuits against him and absolutely no hiding of his racism after supporting a video stating ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù. They should rethink their upper management."}},{"id":"6179325171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hatingthis","date":"2020-07-10T03:52:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Less than one star!","rating":1,"review":"This app took 12 days to download. It took all the power from my electrical box and cost me $70000 electric bill. When I tried to pay the bill my credit card was hacked by this app. My house burned down because the electric was too hot from the electric for download. My phone melted and I burned my elbows when I tried to pick up my hot phone. I went to the ER for my burns and tested positive for COVID 12 days later. On the way home from the ER this app sold my phone number to China. China calls me a lot now. My credit card is drained and I receive all types things to my burned down house from China. Lots of plastic things."}},{"id":"6179325138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kira hatsumi","date":"2020-07-10T03:52:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"üò°üò°üò°","rating":1,"review":"Is so trash app wouldn‚Äôt let me get in I hate this man is racist anyway hate him this is very bad he is gonna get y‚Äôall App Store hates\nüò°üò°üò°ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§°ü§°üë∫"}},{"id":"6179325087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ed_*","date":"2020-07-10T03:52:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TRASH","rating":1,"review":"The app continually crashes, I‚Äôm getting unsolicited phone calls, and the color palette is ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢"}},{"id":"6179324984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dick C.
