Some kids look up to people on there. There are MANY influential people on this app. Some people make videos about chasing ur dreams, loving your self, loving god, and even how to get over bullying. why would you take that from people who genuinely use this app to be great people. With COVID-19 you gotta realize some kids parents don’t even let them go out, so they use social media as there way to have fun. No one planned to have COVID-19. Do not take away kids happines.","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:21Z","userName":"trump=garbo","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172898891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave my Sister Anaphylactic Shock","review":"My dear sister is very devoted to trump. I don’t really get the hype but she said something about him being the supreme 🍊. Whatever she wants to do I guess. But a few weeks ago, when she got this app she started to see an allergic reaction going up her arm. I told her the app was poisoning her. She said no. A few days later her throat closed up and she nearly died. It was very ✨Scary✨ and I told her that I think it was this app. I’m personally so sad that this app has hurt my family this way. 😭","date":"2020-07-08T16:29:53Z","userName":"Genesis Vanilla","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172840332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Lemon (or should I say Orange)","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of having my mind changed about our President. I’m a rational person and like to think that people can change. However, upon opening the app, it forced me to put in my phone number and I have been receiving so many booty calls from his staff...some as early as 3am. I am fed up with this and deleting the app. They leaked my personal information and I am just as upset right now as I was when this lemon (or should I say orange) was elected.","date":"2020-07-08T16:12:13Z","userName":"blueishotredisnot","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172783006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Can’t believe I downloaded this","review":"I was hoping to get more information about our president and his plans for the future but after downloading the app would NOT stop sending notifications even though in my settings the notification were disabled. Along with this the app would never work when I would open it and I noticed my battery would drain EXTREMELY fast after I  got the app. Would not recommend this AT ALL do yourself a favor","date":"2020-07-08T15:55:43Z","userName":"lillian robins","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172778241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"battery drainer","review":"i was looking at the reviews and obviously they aren’t believable. so i downloaded the app, just to see what it’s all about and support our president. but as soon as i opened the app it kicked me out. and so i waited a bit, then i clicked on it again and it kicked me out once again. i just powered my phone off and let the app be for a bit. once i was finally able to get into the app, it was extremely glitchy and slow. it kept lagging and i could barely touch the screen without it going crazy. and then my phone died. so i plugged it in, once at 100%, i went back into the app. not even five minutes later, it died again. so not only is it glitchy and slow, it also drains your battery and takes up a lot of storage.","date":"2020-07-08T15:54:22Z","userName":"amos volleypaige :)","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172737907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT SUPPORT THIS ORANGE🍊✨💔","review":"when i downloaded this app, it took MONTHS TO DOWNLOAD. i do not have that much time because i was planning on going to a trump rally, but got 10 tickets and forgot i had to vacuum my ceiling. the second time, i had to dust off my roof and so i’m sorry i got 5 seats😔😔....in this app IT CRASHED MY PHONE 10 OR MORE TIMES!!!!!’11!!1!1!1!1!1!! i got so upset, but then my phone EXPLODED and CAUGHT ON FIRE while playing the national anthem, and my head almost exploded, just like my grandpas😢rest in peace.

He must be saved ASAP, I also wish there were a lower rating I could give, I was gonna give the good old Donnie another chance because I feel bad he has such a small you know where THEN I remembered I’m voting for Myself 2020 I may be way too young but if a clown such as Donald can do it I can do it with ease ~thank you for reading","date":"2020-07-08T15:03:46Z","userName":"Hdhndnejwk","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172561353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app made me have explosive burning diarrhea!","review":"This app not only took 4 months to download but it crashed my phone every time I unlocked it, even my dog suffered from the diarrhea, the rocks in Donald trumps head even suffered. My poor cat had a brain tumor and exploded. The burning sensation was moist and rough like sandpaper, and the explosiveness can only be compared to volcano tambora. Have you ever seen a baby eat it’s own eyes out well this app caused it to do so. This app works just about as well as the president does, awful. 🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻","date":"2020-07-08T14:53:18Z","userName":"eatmybootycheeks🧚🏻","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172552290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Overall bad app","review":"This app is just not good. I don’t understand the point of it. I tried to use the app to its full potential, but it was significantly difficult when the app was difficult to use. How do you expect me to use the app is difficult to use? Plus I don’t understand why the app is for trump is that all it’s used for? As a very strong trump supporter I would love to use this app but I don’t understand what the apps purpose is.  Is it just to support trump? I don’t know. I don’t care for the app.","date":"2020-07-08T14:50:46Z","userName":"looshielou","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172511850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"dangerous and broken 😚🧚\u200D♀️🤩","review":"When I downloaded the app it took weeks to install and after finally being able to open it I was stunned at a big 🟠 thing. It was truly terrible and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Also IT has done nothing to help improve equality it our nation for women, people of color, immigrants, people of the lgbt community, and many more struggling groups. Unless you’re a cis white straight male with no compassion for others then plz don’t get this nasty app. 😌","date":"2020-07-08T14:39:22Z","userName":"ALDM until BLM","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
