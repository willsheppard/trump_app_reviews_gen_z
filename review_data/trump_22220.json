God awful app, I wish old people would just go back to playing candy crush and solitaire.","title":"No"}},{"id":"6172997413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:00:30Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"A_human21","review":"Literally one second in to downloading the app I received a call saying that donald trump stole my dog is is keeping him hostage!
