Second, I don’t think trump should be able to access our phone numbers. I feel like it’s a threat to national security. I wanted to support my non homophobic and non racist president but then I realized we don’t have one. 10/10 would NOT recommend. Also, i didn’t get a chance to use the app very much because i died yesterday. Horrible app and I don’t recommend it. Also, I no longer support trump because he might shut down tik tok. I wish I could rate it half a star. I feel uncunfortable that trump could access people’s phone numbers. DONT GET THE APP.M","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:45:08Z"}},{"id":"6176679328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😈🦆","title":"10/10 wouldn’t recommend.","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app expecting accurate information of what is going on. Instead it asked me to provide my phone #! I was not having it. The fact that I had to be asked for my phone number was outrageous! Why do you need my phone number when the app is already on my phone? Did I mention that now my phone has a virus. I’m very angry. 10/10 would not recommend downloading. It is a waste of time. Also it took over 4 months to download. Very disappointed. Will be telling fellow trump supporters of my family to not download this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:20:03Z"}},{"id":"6176665886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dunder mifflin cree","title":"bruh 👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"This app took almost 2 months to download even with my 2-gig internet. Once I opened it I was spammed by thousands of scam emails and phone calls from Chinese hackers. Then, I heard a helicopter from above and the next thing I knew, 300 Russian spies landed on my house to kidnap and take me to Jamaica. They then forced me to compete in the local bobsledding competition. Thankfully, Tom Cruise came to rescue me but then we went to Iceland to see the northern lights. Now we’re filming the new mission impossible movie. Anyway, long story short, don’t download this app if you want all your private information to be exposed to the whole world.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:16:27Z"}},{"id":"6176631653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tay Tay <3😜","title":"✨🙈🥰🧚🏼\u200D♀️🤭","rating":1,"review":"Like said in some other people’s reviews if I could give zero stars I would without hesitation. The app itself is just so problematic and causing so many issues. You have to be 17+ for the app... why? Is there going to be things that my virgin eyes don’t want to see on here or something? Other reviewers also said that the app took forever to download. THEY WERE RIGHT. It took sooo long. All of that waiting gone to waste bc I disliked the app so much I didn’t even open it, I just deleted it🥰😜 Chile anyways, whoever is reading my review I hope you have an amazing day and don’t let the trumpees get to ya😘😘","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:07:25Z"}},{"id":"6176452067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bailey.T813","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"review":"so after the hour it took to completely download it’s started asking me all the weird questions like my address my social security number my credit card number then it wanted a picture of my birth certificate and my id also i uninstalled like 7 different apps and it says the app can’t work properly if it doesn’t have my location at all times then it deleted my text message and wanted access to my photos and it wouldn’t tell me why also had very inappropriate pictures and videos not suited for anyone to watch over worst app ever download 🤦🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:18:25Z"}},{"id":"6176106319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"presthegr8","title":"HORRIFIED","rating":1,"review":"I saw that this app was going to be the replacement for tiktok, so I decided to download it. To my dismay, I was greeted by some kind of monster throwing what looked to be gang symbols. I assume they are gang symbols bc one of my neighbors saw it and immediately shot my grandmother. Now, my grandmother is a trump supporter and it is a shame that he is making his supporters targets. After my grandmother was shot, we tried to take her to the hospital but she said that it was what trump wanted and decided to lay on the porch and bleed out for 16 hours. Overall I do not approve of this app, I wish I could give it -6 stars but sadly that is not how the solar system works. RIP grandma P ❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:36:24Z"}},{"id":"6175981575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BRUHFDT","title":"HORRIBLE FAKE APP 😡","rating":1,"review":"I can not even explain how frustrated this app made me feel! Not only did it take 6 hours, 6 minutes, and 6 seconds to download, but when it did it downloaded a virus to my phone! If you look up the agaM virus you will see how terrible and damaging it is to your phone! I downloaded this app seeking information and all I got from it was a facetime call with Hillary Clint*n telling me I am a stupid ugly horrible person! I threw my phone at the wall in disgust! I would’ve rather seen my orange savior but whatever. I have to go back to my cult meeting but I just thought I should spread the news! 💟☮️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:56:24Z"}},{"id":"6175896594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fonts_user21","title":"Unacceptable😠","rating":1,"review":"Omg I can’t with this app. When I was signing into the app I noticed it was asking a lot of personal questions. I didn’t think much of it until it asked me what my favorite kind of chips were. Of course I said Doritos, then suddenly I get a FaceTime call from an unknown number. I’m hesitant to answer because my hair is a mess!!🙈✨ Like I said it was an unknown number, so of course I picked up! It was nun other then Donald trump himself! I thought oh no he’s gonna send the swat after me!!!!😥 He proceeded to tell me I have no taste and then hung up. What was that all about I thought. Definitely do not recommend this app.🥱😒😠🤚🏼","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:28:14Z"}},{"id":"6175801567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Voodoo Boi","title":"This app is TERRIBLE","rating":1,"review":"it’s taking WEEKS to download and when i did download it, it asks for all of my personal information which is inappropriate since he is the President. Once i downloaded it i wasn’t able to delete it and then it flooded my camera roll with pictures of him. My phone has also been completely wiped i only have the factory setting apps and this one everything else is gone. Absolutely terrible not worth the trouble. i must get a new phone because of what it has done and the amount of glitches and problems i have now because of this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:56:35Z"}},{"id":"6175744367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"johnny lankford","title":"To Donald Trump","rating":1,"review":"I am a tiktoker with over 145k followers and have makes part of my living off TikTok. Closing TikTok would mean killing jobs for thousands of Americans. People have brand deals, clothing endorsements, and also receive income from TikTok through coins it’s like people tipping. You killing this app will be the end of your growth for even your young followers are in there. I will never vote for you just FYI. You left 40 million out of jobs as the treasury gave out $5 trillions to big company’s. So now you wanna get rid of TikTok. You might have a lawsuit from creators with creators that have millions of followers btw my @ is southpawjohnny.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:36:54Z"}}]}
