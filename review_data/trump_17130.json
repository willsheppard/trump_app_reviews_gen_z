App gave me corona virus which my fearless president told me I would not get because everything is fine. Wanted to download the app to show those libtards that this app and election is no joke 😤 but I opened it to see someone much uglier than I remember seeing on TV. This is not kids or anyone with an underlying condition friendly.

Where in history has America ever been great. We took sacred land from Native Americans and we only give back a piece of it. Next it wanted me to put in my phone number, I don’t to be notified for when America reaches hell 2.0  .  Sis, I got places to be and it’s not on this piece of land. Anyways, I’m heading to Popeyes, y’all want something?

His fist being equally orange. It scared the living day lights out of me. In addition to the fear still left in me the set up of this app is very poorly designed, almost like an orange idiot created it himself, with spelling errors and false information in every sentence.... This app is a disgrace to the face of America. Truly a dreadful experience.","title":"Terrible, awful, and just dreadful..."}},{"id":"6174428191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:18:39Z","userName":"kimirah","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app I saw a naked Cheeto and then I saw him at my door and he looked way worse in real life then I was hungry so I looked in my pantry and he was theDISGUSTING Cheeto and that’s when I realized...... he tried to eat all of my flaming hot Cheetos 😔so I did what I had to do......

Taking a risk, I decided to download to stay up to date with MY president. However, after opening the app I saw a walking kaka on my screen. This revelation frightened me so much so that my middle fingers suffered a stroke. After that, my pet rock went kaka on my phone and it stopped working. Garbage!!","title":"Terrible....just TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174415292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:44Z","userName":"mariiik11","rating":1,"review":"가진 게 꿈밖에 없었네\n눈 뜨면 뿌연 아침뿐\n밤새 춤을 추며 노래해\n그 끝이 없던 악보들\nAy 우린 호기롭게 shout\n'다 던져봐'\n세상과 첫 싸움\nDon't wanna die but so much pain\nToo much cryin' so 무뎌지는 칼날\nOh I\nWe were only seven\nI, but we have you all now\n일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에\n이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에\nOh I\nYeah we got to heaven\n내게 돌을 던져\n우린 겁이 없어 anymore\nWe are, we are together bulletproof\n(Yeah we have you have you)\n또 겨울이 와도 누가 날 막아도 걸어가\nWe are, we are forever bulletproof\n(Yeah we got to heaven)\nWe are bullet bullet bulletproof\n부정적인 시선에 맞서 우린 해냈구\n나쁜 기억도 많은 시련도\n다 호기롭게 우린 막아냈지 bulletproof\n늘 생각해 아직 꿈속인 건 아닐까\n길었던 겨울\n끝에 온 게 진짜 봄일까\n모두 비웃던 한땐 부끄럽던 이름\n이건 쇠로 된 증명 \"bullet-proof\"\nOh I\nWe were only seven\nI, but we have you all now\n일곱의 겨울과 봄 뒤에\n이렇게 맞잡은 손끝에\nOh I\nYeah we got to heaven\n내게 돌을 던져\n우린 겁이 없어 anymore\nWe are, we are together bulletproof\n(Yeah we have you have you)\n또 겨울이","title":"🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨𝓚𝓪𝓻𝓶𝓪 𝓲𝓼 𝓪 𝓫𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174405561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:47Z","userName":"karen🤢🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰💚💞💛💕","rating":1,"review":"I saw this racist/rapist person when I first opened it that’s is unacceptable to me and my family.

How can someone of such high status have this type of app 👎 Then it began loading very slowly and wouldn’t let me use it, and it definitely isn’t my WiFi I could use my other apps easily.
