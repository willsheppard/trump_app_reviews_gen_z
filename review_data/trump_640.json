I have had plenty of bad experiences but my experience with this app has managed to come out as the absolute WORST. first of all, when I saw the image of a pedo cheeto come up on my screen, my eyes felt like they were on fire and thanks to the absolutely horrific sight, my vision is now permanently impaired. Second of all, this app asks for your phone number, and so I gladly gave it, not expecting anything bad to come of it. However as soon as I entered my number, I began receiving multiple creepy texts that wouldn’t stop, even when I blocked the number!! I am writing this review now fearing for my life, knowing that my information is now in the hands of this ugly orange. Now that I have finally deleted the app, I don’t think I can recover from the trauma that installing the app put me through. I do not wish my experiences on ANYONE, not even my worst enemies. Please save yourself while you still can and DO NOT download this app, or it very well may be the last thing you do"}},{"id":"6175000027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-09T04:07:38Z","userName":"Dippxr","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app poisoned my water supply, burned my crops, and delivered a plague onto my house. This app is absolutely terrible and will ruin your life. 0/10 do not download under any circumstances. Immediately after opening this app an electromagnetic radiation wave was released from my phone and made everyone in my house stupid. My family won’t stop lecturing me about how vaccines will kill you and how wearing a mask outside causes brain damage. It’s maddening. Even my cat has tried to convince me that the coronavirus was invented by liberals. I have fallen into insurmountable debt due to the amount of MAGA hats my family keeps purchasing. This app caused my wife to cover our home wall to wall in Donald Trump merchandise and I fear she will soon leave me in favor of Donald Trump. We used to be a good wholesome Christian family, we raised our children with good morals; however this app has turned my entire life upside down, and it will do the same to you. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Don’t download this app by any means. Save yourself, before it’s too late."}},{"id":"6174827048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worning do not download this app","date":"2020-07-09T03:15:15Z","userName":"do not downlowd plz 098","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded this app I thought I was going to get the latest campaign news but turns out when I downloaded this app I opened it my hair started to be like this dumb Color ( no offense to all you blond people out their )  then I fart is it this app or am I just going crazy because the very next day I open the app to check if there was any news there was no news in fact something horrible happened my penis fell off it was a very sad day I had a funeral.

THIS IS HORRIBLE!! It is mostly horrible knowing this is a app with such horrible intentions, etc!! there are many many many horrible things going with this app, and knowing that by the reviews most people agree with the app being deleted for such horrible intentions etc!! it also takes up a lot of battery which I most certainly hate!! I have all the time in life to keep on going with the horrible things with this app but I have things to do in reality.. unlike trump which is possibly laying around in his office in a chair eating Cheetos which could be the reason he looks like one but is sitting doing absolutely NOTHING for America and tweeting on Twitter.. but I could go along with the horrible things.. anyways Chile. thank you for reading this sincerely - a person that is actually educated."}},{"id":"6173499343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:48Z","userName":"Disneycrazedmom","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Last night I woke up in a cold sweat with the message to download this app, or else. I didn’t want to know what would happen so I quickly got it and it took so long to download, when I finally woke up from a restless sleep, it was still loading. Still, curious as to the mysterious nature of this app, I opened it when it finally finished. What I saw horrified me. I saw videos of Donald trump and his supporters kicking my cat around like a game of soccer. I immediately deleted the app, but as I got off work I saw the app was back. It opened by myself and I saw a live feed of my house burning to the ground! When I got home and saw that it was true, it opened again to an image of my entire family stabbed through so many times with a message written in their blood above them, “I didn’t say I was done with you”. I am now terrified and running for my life. I know the app is tracking me, and I wish I could just fly out of the country, but I fear that being in one place for too long will make them able to track me. I’m scared. Help."}},{"id":"6173029936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"very bad 😍💖✨🥵🤪","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:27Z","userName":"Sister bear 😋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"my family downloaded this app because we LOVE our president. the app took exactly 4 months 2 days 11 hours 23 minutes and 2 seconds to download. while it was downloading my whole phone screen was a nude picture of our president. I couldn’t get out of it so i just had to leave it there until it was done downloading. when I got into the app i was showing my parents some of the news going on. when I clicked on recent news a giant barbie tornado spawned outside and tore our house down. we called the police but they said they wouldn’t come to us because they where busy throwing tear gas at people. after our house was torn down a bunch of little elf children came to us and started stabbing us with knifes. my parents died and my dog did. thankfully my brother and I got out of that situation. when we got out we attempted to forget about it but the elf’s cursed us with 2 extra toes and 2 extra fingers so I can never forget about it and I have extreme trauma. my story needs to be heard thank you."}},{"id":"6172183282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I almost got hacked","date":"2020-07-08T13:09:23Z","userName":"cat910","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The trump app sold my phone number!!!!!!!!!  As soon as you open the app you put your phone number in and they sold mine and will sell yours to. I wanted to show my support for our lovely orange president and so I downloaded the app. I figured it would also be a nice place to meet other fellow racists and pedos. But that’s besides the point. As soon as I downloaded it I saw the first person that fix the description of the ppl I thought I would see. It was our great president. Then his eyes started turning red though and he came to my house. He was angry and wanted to kill me because I was a black Gen Z. Once I told him I supported him to save my life he called me a liar. He said that I’m a liar because why would a person of color like him when he hates me. I started to get real sad when he said he hated me for my skin color. Then he left. After he left my phone bugged out and while I was on the Trump app my location got sent to me. Overall I hate this app I wish I could rate it negative stars for me and my tiktok homies💖✨✨"}},{"id":"6177415171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible app.","date":"2020-07-09T16:41:49Z","userName":"keris61538","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"as soon as i downloaded it I saw the ugliest creature i had EVER SEEN. I almost barfed because of it. not to get political or anything but i think the ugly creature was donald trump. also... i started getting these weird calls and texts from this random number saying that he wants me to come over so i looked it up and it was the presidents number! i got a little confused about why the president wants ME to come over but i went with it anyways. I took my cruise ship over to the white house and hopped in donald’s private olympic sized hot tub. it was so relaxing until he showed up. I mean it is his house but i told him to leave me alone. i’ve always wanted to live in the white house, just not with cheeto spray tan man. i think he got a little mad tho bc he said he was gonna kidnap my giraffe. idk how he even knew i had one but he did and he kidnapped it and it’s all bc i downloaded this app. so now he has my giraffe in captivity and this will happen to you if you download this app. i’m wishing the best for you and your animals!"}},{"id":"6176486021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP!!!
