I downloaded TOTALLY in support of the Trump re-election only to find that when I open the app all my N-95 masks starting to vanish into the air!! I quickly tried to get ahold of them but right when they were within my grasp they turned to dust🤬 Then HELLO Mr. COVID-19 who has been waiting outside my window with a sly grin on his face waiting for a moment to catch a slip and STRIKE, gets pulled in from the OUTSIDE with a very STRONG MAGNETIC FORCE when I look to see where it was coming from I COULDN’T BELIEVE MY EYES.

I would have deleted it but i wanted to support out president so i kept it. Biggest mistake of my life. The app wouldn’t let me open any other apps or have any apps running in the background and made my whole phone eventually crash. I had to buy a whole new phone because even after doing a factory reset it was unusable. If i could rate it zero stars i would.","title":"One of the worst working apps I’ve ever downloaded","isEdited":false,"userName":"penguinilinguini","rating":1}},{"id":"6172693235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:30:11Z","review":"When I opened the app, it gave me a screen of complete bs. If you want to spread your campaign, have your bs get to the point. Don’t ask for unnecessary info about someone. Anyways, when I opened the app, I put my phone number in and I was reading the words when my ✨c h a r g i n g ✨ phone died. I looked at my battery settings and this app took 100% of my battery. I was going to go to my friends house and watch his ✨a m a z i n g ✨ speeches but my phone died and I couldn’t go because I needed to charge my phone. This app took an hour of my time that I can’t get back and they just lost another trumper. I’m very busy so I can’t watch his speeches all day, ya know. Currently I am on my break. \n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","title":"App glitches and need improvements","isEdited":false,"userName":"𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚔𝚗𝚗𝚗𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚎","rating":1}},{"id":"6172687117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:28:27Z","review":"I tried typing in the app but it was so orange it gave me Cheeto fingers. Also, as soon as I opened the app, my ears were blasted with “horn of plenty” from the hunger games(Panem national anthem). I was soon swept into a virtual reaping and was chosen to be in the next hunger games😡. And they said my name wrong!😑😤. After getting into the arena I became a target with my Cheeto fingers. Despite the young ages, everybody soon got sick with covid-19 and died, but I wore a mask the entire time. So finally I won and was airlifted to trump tower where I was to meet trump. He smelled liked Rachel(the big fat nasty...). So in true shark tank fashion: for that reason, I’m out.","title":"Orange","isEdited":false,"userName":"Official_George_from_Peppa_Pig","rating":1}},{"id":"6172543771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:48:23Z","review":"Once I got this app, I lost half of my weight 😬 here’s why.

Once I opened the app, it would simply not load even though I have Wifi. It kept shutting off my phone and I never even got it to work. After a half hour of trying to get it to work, I finally deleted the app. I wish I had kept the 4 apps I had to delete to make space for this trash one.

Their brains are too small to know that you shouldn’t tear gas and shoot rubber bullets at the people you’re supposed to be protecting. But the orange, of course, does that anyways. Because the orange doesn’t care about what the people want. But luckily, gen z knows what to do! They made petitions and attended protests, they’re even trying to change the national anthem to “black and yellow” by wiz khalifa. Black,yellow,black,yellow,black,yellow,black,yellow, yellow, black!
