Firstly, to have access to the app, we are required to provide our phone number, name, email address, and zip code. This is a lot of information to collect for access to an app. That’s very concerning to me. \n\nThe app itself is just an ode to Trump. There’s no factual information or accurate news. It’s all propaganda. If you’re looking for an unbiased, reliable news source, DO NOT USE THIS APP. This app is 100% FAKE NEWS."}},{"id":"6173206514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"SO BAD","rating":1,"userName":"trumps daughter","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I wish I could give it a zero stars this app is so not good I do not like it.  it’s really horrible you don’t learn anything.

And he is letting this HAPPEN why do people like him he’s bad at his job and he says this is America and let’s make it great again. FIRST OFF, if you want to make America great then stop ICE from taking kids from their parents and instead make ICE helpers/ workers pay for what they have done to kids and parents. And help Yemen with their crisis and stop Korea from doing the Muslim concentration camps. THATS HOW YOU CAN MAKE IT A BIT BETTER BUT THEIR IS MORE YOU SHOULD FIX."}},{"id":"6173204093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP bc it represents the great orange","rating":1,"userName":"b/lake","date":"2020-07-08T18:05:58Z","isEdited":false,"review":"In Congress, July 4, 1776.\n\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."}},{"id":"6173203545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"god awful app","rating":1,"userName":"Daliyah4ever","date":"2020-07-08T18:05:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"H҉E҉☕️H̑̈Ȃ̈S̑̈💰N҈O҈💅🏻L⃠I⃠P⃠S⃠💋H͜͡O͜͡W͜͡🙈W̥ͦI̥ͦL̥ͦL̥ͦ🥰H̾E̾☕️G͎E͎T͎✨Ⓐ🥺KIᔕᔕ KIᔕᔕ💕"}}]}
