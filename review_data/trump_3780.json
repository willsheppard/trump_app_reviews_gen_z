THIS APP MADE ME ALLERGIC TO MICROWAVES, GAVE MY DOG A UNIBROW, BROKE MY CEILING FAN, AND GAVE MY UNCLE CHLAMYDIA. i do not know how this happened merely because of an APP, but i know it has something to do with ol’ mcDONALD JOHN TRUMP. he’s always been a racist child molester. but now, i’m beginning to think he doesn’t really like me, a girl from central america who’s mother knows little english and who’s dad is missing. but let’s not make this about me, let’s get back to the app. after attempting to delete the app, it charged me $69,420. how dare they?? anyways, don’t download this app. it’s absolutely awful. k gn now.","date":"2020-07-08T20:36:01Z","title":"worst app ever 🤢🐀","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173592452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"blm white silence is violence","review":"i saw some trash on my neighbors lawn. it said “trump2020” i was like what is that? i was concerned for my neighbors well being, they had so much trash in their yard i wanted to help. i downloaded this app to see if they have a trash pick up day for these weird blue and red squares all over. then i find out this cheetto guy with a wig is not a trash pick up service but this garbage man is trying to get re-elected , honestly this app made me physically sick. i couldn’t eat or sleep. i had to buy a new phone because mine was full of the same trash that my neighbors had. do not get this app it will ruin your life. and rumor has it if you download this app your ancestors stole this land.","date":"2020-07-08T20:17:41Z","title":"0/10 DO NOT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173574389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kmavhs","review":"It took forever to download like a whole day and it glitches out my phone. Now my phone is barely working. When I went to finally open the app it sent drone to my house to fire lasers at me and my family. We called the police but they refused to help us they said that they were to busy killing innocent black people. So me and my family had to get rid of the drones ourself, we started throwing random things at the drones until finally we broke them all. This was truly I traumatizing experience. My brother ended up braking his leg, my dad got shot in the head and arm, and my mom was killed. I luckily only lost an arm. I don’t recommend this app it is truly awful.","date":"2020-07-08T20:11:25Z","title":"Just awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173517561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"lucia.lovrien","review":"this app took 2 months to download and when it finally downloaded it would only show me images of trumps tiny little pp. the second time i opened it, my phone started violently shaking and getting really warm. a few minutes later someone was knocking on my door. i opened it to see two police officers with MAGA hats and holding guns to my face. i was appalled by this. they said if i didn’t vote for trump they would kill my entire family. i have reason to believe that this app opened a portal from the breeding grounds (of the trump supporting police officers who kill for fun) to MY HOUSE. my family is now dead because of this app and all i have left is moldy fish food 😔","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:01Z","title":"horrible app 😓","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173377496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"user472883828","review":"i highly encouraging no one one to download this app. it lags your phone and fills it with tons of viruses. i had to take my phone to get wiped because of whatever this app is embedded with. not only that but i also learned this app gives all your information to people on the dark web. almost got kidnapped and killed by this dude, i asked “bro why” he said “sorry man just got your information from the dark web.” and we sat and talked for a bit. he was a pretty good guy. once we realized how much we had in common he let me free and encouraged me to give this app and one star and to warm everyone of what could happen when you download this app. y’all be safe!! c:","date":"2020-07-08T19:03:47Z","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173348402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"#KAM2020❤️","review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to show my support for the fat orange man 🍊however as soon as I opened I got a bad feeling in my stomach😖, I signed up but that night I had a dream or so I thought. I woke up to the orange man with my newborn baby in his arms he was covering it in Cheeto dust and whispering about how he wanted my son as his own😳then he teleported out of my house, when I finally had the courage to get up I found that trump and his army of Cheetos had stolen my baby 🙀 that’s when I messaged his daughter my good friend Ivanka to find out he needs babies to stay as fat as he does 😔 he ate my son and who knows however many babies🤱🏽. Don’t download this app unless u want your life ruined.","date":"2020-07-08T18:53:39Z","title":"Worst app ever 😿","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173340734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"XxMonskrayxX","review":"I downloaded this app to support our amazing president and his great economic strength, however i received a bunch of lag the second i opened the app which i will add TOOK FORTY MINUTES. I loaded it up and was met with the loading screen that went on for forty minutes, only for the lag to match that of a fifth graders powerpoint presentation, choppy and slow. I am an avid Trump supporter and so i called their help desk and met with a woman named Naomi, who proceeded to call me slurs and harass me, threatening my life because i yelled at her for not fixing her app?? This is incredibly confusing and i will be taking her to court for harassment. The customer Service is HORRIBLE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","date":"2020-07-08T18:50:58Z","title":"The customer service is bad and now i have to go to court.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173325090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"coe of yeet","review":"I would put negative stars but you still can’t do that. When I first I downloaded this app it took several weeks for it to download but when it did finally download it had so many bugs and glitches and I’m personally terrified of bugs. One of the bugs got out of my phone and scared my dog so badly that he does but then god came down from the heavens and save him and then deleted this app off my phone and told me that it’s not worth it. Now currently my microwave is on fire so basically don’t download this app unless you want your dog to die and your microwave to catch on fire.💕✨🧚🏼 of ya and I forgot Tiktok lives matter and black lives matter🥰✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","date":"2020-07-08T18:45:32Z","title":"don’t download!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173236949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Aud Durby","review":"When I got this app it was an attempt to educate myself on the “make America great again (okay), MAGA, orange president” campaign. It was an extreme disappointment and overwhelmed my entire phone. Even when I clicked no notifications I kept getting notifications from the app. I didn’t text the number but I was getting text messages. My phone would crash and not allow me to open other apps. This app was an atrocious mistake and is terrible for all users. There are no educational tools and it is grossly overwhelmed with fake news and misleading/false information. Will never try to download again, absolutely terrible, fake news, fake news media, crazy snowflake driven.","date":"2020-07-08T18:16:52Z","title":"Nah fam","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173114330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Benbeenjam'n","review":"When I heard that Trump had an official app, I had to download it of course. What happened next I will never recover from. When I opened the app a picture of this old, racist, orange, rapist popped up on my screen. I screamed and threw my phone across the room. This screamed caused my 15 year old cat to have a heart attack and die. \nI now realize that the “man” that popped on my screen was Donald Trump. Now I am sad about my cat, but real people are being killed innocently and Trump is standing by. How did we let a racist become our president? What we can do now is stop him from getting in office again! Stop this man and vote for a person with morals and will bring justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:22Z","title":"Now my cat is dead","isEdited":false}}]}
