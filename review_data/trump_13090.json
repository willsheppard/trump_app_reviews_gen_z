I want to download this app to become more educated but everything on here is untrue. i’m so confused why they would choose to lie to the people of America! what could they possibly hope to gain? I would understand if money or power were involved (although that doesn’t make it right). I guess i’ll need to go somewhere else for my news. Thanks for nothing Trump!","userName":"Frog-boy","title":"**VERY** disappointed","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177363826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to get updates about the President’s candidacy. Instead, I started receiving personal death threats from Trump and his administration. When I told authorities, they called me a whiny poopoo pants and punched my grandmother in the face. When I got home there were thousands of Trump flags and signs across my lawn and every window was broken. Trump said I shouldn’t have used the app. Then I got possessed by the devil and started speaking a strange tongue for 3 days.","userName":"Teenager #6272892817","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:26:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177324978","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and my first thought was how did anyone approve of this. The design? Atrocious. Navigation? Gross. Responsive? Not at all. I am appalled by the sheer foolishness of this app and I wish I paid real money so I could demand a refund. I also wish I could give this app zero (0) stars but I can’t. Thanks for wasting space in my phone and in the app store. I hope that you realize how much time and money you wasted making this poo poo app.","userName":"Burple Nurple","title":"Worst app everrrr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:15:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177322615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has a poor layout, is super slow and has already has sucky ratings... I also think that one term was enough just by seeing this app and I’m not even a liberal. He is also trying to delete tiktok!! I think it’s no coincidence that when we screwed up his rally in Tulsa and spoke up against him using that platform, he decides to take it down, taking away the freedom of speech and the freedom to assemble peacefully. This is disgusting.","userName":"sophers8182","title":"Ew","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:15:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177297523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t even know why anyone would even download this app! The notifications never stop! I even turned off my notifications but they still sent me a thousand texts. I can’t fix it and it has consumed my phone. I’m pretty sure their are some viruses in this app too. My phone has been randomly glitching since I downloaded this app, so you should be careful. Just don’t waste your time in this app!","userName":"Noir Chaton","title":"~💗b a d💗~","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177267122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s my 102nd birthday and opened the app and the Trump logo started spinning. I immediately started have compulsive seizures. I was rushed to the hospital and after the doctors said I was ok and I was resting, I called Trump to tell him what he did and demand compensation. He showed up dressed as a Cheeto, spit in my face, sucked on my big toe, and ran out screaming. As he was running out he shoved a elderly patient down the stairs and screamed, “Bow down Hitler is back!!” ,Referring to himself. -10/10. Worst birthday ever.","userName":"Rose from the titanic","title":"WORST APP OF THE 2000’s","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:59:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177234402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app out of pure curiosity, and because I like to stay informed. It was a mess. It crashed nearly every time I tried to open it, glitched when it managed to stay open, and even made my phone crash a couple times. A good platform, especially in politics, is clear and organized, and much like the rest of his campaign, there is a distinct lack of those qualities. If I could rate it zero stars, I would.","userName":"sam01119","title":"Useless","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:49:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177216348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello, I thought it would be an amazing idea to just download the app to see what was going on but after the app downloaded (it took an entire day) my phone started crashing every time I opened the app. Random things then started to happen like my phone would randomly shut off and a message would appear saying “you have to vote for me” and that is why I’m giving it a one star.","userName":"vgd vhgxcg","title":"This app killed me😘","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:32Z","isEdited":false}}]}
