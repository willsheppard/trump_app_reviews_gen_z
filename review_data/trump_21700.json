Freedom of speech is allowed but some of the crude foul speech that comes with this app is astonishing. And on top of that I can’t believe the Apple team would allow such a terrible image and message to be spread through their store.","date":"2020-07-09T01:04:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Stop before you download"}},{"id":"6174349289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"karens unite","review":"all of the things that could possibly be wrong with the app is in the app! i guess the app didn’t like my latinx last name so they didn’t even let me enter until i faked being caucasian. gross, disgusting, racist! i want to speak to the manager of this app. my doctor also told me i have ptsd and am legally blind because of the opening picture in the app. how can they scar people’s eyes like that! the nerve of these people. this app should be deleted and if it isn’t i will call corporate and get everyone involved in this nasty operation fired. karens matter. delete it apple!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:54:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"terrible terrible terrible"}},{"id":"6174326506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"anonymous1234556789009827264","review":"Omg so storytime✨✨💕💞.

I tried relentlessly to close it, but every time I pushed the close button two more appeared- until my screen was half way filled with a 100 of his tiny wieners (life size of course). It is a disgrace that this pornographic app is not age restricted and anyone download it to see Mr. Donnie’s peepee. Disgrace I SAY!

I think this app should be removed from the App Store or even banned in just like tiktok (the best app in the world) was banned in the USA. Plus only Karen’s use this app so what’s the point?
