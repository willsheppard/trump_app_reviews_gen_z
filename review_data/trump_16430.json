However, upon opening the app, which took a very long time to download, I was hit by slow speeds. It is very difficult to navigate, and I am disappointed that daddy’s money couldn’t go into better programming.","userName":"Dojkm"}},{"id":"6177977316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of time","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:36:36Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this app in hopes of being updated daily on the president, but instead I was mobbed with notifications. Super annoying. I tried to turn them off but it took me half an hour to find the setting that allowed me to turn them off in the app. Also it’s biased. All I wanted was information, not opinions. I always liked twitter more anyway","userName":"moniwagns"}},{"id":"6177953180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Muffins in the freezer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:28:48Z","rating":1,"review":"I am completely disappointed with how this app turned out.

I don’t know why there’s an app on apple that obviously doesn’t work. I don’t recommend you download this app, it’s trash and not useful at all! My phone also froze with this app! If you don’t want any problems with your phone don’t download the app, apple should just take it down!!!","userName":"Ella2227"}}]}
