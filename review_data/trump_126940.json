It took FOREVER to download. Like what was this app doing while I waited for it to fully load?? Did it go back in time all the way to the year 1759, jump Benjamin Franklin, steal the key and kite, bring it back to modern times and conduct that sh*t all over again? And don’t even get me started on the format. The worlds were so little, so unreadable y’all might as well have put nothing at all. And how DARE you ask for MY PERSONAL information.... you want my phone number? My phone number for WHAT?!?  If I wanted to share my number so anybody could see and text me I would have gone to a str*p club and painted it on a respectable sex workers a**.  This app is useless, why even get this app if I need to put personal information when yOURE the one supposed to be giving the information? Horrible.

For me I’ve made so many amazing friends and the app literally saved my life like I was really depressed when I started making videos then people liked my twisted humor and somehow I got 40k people to follow me and they have been the most supportive people and they are my motivation to keep living. please don’t take this away.","date":"2020-07-09T19:54:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s not over without a fight."}},{"id":"6178032344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trAamp2020","review":"i had heard from my friend how good this app was, and i was super excited to download it! unfortunately, it was absolute trash.  -100/10","date":"2020-07-09T19:54:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"so disappointed!!! 😢😢😭😭"}},{"id":"6178032285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nataliaaa2204","review":"Oh yeah \nCome on \n\nYou get the limo out front \nHottest styles, every shoe, every color \n\nYeah, when you're famous it can be kinda fun \nIt's really you but no one ever discovers \n\nIn some ways you're just like all your friends \nBut on stage you're a star \n\nYou get the best of both worlds \nChill it out, take it slow \nThen you rock out the show \n\nYou get the best of both worlds \nMix it all together and you know that it's the best of both worlds \n\nThe best of both worlds \n\nYou go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?) \nHear your songs on the radio \nLivin' two lives is a little weird \nBut school's cool cause nobody knows \n\nYeah you get to be a small town girl \nBut big time when you play your guitar \n\nYou get the best of both worlds \nChill it out, take it slow \nThen you rock out the show \n\nYou get the best of both worlds \nMix it all together and you know that it's the best of both\nYou know the best of both worlds \n\nPictures and autographs \nYou get your face in all the magazines \nThe best part is that you get to be who ever you wanna be \n\n(Best!

Donald J. Tump aka Oompaloompa  man, is a racist egotistical misogynistic lying a**hole with no shred of empathy for the people of this country or any people at all. I can’t express how much I can’t wait for him to get the hell out of office come November (hopefully sooner)... He is NOT a leader. He is rotten to the core. Thank you for running America to the ground Trump!","date":"2020-07-09T19:54:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"For the orange guy in the red hat☺️"}}]}
