I was hoping to learn more about our President Trump but the app kept asking for too much personal information. Information we do not want to give away for example where we live in a ZIP Code. In fact this app took so long to download. I was really hoping for a better quality. This was just horrible👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T16:40:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🧚fairy from tikity tokity🧚✨","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6172930621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Here i was on a sight seeing morning when i get a notification from my favorite app. Not only do i love supporting trump i love to attend his rallys. So when i saw i got a message from his app i was so excited. I opened the app and it just started saying “boner alert” “boner alert” i was so confused. Quickly i try to exit the app so i don’t get beat with the vacuum wire. But when i tried to leave it was flashing a horrid picture of my favorite president🥕 oops wrong emoji i meant😍 see look the app messing with me again! Anyways let me get back to the story, so when i see his carrot flashing on my screen!!! i throw my phone because i felt like i was invading my dear presidents privacy😔Then i kept getting more and more notifications from the app and made my phone float and it just kept buzzing making it go higher and higher eventually hitting my fan. I try to go reach for it but it’s too late my fan which is barely hanging on by a nail snaps in half!! Making my third floor apartment fall all the way to the earths crust! There i am on my bed protecting me from all the molten lava. When i see my disgraceful phone fall from the sky continuing to show that horrid image of my dear president. The earth was not happy about that! lemme tell you! IT SCREAMS AT ME “HOW DARE YOU BRING THAT TREACHERY DOWN HERE” Causing it to ERUPT all over my favorite bed! there i am trying to escape yelling for help when i see this black figure.. ITS EX PRESIDENT OBAMA he then picks me up from the erupting crust and saves my life!!😱 He then buys me A THREE STORY HOUSE SINCE MY APARTMENT GOT DESTROYED!!! But that’s just the start a couple weeks after i move in my fridge opens and i hear a drawer open as well. I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES 👀 IT WAS ASSASSIN CARROTS!!!! How dare my dear president send his army to come and attack me in my own home!!! while i run for my life going through each floor in the house mr.Obama graciously bought for me i hear a knock at my door... i run to go open it and it’s BERNIE SANDERS!!!!! He takes out his “vote for bernie” stickers from the election and THROWS THEM ON THE CARROTS. Making them good carrots🥰But i just can’t believe all this occurred cuz of an app shameful!😡","date":"2020-07-08T16:39:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sugar daddys needed😩","title":"Shameful"}},{"id":"6172927855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"as soon as the app was downloaded my phone begin to overheat and produce a horrible smell that attracted many wild boars.
