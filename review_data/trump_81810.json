I have to say, though, he has failed me with this app... The spinning T when you first download and open the app made me nauseous. The font made my heart skip a beat and my pulse wallow in pain. Painful is the realization that I couldn’t click the phone number button. I wanted to give the leader my number so badly, and I wanted to let my voice be heard. My voice was outnumbered by the voices in my head telling me, “Please remember what you first saw when you opened the app,” that dreadful design. I could reminisce on the purpose of the app, on the thought put into making it, but no, this small detail turned me off so badly I just had to write this review. Normally I am so turned on by the thought of Trumpy. 😫😖 Maybe in future updates you can add an alternative look to the app, like an upside down T instead of a spinning one, because when I think of my president I think of things similar to the shape of a T being upside down. Or maybe instead of a photo of the president at the start you could use a photo of his most notable accomplishment during his presidency: children held forcefully at the border, an act of which has been classified by Holocaust survivors & historical professionals in literal terms as a concentration camp. ( Only kidding, stupid liberal propaganda! 😂) It helps those that download the app to understand what they are getting into... These are some of my suggestions, and I wholeheartedly hope your team takes them into consideration. \n\nIf President Trump reads this, thank you for all you have done. I am truly sorry I have to give this app one star. I love you. I love your son. I love America. I love the Capital. God Bless ✝️"}},{"id":"6076505425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"SO BAD","userName":"belladonna3.0","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-14T23:08:03Z","review":"It has so many ads.
