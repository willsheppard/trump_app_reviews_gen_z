However, as soon as I had downloaded this app, I notice many flaws. First off, over a collected small amount of time of using the app I was asked for, in total, my Name, Username, Password, Email, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, and Employment Description. I would like to know why I had to enter my entire identity, just to be informed on President Trump’s campaign ideas. Seems very shady to me... Also, after this I had decided to read through all of the terms of conditions of use, as I wanted to know what kind of shady business this app was doing with my identity. Then I read the following quote: “ PLEASE READ THESE PROGRAM TERMS BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDE A BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE, A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS, AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. BY ENROLLING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE PROGRAM TERMS.” This is beyond infuriating. On the home screen, they never once begged you to read the terms of conditions, as your legal rights can be affected. They only asked for you identity first, which caused me to click on the measly link that simply read, “Terms of Use”. This is revolting. I will still of course support my President, as I don’t believe this carelessness and idiocy of an app was his doing. However, I beg of the Apple Store to please, please, remove this app. It only makes President Trump look bad, by stealing your information, and barely telling you what they are doing with it. This whole app has a very concerning shady-ness applied to it, that I don’t want to be connected with President Trump’s Campaign. Not to mention, this review had only talked about the Privacy Information, and how they didn’t ensure to tell you in a good, upfront way of what they’re doing with your submitted privacy. I had talked nothing about other issues that this app faces, such as crashing my phone, miss information or mis leading information about the President’s campaign, and also things like obnoxious, hard to read fonts, or photos that don’t accurately portray  President Trump’s supporters. This app is nothing but a shady money grab designed to give out misleading information, in a desperate attempt to make President Trump look bad. Us Republicans need to stick together, and unite. The first step is to abolish this app, and replace it with a better one that accurately shows  Republicanism, with correct information about Trump’s Campaign.","title":"This app is terrible, very unprofessional."}},{"id":"6178378404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:56:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Luna_Berries","review":"IT TOOK 1062539 DAYS FOR IT TO DOWNLOAD AND THEN SUDDENLY MY APP CRASHED AND BLEW ITSELF UP!

However, as I started receiving about 150 notifications per day telling me which rallies to sign up for, and which foundations to donate to, I really began to see what it was like to be a true American patriot.after a few weeks of this subtle brainwash, I linked my paypal account to directly deposit every paycheck from work into Trumps charity foundation.... and I am PLEASED!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I get premium magazine subscriptions and discounts to his merch store (I don’t know why the website has been slow recently), AND I get free posters. NOW, they’re in every room of my house, but I’m not even worried about taking them down eventually because I’m getting evicted next week because I couldn’t pay rent... trump needs my money more than I do!! \nNot that my house is painted LIKE THE MERICAN FLAG like the true patriot I am, I’ve started to grow some negative attention from my neighbors. I keep getting notifications on my phone even when it’s turned off, and I tried breaking it with a hammer.... I am so tired of those dang notification sounds on my phone that I use some dynamite my cousin Mose lent me to blow up my phone to finally stop it all.... \nprobably shouldn’t have done it in my house....💥💥💥","title":"I went a little too far..."}},{"id":"6178376564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:56:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🧚🏻 acab ✨","review":"absolutely hate this app. piloting kids in cages. falsifying covid results. openly supports rape. absolutely horrible service. oink oink","title":"can’t stop us all"}},{"id":"6178376579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:56:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🧚🏾GEN Z🥰💅🏾","review":"This app was not as good as I thought it would be.
