The app didn’t work AT ALL. The quality is terrible and so is the marketing.

I downloaded this app out of respect for our President however shortly after my phone began GLITCHING. I wanted to trust our president but the makers of the app CLEARLY FAILED. There were all kinds of security issues and all kinds of negative energy. The app and its contents did not feel like a safe space for our democracy. DISGUSTING. My phone storage is completely full because of it.

But when I got it, all I saw was a Cheeto staring at me, it was haunting. I tried to get off the app, but instead the head of our dear president popped up in my phone and started multiple speeches that sounded like a kindergartner wrote them. I finally managed to escape the curse by resting my phone, but I still feel his presence lurking around, like he’s somewhere in the shadows.","userName":"Thatrandomperson265","title":"Congrats on #1! 🧚💕✨As in, 1 Star🙈💕🧚✨"}}]}
