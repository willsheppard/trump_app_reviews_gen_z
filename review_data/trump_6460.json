I am genuinely a person who adores and glorifies this Cheeto man. When downloading this app, my phone immediately crashed and started smoking. After my phone didn’t turn on for two days, I called apple and they send me a replacement phone. Come to find out this app was the cause of the whole conundrum. This app stole all my information and sold it to a person in Massachusetts where he is using my identity to buy cantaloupes. I am beyond furious. Avoid this app at all costs."}},{"id":"6177457837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😜😊💕Hideous 😌🥰✨","userName":"Flabby Greg","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:54:42Z","review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of supporting the LOOVELY carrot demon ~ our president ~ Donald😌💕\nUpon opening the app, I was APPALLED at the spam emails that began pouring and I mean GUSHING, STAMPEDING if you will, into my inbox. I shrugged it off and trundled off to bed 😴🥞 That night, at about 4:02 am, Donald sent seven of his helicopters 🚁 to kidnap me. They landed on the roof of my house and a gaggle of trump robots strangled me and shoved me in Melania’s handbag. And let me tell you it stank it there like Horrific😓 REVOLTING 🤮 pig brains... I am writing this review from inside of one of Trump’s tiny hands; he carries me around wherever he goes, I hope to be let free someday 😔"}},{"id":"6177447127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"ROBLOX REEEEEE","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:26Z","review":"This app is terrible it took my tv and now I can’t watch bubble guppies it also glitches very badly and makes my WiFi\nSo slow and my mom asks why the internet is slow and I always say i don’t know. I thought this would be the best app ever \nTo keep me updated with our president but nooooo it makes everything slow and when I try to do something it makes me glitch like when I get a bowl of cereal I glitch and I drop the bowl and then I can’t have cereal now I have no more bowls and my mom is mad at me so DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!\nthank you byeeeeee"}},{"id":"6177359096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"so disappointed","userName":"Elena Daves","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:25:23Z","review":"I was so excited to buy this app, thinking it would be a live show of everything going on in the white house. But APPARENTLY donald trump wants to make America a reality tv show WITHOUT the actual broadcasting. It was so incredibly disappointing. After noticing i actually MET with donald himself who proceeded to punch my dog and then do the renegade over his corpse. Thank god Trumpy boy is dead now or will be by august 27th. I sincerely hope now that he is or will be dead we can stop being a fascist state that is censoring the media (like tik tok)  \nanyway, i don’t recommend this app 💞💝💕"}},{"id":"6177208750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Unsafe!!","userName":"Luvlyliv","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:22Z","review":"This app triggered my PTSD. As soon as I opened the Trump 2020 App, I was immediately asked for my phone number from with a picture of an old crusty man in the background. This brought me back to an awful period in my life of sick old men hitting on me. I instantly broke down in tears and then proceeded to experience awful hallucinations of the same old man in the picture destroying our country with his racist, homophobic, cruel, and selfish behavior. This was not an okay experience and you should delete this app immediately because of the harm it has caused me and my family."}},{"id":"6177203356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m scared for life","userName":"im so smart :)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:40:49Z","review":"I thought it would be awesome to get this app and support our ✨racist✨ presidential human in this country. But then as soon as I opened it up there was a huge moo moo! It had red scares all over and it said to me in these exact words “vote for trump or I’m sending my biggest ompilipa ompilpa to your house and your being dead by dawn!” I was so scared I collected it’s IP address and showed it to the cops and then they wiped all my data! This app is terrible and should be taken down immediately. I now kidnapped this so called ompililpa and I have NO IDEA what to do with it. Any ideas?"}},{"id":"6177183102","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Glitchy","userName":"troll heart","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:06Z","review":"I know there’s some trend going around where people are supposed to leave a bad review about this app but this ones true. I downloaded this app to support the great leader ⭐️Donald Trump ⭐️ and see what I could do to help his campaign for the next term but when I downloaded this app it was really glitchy it said that he wanted to take tiktok down because safety reasons and how he just didn’t care about that women in the military and honestly those things are kinda true. \n😉 I don’t recommend people to download this app and make bad reviews"}},{"id":"6177135411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Extremely disappointed","userName":"lord bibble","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:21:44Z","review":"in the beginning I was really hopeful for this app. I figured it would be the perfect way to stay up to date with events and poll numbers, however, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he’s ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."}},{"id":"6177132042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Unnecessary overall","userName":"N1kk19","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:20:49Z","review":"Personally just downloaded the app to see what he had in store for us if he were to be re-elected. On top of taking forever to download the first thing I had to do was put in my phone number which I would have rather had a welcome message as the first thing I see when it is supposed to be an app to help him gain more followers. There were many other things I could comment on but you just have to see for yourself and many of my complaints are most likely personal problems."}},{"id":"6177116649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrendous","userName":"PattyKarl","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:16:35Z","review":"I have never been more disappointed with an app, I got this expecting it to be easy to navigate so that I wouldn’t have to call up my grandkids to explain but i still had to take the time out of my day to bother those kids. This app doesn’t give me the information I need, it’s just a bunch of propaganda and pointless fluff to detract from what the citizens of this fine country want to know. I will NEVER be willing to get this app or an app like this again! It’s an embarrassment on the apple store and needs to be removed."}}]}
