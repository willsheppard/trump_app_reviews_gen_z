The FIRST thing that pops up on the app is several links that offer the same “hair plug” treatments that our PRESIDENT uses... Ain’t nobody want that nasty lookin noodle hair 🤮. Then the app proceeds to book a spray tan appointment for me that I don’t want!!! The biggest problem though.... it set the skin color to ORANGE and I’m not talking no pretty early sunset orange, nah I’m talking that nasty month old grapefruit you got laying in the back of your fridge kinda orange.

It takes forever to get to things and is not organized well at all. I have no idea how to get to things and it doesn’t tell you either. I don’t get how an app could be so bad. And not to mention everytime I see a person pop up from it it’s just a fat orange 🍊it doesn’t even make sense. Who ever made this app doesn’t need to be organizing things or make decisions on how things should be done AT ALL.","date":"2020-07-08T21:12:24Z","userName":"🙃😗🤣☺️😇🥰🥳"}},{"id":"6173720068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I had my hopes up too high 😪","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app I had my hopes up too high. As soon as it finished downloading my phone felt like it was corrupting my hands. I went to wash them because maybe they had Corona on them. Picked up my phone again and boom! The feeling was back! I felt my vocabulary drifting away into the dark and mysterious void. It didn’t feel like it was going to return to me either! The only way of getting rid of this curse on my phone was by deleting it.","date":"2020-07-08T21:03:32Z","userName":"Mrs. Baseballbat"}},{"id":"6173699694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I don’t like this app HEYy hh feelkngs","rating":1,"review":"Hi everyone today I talk about my sad story when I download app. I was download app and the Trump also came to my house after I press his rally ticket cmaping 😉😉✨✨and I was sleeping in my bed and a cockrach witb irange skin came to me and told me to voying for trump😣😣😑🛏🛏🛏😭😭😭I was so sad and I crying so hard sometimes because I’m so sad about how he is bulky and cockrach not leave me alone😈😈😈I downlaod this app to support good trump praise 🍊🍊🍊🍊man but I was very upset by the result so I have to give one star to bad app for hurting my feelings🍊🍊🍊🍓🍓","date":"2020-07-08T20:56:03Z","userName":"Oeange man"}},{"id":"6173674043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to see what all the fuss was about and was completely shook !

One add was about a naked woman by the of Stormy Daniels..? Either way my mother walked in and saw the screen, thought I PURPOSELY looked up inappropriate content, and kicked me out of the house.

Just because a bunch of children managed to troll you with an app doesn’t mean you get rid of the app because we don’t go down without a fight. Your taking away our rights day after day. This is taking away our first amendment right, freedom of speech, press, petition, assembly, and religion. ever since he has come into office he has been nothing more of a disgrace to this country i have to call my home.","date":"2020-07-08T20:16:12Z","userName":"🖕🏿🖕🏾🖕🏽🖕🏼🖕🏻Trump"}}]}
