But I did indeed hate the app it was taking up my storage and data and I did not like that.

How awful!!!! I couldn’t believe some of the things I was seeing- they couldn’t possibly be true! This entire app is a disgrace to the App Store and to REAL apps. Now I know that all apps matter but this one obviously DOESNT.

It said that trump is for women but I recall he said grab them by the 🐱. Which I find disgusting . I also  learned that he is racist , sexist , homophobia and xenophobic . Also the app is built wrong and showed a picture of a sex offender which i found to be triggering . DONT GET THIS APP .","rating":1}},{"id":"6178165444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨Not the right T app✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"CreativeNotes","date":"2020-07-09T20:38:57Z","review":"I was looking for Tik Tok because I heard it was being banned.

Really bad quality and trash. Crashed so many things. Also I got it because I wanted to know what’s up with our disgusting orange 𝙁𝘼𝙆𝙀 hair 𝙊𝙇𝘿  𝘼𝙎𝙎 president. But there wasn’t anything Interesting.
