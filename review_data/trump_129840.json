It’s glitches multiple times, and I keep having to reenter personal info, like my phone # and my zip code, even my address! I will be deleting the app soon, and hopefully my phone will be up and running again. This app has caused nothing but harm, and I would advise everyone to not download it. It also asked me to donate money to the Trump campaign, which I gladly did, but I had to enter my card info. Since then, I have gotten many alerts of money being drawn from my account. I was confused at first, then realized all the weird stuff that’s happened since i downloaded the app, and figured that was the only explanation. I’ve lost a good amount of money, and had to close my account as a result. Please do not download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T03:45:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trumplover223"}},{"id":"6174928631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"-19383889992929/5 stars, don’t recommend.","review":"Disgusting.

I tried to communicate but they didn’t say anything they only stared I asked them if they needed help, no response. So I said whatever and went to bed. I woke up in the morning to be surprised with carrots! They had dumped millions of carrots all over my house claiming “your soul needs to be cleansed”, “bathe”, “eat the carrots. NOW!l” So I did the only reasonable thing and ate the carrots, ALL of them. They congratulated me and left my home. I thought it was over, until...... The next day is they brought me gorilla glue and told me if I didn’t swallow all of the gorilla glue they would turn me into a tortilla chip and eat me alive, so of course I swallowed the gorilla glue. BUT THEY FOOLED ME!!! I still turned into a tortilla chip! Im begging them for hands but they made me bathe myself in salsa and start twerking but of course I couldn’t twerk because I was a tortilla chip and my flat ass can’t twerk! I pleaded for them to turn me into a human but they won’t do it! They keep threatening to feed me to a woman named Miss Keisha but I thought she was dead so now I don’t know what to do I’m trying to learn how to twerk but it’s hard to find twerking videos for tortilla chips so please if someone could please help me!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"just a critic (not)"}},{"id":"6174926113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app I’ve ever had","review":"This app gave my brand new iphone a virus and now it’s completely broken. 600 dollars to waste cause you this stupid spray tan orange lookin ass’ app","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:26Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Laurenjohnnson"}},{"id":"6174925938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","review":"Everything is wrong with this app. Just no❤️.  1863719% of the time there is a glitch that makes me have a seizure.

Immediately after downloading the app my whole phone shut down. I couldn’t get it to turn back on until I went to Best Buy for help. When I was finally able to open my phone I got an email from my bank warning me that suspicious activity had been detected from my credit card number. Over $5000 dollars had been spent at FemBoy Hooters. All of the personal information saved on my phone was stolen, including my social security number and all of my passwords. In addition to this every other app was deleted from my phone and my home screen photo was replaced with a photo of trump wearing a crown. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP!
