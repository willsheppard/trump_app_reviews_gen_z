I am not a Trump Supporter, quite the opposite actually (I’m a Bernie Bro). This app is so difficult to navigate and it just doesn’t make sense, if I’m being completely honest. I swear I lost a few brain cells trying to use this app. Even just looking at the icon for the app gives me a RAGING headache. I absolutely, positively, 10000%, do not recommend this app to ANYBODY, not even Trump Supporters! This app is wack as heck and I feel like I need to go back through the entire school system just to regain the brain cells I lost from using it. Anyways, stan Nicki and Bernie 🥰✨🧚","title":"Trash App!","isEdited":false,"userName":"For the Girls and the Gays","date":"2020-07-09T15:00:45Z"}},{"id":"6177058613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So I got the app cause I was interested in it but the page won’t load it’s to slow or it would kick me out and I would have to but my username and password again also I don’t know why we have to get points.
