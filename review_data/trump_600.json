I downloaded this app for fun and after going through the app for a couple minutes, I heard a knock on my door. I looked through the peep hole to see this strange orange 🍊 figure. I was horrified!!! Only my grandma 👵 was home with me at the time and I didn’t know what to do. The door was locked so I ran to my grandma and took her to hide in my closet. I called the police 🚔 and they asked me where I was hiding so I told them. They then proceeded to hang up on me and next thing I know, the orange figure was walking towards my closet. It opened my closet and body slammed my grandma onto the floor. I was crying 😭 so hard and at that moment, I knew I was next. It grabbed me by the head and smashed my head on the window. It then said that I didn’t belong in America and had to go back to my “home country.” It proceeded to fling my body out the window and “back to home country.” As you all probably know, I have been reincarnated as a hippo to write this review. I’m afraid to go back to America and I had to let you all know the dangers of this app. 😤","rating":1,"userName":"Heeehawwz","date":"2020-07-08T22:29:44Z"}},{"id":"6173648968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT GET HE WILL SHOW UP IN YOUR DREAMS","isEdited":false,"review":"i wanted to download this app to give this teeny weeny ding dong guy some compliments😍bUTT it kept crashing even tho we have good wifi? and my phone all of a sudden kept on shutting down every few seconds i’m on this app🤬🤬. and now all  of a sudden i keep getting g advertisements even tho i don’t even hs e the app open???? is there a virus???? this app absolutely should NOT be available to download. and even with our data it doesn’t work. and this app apparently gives you like night mares???? all of a sudden after i downloaded this i started seeing this CHEETO literally EVERYWHERE. he showed in my dream in SPEEDOS w a bag of cheetos and said “y u crying babygurl ?” DAWG WHEN I TELL TOU I ACREAMED SO LOUDLY🤬🤬🤬🤬can y’all facetune him a lil so his face isn’t to shocking to see😔😔 i KNOWWW y’all be cropping him out of certain photos so of COURSE y’all can smooth out his orange face a lil. and maybe photoshop his chin too. don’t get me wrong he doesn’t look bad but he could b much better. anyways it would be nice if y’all DELETE this app off the app store THANK YOU MWAH🧚🏼\u200D♀️😍","rating":1,"userName":"ch ngyn","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:52Z"}},{"id":"6173521522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is a terrible app","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is so bad once I opened it I became a redneck and became white I could not believe it I cried cause I don’t wanna be white then I did not think it could get worse but then a KAREN appears like outta no were and hands me a all lives matter shirt I did not want it but she told me to take it but then before I could say no she shoved me in her “mini van” and starts playing kids bop my ears started to bleed once we got in her house she tuned the tv and it.

After I clicked “get”, it had me verify my thumbprint 12 times. I had never seen this problem before. Then, when it finally worked, it took almost forty-five minutes to download, despite the good internet in my apartment, and all of my other apps and games  shut down during the process. When I could finally open the app, the interface was like a website in the early nineties. The text was small and hard to read, and the whole thing was just hideous. Not to mention as soon as it opened it started to play a quiet little screeching sound that made all of my poor cats convulse on the floor. So I exited out of the app, but the sound kept going. My cats are currently twisting around the floor screaming. And now I can’t delete the app, so I suppose that my cats will be this way forever. Thanks a lot, president Dump!\n\n- Genivive Zimbabwe","rating":1,"userName":"annukkapr","date":"2020-07-08T18:31:26Z"}},{"id":"6173215048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"You’ll regret downloading this","isEdited":false,"review":"Firstly, I would like to start off with the fact that I found the app difficult to download. My phone has plenty of space, but every time I went on it, it would crash. Secondly, I’m not sure if anyone else had this problem, but there were way to many ads. Not to mention ads that should not have be advertised, if you know what I mean. I could barely go on it without it causing my phone to break down, and mind you, my phone is brand new. I may not be as tech savvy as some of the younger people, but at least I know how an app works, and this is just not it. A terrible idea, really, for our President to make an app when he is threatened by the younger generation and their use of social media and such. Anyways, my experience with this app has been horrid, and no one should have to go through this much frustration downloading an app. Please heed my advice, as it is important Apple realizes that this app may not be the best idea for any of us. With love, your favorite grandma from the south❤️","rating":1,"userName":"SquiffyNarwal","date":"2020-07-08T18:09:39Z"}},{"id":"6173184872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"review":"this is the worst app made EVER!!! the app took weeks to download an i was incapable of doing anything else while waiting. when launching the app it played music and that music brought many cockroaches!!! and i have a terrible fear of bugs. the roaches then proceeded to sacrifice my cat to president as my whole family watched crying. they then burnt my dead cat and sprinkled his ashes in various places around the house. the roaches then called to their rat friends who also invaded our home and ate every last drop of our food and due to the corona virus every single grocery store is closed and we are out of food and will starve to death. we tried to call the police and when the came the told us they would not help us even though we are a white conservative family. but the said they had more important thing to do like kill black people and get away with it because we are above the law. so i did the only thing a person would do in that moment and went back into the app to look for a reverse button. {repost}","rating":1,"userName":"dgualsbdsowlebue","date":"2020-07-08T17:59:44Z"}},{"id":"6172925356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not at all Scrumdiddlyumptious😔","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to receive future updates and and new information about our racist, cheeto lookin, pedo- I mean great president and continue to follow the journey to his second term in office. But man was it a BAD idea. First off, he asked for my number and now I’m continuing to get weird spam calls and texts from the trump campaign. I didn’t give you permission to that bro..... not very groovy 🙁. Secondly, the app is continuing to crash and glitching to horrifying pictures of our President. I’ve seen his wee wee 😭, absolutely disgusting (but there’s not that much there). I might take him up on his advice and start injecting my eyes with bleach. Thirdly, I’m 100% convinced that the trump administration is watching me through my phone now😳, the camera will randomly turn red and I think that’s the little guy just checking back in one me 😰. And to top it all off I have started noticing orange hand prints on my window, so I guess he’s watching me while I sleep as well and it’s honestly not cool. This is all the stupid app’s fault. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"userName":"Olive Bradsom","date":"2020-07-08T16:38:10Z"}},{"id":"6172500521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download!!!!","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever gotten, it took 7 hours to download! I wanted to see what our president was planning on doing but as soon as I opened the app an orange man appeared on the screen and demonic music started playing and my screen started flashing. The music and lights continued for 30 minutes until the president himself started saying that black people are below us and the pictures of all the women he has sexually assaulted and raped flew across the screen and the president was saying why he raped them and how he paid them all not to tell. I showed my mother what was happening and she had a stroke! The flashing lights caused the stroke and the demonic music made it worse! As she was having a seizure, all the mice and squirrels in a 5 mile radius came flooding into my home, they stared to bite my mother as she was having a seizure and I am mortified. This is outrageous, me and my entire family are going to need years and years of therapy after this! Needless to say I will never download on other app that is from or supports the president.","rating":1,"userName":"katchick_101","date":"2020-07-08T14:36:09Z"}},{"id":"6177565364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"💀 CAUSED MY DEATH 💀","isEdited":false,"review":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥰✨If I could give this app -5 stars, I would. First of all, this took forever to download; it took a year which it ridiculous. When it finally did download, I saw the face of a disgusting human being. (Sorry if I offended any humans. We don’t claim him.) The orange Cheeto with a fake spray tan from bootleg WalMart is the first thing you see. 🤢 🤮 That’s beyond gross. Moving on, the app requires my phone number. Excuse me. I am not an adult yet, so that is another felony you have committed. 👮🏽\u200D♀️👩🏽\u200D⚖️ This app is so bad that I fell off the Empire State Building and into a landfill dump. I died but the smell brought me back to life. When I escaped with my life, I continued on the app to see writing. It was far too big to read. Like someone’s ego. 🙊 More importantly, the app keeps on crashing. Like how am I supposed to stay updated on the politics. Save yourself before it is too late. My mental health is beyond recovery. Not even therapy will help me. Thank you for your time, but I must bleach my eyes now. I would very much love to forget what I just saw. ✨🥰🧚🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1,"userName":"A Female Human Directioner","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:40Z"}},{"id":"6177392649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is bad","isEdited":false,"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head That I can't keep out Got me singin' like Na na na na everyday It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay Shawty's like a melody in my head That I can't keep out Got me singin' like Na na na na everyday It's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay) Hey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober I got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover On my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga So down on the line make me want a cold soda Hey baby be my radio Hear you everywhere I go Music in my head Know your melody in every note Girl you incredible Make yourself available Na na na na That tune so exceptional Sexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready We can make plans get body stand if you let me Girl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me I ain't a fight she gon arrest me Shawty's like a melody in my head That I can't keep out Got me singin' like Na na na na everyday It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay Shawty's like a melody in my head That I can't keep out Got me singin' like Na na na na everyday It's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","rating":1,"userName":"A concered stay at home mom","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:23Z"}}]}
