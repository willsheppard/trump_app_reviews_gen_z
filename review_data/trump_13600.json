Then when I allowed notifications weird men came into my home and ripped me away from my family. This app has hurt me deeply, I don’t know if I’ll ever see my loved ones again. And it’s all bc of this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:27:53Z"}},{"id":"6175246338","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sadly.","userName":"minielux","rating":1,"review":"Honestly not one of the best apps. I am a trump fan. However, I might say that this app did not satisfy my needs and it was not my expectations!!! I thought this app was definitely going to be number 1! Unfortunately, when I downloaded this app, it was not when I expected. Release a different app with more statistics and information and I will reconsider. Be smarter Donald Trump. I am sorry but I can not side with you on this one! Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:30:09Z"}},{"id":"6175213817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"See it’s a funny story","userName":"chewychubacameow","rating":1,"review":"I happen to be browsing the “interwebs” and found that there was this app. I gave it a download as the kids say these days and my phone exploded then reconstructed itself saying to leave a comment before my inevitable death. Thanos then ran in and said “I’m your friendly neighborhood spider” and ate my all of the lightbulbs in my house!!! I don’t know how but it happened I swear! I then felt the earth shake from his \ndevastating snap. 🐒💩🤡🤡🤡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:18:15Z"}},{"id":"6175193805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app EVER","userName":"Hannah2456","rating":1,"review":"my phone was perfectly functioning before i downloaded this. next thing you know, within 10 minutes, it keeps crashing all my apps, glitching, opening random apps, etc; also TOO MANY NOTIFICATIONS! i get almost 30 or MORE a day just from this app ALONE! i would NOT recommend this app to ANYONE! i hope that this app gets fixed SOON, if not, might as well just remove the whole thing 😔💅✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:11:02Z"}},{"id":"6175186446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app needs work","userName":"Karen(good side)","rating":1,"review":"This app is so extremely confusing!!! Filled with so much nonsense it’s not even funny anymore! Half of the time I’m wicked confused also there are so many glitches it’s crazy! The trash that is in this app in ASTRONOMICAL!

But it lagged so bad that I think my phone is going to break. There’s only one thing that’s would be best for this app and it’s not to have it. Many people also agree with me.  It’s made my life so bad now because I keep getting scammed from it.  It also stole my dog because I can’t find it anywhere and I only keep it in the house. I want my dog back.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:48:45Z"}},{"id":"6175122354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad","userName":"Cool Macana","rating":1,"review":"This app will make your phone glitch and shut down so that the radical right can go through your social media and brainwash you people to push their political agenda. Fake news, wouldn’t recommend. 0/5 stars if I could. \n\nPS: the app is ver much racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist etc and will steal your puppies and turn your microwaves into spies for the government. It will track you and send messages to the birds. \n\nPPS: eat the rich","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:46:31Z"}},{"id":"6175107304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢","userName":"Valeria✨😳","rating":1,"review":"This is reaaaaaally an atrocity of an app. I can’t believe someone would truly ever not be disgusted by the first thing to see whenever you open the app. A disgusting orange transphobic, xenophobic, racist, white supremacist. I have never felt such utter repulsion upon seeing an image. I have emetophobia, and throwing up after seeing him was NOT GOOD for me.🤩✨💅If you decide to download, make sure it’s to leave a nasty review, and then take the app off your phone(For personal health).","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:33Z"}},{"id":"6175086318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISAPPOINTED!!","userName":"Yo, ?","rating":1,"review":"As a God fearing, America loving Trump republican, I was so happy to see this app (my daughter Hayleigh showed me how!) However, I was disappointed to see how terrible it was!!! After all that I have done, I, Cathy, and truly upset to see how my phone, which is infested with 5g aka the reason for this COVID CRAP, glitched and broke right after getting my cell phone number! Now I keep getting messages from President Trump which is AMAZING! But I have limited minutes!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:34:46Z"}}]}
