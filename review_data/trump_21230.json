Don’t spend one ounce of your time attempting to download this God-forsaken app!! To start off, this app is filled with INACCURATE information! You couldn’t even explore the app without seeing “Make America Great Again” or “Trump 2020”🤢! I could go on and on about how disgusting this app is but I think I’ve made my point.
