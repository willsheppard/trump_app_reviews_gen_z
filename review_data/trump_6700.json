This time it didn’t crash but it did set off the racist, homophobic and xenophobic alarms in my house (I know xenophobic is a big word for you bunker boy so go ahead and look it up before you continue) after this I tried again and it set my house on fire! The fire burnt all my MAGA gear and now I can’t attend the rally😰 I was highly disappointed by this app and by this president. Have an enlightened day Donald.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:14:29Z"}},{"id":"6177489930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scarred me for LIFE","userName":"Linda Mae Rose","review":"When I saw this app, I was thrilled. Our president Donald J Trump is my 💕🍊FAVORITE💕🍊. Everything was good for a few weeks. But then I started doing things against my will. At first I thought that I was just tired, but that’s was NOT the case. After further investigation, I figured out that this is run by ALIENS. They are using subliminal messages to hypnotize us! They made me punch my boss, flip of my pastor, and even SELL MY CHILDREN. I am heart broken over this. There is no way for my to get them back. Now I have no job, no god, and no children, all thanks to this app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:04:13Z"}},{"id":"6177473737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","userName":"chasemeier","review":"this app doesn’t help trumps campaign. it is too confusing for all the dumb people who would support him. they could never be this technologically advanced. there was no point in making a confusing app. also the Cheeto who is always on the screen makes me feel like puking. I went on this app not know my little brother was near and he started crying because of the ugly creature on the screen. If you have kids, please be careful when using this app. No child deserves to go through the pain of seeing that Cheeto.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:20Z"}},{"id":"6177439893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Many bugs and getting kicked out","userName":"𝘴𝘵𝘧𝘶","review":"This app had so many bugs it was hilarious, I tried to see what trump was up to but it showed a blank screen without anything on it. Sorry trump, it’s just not gonna happen. \n\nThere was many more things wrong with the app such as kicking me out and not letting me back in for a long time. I wanted to see something about Tik tok getting removed and it kicked me out again, you guys really need to fix this app or get it removed instead of Tik tok. Oh and I have one more thing.\n\n             TRUMP IS HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:49:13Z"}},{"id":"6177321348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"nasty boy✨","userName":"xoxo go piss girl✨","review":"that app is trashhhhhh. took 3 years to download and show what it was actually all about. people we telling us not to download this app years before it’s release but we didn’t listen. it’s a horrible no good app that only creates bad problems for your phone. your battery will die. it takes up most of your storage space if not all. it will quit randomly when you need the app the most and will not open again until it deems it okay. this app is disgusting and i hope Apple will remove it soon.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:14:45Z"}},{"id":"6177316741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","userName":"slideeetotheleft","review":"As I downloaded the app I noticed how traumatizing it was to see this man on my screen. Thinking about all the disgusting things he’s done, the racist comments, and exploiting women and children I just couldn’t keep this app. I feel like someone running for any political office shouldn’t even need an app if they’re so confident they’re gonna win. Besides this man is probably not even paying for this app with his own money, but using the people’s money through taxes (further the reason why he raised them). This app was terrible.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:13:31Z"}},{"id":"6177294242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App","userName":"user13deletethisapp","review":"Ok so I am typically all in favor of Trump and his wonderful political actions. However, he has made a terrible mistake in making this app. It’s very glitchy and I think it’s a very poor thought out idea. First off, the app is allowing you to redeem awards for supporting him. I think that makes his presidential running into more of a game than a serious political event. Therefore, I believe this app should be banned because it’s teaching Gen Z that you must modernize everything and turn everything into some game instead of a serious thing.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:07:08Z"}}]}
