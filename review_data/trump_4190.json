I got scared and closed it because it was a horrific sight. I kept on my phone and I noticed stuff that was happening to me first everywhere I went I started to want to grab women by there 🐱then I started moving my hands like as if I was playing a accordion every time I talked finally I started looking like a human Cheeto puff with a bad wig. Once I noticed the changes I quickly deleted the app and went back to normal. It was a horrible time and if I were you wouldn’t download. 😁","userName":"Maddy20150715"}},{"id":"6171780842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:08:03Z","title":"terrible","rating":1,"review":"❌my dearest cat has gone missing and I need help please help me Andrea was a great time to see you I love you so sweet I hope you have a great time love you bye love y’all I’ll see y’all soon bye love yyyyyy was the best night ever for you and I hope y’all had fun and I’m so sorry to see y’all I have to get to see you soon love y’all so good omg was your time to get to my mom I hope you’re well I hope y’all have a great time love love bye love y’all bye bye love y’all love mom love y’all love you mom I’ll be happy and then bye love y’all I’ll talk soon I’ll talk y’all over again I’ll see y’all tomorrow bye love you bye love y’all I’ll see him soon I’ll talk soon I’ll be home.❌ ⚠️MY CAT DID NOT GO MISSING THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME⚠️","userName":"skypeach"}},{"id":"6177902926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:12:21Z","title":"disorganized","rating":1,"review":"i was excited to support the cheeto rapist, hoping to be caught up and informed on the election and tanners campaign.🍊orange🍊racist anyway, this app is horrid looks like a child designed this. The app took F O R E V E R to download and i have never had a problem with any other app downloading before.

Upset I decided to go to bed but in the middle of the night I woke up to James Charles standing on top of me whispering something. I grabbed my phone and ran into the bathroom and locked myself in there. James Charles started to knife my door! 😱😱😱 I quickly deleted the app and he disappeared 😓 This app summoned James Charles to kill me!

Every time I open it it takes about ten minutes to load and glitches so so bad. Also, it keeps on deleting itself from my apps. Anytime I want to look at it, it has deleted and I have to re download it from the App Store. The information on this app is watered down and offers no actual facts so it’s not really worth it. I deleted it within a week. I can learn more about Donald Trump on tik tok, rest assured. Please DO NOT waste time on this app, it is unhelpful and completely ridiculous. I want nothing to do with it anymore. An utter disgrace. Terrible, really. \n\n-Dissatisfied user","userName":"Marié J."}},{"id":"6177651461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:18Z","title":"Horrid app","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because I lOvE oUr OrAnGe man (😳) first off it took 2 weeks to download, after i downloaded a bunch of spam callers told me the kidnapped my baby. I went to her crib and guess what SHE WAS GONE. They told me they’d only give her back if i sucked their toes. I did what i had to and gave their toes the gawk gawk 3000. I finally got my baby back but she was orange. The app kept crashing. And then i got addicted to the app and got into an actual car crash. Overall I’d give this app a 2/10. I gave it a 2 because it’s funny to see what the clown of the president has to say, also i am scared of clowns so i have to go to therapy because of this app.","userName":"hfdxcvvhifdxaf"}},{"id":"6177642354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:52:25Z","title":"✨Disgusting✨","rating":1,"review":"If i could give this app a zero star review, i would✨ This app is trash. Nothing would load, it kept crashing, and when it would load i would almost throw up because of what i would see on my screen. It made me nauseous and disgusted. Trump is just ruining the world. Everything that’s happening is bc of him. If he were never to go into office none of this would’ve happened. Anyways back to the app. This app is so unorganized it makes me giggle. It’s not worth the time to download this app. It’s all over the place and there’s zero purpose for it.

If the Trump administration would like to make amends for this sick joke they played on us, we will only be accepting payment in ARRESTING THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONA TAYLOR. also finding JUSTICE FLR VANESSA GUILLÉN, GEORGE FLOYD and making him take responsibility for the countless other lives that have been taken in cold blood under his watch.","userName":"Iluvanimalscupquake"}}]}
