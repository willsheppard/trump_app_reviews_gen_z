The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","isEdited":false,"userName":"10cak01","title":"Irrelevant","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:03:12Z"}},{"id":"6175098044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Oh heavens!! I cannot begin to even articulate how wretched this terrible app is!! I am so very displeased with its appalling service!! This app is incapable of lifting a glass with one hand, closing an umbrella, walking up a ramp, seeing a woman as more than an object, seeing a Mexican/Latinx immigrant as something other than a drug lord or rapist, understanding the concept of basic science on climate and public health, respect for people of a faith other than Christianity, and respect for America’s highest office. Please, I am begging you, do not give this horrid app 5 stars, but do give it one and the terrible review it so very much deserves.  Thank you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alison Moro","title":"Appalling Service","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:38:33Z"}},{"id":"6175084535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible I get sick every time I get on this app and things in my house are disappearing in plane sight and when I try to delete it I won’t freaking let me like my family is scared of my phone from this app I literally think this app is garbage 🗑 and I would never freaking recommend it for anyone . If you get this app your going to get so much bad luck and my friends won’t talk to me anymore like just because if this terrible disgusting app my food is starting to have no taste and I think this app ruined my life . So for everyone out there NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS DISGUSTING TERRIBLE GARBAGE APP .","isEdited":false,"userName":"😔🇯🇴❤️👌🏻","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:34:13Z"}},{"id":"6174933689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"In December 2019 I made a life-changing decision to download this app. Needless to say I did not know this would change my life. Soon after downloading this app my spine started crackling at first to begin only in small sections but then it escalated where I was in critical condition many hours of the night. I had to call the ER and it turned out that 9D2 sections of my spine were dislocated and discombobulated all because of Trump. This app needs to be shut down immediately in order to save the countless lives you could suffer with the same conditions that I did. thank you ❤️😏.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sad Spineless Person","title":"This app broke my spine","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:46:45Z"}},{"id":"6174922235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so awful. I never knew that my phone could lag like that. Not only was the app slow, it also messed with my whole phone. I think they have my phone bugged now. Because of the app, the government has access to my phone number, email, text messages, social media passwords, and my photos. I personally received a phone call from the president himself saying that I should spend less time taking selfies and more time exercising (who is he to judge!!) Anyways, I would not recommend this app and I would give it zero stars if I could.","isEdited":false,"userName":"aslfiahrbciajebfkwoqndhd","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:43:15Z"}},{"id":"6174914034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app and suddenly my entire house started to shake! absolutely disrespectful in my small opinion. it was a terrible use of my time and it will be a terrible waste of yours as well. this president will definitely not be bothered by the fact that if this app gets below a 1 star rating that itll be off the app store as well as the fact that it is totally possible for everyone to submit a small message about how terrible this is! anyways this was a complete waste of time and it didnt even show anything for me! it was just a game. no updates about donald trump AT ALL.","isEdited":false,"userName":"chair🦋💖but electric🥰✨","title":"ABSOLUTELY GROSS","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:40:48Z"}},{"id":"6174907748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My phone was absolutely fine but when I got the app everything went wrong. First it lagged then it glitched. It did not stop there though. Soon enough I had a virus and had to smash my phone because it got so bad. It would die on me then come back to life just to tell me it’s dying. You may be thinking ‘well how do you know ow it’s the app that did that?’ Well when I did charge my phone this was the only app I was allowed to open. It just messed up my phone so horribly bad. I do not recommend at all u less you want to ruin your phone completely.","isEdited":false,"userName":"PeppyLemon4","title":"Horrible.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:38:55Z"}},{"id":"6174798495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Martha was an average dog, \n\nShe went (woof!) and (arf!) and (growwwlll) \n\nThen she ate some alphabet soup and what happened was BiZaRrE- \n\nOn the way to Martha's stomach, the letters lost their way. \n\nThey travelled to her brain \n\nAnd now she's got a lot to say!! \n\nHow now, brown cow? \n\nMartha speaks \n\nYeah, she speaks and speaks And speaks and speaks and speaks \n\nMARTHA: What's a caboose?
