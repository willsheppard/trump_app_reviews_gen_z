I could not even find a trashier app this. Even tinder comes within second place. I’m disgusted from the app, and I will refused to keep on living if I see this app ever again. Terrible title, I could not understand why the app’s name is (Donald Trump... Cough cough) “Trash”. And did I also mention this app stinks? Even number 15 Burger King foot lettuce gives a nice reputation to itself compared to this, absolute, outrageously, mortifying, and disgusting app. I feel physically, mentally, and spiritually ABUSED upon looking at the app! Imma just gonna go 🌈🤚🌈🖐🙅🏻\u200D♂️after this 😭😭😭😭😭😭. Anyways, this is an Apple user, and I approve of this message.","date":"2020-07-08T22:05:16Z"}},{"id":"6173793865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The rat 🎀🐀","title":"This app is disgusting","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Ok I’m a trump supporter I am 45 years old and I love trump to death BUTTTTT this app took dayssss to download to be more specific the app took a FULL two weeks to download and that is unexpectedly.

I will not be downloading any app like this EVER again. So first when i open this app, it was sooo glitchy and the adds were unnecessary! and after that apparently after downloading it gave me a huge virus and broke my phone. my keyboard didn't work, my screen went green at some points, and i couldn't even use my camera. do not download this app! i had to replace my phone. Even after i downloaded a vpn it did nothing to the virus. i have read many other reviews and it all is the same things that happened to me. and lastly, back to the adds. after i opened the app the inappropriate (sexual) adds in front of my kids, they started to cry. WORST APP EVER. 😡😡😡\n\n- gen z","date":"2020-07-08T21:24:30Z"}},{"id":"6173742203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MiaS890","title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and it took me so many hours to open it because it kept logging out and glitching. I have perfect WiFi btw! When I finally got it open, there was just an ugly picture of an orange Oompa Loompa on my screen when I thought I had downloaded the official trump 2020 app. This is the most awful app I have ever used and I would not recommend downloading it at all! The app literally doesn’t do what I tell it to do and is literally ignoring the users of the app. I REPEAT this app is NOT user friendly and if u download it, it will break your phone and yell racist, homophobic slangs at u. I’m sure the maker had great intentions with this app, but the people of the United States VOTES NO!!! #DELETETHISAPP2020","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:43Z"}},{"id":"6173702475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"namjoonslefttittes","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app last night and it made me fall asleep within seconds of looking at it, I think it might have drugged me 😔. This morning when I opened my phone I had calendar viruses and could not get rid of them and it would send “trump 2020” and pictures of oranges every 3 minutes. When I finally god rid of them my phone turned into a picture with an orange 🍊on it I got so scared that I threw my phone across the room so after I had to get my phone fixed. They guy at the store told me that I would have to get a new phone because all my photos my downloads my google searches are all replaced with oranges and that would be no point into keeping it.

It took absolutely forever to download, to the extent where I wondered if there was something wrong with my phone! Then when I finally opened it asked for my phone number???? I wanted to use my email but it wouldn’t let me!!!! Donald J Trump apparently couldn’t pay enough to make sure his supporters can get contacted in as many ways as possible! I finally gave in and put in my mobile number (I don’t want to gov to know that! 😤😤😤😤) and I got so many glitches! I had to take it off my device bc I thought it might’ve gotten hacked!
