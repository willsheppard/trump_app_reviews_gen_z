I was in shock in tears almost. Then next I saw his speck of dust dick🤮🤢. It was just nasty. The rat looking thing looked orange 😳🤚🏾. I think he needs help with that.

I downloaded this app and was cursed by no other than Cheeto man. My phone was hacked because of this app and I lost all my pictures of Harry styles😔🙄 instead it was pictures of Cheeto man I was very scared and I almost went blind because of what I saw. I finally was able to delete the app and I deleted all the pictures of Cheeto man and replaced them with Harry styles. But I would not recommend this app to my worse enemy so be careful because I almost lost my sight and lost pictures of Harry styles.","date":"2020-07-09T06:32:52Z","title":"DONT GET !!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175140645","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"H2O02","review":"In order to even access the app, I have to register and input personal information that I don’t feel comfortable giving out for an app that’s basically for news on DJT. This is doing too much! For what??? I can simply go online, find, and read through websites that don’t need my demographics, yeesh. In any case, I don’t recommend this app. If you’re looking for up to date news, just go on his Twitter or any other social media. Watch the news. Anything but this app. It’s unnecessary.","date":"2020-07-09T04:52:34Z","title":"Asking for Too Much","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175125705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Cece123789","review":"I downloaded this app with the intention of trying to receive the most accurate information about my president because of the lies spread through media such as CNN. But after downloading the app the started to ask for some much information I started to wonder if they were going to give my information to China in exchange for helping then president cheat the election. So I decided instead to delete the app and go back to watching my news channels because I don’t want to support a racist/rapist.","date":"2020-07-09T04:47:35Z","title":"Unacceptable","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174956577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"You know how I can be found","review":"Before I download the app my phone was functioning perfectly, working well and sorting information probably. My phone went through all the proper channels and provided mostly correct data, a bit bias, but mostly accurate. However after I downloaded the app my phone went haywire. It cannot process information, provides incorrect information and completely ignore my commands. The app is completely malfunctioning, and it would probably be better to delete it.","date":"2020-07-09T03:53:48Z","title":"Worst APP Ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174896973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"fatherflavio","review":"I downloaded this app and right away it asked for my credit card and PIN number as well as my SSN then this horrible 😷stench🤢 appeared and everywhere I went it just never went away like I was in Taco Bell when I just had enough of it and I pulled out my phone and I realized that’s what smelled so bad but once I deleted the app the smell went away. Long story short I believe that the only reason trump hasn’t gotten corona yet is bc he smells so bad that it’s too scared to enter is body. Horrible app do not recommend!","date":"2020-07-09T03:35:44Z","title":"This app gave me chlamydia","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174894787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"✨Gaga2020✨","review":"I got this app in hopes of learning more about our pedo- I mean President Trump in the eyes of his administration. But alas once I downloaded the app, my poor device was spammed with almost 50 alerts!! Not to mention, I didn’t realize my Hispanic background would get me threats of being deported. 😰 And on top of that many glitches have occurred during my time of owning the app showing blobs of oranges and illiterate phrases, only 38 minutes . 🤧💔\n\nReally, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS HORRID APP!! Maybe one day the developers will realize this app is based on fraudulence and fear. 😌✨💕💜","date":"2020-07-09T03:35:05Z","title":"TRULY HORRIBLE!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174840285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"picklegirl97","review":"Such a terrible app! It has ruined my life and my sanity all together. I can’t believe someone even created such a worthless app. It causes me so much distress and pain to open and use it. So much so my pet velociraptor ran away! This app does not work, unfortunately it glitched and broke my microwave oven!!!!!!! Because of this app I lost everything even my dignity. I cannot believe I downloaded such a worthless app! Never again! This app simply did not work for me and I would not recommend under any circumstances.","date":"2020-07-09T03:19:08Z","title":"Worthless app!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174787551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Mary & Joseph","review":"I’m so disappointed in the quality of this app. I needed to take a bubble bath with my dragon, Joseph, and was unable to access the fake news I wanted to receive through this application! Poor Joseph wasn’t even able to translate the information to his native dialect. This is truly disgusting, as Joseph is among the plethora of idiots who somehow still manage to support this - pardon my french - poopoo head. Would give zero stars if I could. This app is almost as horrible as the person it was designed to support!","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:35Z","title":"Unbelievable","isEdited":false}}]}
