Like, who allowed an app like this to exist. Runs terribly slow and is super old and ugly. Also here is a gross fact about the person this app is centered around: He has 24 rape allegations, including his ex-wife (settled) and an anonymous 13 year old girl. Here is why he hasn’t been proven guilty but is guilty of those and probably more: A criminal case, like rape, needs to be prosecuted before it goes to court. Trump picked the attorney general and the DoJ is controlled by the trump administration. The attorney general prosecutes the federal cases, like the president raping someone. While he’s president, Trump can’t have a case against him. The only way to do that is through impeachment, but the senate is never going to remove him from office. So the whole “innocent until proven guilty” doesn’t work with presidents.","title":"TERRIBLEEE!!
