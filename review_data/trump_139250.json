We’re so excited to have this app to look at pictures of the orange, unfortunately since it took so long to download I was unable to be able to see any of his content. I really wanted to be able to see his thoughts and decisions and support a man I admire. This made me look at Trump in a completely different way if his app doesn’t even work how will he work as a president. He should keep trying but I’ll never work🧚❤️🧚❤️","date":"2020-07-10T05:35:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible🧚❤️🧚"}},{"id":"6179631986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"longsalami","review":"Well when I downloaded this app Donald trump told my grandpa edd that he would bring him a truck and that he saluted my grandpa well he sang the star spangled banner even though Donald doesn’t even know it🤣but anyways so when I got to my house at Walmart I feel down the freaking stairs and met the lil beaver from narnia btw it was pretty fun I also drank tea then my mom started eating macaroni and mg niece ate frozen BAKED POTATOES well my brother feel in target like what and then the closet ran away and and took all my clothes I also sleep in the closet 😏so yah my door started flirting with my bed and shower and they had a truple therapy and then red white and blue just stated ringing in my head and went in my brain and found the guy that discovered McDonalds and that was like wow but anyways my t.v fell into Beyoncé’s house in blues room and she had a bat and and she broke it and they went swimming shopping in target so don’t download this app and don’t vote for mr.chumpy unless you want to meet hitlers brother🤓","date":"2020-07-10T05:35:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Why my t.v got broke"}},{"id":"6179631926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"beckyg0456","review":"this app is super glitchy, took forever to download. overall is extremely dumb and keeps closing me out. Trump needs to try harder with his apps this one is NOT it and has no hopes in getting better. i kept getting closed out of the app and it wouldn't take my info. i tried not to listen to the other reviews but instead i wasted my time and found out all of these one star reviews are true. don't waste your time like me on this HORRID app. if you want to make a difference for america downloading this app is most defiantly NOT the way. I hate it with a passion and do not recommend it. honesty NEEDS to be taken out of the app store. it's fake and a bunch of lies. i feel like my account couldn't be hacked and my address could get out! ENDLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE AND BE KILLED DO NOT DOWNLOAD! SAVE YOURSELVES!","date":"2020-07-10T05:35:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER NEVER DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6179631688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alex08631569075421","review":"This is NOT the pasta recipe.

This app also glitches a lot and I even tried to contact service helpers and then they were so rude. They did nothing to help me. The app took so long to download and was so hard to understand. The screen turned pink all the tine especially when I when to my room and I even got an internet guy to come over and fix it but he said it’s was perfectly fine and he said that it just the because this same problem happened to him. SO I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP. Such a wast of time and will give you a migraine.","date":"2020-07-10T05:35:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible App to Ever Exist"}},{"id":"6179630795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emla16","review":"Cheeto man has gone too far.","date":"2020-07-10T05:35:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Cheeto man"}},{"id":"6179630712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"unfollow trump","review":"Worst app to ever be made.
