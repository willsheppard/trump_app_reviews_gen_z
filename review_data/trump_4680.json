THEN it downloaded a virus on to my phone where The FBI had complete access 😭😫.  They tracked me to my house and implanted a chip in my head (I consented in the terms) and then stole my family, kicked my dog, and burnt my house down.  Now I ☹️ can be 🤧 tracked 😭 anywhere 😰.  Don’t download the app unless you want the gov to see and know everything and control your mind.  Still voting for our problematic king tho 🏃\u200D♀️🏃\u200D♀️.","isEdited":false,"title":"High expectations"}},{"id":"6176228394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:14:07Z","userName":"karens are kool","review":"I LOVE our president, so obviously i was exhilarated to download his app!!

The orange literally rolled up my stairs and broke my front door open! I looked and it was our president Orange J. Trump! He kept rolling towards me so I ran to my room. I locked my door and hid under my covers like any sensible person would do. Then he SMASHED my wall open! He pulled out his rat cannon with little orange rats with toupees on!!! He shot them at me and they grabbed my phone and ran up the oranges sleeve. Then Trump hissed at me and slithered away turning into a snake. And I never saw my Nokia phone again. 😢","isEdited":false,"title":"My Phone!!!😢"}},{"id":"6175544877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:26:07Z","userName":"WILL NOT SAVE!","review":"✨💗🧚🏻I took the time to download this app and not only did it take FOREVER to download but my phone ended up being factory reset and I lost EVERYTHING!! So I re-downloaded it and then I got contacted by someone on the app and they told me I was a crusty dusty rat and that I should go jump off a bridge. That hurt my feelings so bad, and afterwards a weird guy came to my house and he round house kicked my grandma into oblivion and coughed on my dog. My dog ended up getting really sick and she’s now addicted to 🧚🏻✨ recreational drugs. ✨🧚🏻 NOT COOL!! I will not bet voting for the 2020 elections because now my hands do not work and I had to voice speech this entire review! ✨😗✌🏼","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻💗✨WORST APP EVER!✨💗🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6175345545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:08:16Z","userName":"ayva123","review":"The app glitches very consistently and will randomly just delete itself and disappear from your screen, just to reappear again the next day. It started sending me excessive amounts of notifications at all hours including the middle of the night waking me up even though I turned off notifications!! The app also stole my data and started messing with other apps in my phone. This was by far the worst app I have ever downloaded on an iPhone👎 would definitely not recommend. There was also a lot of racist, homophobic, and misogynistic propaganda that made me really uncomfortable.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible mistake"}},{"id":"6175183469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:07:20Z","userName":"Hajhajhajajhajaja","review":"Grumpy Trump offends me cause he’s orange and it hurts my eyes especially when the sun reflects off his skin, it burns my eyes. Please take him away.. it’s not safe for me or others. This app is horrible cause as i was typing my password, it started typing “I am homophobic, racist, and a rapist that likes to eat oranges until I turn orange and speak like I know what I’m talking about when in reality I do not” Idk how it typed all of that or why but it hurts my eyes. Everything about him hurts my eyes. Please take him away. He hates ppl from countries with actual flavor and culture so I think I should bite his ears off.. or will they taste like oranges? idk but imma go eat chocolate","isEdited":false,"title":"Very offensive"}},{"id":"6175132350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:49:48Z","userName":"EverythingElseIsTakenSoHereIAm","review":"I was really expecting a lot from this app downloading it. However when doing so I was met with horrible color schemes that I could hardly hardly stand to look at for a single minute. I actually timed myself. Nonetheless looking past the ugly colors the app also comes with many many many many many glitched out screens. And because of this my phone has become almost if not absolutely useless because I keep getting pop up ads and has made my phone sooooo unbelievably SLOOOW. And around the same time my dog disappeared so I’m assuming this app is the culprit behind that as well.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is bad. Just bad."}},{"id":"6175107834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:43Z","userName":"BodakYellowFU45","review":"This app is the worst. The WORST! I have been told by many people, smart people, people that know things, lots of things, that this app would save America and Make it Great Again and Keep it Great.  This app is about as useful as the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  It crashed my phone, autocorrected all my texts to words like “bigly” and got me absolutely nowhere as far as progress.  In fact, it was the opposite of progress.  It was the least amount of progress by any app EVER!! It is probably designed for those 5G towers to give me COVID. Which is Fake!! Like all the news! So FAKE!! Thanks, Obama, since this is probably your fault.","isEdited":false,"title":"Fake App! Obama’s Fault!"}}]}
