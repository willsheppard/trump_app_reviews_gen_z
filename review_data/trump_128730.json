First of all the app was only in English so I had trouble trying to understand the app since I don’t know how to read and write in English ( no I don’t have translate) also every time I did open the app it would tell me there’s a minority near by but the only thing that was next to me was my uncle Miguel Ruiz Gonzalez Martinez. But that’s not even the worst part one day I woke up to my phone holding a rally all the way in Vermont so I was phoneless for about 7 months and counting and I’m pretty sure my farmville animals are all dead. Please do not get this app save yourself \nAdd me on snap: andy_valdez11"}},{"id":"6176470808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:23:36Z","rating":1,"title":"DONT🍊DOWNLOAD","userName":"niaavaa","review":"The🍊app🍊replaced🍊my🍊spacebar🍊with🍊the🍊orange🍊emoji🍊!!!"}},{"id":"6176468002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:22:50Z","rating":1,"title":"this is horrible!!!!!!","userName":"hsjdkfk","review":"when i clicked on the app it was all in Russian code and there was this orange man threatening me to vote for him or else. 0/10 recommend. i’d rather delete this app entirely."}},{"id":"6176466787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:22:29Z","rating":1,"title":"NEVER DOWNLOAD","userName":"jollyholy","review":"Other than the fact that we have a misogynistic,racist ,and homophobic president the app is terrible😝 it took 542 weeks to download. once it finally downloaded, it took my grandma’s keys with her in the car and drove her off a cliff. I didn’t really care about my grandma anyway.But the next day It took my gummy bear album and broke it in half.

They advertised XXX super tiny teens, but that makes since considering Donald Trump’s pedophilia. Along with this however, there was an absurd amount of viruses, to such a point that my phone had to be replaced, and my information was sold to Russia."}},{"id":"6176452734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:18:37Z","rating":1,"title":"DONT EVERR GET THIS APP!!!","userName":"slickster 😉","review":"I originally got the app to support the one and only President that we all hold so dear to our hearts, Donald Trump. But when I got the app, and not to mention it took a really long time to download and it was very laggy. Anyway when I got the verification code I also got a text saying that if I didn’t text back my name and age, something bad was going to happen to me. My first instinct was to turn off my phone and I waited about five minutes, when I turned my phone back on I deleted the message. Later on I felt very out of it, and not like my usual self. I ended up being sick with a stomach flu for a week, and I think it was because of the texts. So I would not recommend this app to anyone, it’s not safe at all and if you do have this app, be very careful."}}]}
