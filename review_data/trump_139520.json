It started with pictures of a cartoon child I believe having the name of manny pop up. Just a few pictures I didn't think much of it. It soon started spreading to the rest of my phone turning all off the apps to black and yellow! Even Facebook it went all yellow. I am completely devastated. The neighbor's dog just took a crap and didn't clean it up!!! How am I supposed to Facebook this? I will be going to the phone place whatever they call it to get it looked at. I'm the meantime I will be using my husband franks Facebook account. Definitely will be complaining to the manager of Apple for letting this happen. Very disappointed!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:07Z","title":"Gives phone virus","userName":"personofdogs","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179600680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give this app negative stars I would you. Wanna know why? Because ion like it. This app is crap trump is crap America is spiraling outta control and has become the laughing stock of this planet because some of you idiots decided that putting a stupid billionaire in office was a good idea.

If I could give it no stars, I really would. I was trying to sign up for an even, and not show up to it, but it didn’t let me! What is this? Everything in this app is RIGGED! I hope Apple does the conscientious decision of removing this app from the App Store. I hope the president reads this message, but this app is as worthless as him ✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:25:00Z","title":"Worst App in Apple History","userName":"Billyhen77","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179600385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Let me start off by saying the second I opened this up I saw a orange man who scared the crap out of me. Upon further inspection I found out the orange man is also a pedo who likes children and hates people who aren’t orange. After seeing the app I have realized that Tik tok is a way better app and this app should be deleted. Do not vote the orange man into office he’s gross. Ass in the form of an app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:56Z","title":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨Download tik tok instead✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"anyone but the orange man 2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179600328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app sends and continues to send emails and text messages to me saying they want to eat each of my babies eyelashes off and spit them in a jar,,,, literally terrified rn 😿 0 stars","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:54Z","title":"omg bruh 🙀🤔","userName":"your mom ohhhhhh","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179600228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so many glitches","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:52Z","title":"Just bad","userName":"lbrivfjecke gl","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179600224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App is broken","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:52Z","title":"Broken","userName":"Cutiepie7000gator","isEdited":false}}]}
