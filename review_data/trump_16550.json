I open the app and see this rotten, wrinkly, horrendous looking Cheeto standing in front of the beloved American flag. He was covering the view! Then I signed up and my whole phone got hacked. The Cheeto stood before my screen and insulted me while I cried. I broke the phone but the Cheeto just came out and ATTACKED ME. I WAS UNHARMED! Anyway, don’t get the app🥳🌸✨💅🏼🌈☺️🙈⭐️💕","userName":"Niya0630","title":"I opened the app🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🌈⭐️☘️💕✨then I deleted it🌹☀️🌈🌸🧚🏻\u200D♂️🤪","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174149033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:43:30Z","review":"as soon as i opened the app, i was greeted by a a picture of a fat, disgusting, horrible looking orange man with his private parts out! i was disgusted especially because i support my president. this was horrible. also when i tried to contact the person who made the app, they told me to kill myself and that they were going to kill and eat my family! how horrible.","userName":"Obsidian68421","title":"Disgusting","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174124143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:34:10Z","review":"This app is the worst. I downloaded it and realized it was draining my battery the fastest also I only saw pictures of Cheetos, I don’t understand what’s that about. Then I saw a video that made me throw up and had to get medical help bc I was flushed our from all the puke.  I don’t recommend you download this app. I wish they just took this app out of the App Store.","userName":"🤮🤢eww","title":"Worst app, don’t recommend it at all.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174070815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:14:48Z","review":"Once I downloaded this app my phone started shutting down like every 5 minutes, all of my apps would randomly delete themselves and my messages, contacts and photos all got deleted and I know it had to be this app because none of it started until I downloaded this app and it all stopped once I deleted it.","userName":"Tiktok fairy ✨🦋☺️🧚🏻\u200D♂️","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174055373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:10Z","review":"This app seriously needs major upgrades. It’s incredibly slow and doesn’t have any of the information it says it contains in the description, such as where/when rallies are and how to RSVP for them, it doesn’t show any official political stances in a clear, outlines manner. Free or not, I can’t believe the worthlessness of this.

(now barron won’t have to suffer anymore 😛) i sniffed in the toxic fumes and died. the smell flowed throughout the house and my whole family died.☠️ i am currently in my coffin writing this now. imma go back to watching tik toks now💅","userName":"lemonade.y","title":"my family died","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174028576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:59:00Z","review":"the app is all over the place and i wanted to see where the next rally would be but i got lost and I appeared outdoors with my grasshopper 🌱🧚✨💫 on a leash because it likes to misbehave and once I stepped back in doors i forgot my keys outside with my frog . my frog disappeared after turning orange like cheetos and since then I can’t find it. \nanyways , the app isn’t my flavor of cheetos, i prefer the xtreme spicy ones 💪🏾😚😍","userName":"squishy🌙🌏🌍","title":"over it","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
