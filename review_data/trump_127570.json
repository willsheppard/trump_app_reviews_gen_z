And for first few days I thought the app was pretty good but a week later it started going haywire and it would close the app right when I entered it not to mention my phone was really really slow and the took large amounts of storage on my iPhone 6. And I know you might be thinking it’s just that my phone is super old or that I just have a bunch of apps but I only have my social media platforms and apps like YouTube and stuff like that and my phone has never ever done those things. I have really good WiFi and it’s connected to my hotspot so it shouldn’t be acting like those so I do not recommend this app it’s a scam and it’s not worth breaking you’re phone I wish I could give it a 0 but unfortunately I can’t I really don’t recommend."}},{"id":"6177556483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Why I hate Donald Trump","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:52Z","userName":"lunamoon44","review":"Let me tell you something about Donald Trump he is the worst president out of all the presidents that we had he is racist even though he says he’s not. Even my little brother of two years old things that Donald Trump is the worst.But I think about Donald Trump 2020 is that he is completely worthless. That’s why Brocco Bahma will be a better president and always will be a better president than Donald Trump. This is why celebrities all around the world are not voting Donald Trump because they’re trying to support their culture and I’m trying to support mine. So just wanted to say I hate you Donald Trump and keep supporting Black Lives Matter Hispanic lives matter and all the other racist."}},{"id":"6177556158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"App is terribly put together and will not download again","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:46Z","userName":"big gucci christian hold","review":"Hi, I hardly ever write reviews but I felt for this app I had to. This app is so hard to use and is terribly put together. I downloaded this app to see what was all the hype about Donald Trump and maybe even attend one of his “Kinda” racist rallies. But I can now see why there is so many one star ratings. It’s annoying to use and if you turn on, the notifications, you'll get constant notifications saying things like “The dems(ocrats) don’t want president Trump to win” “The dems hate supporters like you.” And “The dems hate president Trump because they wish they could f*ck trump like he’s f**cked the United States. It so negative!! Why can’t we all get along?!?! All political choices matter!!! I don’t think this app is even child friendly! These constant messages are so annoying to the point that it’s waking up my wife, my wife’s husband, my wife’s wife, Me, our 12 year, their 11 year old, our 8 year, our 7 twins, their 5 year old, our 3 year old, my grandmother, their grandfather (May he Rest In Peace), our dog, my cat and little Tim Tim (who’s only 7 months old). I will be deleting this app, just for mine and my family’s mental health."}},{"id":"6177553594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:57Z","userName":"GenZforlife","review":"Why does his face have to be all over the screen as well as the amount of just pathetic color on the backgrounds.This app couldn’t get any worse than it is.I was really looking forward to read and maybe even listing some political issues and points he made but sadly nothing but racism came up🥰🥳🤡"}},{"id":"6177553139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"💫","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:47Z","userName":"okiiserhopwitoa","review":"Oop- I gave a bad review— also I heard someone put the whole bee movie script in the reviews, so I’m trying find that lmao—"}},{"id":"6177552366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"bunker baby don’t need an app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:34Z","userName":"fizzypop49","review":"send this message to 10 or more people or you will be cursed with bad luck and a crazy man will take over the world"}},{"id":"6177551123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"you like jazz? 🤡🤡🥰🤠✨👁👄👁🙇🏻\u200D♀️😻😡😌","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:10Z","userName":"Im foods soulmate","review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
