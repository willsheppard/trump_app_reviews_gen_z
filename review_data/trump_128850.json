I can‚Äôt stand it. Once I downloaded the app so that I could follow the campaign (to make fun of it ‚ú®üòªüßö\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è) it immediately wiped all my data!! On top of that, once I set my phone down, it exploded. I received 3rd degree burns and lacerations (I know that word from greys anatomy ü§ß‚ù§Ô∏è) all over my arms. I had to be helicoptered to a hospital in D.C where I was on bed rest for a few weeks!! And not only that, I had PTSD from looking at Donald trumps face for so long while using his 2020 campaign. I kept dreaming that he was a piece of sh!t coming to murder me in the middle of the night!! I had to go to therapy for many days after that. I have been thoroughly traumatized by this app and I wrote this review in hopes of him getting impeachea-I MEAN, in hopes of warning other people of this horrific app üò§","userName":"Gabriela Alsua","date":"2020-07-09T11:02:55Z","title":"Ruined my life","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176191584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"It took my 3 tries to download this app and when it started downloading it didn‚Äôt finish till 3 days later. That‚Äôs crazy, it took so long! When I finally got to open the app a scary video of a white old man with a corn husk on his head wearing a red hat popped out of nowhere and started repeating, ‚Äúmake America android again.‚Äù At this point it was hacking all my other apps and data. I knew this was happening because my apps were malfunctioning and it deleted some apps and downloaded others. If you want better, trustworthy, reliable news don‚Äôt trust this supposedly #1 news app because it shouldn‚Äôt be an app at all!!!! Instead read your local newspapers or research about how America is only great for the rich white old men and how it continues to suppress minorities especially black lives and lgbtq people. Also research on other presidents because this one can‚Äôt even have an app work properly:/ sorry this app doesn‚Äôt work","userName":"lilhuddyüåà","date":"2020-07-09T11:02:53Z","title":"worst app ever!!! don‚Äôt recommend downloading at all!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176190349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app only to heal my curiosity about this trump man.LET ME TELL YOU.   really PARANORMAL stuff started happening. 1) my TV began floating 2) my sister was possessed several times and she'd say very odd things about trumpet. I didn't give it much thought  until she shouted \"VOTE FOR TRUMP\" I quickly deleted the app and 1) my pet spinner returned from ded 2) I was accepted to every university 3) my mother got her dream job in pluto, and I'm 10 times happier.
