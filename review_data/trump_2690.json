I downloaded it and it told me to open the front door and when I opened the door a giant elephant with a rocket launcher rocket launched my house, killing my entire family. He then proceeded to stomp on their bodies, so that I couldn’t even have a proper funeral for them. After he did this, he sprayed his boogers on me from his trunk. He had trump 2020 painted on his body. I am now waiting in child services, covered in elephant boogers, writing this review, tears streaming down my face. I don’t where to live now and at the moment the child service worker is laughing at me telling the elephant should have stomped me too. Don’t download this app, it will ruin your life like it ruined mine. Rest In Peace ma, pa, little brother, and kitty, you will be missed.","userName":"roosuu14","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Ruined my life I am now an orphan"}},{"id":"6173223713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:12:29Z","review":"This app took four days to download. When it finally downloaded it made a noise and the pitch was so high I couldn’t hear it but my dog could and she became DEAF. She started barking like crazy and scratching her ears so much she ripped holes in her ears and they almost fell off. I took her to the vet and she had to get double ear surgery because her ears fell off. After the surgery she looked so ugly that I didn’t want her. I took her home anyways looking like a crack dog. The very next day I took her on a walk without a leash because she never uses one and she ran INFRONT OF A CAR. At this time I still didn’t know she was deaf so I kept yelling her name to to get her out of the road but she didn’t listen. The man driving the car was Donald J Trump. Thanks to Donald and his stupid app my doggies dead.","userName":"cooouurrttt","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Rip my doggie:((("}},{"id":"6173068093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:22:28Z","review":"My mother wanted to download \"Trump 2020\" since her facebook friends were posting about it. I helped her download and registered her onto the app, fine at first. A couple of minutes pass and a message is sent her, claiming they know her address, her email, passwords, etc. Then they proceeded to send my mothers address to her along with her email password. \"Trump 2020?\" was being sent minute after minute until i deleted the app on her phone. I cant believe how disgusted and disappointed i am in this app.. They let hackers walk right on top of their app and won't do ANYTHING. If you want your information safe and not stolen, then i plead you not to get this awful app. Once I deleted the app the hackers stopped writing back and nothing has happened since.","userName":"iwowjendbcycu","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DANGEROUS."}},{"id":"6172768120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:51:32Z","review":"i downloaded this app earlier today to see what it was about. I LOVE TRUMP AND THAT SCRUMPTIOUS ORANGE SKIN💕😺😺😹✨😍💕 has this four years been a wast of time? yes! has he made it clear he was a child predator? yes! is he homophobic and islamaphobic? yes! but people change so i downloaded this app. I WAS SHOCKED when the app asked for my personal information. i trusted it tho, so i put in all my information and nothing bad happened until a few minutes later my phone had a virus! THIS APP WILL TAKE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE IT AGAINST YOU. they’re holding me captive please delete it while you can! BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP MAKE SURE YOU READ THE REVIEWS BECAUSE THEYRE TRUE! this app is a curse and now i’m being held captive in a basement and they’re only serving my chocolate covered crickets dipped in trumps toe hairs. 😿😿😾😿😾😿😿","userName":"the poop sqaud","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨trash like this president✨"}},{"id":"6172584363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:59:41Z","review":"Downloaded the app to support our burnt chicken nugget of a president. When I went to open the app, Kaitlin Bennett teleported to my house and kidnapped me and held me hostage for two months before I escaped. During those two months she tried to force me to write a five star review on his app. She wouldn’t feed me until I said I would vote for trump. I tried to escape when she went to one of his rallies. There was a bunch of hillbilly ninjas outside waiting for me but I used my karate skills I learned when I was 3 to fight them off. After that was Kellyanne Conway in a black Cadillac sitting there running with the headlights on. She then drove full speed straight at me and unfortunately I died. But luckily I had Damon Salvatores blood in my system do I came back to life a vampire and escaped. 🙂","userName":"Izzy ya","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"It killed me"}},{"id":"6172459226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:25:00Z","review":"I downloaded the app to see if Trump was worth voting for. I already had low standards walking into it, but I thought I’d give it a try. Turns out it was the worst decision of my life. I 100% regret it. I’m don’t know what was going through my head. Because this man is a racist and a predator. Just look at his cheeto looking self and you CANNOT tell me he doesn’t look like a complete imbecile. <— let me dumb down that word for you trump supporters: idiot. Because if you support Trump you have a few screws loose up in your noggin❤️. On the app he makes allll of these promises THAT HE DOESNT LIVE UP TO!!!! He is losing his mind he can’t even make sense half of the time.\n\nSo overall I give this app a ✨1 star✨rating. I would give it a zero, but there isn’t a choice for that.","userName":"Deannas Bananas","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst decision of my life."}},{"id":"6177451218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:52:40Z","review":"I opened the app when my grandma walked behind me and she saw an ugly rotten orange. As soon as she saw it she screamed and had a heart attack. I went over to see if she was ok. I checked her pulse, and couldn’t find it. I called an ambulance to help her, but when they arrived it was too late. When I went to her funeral I looked in the coffin to see her turning orange. I immediately started crying knowing that she got the Cheeto touch. I immediately left so I wouldn’t get it. Then the next morning when I woke up I was orange and had the Cheeto touch. I called everyone who went to the funeral, and asked them if they had it. All of them said yes!! It took us all 2 weeks to recover, but I still am slightly orange. That is why you should not download this app.","userName":"TURTLE14GIRL","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Killed my grandma"}}]}
