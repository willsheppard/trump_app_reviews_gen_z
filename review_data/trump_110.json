That being said, the minute I downloaded this app I knew I had made the biggest mistake of my life. Right away it took 6 days to download and once it did it asked me for my phone number and nothing else. I find this inappropriate and kind of weird. “Why did he want my number you ask?” Who knows, but something about it just creeped me out. They had the most annoying notifications that kept interrupting my screen while I was trying to sign petitions to abolish ICE and impeach that large, orange-faced, fake-haired baby in the Oval Office. Looking at a more long term review, this app slowly started to turn me into a racist, homophobic, xenophobic nightmare that my friends and family couldn’t stand. I was kicked out of my house, lost my friends, and my job and now I’m living on the streets thinking about when I was happy and had never heard of this godforsaken app. Overall, downloading this is a waste of time and will destroy your mind, body, and spirit. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"title":"Downloading this app made me physically sick"}},{"id":"6176729182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:33:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anna Bortion.","review":"I downloaded the app and everything seemed fine until all of a sudden my cousin fainted onto the floor. i ran over to help her but it was too late, she was dead. then, without warning, all of my other 20 family members started dropping to the floor making a line towards something in the distance. i followed the line, and at the end was a sign that read “vote trump 2020 or i’ll take away your rights.” I screamed and ran back to my house only to see my family being loaded into buses. i asked the driver where they were being taken, and he told me they were going to trump’s warehouse! i asked him what the warehouse planned to do with the bodies, but he drove away without another word. after hacking into trumps warehouse through google, i drove to the warehouse and opened the doors only to see trump himself! he looked up just as shocked as I was. thankfully he let me stay (i came prepared and dressed like a man). I asked him what he planned to do with the bodies, and he told me they would be more votes for him! “if no one knows they’re dead, they can help me win, and then end basic human rights of course!” in conclusion, only download this app if you want your family to be killed and used for votes towards ending equal rights!!!","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY COUSIN"}},{"id":"6175800608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:56:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tidixhejsj","review":"Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on.\n\nBut that's even worse.\n\nThe post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.","rating":1,"title":"Terrible 👎🏾"}},{"id":"6175536995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:23:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"OWLSGAMING662","review":"Has 1000 bugs in it dosent work the personWho made the app is in competition the app promote racism discrimination wall building the app is orderly disrespectful to every person in this world if there’s not understand what he needs to be a nice day major problem is actually taken off the App Store to save other peoples brain cells and lives this is very important and I think that this review should really be looked into because this is very very very true now what do I suggest at this app does the app is in such a bad day at this point in time to the point I think that the best option is to just take the ad down entirely and safe every other human being from downloading the app the person who made this at clearly does not have a brain and I advise against believing in any other propaganda or words this was so bad and I cannot ever let anyone get this app I will be telling my wife and my kids that are of the age of 20 to 18 to one of you start this app because how bad it is but they will have their own input in on it and they have actually already know they have set themselves at this app is horrible please please please Apple take this app down for god sake do us a favor take it down it is that bad","rating":1,"title":"This app was horrible 🤢🤢🤢"}},{"id":"6177732512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:20:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ipodmartin","review":"First of all I think it’s absolutely absurd that this app took 3 months to download! When it did finally download it changed every other app on my phone to the same thing!! Now you can imagine how annoyed I was so I went to delete the app, but it wouldn’t let me. It gave me two choices, I could keep the app and vote for trump 2020 or I could delete it and in minutes I would be surrounded by the fbi and trump himself would fly me in a helicopter and drop me right over the Sahara desert to starve and die 😤 so I did what any normal person would do and I got my lightsaber in hopes to fight off trump and the fbi. When they got to my house I realized I didn’t stand a chance as there were about 1000 of them so they quickly got ahold of me and put me in the helicopter right next to trump! Thankfully I had told my family about trumps evil plan and they were waiting for me in the desert to save me! Trump threw me off the helicopter and immediately flew away while blaring “hit me baby one more time” by Britney Spears. What a traumatic experience am I right?! But at least I survived and am able to tell my story :) if your still considering getting the app just don’t, ok? It’s that simple!! Just do not ever get it 🙃😉😆😜","rating":1,"title":"this app is not it🥱🤬"}},{"id":"6177034009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:53:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"SaphireAmber","review":"I was sooo excited to get this app and support our 🤢 umm ☺️ wonderful president. But i opened the app and the instructions were very unclear. Dora showed up at my doorstep asking if i knew how to get to candy mountain. I obviously had no idea what she was talking about so I said no. Theeenn she said “nevermind i have a map” and started to walk away. BUT I WANTED TO SEE WHAT CANDY MOUNTAIN WAS. So I said “ Dora wait... Can I come?” And she said “No you hobo”. And left😔 So I followed her very sneakily until we arrive at the biggest pile of candy ive ever seen. When Dora walked up to 3 unicorns.😦 One looking very mad for some reason and the other 2 acting like they were high off something. When i was spotted! And dora whipped out a machete. I obviously started to run when i heard one of the unicorns say, “The bleh bleh bleh is right behind you!) Not knowing what the crap they were talking about I turned my head while still running. A huge beast was behind me i got startled and fell. It opened it’s mouth to eat me when all of a sudden it gave me the finger and smacked me across the woods all the way back into town. Conveniently right outside my house. I went inside and took a nice hot bath. And the end. An overall very weird day. I wouldn’t recommend.","rating":1,"title":"Dora is the big mean."}},{"id":"6176518968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:36:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"delete this app 👎👎👎","review":"I downloaded this app to see if I would change my perspective on Trump. It didn’t. He is the worst president this country has ever seen. It’s a shame he was in power during Covid-19. He hasn’t said much about the black lives matter movement and when he does he only looks at the people doing bad things. Not everyone is looting and ruining buildings. Most people are peacefully protesting. Personally I am white but it is not right that our black brothers and sisters are treated differently than us. Why do you think it’s okay to treat people differently because of their SKIN COLOR. It shouldn’t matter what people look like or how much people make everyone should be treated EQUALLY. Colleges are also racist. They accept people of different races to make their campuses more diverse. Even if there is a student who deserves to go to that college more they would take a people of a different race to be more diverse. This app not only didn’t make me like Trump more it made me like him LESS!!! I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this app to a friend unless he/she wants the rest of his/her day to be MISERABLE. The only thing Trump has done, in my opinion, that is good is go to the march for life. It was really kind to support us because not many people do.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE app"}},{"id":"6175823276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:03:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"save poor barron trump 2020","review":"This app took 16 hours to download and i have plenty of storage before i even opened the app my phone started to glitch, but right when i opened the app my phone was hacked and wiped so then i downloaded it again and when i did it said they wanted to put me in a cage so i started to cry and told my family they said they would call the cops, but then we got a call from the one and only our racist,homophobic, and rapist of a president that if we called the police he send people to kill my whole family take our houses and money that we had then he continued to laugh at us!!!

When I opened it I saw this Oompa Loompa looking Cheeto on the front. I then fell off of the Eiffel Tower on top of and SUV that looked like a soggy chicken wing. The SUV was also playing the peppa pig theme song on repeat. It then drove into an elephant in surprise. I was then flung all the way to J U P I T E R, where I then found a talking blob fish. I showed it the app and it picked me up and threw me back to earth. I landed in my back yard and hopped on my pet penguin who then flew me to the hospital. I was then greeted by a female cactus. I showed her the ugly Cheeto I had on my phone and she hit me with her apple 87 times! I jumped to New England to see if I could find my watermelon flavored lollipop that’s shaped like a star. I couldn’t find it so I cried and then teleported to Jones BBQ And Foot Massage. It was old and run down. There I found a lotion bottle putting barbecue sauce on his toes. I screamed and it started chasing me. I attacked with a flower and used my magical glitter bee powers, but it got to me and ate my toes, fingernails, and then ears. It pulled a squid from le turtles pants and used it to ~pop~ my head off. At last I am now writing this from the Heaven of llamas. I am only here because this is a ~horrible~ app. I can say it was the death of me. Anyways, bye y’all.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE! I died!"}}]}
