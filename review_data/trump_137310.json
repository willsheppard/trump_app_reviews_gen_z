I don’t even know how that happened. Then after my wife saw this app downloaded, she filed for divorce and took my three beautiful children away from me. I didn’t even get the chance to explain myself. Since I downloaded this app, it’s like a curse has been placed on me. I got Coronavirus 4 separate times, I had to get my leg and six fingers amputated, and the surgeon accidentally left his scalpel in my kidney. Kids make fun of me on Twitter and call me one leg willy and post videos of pop stars in their reply. Are they worsening the hex? I’ll never get my life back. And it’s all because of this app. 0/10 do not get this, unless you want your credit card cut up my the gnome in your garden at night!
