Boy was I disappointed. I opened the app to find it was only supportive of a giant Cheeto. While this may be representative of most Americans at the moment (Cheetos are a great snack when you get the munchies), I do not want a Cheeto for president. Take down this app. Being humans back to the White House.","date":"2020-06-10T05:52:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Fish Reed"}},{"id":"6048321565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING ‚ÄºÔ∏è","review":"Ok so to start, as soon as I the downloaded the app my cat was brutally murdered by a trump supporter. The trump supporter then continued to harass me and my family. A couple of hours after we got him to leave my grandmother had a heart attack, turns out that the app sends out special radio active waves that effects only old people. This app is a sham and was designed to harm those around you. BEWARE.","date":"2020-06-07T21:27:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lolboidatboilolhlohilol"}},{"id":"6179137839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very bad!","review":"Unfortunately I made the mistake of downloading this app onto my cell phone. As soon as it finished download my phone began to smell terribly. I didn‚Äôt even know it was possible but the smell of trash was so potent I had to uninstall the app. I also became fatigued because I saw D*nald Tr*mps face which then triggered an epileptic seizure. This app is very unsafe and should be taken off the App Store immediately","date":"2020-07-10T02:45:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bidenmy"}},{"id":"5949645697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Robocalls, no thank you!","review":"As a Trump supporter, I was very exited to use this app. However, you can‚Äôt even start the app unless you give your phone number and agree to automated robocalls and texts from both TMAGAC and the RNC. That‚Äôs a dealbreaker for me. I am a long-time donor but don‚Äôt want any more calls and texts than I‚Äôm already getting.","date":"2020-05-15T18:03:06Z","rating":2,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Doc-911"}},{"id":"5883362546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App well designed","review":"I am impressed as a developer at the user friendly design.

Maybe from donating or attending online rallies?","date":"2020-04-23T22:17:14Z","rating":4,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TheTheJay31"}},{"id":"6178936022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app broke my phone","review":"I downloaded this app for my beloved president and in doing so, I went to click on the app and my phone exploded, disintegrating right my hand. I am typing this review on my laptop right now with my one hand. Very disappointed in whoever designed this app. Now the Trump administration owes me a prosthetic hand and a new phone.
