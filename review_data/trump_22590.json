I think it’s very messed up especially when their are huge creators making millions off of it such as Charli D’Amelio, Chase Hudson, Avani Gregg,Addison Rae, Dixie D’Amelio, and other huge creators. You’re also ruining it for adults who enjoy the app. We won’t go down without a fight trump.","date":"2020-07-08T19:23:51Z"}},{"id":"6173416370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"Yung Luam","review":"This took years to download I mean years I don’t have crap wifi I have the best wifi ever and this dude Donald trump almost hit my mom and dad his secret services are terrible they called me something I don’t know if it was a bad word and they are going to remove TikTok which is pointless us parents love TikTok and so do kids so ye this is trash Kanye west 2020","date":"2020-07-08T19:17:32Z"}},{"id":"6173415988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","userName":"Killeen P.","review":"This app is terrible, it took forever to download and took up so much storage on my phone.
