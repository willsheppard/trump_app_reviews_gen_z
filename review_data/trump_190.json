Then a Wendy’s employee slapped me on the back of my head and took my 4 for 4 McDonald😭😭 worst day of my life I had to dunk my phone in water to get it to shut off and then put it in flour but the milk couldn’t fix the racism the Cheeto left so I had to get a lip-phone that cost 2.3 million dollars but I didn’t have the money so Burger Donuts paid for it for me😭😭","userName":"BTSshippervkook","isEdited":false,"title":"I was so scared😭 worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174025734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:57:54Z","rating":1,"review":"Before I got the app I got loads diarrhea and felt extremely nauseous. Then I soon came to find out that I had Covid-19. I truly thought I wouldn’t make it but luckily from this app I learned from Trump that injecting yourself with Lysol would help fight the virus. So I did as my president said and injected my family and I with the various cleaning supplies we had at home. A few days after the injection my entire family felt sick to their stomachs. So we all decided to quarantine ourselves in the house and after a couple of days we began to have strange symptoms. Our skin turned green, our limbs and muscles grew, we had strange cravings such as pizza, and our backs began to resemble turtle shells. We then thought it was best to move to the sewers and fight crime. We are now known as the teenage mutant ninja turtles. Heroes in a half shell, turtle power 💚. Btw I’m Leonardo the leader in blue and I’ll doing anything to get my ninjas through. Donatello is the fellow, has his way with machines, Raphael‘s got the most attitude on the team, Michelangelo his one of a kind, and you know just where to find him when it’s party time. Master Splinter taught us every skill we need to be one lean, mean, green, incredible team.","userName":"Leo.the. shredder.crusher","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6173883569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:04:56Z","rating":1,"review":"TO BEGIN WITH, this app took 3 years to download and I had to get a new phone just to communicate with friends, family and just use my phone in general! I still wanted to give it a shot so then I proceeded to sign up and it told me I had to pay $2,000 just to create an account to learn about now, YOUR president! Then when I didn’t make an account it then told me I had won a a free 7 day trip to Bora Bora, I was excited at first but then realized that the same ad was printing from my printer, there must’ve been at least 100 paper ads. So I still continued and felt something slither down my leg, I looked down and it was a snake that came \nout of my phone and had a tag on it that said, “vote Trump 2020” a screamed and tried to delete the app but then it wouldn’t let me delete it! A bunch of orange emojis 🍊starting going across my screen and my TVs turned on and blared one of Rumps rally’s. Not to mention they got my information including email, phone # and address. I am extremely disappointed and this is why I am giving this app a 1 star rating. do not talk to me, I am still grieving over the loss of my dog (the snake poisoned him 😭)","userName":"1 star....","isEdited":false,"title":"This is the most awful app here."}},{"id":"6173670420","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:45:27Z","rating":1,"review":"I finally opened this app after FOUR DAYS OF CONTINUS DOWNLOADING, WHERE I COULDNT EVEN USE MY PHONE. Upon opening, my phone immediately blew up,  killing my firstborn, singeing my unibrow, and opened my third eye. Chakras and third eyes open, I proceeded to login, giving my number to the government. I could see the FBI agent inside my camera smiling with delight, clapping his hands manically. Suddenly, his clown nose fell off, and he woozely slumped forward, his rainbow clown wig rolling off. A large rubber bu11et protruded from his back, a tear gas canister fell out of his weave. A high pitch laughed emanated from my unmoving firstborn. “ACCORDING TO ALL KNOWN LAWS OF AVIATION, THERE IS NO WAY A BEE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FLY,”\nScreeches a demonic voice, speaking with my child’s voice box.  Suddenly, my child’s skin turned bright orange, like a bad spray tan. Her hair became incredibly short and balding, a thin flap of crusty yellow hair glued to her scalp. Her eyes were bloodshot, her face large and saggy, her now orange double chin smothering her. I screamed, and my phone whirred. It stood up on end, waddling towards me, camera on. “SAY CHEESE!” Last thing i know, my firstborn was arrested under the charge of being and infant, and I woke up in the ninth circle of hell.","userName":"xJxnniferx","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL APP, SERIOUS CRASHES AND BUGS"}},{"id":"6173464117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:33:41Z","rating":1,"review":"Of course I downloaded this app to support the 🟠🔸🟠🔶MEGA CHEETO GOD 🟠🔸🟠🔶. But once I opened it terrible things started to happen 😨😱😱!!! First, every surface in my house turned orange 🍊 and smelled vaguely like old man spray tan. Then!!!!! I heard a chorus of ear-splitting meows coming from outside 😰🥶🙀🙀😓🙀. Suddenly, my big sister turned to me, soaked in orange 🍊 spray tan and coated in Cheeto dust, chanting “ALL HAIL THE HALF EATEN CHEETO GOD!” 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶 terrified I ran out of my house only to be greeted by a swarm of orange stained hairless, cats 🐈, with blond wigs 👩🏼 clinging to their wrinkly heads. The cats stared at me blankly 😶 while I screamed loudly 😱. I frantically reached for my phone to delete the demented orange’s 🍊app, as if sensing my intentions the blond wigged 👩🏼orange cats started levitating in my front yard. The cats 😼 started performing intricate dance routines in the air swirling and moving as one, creating shapes 🔀🔁🔂🔄🔃⤵️⤴️↖️↙️↕️↩️↪️↔️↗️↘️⏪🔽➡️⬅️⬆️↔️ each more unique as the last. For the finale, 🎇 they made the face of the old racist orange white Cheeto. I finally deleted the app and I could see in color again not just white and orange!!!!!!!

He also allows police officers and tells police officers to kill their own citizens that have not done anything wrong. He also has let black people to be hanged and says that they committed suicide but we all know the truth. He disrespects women and if u can’t see that ur blind. Also he makes it seem like white people are way more superior than any other race but how can white people be the superior race when they weren’t a race to begin with i am just stating facts and trying to educate the people the best way possible. And also why are people being killed and getting locked up for peacefully protesting we have the freedom to peacefully protest and we have the freedom off speech so their for we have the right to do it without being looked up and killed. I’m really great full for things like this so I can spread what’s right so others can also see. If u read this I thank u ☺️.

When I first opened the app my friend had told me are u sure u want to have this app on my phone and I said yea. Then when I first opened the app I saw this picture of this rotten nasty orange with blonde hair.. I started to lose my eye sight. Then I felt dizzy, and my hearing was going away my friend had said to you want to go to the doctor and I said not I think I need to sit down and drink to water. After a while it didn’t get any better. So I went to sleep to see if it would get better then. I woke up and walked over to my friend and tripped and twisted my ankle. Then my friend told me to sit down and I did and I went on my phone bc I went to text my mom to tell her what happened and I told her and said it happened right after I downloaded this app and she told me to delete it so I did and soon after that my sight came back and my hearing became normal and I wasn’t dizzy anymore after that. But my ankle is still hurting. But all I’m trying to tell u is don’t download that app it has bad luck on it. It is seriously cursed and disgusting. DON’T DOWNLOAD IT!","userName":"renee is right","isEdited":false,"title":"This is the worst app EVER!!!!"}},{"id":"6172614497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:08:00Z","rating":1,"review":"So my granny was a huge trump supporter I mean likeHUGEEEE.  She even made a painting of him and added skid markers to his pants because she thought the doodoo stains brought out his eyes. And yes she even slept with that painting bc she knew he would protect her. She even got a tattoo of him on her shoulder so he would always be with her. She even fantasized about running away and being able to bake cakes for trump. So I decided to download this app for her considering how much my Grammy loved him and how he is so amazing . But it was terrible, it took a week to download and my Grammy was so sad and couldn’t wait so she just sat down for hours just holding the poopoo painting wishing that the app would download faster so she could see her beloved president . And once it downloaded it started glitching and was showing pictures of trump and he was whispering but I couldn’t hear so I turned it up and he was whispering hey lil mama let me whisper in your ear and wouldn’t stop and then it started to stink like old fake spray tan and it gave my phone a bug. All the bugs came and attacked my Grammy which caused her to slip and kill her. I do not recommend to use around elderly.","userName":"❤️Mariah🤤","isEdited":false,"title":"Killed my beloved granny def don’t recommend"}},{"id":"6172543684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:48:21Z","rating":1,"review":"As a hardworking middle class American I heavily value the family unit. On July 2nd I came home from work. I had forgotten my house keys that day so I had to get the spare from the back patio. As I approached the back patio I noticed it reeked of cigarette smoke which was odd considering neither me or my wife partake in any such activities. Nonetheless I entered the patio door as quietly as I could. As I entered the room my heart had dropped. I heard the moans of a voice already recognizable as my wife. The only thought racing through my head is what kind of sick bastard would break a home. Every step closer to the fort my anger grew. I crept past the kitchen only to see cigarettes upon the granite counter. Figured as much. \nI had finally made it to the bedroom door. I’m a moment of rage I slammed the door open and was shocked my what I had seen. This app was having sex with my wife! The grocer at the supermarket across the street? Sure. Clark from accounting? A logical guess. But this app? I could have never dreamed of such a thing. I took a deep breath and had made my decisison. I walked towards the bed, shook his hand, and admit defeat. I then packed a bag as he continued to ravage my wife and I left for Oregon.","userName":"ricardo bicanegar","isEdited":false,"title":"Slept with my wife"}},{"id":"6177615362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:43:42Z","rating":1,"review":"When i downloaded this app a boat popped up on my phone and i couldn’t get it off, even if i tried turning off my phone it was still there. 5 days later Donald trump himself appeared at my house. He murdered my siblings under the voting age and forced my parents to vote for him in the election or he would have killed them too. The he drugged and took me and my parents to the pentagon and brainwashed us. We were forced to stand by his side in speeches for weeks saying “trump loves the blacks” even though after the speeches he said he hates us (because we are black) so i had to run away to Europe so escape his tourment. I had to leave everything behind even my parents. My parents died for me and in their last dying breath said “find freedom” so i had to leave them behind and let them die for my life to be saved. The worst part is that while we were stuck in the White House trump showed us a secret room. In that room he has 300 wigs all made of real human hair he picked off of trump supporters himself and said that each night he makes his son try on every single wig before they go to bed. It’s disgusting, 0/5 stars. I want my parents back.","userName":"glutenfreepussy","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump has a secret wig room"}}]}
