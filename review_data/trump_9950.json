So inappropriate 😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"its utter crap","review":"I’d give it less if could. Horrible glitchy and then when I actually got to view the content. It was in appropriate and unchristian. I was so offended because my family loves Jesus and used to support trump. But now I feel he’s showing pornographic, satanic pictures to our children! My son is 17 so I let him dawnload! Horrible! Blasphemy! No body wants their child to see large orange bre*sts that look female on a man! I do not support this! Porno laten Bible burning satanic."}},{"id":"6174156587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:46:23Z","title":"Emotional Distress","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"macaroni dog","review":"I was so excited to download this app. I opened it to a picture of an orange martian in a suit. I was so traumatized I immediately started crying and shaking. I didn’t know it was possible for a person to look like that. There was no warning for disturbing imagery. When i tried to change the picture or make it go away it didn’t work. It took me an hour to calm myself down from my panic attack. -10/10 experience. I will be contacting my lawyer."}},{"id":"6174147238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:52Z","title":"👁👄👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"pet dino 🦖🦖🦖","review":"i had just got the app and as soon as i opened it i saw a a pineapple with white golden hair Squinting at me. i could tell it was very old it had wrinkles and saggy checks. my pet t. rex almost made all dino’s completely extinct🦖 when it saw it had fainted from the fumes from the fake tan. i showed my brother and sister and the hid under a bed in fear of the ugliness. my house almost fell down from the squinting pineapple with white golden hair. so this app has made every thing messed up."}},{"id":"6174145797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:19Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!🤬","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"omq_lavalamps","review":"i downloaded this app to keep in touch with our beloved president since his twitter was getting boring and as soon as i downloaded the app AND SOME MAN BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE, he told me that i could live if i said “maga2020” and he brutally beat my family and i. i am DISGUSTED at the fact that i had to LIE in order to live 🤢.

But upon opening it, all the lights in my house turned off. I am freaking out right now. All I did was just open  the app and the lights turned off and I saw a Cheeto🧀 on the floor. I’m not sure what this means. Later on I went to try and delete the app, but this huge gust of wind blew🌪💨and closed and locked my doors. I’m seeing Cheetos🧀everywhere now. This app is cursed. Would give a zero."}},{"id":"6174088646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:21:10Z","title":"Trump2020 (dead trump in 2020🥰)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"letasoso","review":"Yes I do have a lot to help you out there I wcan wis wa a las mias was the first day in a while omg omg was the way I was going a day of Christmas and a birthday dinner and I wanna is the way you want to be with a man and a friend of a coral and you know you wanna was the day I was going a day or so maybe you can come and I wanna play with you and you have to come home with us so maybe you could just go and go get your stuff done so maybe I just got home I so periodt pohh 💁\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🥰"}},{"id":"6174062323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:42Z","title":"Inappropriate Cheeto photos","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"allcountriesmatter_acab","review":"Downloaded this app because Cheeto man told me to and I didn’t know there would be horrifying photos of Cheetos! I first opened the app and BAM there was a naked Cheeto on a horse and I was horrified. Why isn’t this app 18+?? What’s wrong with America? I feel awful for the children who weren’t warned. Little Cheeto man should be ashamed of himself. This app is terrible 0/10 would not recommend. Not fun. Not funny. I’m disappointed. I was expecting jokes but all I got were terrifying photos of Cheeto man. :("}},{"id":"6174054999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:02Z","title":"DON’T BE FOOLED!!

It seemed strange but I continued and gave it my phone number. As SOON as I gave it my phone number, it spammed me with orange 🍊 emojis and blew up my phone! After the spamming finally stopped, my phone screen began to turn orange???
