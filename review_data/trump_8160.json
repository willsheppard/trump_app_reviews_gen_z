I searched for the Uber Eats app and ordered a large bag of extra dusty Cheeto puffs. When my food arrived, it kept saying one phrase and one phrase only: FAKE NEWS in a strange accent. I took one bite and ka-yeeted that thing into orbit. It was waaaaaaaaay too  dense for my taste. The whole way, it kept screaming at me: “MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA!” The next day, i woke up in the ICU. They told me i had been infiltrated by a racist homophobic dusty cheeto and i had two hours and 34 seconds to live. \n\n                     Sincerely, the entirety of Gen Z"}},{"id":"6177726766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:18:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","userName":"harry potter forever 9 3/4","review":"i downloaded this app on my phone bc. i heard it was great for news, and of course to support our president, but it took FOREVER to download and it slowed my phone down???? i left the app for a while and came back only to find that it made my phone EVEN slower. i was really EXCITED to use this app as a tool to see what is going on with everything with all the FAKE NEWS being so confusing, but honestly it made my phone so slowly that i SADLY have to say that this app is just not good."}},{"id":"6177621957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:45:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No🥰","userName":"star0511","review":"This app is horrible. First off let me actually say something that is true about this app. This app uses your location!!!! Even when you’re not using it. It also drains your battery percentage/life. The orange is gonna track you down and do awful things to you. He’s a vile human being, It’s despicable 😔. Ooo speaking about despicable go watch Despicable me. It’s on Netflix. And go watch The vampire diaries while you’re at it 😌. One more thing go Stream Elijah Kyle he’s a small artist 😌👏👏. Ok goodbye and thank you."}},{"id":"6177608914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Sad","userName":"Grace aikman","review":"Just terrible! Quality is bad. Like the worst. Not good. Very not good. I heard the app was good. That was fake news. There is not a good thing about this app. Well, maybe a few things work, but it’s mostly just really not a good thing. I thought it would be. That’s why I downloaded it. I downloaded it because I download apps I think would be good. This wasn’t. Sad. If I could leave a zero star review I probably would. Or maybe just a half star. I think we could make half stars happen."}},{"id":"6177561498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:26:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Made my butthole explode","userName":"andysGirl101","review":"I downloaded this app to support this racist Cheeto and it took forever to download. When I opened the app I was faced with a hideous Cheeto looking creature and while I was sitting on the toilet my butthole started vibrating. I tried to see what was going on but before I could do anything my butthole exploded. I was rushed to my hospital in need of a butthole transplant and a brand new set of eyes. When I got home I saw my dog spazzing out on the floor screaming Cheeto 2020 and He blasted off into outer space and was never seen again"}},{"id":"6177537225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:18:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"ZoomUniversity","review":"I downloaded this app with the intention of seeing the great and wonderful Cheeto mans plan for keeping America great. First of all it took 16 hours to download. After waiting 16 hours the app continuously crashed and was clearly stealing data off my phone. Then the app actually began insulting me and family and was actually being really disrespectful. Then I tried deleting it and it wouldn’t delete. Instead it started stealing my entire contacts list and continued to insult me and my family. NEVER GET THIS APP! WORST APP EVER!"}},{"id":"6177439180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:49:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Tik tok","userName":"llama fleas","review":"The app is soooo baddddd, I downloaded this app to be informed about this whole 2020 election and I ended up seeing a bunch of pictures of an orange small pp Oompa Loompa, I decided to stop looking at the app for a bit and take a break from all the orange and went to sleep I ended up having a nightmare about seeing this horrible orange man, now I can stop seeing him and now I have to go to therapy to get over this ptsd of seeing this in my dreams and on a daily basis I am still traumatized from this app and experience PLZ DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."}},{"id":"6177430904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE 🤢🤢🤮🤮","userName":"ur left but cheek","review":"After days of waiting for the app to load, I opened it expecting to see when the next rally was coming up. Instead I found the cover of the app calling me a Sasquatch instead. I also found out that instead of the president showing up I saw an orange instead...👁👄👁... I was kind of hoping the orange would rot away ...anyways I don’t recommend this app what so ever after calling me an oompa loompa and Sasquatch, if you think this app is good, then that means something’s wrong with u🥱"}},{"id":"6177321959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:14:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This App is reanimating the dead in my home and they are attempting to force me to inject bleach","userName":"Cyber Matter","review":"This app has literally risen the dead in my home and they are attempting to force me to inject bleach into my bloodstream to kill the “fake Chinese virus”\n\nIt has also brainwashed my kids to go into public without a mask on and begin waving blue lives matter flags while denying that anything is wrong with the country. \n\nThe undead are forcing their way in, I don’t have much time. Maybe if this app is shut down then the bombardment and idiocy will stop"}}]}
