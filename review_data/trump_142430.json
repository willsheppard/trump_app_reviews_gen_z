Do not download it! It’s glitchy, tacky, and overall full of misleading information.

Luckily I had my laser gun to fight it off but it was a tough battle. Then Batman came into my room and got naked and whispered in my ear, “I’m Batman” I got scared so I kicked him in the nuts and ran away, next thing you know my toaster came to life and was having sex with all my furniture. Worst app ever it’s all the apps fault. (Also I lost my virginity to a toaster)","isEdited":false,"title":"I HATE IT😡🤬","date":"2020-07-10T03:44:33Z","rating":1,"userName":"fjejdjcirkekskckdo"}}]}
