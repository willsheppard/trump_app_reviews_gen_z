Once it did a found a sad old angry orange telling me things that messed with my head. It told me to hate everyone that wasn’t a straight cis Christian white person. It made me lose my mind thinking people who are against fascism are now a group that cause terror while triple K isn’t. It made me believe a full fledged pandemic was not real and taking the few precautions we have like wearing a mask were unconstitutional. And it made me follow every single order a shriveled sad orange said. All while thinking it was right in every way despite obvious insanity. I realized though this app broke my brain as well as wasted my phones battery way too much and I realized I was better without it since it makes anyone who uses it an idiot.  🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️\nAnyway 0/10 would not recommend cancel this app cuz Gen🧚\u200D♀️Z🧚\u200D♀️will🧚\u200D♀️not🧚\u200D♀️go🧚\u200D♀️down🧚\u200D♀️without🧚\u200D♀️a🧚\u200D♀️fight🧚\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:24:45Z","title":"This app gave my phone a virus 🤢🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6175829181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"acer__jay on IG","review":"First off this app took 7 years 4 months 6days and 47 seconds to download. Then when i opened it it sent me to pornhub to watch riley reid which wasn’t that bad until i saw donald walk into the scene. so i closed it then opened again and this time it had hacked into my phone and wiped all data and replaced it with pictures of donald so i deleted them all and tried to open again when it made me watch a 4 day long documentary about donald and i couldn’t leave the app so i was forced to watch it and when it finally ended my phone froze and then grew legs and walking to the sink and went swimming then it had a conversation with me about how i can get good at warzone and why i cant even get 3 viewers on my twitch stream and then it cooled me a full course meal but it was completely burnt then it beat me up and left and i haven’t seen my phone since and i don’t have the money to buy a new one so if you see a walking talking phone let me know","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:05:50Z","title":"Terrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6175606282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"YayItsAReview","review":"I downloaded this app to support my loving and caring President, Mr. Trump 😍. However, upon opening the app, I found that I had to enter my phone number and age ??? There is no way that Mr. Trump would ever ask any of us Americans for our age or phone numbers because those are violations of our rights and privacy. I’m sure the Chinese app, TikTok and those Chinese Big Time Socialists are behind this app 😡. They’re collecting our information to find out where we live and then will spam our phone numbers with fake telemarketing scams and surveys. I’ve already gotten 30 alerts in the past hour saying that there are “Hot Singles in my area” looking to hook up ??? It also says that my phone has contacted a virus ??? I hope it’s not the coronavirus 🤢. Be careful fellow Americans- danger is everywhere. But with the power of the Bible and the bald eagle on our side, we can overcome anything! (except for homelessness and obesity) Make sure to vote for Mr. Trump on Google Forms instead!!! 😌","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:48:45Z","title":"Big Time Socialists ???","rating":1}},{"id":"6175018366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nika's_Baby","review":"CHILE when i tell you this app ruined my life. basically my best friend kelly was driving and i was in the passenger seat when i was in the app store and came across this application. as i was reading the description in disgust, my girl kelly happened to glance over and saw what i was looking at. she then exclaimed “F*** DONALD TRUMP”, reaches over to grab the aux, plugged in her phone (all while driving 100 mph on the highway), then proceeded to start blasting the music so loud that my eardrums busted, causing me to lose hearing in both my ears! as i reached over to grab a pencil to finish my math homework because i could no longer hear, kelly slammed on the breaks twice, causing me to stab myself in both my eyes, blinding me completely. we had a head on collision with a semi-truck, and i’m currently stuck in the burning car with a broken neck, left arm, and two broken legs. i am writing this by using text-to-speech and i feel the heat of the fire getting closer to me. kelly is dead, y’all. somebody send h","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:13:29Z","title":"THIS APP IS CURSED","rating":1}},{"id":"6174943170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Super master flex eos","review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.\n\nI'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:49:40Z","title":"KILLER QUEEN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THIS REVIEW","rating":1}},{"id":"6174730474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trevor050","review":"I saw Donald Trump at a grocery store in D.C yesterday.\n\nI told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\n\nHe said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.\n\nAfter paying for the Milky Ways he proceeded to leave the store and throw all of them in the garbage. Haven't seen him since.\n\n(found in r/iamverysmart comment section.)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:46:08Z","title":"Very bad :(","rating":1}},{"id":"6174444976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lilianawolf","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, I downloaded this app thinking it was going to be good for my dog but it turns out that once you open the app a Chito puff comes up on you’re screen it stayed there for several hours and i didn’t know what to do I was very scared then I started to cry my dog ended up crying with me it did not make me or my dog happy it actually made Us very sad then the app continued to show very inappropriate pictures of a disgusting orange figure sadly my hamster could not take the horrible site and died my dog is currently passed out and is having problems breathing and I sadly can not get the disgusting terrifying image out of my eyes I almos considerd bleaching them but idk yet I might then my cat came in the room as soon as she saw the horrible picture she threw up 😔😔in Conclusion I do not think that this app should be available for anybody there is kids on this app and that is very inappropriate for them to be looking at this disgusting horrible and horrific app. Have a good day🙈✌🏽","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:23:46Z","title":"VERY BAD!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174205451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Unicorn367","review":"first off, i opened the app to see a horrifying photo of cheeto working out 😳🖐🏼. it was like seeing a pig sweating profusely. then, i was shown an even more disgusting and horrific photo of cheeto getting a spray tan NAKED 🤮. i had the displeasure of seeing his little ball. gladly, i had my glasses on to protect my eyes from the poisonous gases coming from each photo. unfortunately, my sister didn’t she needs emergency surgery and new eyeballs. i also showed my mom and she passed out from the fumes. my phone then said to me, “why am i even here? i can’t handle cheeto anymore!” so my phone disappeared into thin air (im having to write this review on my refrigerator door). and now, ive lost brain cells listening and just seeing cheeto so i go to therapy 80 times a week to help with my mental trauma caused by cheeto boy 🟠. my eyes have been scarred for life and my mom in still passed out from the fumes lingering in the air. actually im starting to feel a little shsffayuoplbbsbs;-4280?gnanaofx;)-&(691","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:04:13Z","title":"this app... just no","rating":1}},{"id":"6174149334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Y kira","review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira.
