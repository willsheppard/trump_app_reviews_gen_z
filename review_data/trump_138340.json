He, who shall not be said, is a racist, homophobic, I don’t want to write all of these things for I’d be here for weeks, but I believe you get the big picture. It’s really sad to see that this orange is in power and is using his powers for the worst reasons and on the wrong things. There are bigger things to worry about other than twitter... please don’t bother downloading this app. Thank you for your time. 😪","title":"Don’t waste your time 😪","rating":1,"userName":"🚫hopewithorange"}},{"id":"6179759029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:22:30Z","isEdited":false,"review":"it crashes all the time and i keep seeing this picture of a small cheeto! it is horrifying nudity should not be allowed on here come on now! this is just not ok! please take this app down before you scar more people please!","title":"this app sucks😭","rating":1,"userName":"mhmamaya"}},{"id":"6179758916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:22:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app was horrible.
