When I downloaded it, it kept glitching and showing me a orange face... oh wait that’s the president never mind. Anyways when I downloaded it I legit almost had a heart attack from seening that orange thing oops I meant president. Like I was saying I do not recommend downloading it. Oh and don’t even get me started on my parents they almost called the ambulance because they saw me almost having a heart attack because of what I saw. I told them what caused the heart attack and they looked and they almost had one themselves. Just don’t download it. it’s not worth it. Have a good day😊"}},{"id":"6173408644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:14:55Z","title":"THIS APP KILLED ME","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"barron trumps wife","review":"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER!!\ni wanted to get this app so that i could support my beloved and sexy orange president✨🤤🥵🧡💦\nas soon as i downloaded it, hundreds of cheeto puffs with arms and legs climbed out of my phone and started throwing spray tan bottles at me! then mr orange cheeto man himself kicked down my door and started chanting child’s rhymes. i tried to run but i was blinded by thousands of pictures of our esteemed leader’s small orange member. finally, the cheeto puffs engulfed me and killed me along with my 58 hairless cats which mike pence then ate. since i was brutally killed, my trusted giant sewer rat is writing this review. please do not download this app it will only do you harm."}},{"id":"6173408222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:14:46Z","title":"Absolute disgrace","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🍑🍆❤️","review":"This is HORRIBLE never download this app your phone will start to glitch and your dog might go missing. Orange headed “president” will flood your screen so you might have to turn your phone off and on again. TERRIBLE APP this app is dirty and it took almost 5 days to download on my phone. After you download this app you would see the world get worse and worse like higher cases of corona everywhere Bc of Trump saying 99% of corona virus cases are harmless and saying it will go away like a miracle. BLACK LIVES MATTER AND WILL ALWAYS MATTER FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!! SAY THIER NAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALL LIVES DO MATTER BUT BLACK LIVES ARE A PART OF ALL LIVES!!

It’s distasteful and disgraceful. It hurts me to THINK about the experiences I’ve had on this. Took an HOUR to download for how many files? Three? Why?? It’s almost sickening to know that this thing is still on the App Store? Take it off! The reviews never lie and it’s harming me to think that people are actually using this app. I would personally love to sue this app for my time and effort of putting my finger on the home button and having it scan. I am disgusted by this horrid app. If I could rate it one star, I would."}},{"id":"6173369470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:00:58Z","title":"What is this?","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"swag🛒","review":"The fitness gram pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. Ding. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Ding. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On you mark, get ready, ding."}},{"id":"6173359442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:57:32Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"worse app in the world","review":"This app took way to long to download and once it finished it kept on glitching and logging me out. After all the glitches I had a VIRUS a virus I tell you!😡 like what type of app gives you a virus!! And I don’t have many apps on my phone so I tried to download it on my iPad but it did the SAME THING AND IT EXACT THING. But it didn’t glitch as much as it did on my phone so I guess that’s good. Once it finished loading on my iPad a ugly orange thing popped up like eww. This app needs a lot of updates and clear all viruses cuz it’s just not sanitary to have so many bugs, like WHAT. So ya in other words DO NOT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6173333287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:48:21Z","title":"WHY WHY WHY","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMP4LIFE2020","review":"So I downloaded the app to try to support our awesome president. I downloaded the app and started looking at stuff. Then I noticed that it turned my entire family into oranges🍊!!!! I was so offended that they would mock our president in such a way. I was so mad that I accidentally lit our trump 2020 sign on fire🔥and it somehow landed on our flag!! 🇺🇸Then my family turned into Cheetos and I was hungry so I ate them! I love our president SO MUCH but I lost my job, 😿my family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧and everything over this, I am now in jail 🚔and want you all to know that this app is HORRID and has cost me my entire LIFE🤪🤩😔🥰😭😢😡🤬😱😨🤯😳😰"}},{"id":"6173328175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:46:34Z","title":"THIS APP IS CURSED. DO NOT GET.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Dr. Drew Thomas","review":"I got this app and the second I opened it my phone started glitching out. I couldn’t open any other app on my cell phone and i could tell the app was definitely listening to me and recording my conversations because the mic would turn on every time I opened the app. It also gave my phone viruses. please do not get this app if you want a good life. After I downloaded this app my whole family got a disease and died 🙁🙁🙁 and I lost my job. It all happened after I downloaded the app. This made me hate Donald Trump. #formerrepublican #dontvotefortrump #savebarronteump#appdoesnotwork"}},{"id":"6173316088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:34Z","title":"Crashed my phone....Would not recommend","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sashaRN37","review":"This app was one of the most awful experiences of my (admittedly middle-aged challenged) on-line ventures.  It COMPLETELY CRASHED MY PHONE.  What in the Sam Heck? I just wanted to connect with like minded mask avoiders and I ended up having to pay a private IT guy (thanks Trevor!) to just get my basic phone to work.  I had to use an old school push button until it was fixed.  I am of an age (and tax bracket) that I DO NOT 1. Stay at hotels with numbers in the title and 2. Use communication devices that takes a degree of finger strength or manual dexterity. 0/10 would not recommend"}},{"id":"6173274367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:29:14Z","title":"Asking for my credit card info","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"art before tacos","review":"Yup right after adding my phone number it asked for my credit card info I didn’t know what to do, so I cancelled/skipped that part and in seconds it started to play The Pledge Of Allegiances. I got quite scared because I didn’t know what to and it wouldn’t stop even if I turned off my phone, in 10 minutes the cops were at the door why? Because I didn’t add my credit card info. The Pledge Of Allegiances wouldn’t stop at all and my fish died because of it :’( But overall, the app was just terrible and would not recommend at all."}}]}
