Therefore, Trump is the reason my 5 husbands aren’t friends. They are also avid Trump haters, thus concluding that i also hate Trump. Also, when i got the app, -which is SUPPOSED TO BE FREE- satan (who was also orange) came and asked for my soul? I don’t think that’s supposed to happen. Then, my sisters started being NICE to me, which is new. Afterwards i saw my evil fifth grade social studies teacher coming through the screen like that scene in The Ring. Therefore, Trump broke my heart then tried to kill me.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:21:45Z","userName":"12387()","title":"this man crushed my hopes and dreams"}},{"id":"6177073911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took so long to download, almost felt like a whole life time and after ages of waiting I excited opened the app to see Donald trumps 🍊plan for America (and building a wall🥴🧚🏻) when opening it and seeing a weird 🍊orange looking Oompa Loompa got scared so much I dropped my phone and cracked the whole thing!💞💓 Thanks for making such a scary 😣app like who even thought of scaring people so much the wouldn’t want to be in the app now gotta get a whole new phone.

I had heard of it but I didn’t completely understand what the app was. Every time I tried to open the app, it would glitch and send me back to my home screen. It never let me open the app and soon I noticed weird things happening after I downloaded it. One time that I tried to open it, I tapped on it and my dog dropped dead right in front of me. Another time I tried to open it, I tapped on it and a picture frame flew across my room at me. This app is cursed and I do not recommend it.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:42:23Z","userName":"ticked off youtuber","title":"No❤️😌🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕"}},{"id":"6176933391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I WAS excited to see all of Trumps plans for America, until I discovered how HORRIBLE of a mistake it was. My experience was TRAUMATIZING. The app took 3 and a half days just to download. I opened the app and had to give my phone number to even use the app. WHY?😡 As if that wasn’t horrifying enough, next they made me make an account. Why the heck do I need an account, I just want to see Trumps plan! Frustrated, I make an account, which makes zero sense. Once I’m FINALLY in the app I just see articles that I could’ve (And should’ve) read online!! DON’T DOWNLOAD! Not worth it.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:51Z","userName":"MaceFace123456789","title":"Couldn’t be more disappointed"}},{"id":"6176556975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app ruined my life. When it finished downloading after several days, my girlfriend left me for a guy named Kyle. I am so distraught over this. Man, this app stole my girlfriend. *audible crying* Stephanie come back, please. I miss you Steph, what happened man, you are my everything, Kyle doesn’t deserve you. Hell I probably don’t deserve you, but I love you so so so much. Babe if you see this please I’m begging you come back. What happened about the dog we were going to raise together? Did You and Kyle already do that? But Stephanie I mean it, come back and lets get married. I love you.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:47:14Z","userName":"ClarenceThePig","title":"I have made a severe lapse in my judgement"}},{"id":"6175956090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried this app cause all my friends said it was amazing or whatever. First of all it took nearly 5 days to download and that was WITH WiFi AND DATA. Then as soon as i saw that it finally downloaded, i clicked on it and immediately i got hit with a ton of ads and suddenly my parents started speaking to me in a language i didn’t know and my dad had a mental break down (give his age - he’s 70) it DIDNT surprise me much. The my mom started burping uncontrollably. It was so bad that we had to hospitalize her. This app ruined my life. You’ll regret getting it like i did. Heed my warning, earthlings.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:47:57Z","userName":"asusreeceyghostymacpie","title":"Don’t get it 😤"}},{"id":"6175832670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and as soon as I opened it on my phone all of my other apps wouldn't open. It's only like it's the only app that matters on my phone. All of the power has just been routed to keeping the app open and I can't get any information or help from anywhere else. It's like it's put up a firewall around it or something. It must been hackers that got it on the phone but I'm really desperate to get it off my phone. I think the only way to get it off is to vote and hopefully it will get taken down for being utterly one star. Help!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:07:01Z","userName":"BaileyBD","title":"this app crashed my new iphone"}},{"id":"6175812003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took 4 days to even begin downloading and I thought I was going to miss the deadline for the next rally so I could show support to our completely ✨unproblematic, not racist, nonpedophile, nonhomophobic✨ president. They honestly tried too hard to make this appealing 💫🦋✨ i hope they never try again🧚\u200D♂️✨💗. I was staring at my screen 👁👄👁 trying to figure out why the president want the mumber of a 17 year old??? That seemed kinda sus to me. Anyways I dont recommend this app. I could feel myself losing braincells by the second the longer i had it on my phone 🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:00:10Z","userName":"H0n3y1019","title":"✨Horrible Quality!! ✨"}},{"id":"6175743236","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app Bc I wanted to support the orange headed bald eagle Donald Duck face trump butttt It took forever to download! It wasn’t anything wrong with my WiFi or phone so it was definitely this app itself. After it downloaded 2 weeks later I tried using the app and every time I clicked it it would take me on the app and back out. I let it be and than later on I found out it was taking my informationI was flabbergasted ............like what kind of app is this ?  I demand to speak to the manager ! This app  needs to be removed right away !!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:36:31Z","userName":"karen luesky","title":"Wow! ................................................Definitely don’t recommend"}},{"id":"6175730618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off, this app took 58 weeks to download. Once I opened it, I noticed something strange, all my showers turned on! I immediately closed the app, but that wasn’t it. My lights started turning on and off. This app has costed me HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS because my water and electric bills are going up. I deleted the app, hoping that this would end, but the worse has yet to come. Trump himself entered my home. Took my dog and fish, stole all my remotes but left the TV, stole my car keys and if that wasn’t bad enough, he left a curling iron on and my house burned down. Not ok. This is rude and inconsiderate. I do not suggest getting this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:32:16Z","userName":"Lgjdhdhehj3357383","title":"UNACCEPTABLE"}}]}
