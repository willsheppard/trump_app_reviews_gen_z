Once it was downloaded every time I tried to open the app, it would kick me out and shut my phone off. Then when I would turn my phone back on, the battery would be at 1 percent! It was a terrible cycle and I couldn’t even charge my phone because it messed up everything. I had to get an entire new phone because of this horrible app!!!","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"userName":"a hater of this stupid app","date":"2020-07-08T20:56:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173663389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took 10 days to download and it plays music and it made spiders crawl on my wall and I just hate this app personally I hate trump personally to he is just stupid for being racist i whould die if that was my father and to tell you this app is stupid like who even likes him ☠️make America great aging like no like this is how I feel when I see his face 🥴🤒🤢🤑🤮🤧😷💩🤭🥺😡💔and that is how I feel so yeah worst app ever TikTok is always better only racist people have this app..............................................sorry not sorry","title":"WORST APP EVER!!","rating":1,"userName":"NO ONE LIKES THIS!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:42:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173602880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the app is in terrible condition which is extremely surprising and frustrating since president trump is so rich. i honestly expected more from him. the app was glitchy and had disturbing messages that made me think he should be ashamed of himself. the app store should remove this app as soon as possible as it affects not only the way we see donald trump but also the way we evaluate Apple in general. i hope everyone has a beautiful day and remembers to wear masks in public😘","title":"worst app ever","rating":1,"userName":"LATINA4TRUMP❤️✨","date":"2020-07-08T20:21:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173597532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"IM SORRY. this app is horrible absolutely horrible. do not download this app why support an orange, cheeto puff, pumpkin, etc you get the point. imagine trying to take down tiktok bcuz us gen z kids are smarter than you. keep playing with us you won’t win. u started a war trumpyy we did it one time when no one came to your rally and we’ll do it again by taking this app down.  \n\nSome people say you can achieve anything if you try😍🦋✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️❤️✨they weren’t talking about you.❤️✨🦋☀️🌺🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥰🤩🥳","title":"cheeto puff","rating":1,"userName":"tiktok we out here","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173594569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE when I first went on the app it started playing this terrible tune and my phone started to glitch so I couldn’t exit and then I was getting worried (I looked like this 😧) the music made me black out and my brother said I drop kicked his son into a community swimming pool and continuously body slammed some other kids.

Looks like something straight out of the Middle Ages. No technology at all. Weak. Disgusting. Shame on whoever was a part of making this. I would much rather go back to playing Minesweeper on my brick of a computer in the early 2000’s than have to open this app one more time and witness the atrocity of the graphics and gameplay of the Trump 2020 app.  Gonna vote Democrat because of this. 👎","title":"If I could give 0 stars I would","rating":1,"userName":"Animuuuuuuuu","date":"2020-07-08T20:06:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173526916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app the most horrifying music that you could ever hear started playing and I tried to open a folder and I read “Go back to your country” I am very offended and disappointed in the government for making such a horrible app for the clown himself and also offending any other Hispanics like me. You can go ahead and leave I will hold the door right open I will be waiting for you to go through and for the world to change 😷🤢🤮","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"userName":"Fnidhdhdsinsdh","date":"2020-07-08T19:55:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173515241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrendous.\nTook weeks to download and it ended up giving my phone a virus that made it over heat and then shut it off. It was horrible and it got to the point where I wasn’t even able to use my phone. Once I took it to the phone store they were able to safely remove the app and now my phone is back to Normal. Don’t get unless you want to end up spending a lot of money to either get a new phone or to fix this one.","title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND","rating":1,"userName":"m.mollymae12","date":"2020-07-08T19:51:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173505813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app made my phone glitch so hard that all my emails were hacked by what appears to be Russian hackers. My emails are now flooded with Russian emails and i can not change my password. That’s not even the half of this apps troubles.
