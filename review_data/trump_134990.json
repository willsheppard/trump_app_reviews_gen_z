But when I opened up the app my phone started giving off more radiation than usually and I feel asleep thinking nothing of it. I woke up the next day feeling a new lump on one of my 🏀🏀’s and I got it checked out by a doctor, I’m going to get surgery for it in a few days.

The lyrics are talking about modern day, the things that  are happening right now.                                                         Tupac- Keep ya Head Up                                                     Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne\nSome say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nI say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots\nI give a holler to my sisters on welfare\nTupac cares, if don't nobody else care\nAnd uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot\nWhen you come around the block brothas clown a lot\nBut please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up\nForgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up\nAnd when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him\nAnd if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him\n'Cause sista you don't need him\nAnd I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em\nYou know it makes me unhappy (what's that)\nWhen brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy\nAnd since we all came from a woman\nGot our name from a woman and our game from a woman\nI wonder why we take from our women\nWhy we rape our women, do we hate our women?\nI think it's time to kill for our women\nTime to heal our women, be real to our women\nAnd if we don't we'll have a race of babies\nThat will hate the ladies, that make the babies\nAnd since a man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up\nI know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter\nAiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me\nHe had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be\nAnd suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with the local crew, and had a smoke or two\nAnd I realize momma really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life, to raise me right\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay your rent\nAnd in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen\nI try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\nIt seems tha rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up\nYou know it's funny when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars, but can't feed the poor\nSaid it ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is\nIt ain't no hope for tha future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\nI blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup\nAnd even though you're fed up\nHuh, ya got to keep your head up\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter\nAnd uh\nTo all the ladies havin' babies on they own\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em\n'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more\n'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son\nWants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'\nYou can't complain you was dealt this\nHell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\nDying inside, but outside you're looking fearless\nWhile the tears, is rollin' down your cheeks\nYa steady hopin' things don't all down this week\n'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me\nI was given this world I didn't make it\nAnd now my son's gettin' older and older and cold\nFrom havin' the world on his shoulders\nWhile the rich kids is drivin' Benz\nI'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends\nAnd it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but\nPlease, you got to keep your head up","rating":1,"userName":"ig-rhianna.offical","isEdited":false,"title":"Very Bad
