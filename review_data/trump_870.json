I downloaded this app and when I opened it I start a huge Cheeto man with his fist up looking to punch somebody. The fist in the air truly scared me and I had no choice but to enter my mobile phone number and sign in to this strange app. When I was about to enter my phone number something came to me and told me not to continue with this app. I am not sure if it was Spirit telling me or just a gut feeling but I followed that feeling and deleted the app as soon as possible. After I deleted the app I came to the App Store to look at other reviews and people are saying the same thing about how this app is not a good app to download. Please I beg you do not download this app I still feel uneasy I’m not sure if it is cursed or what it is but I can assure you that you need to stay away from this application for your mobile phone. Please everyone download safely I did not understand the harsh reality of some applications.💅🧚","title":"Terrible experience 🧚","rating":1,"userName":"I'm not giving out info"}},{"id":"6174146526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:35Z","isEdited":false,"review":"hello, my name is anyone with a common sense 😊. I downloaded this app to keep myself updated on all the ”amazing” things this orange fat potato has been doing. then immediately after downloading i spotted a virus. I tried to follow what are amazing president did , and void it . 🤗. until The virus spread to all All of my electronics And then they all started chanting trump 2020. By this I was very frightened and concerned and started breaking and throwing the objects.  but before I could throw the TV something crazy happened my mother looked at the screen for too long and she suddenly started vigorously shaking she was having a seizure!!!! We took her to the hospital, but sadly she did not make it. After a week of mourning her loss I decided to take my trump infected phone to a professional. They told me they couldn’t do anything it was too far gone. This app has made me lose my mother my phone and many hours of my life. 😔 I hope this review was helpful and stay safe 🧚\u200D♂️😊","title":"don’t get this app 🧚\u200D♂️😔😊🥰🧚\u200D♀️🛑","rating":1,"userName":"a person with a common sence"}},{"id":"6173992841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"iS tHiS aLLoWeD??? The existence of this app is a threat to the “freedom” the US preaches of so highly. Why do we have the anti-Christ in office, and why is he trying to get rid of an app that reminds Gen Z that they’re ultimately just kids? The way CheetoMan consistently lowers the bar for the nation is incredible. Banning a kids app should be the least of the PRESIDENTS worries, considering that over 3 MILLION CIVILIANS have died of COVID-19, quick reminder that the “Chinese Virus” isn’t real since it can’t have a RACE, the country’s unemployment rate is the LOWEST it’s been in all US HISTORY, black people are being KILLED in the streets for JUST EXISTING at the highest rate FROM ALL RACES by either the police or other citizens, Hispanic people are being denied HUMAN RIGHTS by ICE in the worst ways possible, but as the responsible man he is, CheetoMan tells his civilians to drink bleach and that masks are useless. I hope you’re forever aware of the hatred millions of people have against you, and I hope you rot in hell.

Then it start saying rude things about me for example saying, “you are a fat beluga whale with otter teeth” which was highly offensive to all beluga whales around the world!!! especially because I have a pet beluga whale and he now has severe crippling depression from the remarks made as well as my pet otter which is now very self conscious about his teeth. Just because this app I have to pay 8,000 dollars in braces fees for my otter and 200,000,867 dollars in therapy fees for my beluga whale. Not to mention my therapy due to the face I saw his NO NO SQUARE. Over all it’s a HORRIBLE APP it’s so glitchy it broke my phone so now I have to use a rock to write this review. I’m so horrified/traumatized by my experience with this app do NOT RECOMMEND . 😤","title":"OFFENSIVE 🥄!!","rating":1,"userName":"addison rae👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6173783828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:27:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am extremely appalled at the behavior of our president let alone his cabinet. That aside, this app is completely and utterly unusable! It’s confusing. There is no walk around/tutorial on how to use. It’s not the best app I’ve used. Trump should worry about being a man of all the people and not just the privileged few. \n\nNow circling back. I’m dissatisfied with his presidency and hope he does not win again if life will remain the same. I truly hope he fixes his behavior and begins to act dignified. He’s supposed to stand for the people but he’s constantly working to divide the country. I was a supporter once upon a time but now I’ve began to see things differently. \n\nHe lacks empathy for others! It’s quite scary! I hope he begins to actually portray the characteristics of Jesus Christ. Being that he’s a self proclaimed Christian. He is making us look bad. \n\nFor his current supporters I urge you to just listen for once instead of arguing to win. Listen and maybe you’ll learn. Feel!!! Please don’t let your hearts become cold. Anger, violence, hatred, and evil will only ruin this country. Not make it great again, it was never great to begin with. It was productive but not great. \n\nThings need to change. We shouldn’t gain at the expense of others. That’s not Godly, nor is it humane. Step outside of yourself for once and listen. \n\nGod bless! Trust in God and change! Jesus is king! Him alone, not you, not me!","title":"Absolutely horrendous","rating":1,"userName":"vinny2316"}},{"id":"6173677157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:47:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app took WEEKS to download and when it did and i opened the app all of a sudden rats were coming through my window and my house was infested with rats. i read a review and it said someone had had roaches come in so this app definitely is attracting these animals and insects. then i heard someone bust down my door so i went to see who it was and the fbi was here! they said we needed to move houses because our house wasn’t following state regulations so we started packing up our stuff and soon after a week we left and moved into a new house. right as we were settling in the fbi broke our door AGAIN and then proceeded to arrest me. they demolished our house and they took our car to a junk yard. they then took the kids and put them up for adoption. i am now out of jail because my husband bailed me out but we have to start all over again! we don’t even have jobs anymore 🤬😤 this app makes me furious and you should never download it.","title":"this app will ruin your life! ✨🍊","rating":1,"userName":"trina g. 🍊🔫"}},{"id":"6173598801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:19:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to know what was going on with the president, but right when it turned midnight of the night I downloaded, Donald J Trump appeared on my bed. He then scurried away into my bathroom, he used all of my shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, deodorant, until nothing was left! Next he summoned all of the bugs in my house and they formed Elmo 🙀. The Elmo bug started attacking me but i pushed it off and grabbed the spatula, but it was too late, he raped my cat 😿. While all of that was happing, Donald snuck into my room and taped raw potatoes all over my ceiling, then he left. Once I got back into my room, the potato men and women attacked me! They tied me up and carried me off to their dungeon, throwing me into the oven. I cooked for about 27 minutes on 390 Fahrenheit. They took me out and ate me. Now all I am is a head and two arms, which is how I’m typing this. Oh, and not to mention Donald Trump is a racist, homophobic, sexist child molester. Trump 2020 😌✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️, but on a gravestone, I really do hope that Simpson’s episode comes true.","title":"not my cup of tea 😾😿🙀","rating":1,"userName":"Trinarose"}},{"id":"6173571048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:10:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The first of many severe issues occurred when I went to download the app. My phone had never had this problem before, but the app absolutely refused to download and I could not access the app store without being brought back to the home screen. I restarted my phone many times but could not seem to fix it. After about a day it finally loaded, but had the same issue with kicking me out immediately. Once again I tried to troubleshoot these issues, but to no avail. I can’t imagine what other problems occur within the app as well, given the trouble I went through to download it. Just a disclaimer, the other apps on my phone (other than this one and the app store) were working fine, leading me to believe that it is a problem with this app specifically. I don’t recommend even trying to download it, it’s a huge waste of time when you could just find other less biased sources of information.","title":"Overall very difficult to use","rating":1,"userName":"Jann F."}},{"id":"6173299070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"What ever you do. DO NOT download this app because the person you call you president is trying to take away the only thing that is keeping us children entertained ( Tik Tok). And we have had to stay inside 24/7 now it’s been  5 months.  And we are not allowed to go nowhere without a mask or without gloves and especially for the people who have newborns or toddlers their child/children can’t do nothing or get to play because of what we are going threw. This Man has put us threw so much this year and people still stand beside him and the year isn’t even over yet and we a while to go left of this year. AND PEOPLE WHO DONT STAND FOR TRUMP BUT ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT LOUD DONT BE ANYMORE. Cause the stronger we are and the more people we have against him the less pain we have to go through and the less time we have to be scared and on our toes. So PLEASE Vote so we can be free and not always scared about what’s coming next or what’s around the corner. And Please leave a review😁.
