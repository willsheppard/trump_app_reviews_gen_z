When i downloaded it a human sized lobster appeared in my house and told me i needed to move out because it was his house now. The lobster then proceeded to dump chocolate milk on my couch and threw it in the street and ate my curtains. When i asked why he did this he says he appears in everyone’s house who downloads the app. After i bought my card board box to live in the street (because my lobster kicked me out) an orange cheeto man jumped out of my phone and pushed my grandma down 12 flights of stairs and drop kicked her in the face. Now she has no teeth. I’m very disappointed in this app. Do better. And please never download this app","rating":1,"userName":"ava_a____"}},{"id":"6174495890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!😭🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-09T01:38:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So i dont support trump but i just thought why not get this app whats all that could happen well after i put my phone number in i started getting texts from random numbers and tgey were like sexual texts but i thought nothing of it untill somone texted me so you got that trump app well if i was you maybe we should meet up i was scared soni deleted it after j deleted it tge texts stopped but that one dude still texted me he told me were i live and he was right ny email and he was right i was so scared i reported him to the cops and they did nothing about it after i told him i told the cops all he said was we will see about tgat since then i moved and have been scared ever since!😭","rating":1,"userName":"RyRo2000"}},{"id":"6174405819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"why just why","date":"2020-07-09T01:11:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ok. this is serious. i just want to remind all of you people of yourself. you have a life that flies by so fast. you should not waste it. and we love our family so so so so so much, we cant part. parents, this is a time to think about your sons and daughters. you love them right? well, its😭. we all have someone who need us. forever he record, social media isnt bad, but it risks our safety. im also not saying its 💩. but social media has a history of the cause of the loss of life for young people. im just saying its just putting a lot of our personal stuff in our profiles, which is why i only subscribe, not post. so the next time you post, make sure your doing the right thing.","rating":1,"userName":"legendwaitforitdarry"}},{"id":"6174388979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😋🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨BASURA✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️😋","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days. A time of peace. When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation. Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads. And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.","rating":1,"userName":"streamMapOfTheSoul7"}},{"id":"6174282244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointing","date":"2020-07-09T00:31:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this in hopes of supporting however instead what I received was glitching, crashing and \nThe FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.","rating":1,"userName":"Sparkle monkey3365092"}},{"id":"6173936892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely not 😌🧚✨","date":"2020-07-08T22:24:25Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is terrible. Not only did it take forever to download but it kept glitching. So I throw my phone out a window because I was frustrated (obviously). But then a bird came down and took it away. So naturally, I followed to bird. While I was following the bird it dropped my phone that it had stolen from me on my head. It really hurt. I got a concussion from it. After that I went home to see if the app had downloaded yet. AND IT STILL HADNT. So I finally I decided that the only logical thing to do at this point was to yeet myself into my wall. And that’s what I did. I hurt my arm. Now I’m here writing this review. This app it horrible do not get it. It will cause you physical harm and i bird might steal your phone. 🧚✨","rating":1,"userName":"🧚✨🧚💩🤡👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6173915508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"all of my family is dead now","date":"2020-07-08T22:16:35Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ok so when i first downloaded this app it opened up to a weird looking orange man licking his cats balls🙀. so i quickly threw my phone on the floor so i wouldn’t have to look at it BUT my phone grew legs and walked up to my and showed more pictures of the orange man with a wig on and his willy getting oranger. i ran as fast as i could into my bathroom (the only room with a lock) but then 100s of phones with legs AND arms broke threw the window and door of the bathroom grabbing me and slamming me in the toilet into the sewers. they started flushing me and my family down the toilet. we ended up in the sewers somewhere and my phone is broken now so i’m weighting this on a dead rat(my family died) don’t install‼️‼️‼️","rating":1,"userName":"omg stupid🖕"}},{"id":"6173898343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bottom of the pyramid","date":"2020-07-08T22:10:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"hi guys so i downloaded this app and the first thing i saw was a terrible picture of this weirdly shaped orange like figure. i couldn’t make it up but when i saw this picture, something deep inside of me really started to scream. i started profusely sweating and before i even knew it, some tears started to fall down my face. i’m not sure what caused it but it felt like as if i viewed an image that was possessed by the devil! my intentions were to support daddy trump but after this horrifying expirience i just decided he’s just a man to not be supported. i hope you guys all feel the same way. if anyone had similar expiriences please rate this app a one star because this behavior is NOT OKAY. \nwith luv, \nabby lees #1 fan xx","rating":1,"userName":"gooba10284"}},{"id":"6173826682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made me bald 👩🏽\u200D🦲","date":"2020-07-08T21:43:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is absolutely terrible! First of all it took 4 years to install and while it was installing my phone started spraying out fart gas that cause my chickens to start flying away! So of course I called my neighbor bob to come tie the chickens to string, but then he died from all the fart fumes! So then I texted my buddy Mr. T but he was in Hawaii. Once I finally downloaded this app KAITLYN BENNET’s FACE was popping up all over my screen, naturally causing me to projectile vomit all over the place! I had to call the fire dept so they could delete the app for me because I couldn’t bare to look at my phone anymore. Shortly after the app was deleted all my limps fell off so now I’m typing this with my tongue.

I am so confused. I was looking for a political party that’s pro-life, but they never speak out for the Black lives taken by the corrupt cops. I was looking for a political party that’s pro gun, yet they never speak out for the black lives murdered when they were in possession of a “weapon”. I was looking for a political party that favors smaller federal government over larger state government, yet they are giving money to this fascist. I was looking for a political party that supports freedom of speech, yet I found that policy is being pushed to control social media. Huh. ✨❤️🌙✨","rating":1,"userName":"Minny'sPie"}}]}
