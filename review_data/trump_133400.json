As soon as I opened it up, there was a GIF of Donald Trump dancing with a button underneath it that said “click here”. I clicked the button, and my house burst into flames! Luckily I was sitting next to the window so I got blown out of the window while everything else in my house was totally destroyed. I was sitting in the grass still trying to comprehend what just happened and finally regaining myself, when I hear something in the distance. I squinted my eyes, trying to see what it was when I could barely make out something coming in the distance. It took a few minutes before I realized they were people. Lots and lots of people. They seemed to be marching in unison, almost like an army. As they got closer I noticed they were... orange? This could only mean one thing. It was an army of Donald Trumps. I got to my feet and started running when I came to that realization, but they had already seen me and started shooting at me. Luckily I was in a big city so there were lots of buildings to maneuver around, and so I avoided most of the bullets. A few of the Donald Trumps got shot by accident by some of the other ones, but there were still a lot left. Eventually I hid behind a building and they couldn’t see where I went and walked right past. Thinking I was finally safe, I took a deep breath trying to once again comprehend what just happened. I was finally relaxed and about to call an Uber so I could get away from the area and tell everyone my house got burnt down and get insurance, when I heard a gunshot so loud it sounded like it was right next to me. I slowly turned my head to the side, only to see one of the Donald Trumps standing there with a grin on his face. I looked down at my stomach and saw that my shirt was stained with blood. I had been shot.\n\nI woke up in a fancy looking room, laying on a table. Someone had bandaged up my wound, and it already seemed to be healing. I wondered where I was, but it hurt too bad to get up. Just then, I heard someone open the door. I turned my head in disbelief. It was him. The Cheeto man himself. It was the one and only, the REAL Donald Trump. And he was wearing a mask. “What are you doing?” I asked. He said nothing. “Am I in the White House?” I asked again. Still nothing. A few moments of silence passed by when he asked “You don’t have the corona, do you?” “No?” I answered. By the look on his face, he didn’t seem to sure. “It’s my job to make America Great again, and corona is making America bad. So I have to stop it.” He walked into a room and came back out with a syringe. It had blue-ish tinted liquid in it. “What’s that?!” I shouted. He didn’t say anything, but I could tell he was about to inject me with it. I got off the table, despite the agonizing pain, and ran into the room he had just came from. He ran after me, but when I saw what was in there I froze. There were bottles of disinfectants, syringes, and syringes with what I can only assume to be disinfectants in them. There were bottles of all sorts of disinfectants, like Lysol, windex, Hans sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and all sorts of stuff. And this idiot wanted to inject them into me! I’m not sure if he was trying to murder me with it or “Cure me from corona”, but I booked it and ran as fast as I could down the hallways, Trump chasing me not far behind. I saw a dead end with a window up ahead. I didn’t know what floor I was on and I knew it could be fatal or I’d at least get injured, but there was no other choice. I had to take the chance. I keeps forward out the window, closing my eyes and preparing myself for the worst when I felt myself land. I didn’t feel any pain. I opened my eyes, realizing I had landed in a bunch of bushes that had apparently broken my fall. They were big bushes, and I was pretty much inside them. I could see out through the top leaves and saw Donald Trump looking out the window, but he couldn’t see me. I figured he was going to call his security or someone to come look for me, so I had to get out of there fast. I snuck out of the bushes and ran along the side of the whole house facing away from Donald. The White House was super huge, so it took a while to get to the other side. I kept looking behind me to see if anyone was following, but to my relief nobody was. I managed to escape and ran back the the blade where my house burnt down, my Uber waiting there for me. “You’re 20 minutes late” he said. “I know... but I decided to download some stupid app that held me back. It’s called Donald Trump 2020. Do not download it.” I replied. And he drove away.\n\n-1,000,000/10, do not download.","rating":1,"userName":"MyaPapaya080806","title":"THIS APP ALMOST KILLED ME"}},{"id":"6173507678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:48:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app a bunch of baguettes when flying everywhere🥖Then they started to attack me.

And while it was downloading I wasn’t able to use any other app. Which is really messed up. On the other hand I didn’t like how Donald Trump obviously had made this app and fully paid for it, but he didn’t want to help with people in need. He obviously had the money for it so I really don’t see the problem. In addition I think that supporting this app is wrong especially with everything that’s been going around in the world right now. With these Karen’s and ken’s. Most importantly the orange god himself. To tie this all together the App Store really just need to delete this app because GEN Z is more powerful than you think 😘.
