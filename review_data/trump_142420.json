It wouldn‚Äôt stop so I went to a local Covid testing center and found out that I have the virus. Turns out, tr*mp is responsible for how many people in this country are sick. Also, I feel like every time I blink, I‚Äôm losing brain cells. I just watched 25 seconds of keeping up with the kardashians. That‚Äôs 24 seconds longer than I‚Äôve ever made it into that show. I feel like with each fleeting moment, I care more and more about what rich people do in their ‚Äúnormal lives‚Äù. Thank you Mr. President for allowing me to download a small capacity app that allows me to finally let my racism and bigotry boil to the utmost brim of myself. I think I speak for all the toothless, fat, mindless, deplorables, when I say, ‚Äútrump 2020 let‚Äôs keep America a racist joke‚Äù","title":"Beware!!","rating":1,"userName":"Johntc1185"}},{"id":"6179305199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:45:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I‚Äôll trust the underside of a toilet seat at Taco Bell before I trust this app.","title":"Horrifyingly Bad","rating":1,"userName":"lilsteamer420"}},{"id":"6179304980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:45:15Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Jdudhdhehndndbdbhdhdhshhshshshhshshhddbbebehehebdbbdhxuxuxjxnxnxbxbdhhdhehdhhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdhxhhxhhxhxhxhxyyxyxyxyyxyxyxyyxyxyxyyxyyxyyshehehbebebebdbdbdbbdbxbxhxhxhhxbxbxbxbbxbxhxhxhxhhxhdhdhdhgdvdbdbdbdndnndndnxjjxjxjxhxhchhxhhxhxjxjjxjxjdjdjsjjsjesnsnsnbsbsbzbbzbbxbhxhxhxhhxhhxhxhhxhhxhhhxhhxhxhhxhxhhxhxhxhhxhxhhxhxhxhxhxhxhdhdhshhshshhshshhshshshhshshhhshshhshhshshshhshshshshhshshshshshhshshshshshshshhshsshhshshshhshshshshshshshhshshshshshhshshshshshhshsbsbsbsbbsbsbbsbxbxbzbbzbxvvxvxvzggzgzgzgsghsbsgsgsgsgsgsggshshshsyyshsbsbsbbsbshshshbsbzbxbxhhzhzhhsuusjsjsjbsbsbsbsbjsjsjsjsjuzuzujzhzhzhzhzhzhhzhzhhzhzhshhshshshhshshhshshshshhshshsh","title":"Jehoshaphat","rating":1,"userName":"Scarletdew"}},{"id":"6179304672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:45:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as i opened the app with hamster got out his cage ran to my phone and pooped on it.... it gets worse...... ate the poop...... pooped on my phone again.... ate it..... threw it up on my phone....... then my cat my to my phone..... ate the puke....... and ate my hamster...... it was all because of trump and his stupid app. So this is why you shouldn‚Äôt download this app!!!","title":"Don‚Äôt download","rating":1,"userName":"cameronü§¶üèΩ\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è"}},{"id":"6179304593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:45:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Terrible app. Took all of my personal info and had so many bugs, destroyed my phone.","title":"just save Barron","rating":1,"userName":"idjdbshavsksd snshzbsns"}}]}
