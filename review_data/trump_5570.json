But as soon as it downloaded, my phone began to freeze up and then wouldnt turn on. When i tried to fix it, the phone exploded. my mom was so mad at me for breaking my rose gold iphone 11 XL that she sold me to a man named Jumin Han. now he locks me up in a cage and ties me up and wont stop calling me his cat. all i wanted was to support President Lump :(","title":"TERRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6174419124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:15:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"miss Nikki thicky","review":"I clicked on this app and then I saw a disgusting Dusty crusty musty Chito it made me lose my appetite and then don’t we started about the people in this community on the app it’s just disgusting with all the cans and don’t get me started about his speeches you sound like a distorted and disgusting Donald duck and also his campaign he says he wants to make America great again isn’t that the same thing that Hitler said they have a lot in common by the way do you Donald Trump this is for Donald Trump if you’re reading this message I think you look better if you were a mayor of a small town in America","title":"A disgusting racist orange Chito"}},{"id":"6174379696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:03:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Madison McGivern","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer testwill begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","title":"It’s a no for me..."}},{"id":"6174302145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:38:21Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"fatsquidwardco0chie","review":"Horrified at the moment , i opened this app really excited and glancing through it . When i get a notification of a naked cheeto man asking me if i wanted to play a game . of course, curious i reply asking who this is . It was Donald Trump personally asking me if i wanted to play a game . i said sure , why wouldn’t i accept to play a game with the famous cheeto man . He proceeds to send me my address . i was petrified of my safety being at risk so i go a lot with it . The game was a several dares and the last one ending with me committing suicide . I can’t believe the apple store would ever allow for such an app to be available .","title":"blue whale"}},{"id":"6174280703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:31:12Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Obama was way better","review":"As soon as I opened the app I saw a horrific picture of an orange man 🤮. I’m very traumatized and will never be the same ever again. This app is the last app you’ll ever need or use. It spells Trash with a capital T. I’m sure many people fee the same way about this app. I’m very unsatisfied and will never re download again. This is the last time I use an app that includes a man with a spray tan that went wrong. HORRIBLY wrong. I feel so bad for anyone that had to witness the same things I did. The only thing this app will teach you is racism. Get rid of this nightmare as soon as possible ❌.","title":"Make it stop ASAP"}},{"id":"6174254662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:22:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bencongk","review":"This app deserves its 1 star review! I downloaded it to support my favorite president but he is no longer my favorite. I opened the app and saw trump in a hot tub😭 my eyes started to itch really bad I’m now currently blind in one eye! The app lagged out so bad that it pulled up my safari search history that was shrek! I was near my family and you ruined our relationship we are Mormon and strictly forbid shrek in the household. As I was re opening the app to see if that would fix it my phone crashed as soon as I turned it back on he was my background Trump was:( I hate this app and I do not support trump anymore","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6174240565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:17:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"MlCH3AL","review":"Hello my name is Mike and I’d like to talk about my experience with this app.I am truly disgusted of what happened... let me explain. So when I open this app the first thing I saw was a dancing pickle. It was truly disturbing and horrifying. Also I clicked on a button and it brought me to A website that made me spend $14 million and now I don’t know what to do. And I clicked on settings and it asked me where my location was where I lived in my personal information. And then I saw another dancing pickle spanking a dancing shadow. I cannot believe this. Please remove this from the App Store. Thank you","title":"This is horrifying!!"}},{"id":"6174063058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"showhwow","review":"i downloaded this app hoping i can get alerts and updates from MY president 💕but instead i got spammed with emails from iraq and russia 🙄🤚 that’s not even the worst part ladies and gents i then get these random pictures of ROACHES!!!

As soon as i opened the app, my house became flooded with demons and ghosts that actually killed my brother at the ripe age of 9. Then as i tried to delete the app because of the monstrosities it had done to my family, thousands of images of trump pooping his pants started popping up, so many pictures i couldn’t even delete the app. i eventually had to destroy my phone with a sledgehammer to get this to stop. i’m typing this review on something else don’t worry about it.  0/5 stars i hate this app and this country :(","title":"WORST APP IVE EVER SEEN"}},{"id":"6174035815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:01:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hatedapp","review":"This app is so disorganized. It gives nonstop notifications the minute you open it up. It takes at least an hour for a new page to load unless every single app on your phone is closed AND all your tabs in your search engine are closed. This app is so terrible, when you try to work it, it takes so long to load or glitches and goes on to the wrong page. It doesn’t even look like an app, mobile setup. It looks like it should be for a computer. I opened one page and it was coding for the page. Do not download this app.","title":"Bad"}}]}
