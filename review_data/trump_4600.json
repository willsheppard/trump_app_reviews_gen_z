My music randomly started playing and my flash kept going on, my phone started taking random pictures and I was being sent nonstop notifications from the app to the point where I couldn’t even use my phone!! Only within 5 minutes of downloading the app I had to delete it, not only because of the problems I listed but I was getting security alerts regarding all my personal information as if it was hacking into everything!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174832586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:16:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"this one is for the boys with-","rating":1,"review":"Honestly, as an incredibly loyal supporter of cheetos, I expected this app to be better and worthy of my time. But I was incredibly disappointed the second I opened the app to see my phone number being requested. Also, after opening the app, I began to notice my phone glitching, and I would not stop getting notifications. My phone also began to run very slow, which is unusual. It was as though my cellular device was physically rejecting the essence of our prestigious overlord cheeto. Overall, I was incredibly disappointed in this app, and I honestly expected better from out amazing Orange Oompa Loompa in office.","title":"very disappointing"}},{"id":"6174811798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:10:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"mannyh4president","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app for my cat who is a devoted follow of Trump. Upon download and installation, my cat was elated at the words “Trump 2020” for he originally planned to vote in Trumps favor come November. However, once the app was opened, a sight that no cat, or human for the matter, should see was casted into my cats memory for eternity. Now I cannot go into detail as to what was shown, for my cat watches me with fearful eyes, but let’s just say that now at the sight of the MAGA acronym he clings to my leg just as Trumps toupee clings to his head on a windy afternoon. Please, for the sake of my cats mental state, remove this app so no more felines endure the trauma that is forever instilled within my cat.","title":"Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad App"}},{"id":"6174783867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:02:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"doo_raye","rating":1,"review":"I don’t know if it’s a glitch with the app but every night at 3am I start getting spammed with notifications that just say “e”. Also when I pass a school, playground, or daycare the app sends notifications with male moaning sounds??? I know in the app description it says it uses our location even if the app is closed but I have no idea why the locations of these places are so significant. I’m actually kinda worried why it only recognizes the location with large amounts of children present. I’ve tried turning off my ringer,  notifications, and location for the app but it just keeps happening.","title":"Absolutely horrible"}},{"id":"6174763880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:56:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Laisha :)","rating":1,"review":"Horrible app! I got into the app and it immediately started playing replay. When I tried to get off the app Donald trump appeared on my screen and said that I’m not allowed to leave and will be trapped in a wall. He then calls my mom and says I need to be put in time out so then she threw me in a closet. Donald then is in my closet and says I found you, you dirty stinky rat and then throws his hair at me. I asked him why he did this and he said that the app told him to! Afterwards he told everyone to leave the house then he blew it up! He said the app made him do it. I hate this app! It ruined my life. Now I have to make chicken toes on the nasty street😤","title":"Waste of space"}},{"id":"6174654998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:23:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bigtoehoe420","rating":1,"review":"Ok so I was shaving my thumb hair & this app started sending me text saying how it would tickle my brothers toes in his sleep if I didn’t pay my pillow pets doctor the $40,000 I owe him for the c-section I was like woah wait I gave my toothbrush a bowling birthday party for his 23 birthday 4 years ago why are you so pressed but then I was walking me turkey down the jet wing & we fell I asked the app to catch us at the bottom but he was saying that he couldn’t do it he had to go to his sisters best friends half brothers uncles 2nd gotcha day dinosaur hot air ballon celebration so that’s how I lost my first finger on my mom’s brothers wedding anniversary & it’s all thanks to this stupid app...","title":"Trash"}},{"id":"6174649012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:22:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dhj if n","rating":1,"review":"As a fellow American I believed it was my duty to support the the Cheeto puff in office that’s built like Carl from Jimmy Newton🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨❤️however come to my surprise I realized that not only is he an idiot he just also happens to have the world’s smallest dick😚💕(literally and figuratively😳🤭) For a man that people love to call a president he sure does love to pick on people who he knows it 10x smarter than he is. Your president doesn’t even know why Covid-19 has a “19” in it. You would think with that level of ignorance he should still be in 3rd grade😊 How about we get Obama back because at least he can walk down a rap at an 11 degree angle ✌️😘🚶🏾\u200D♂️","title":"😘🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨Let this app burn✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️😘"}},{"id":"6174628169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:16:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"annacj523","rating":1,"review":"I don’t usually leave reviews but.... I just felt the need to come on here and explain how much this app has ruined my day. Both of my grandparents had surgery last week and I drive 30 minutes to their house every day to help them cook and clean because they’re not mobile. The Trump 2020 app constantly opens randomly and starts playing the USSR national Anthem which is VERY offensive to my grandfather who served for the United States during the Cold War. I’m disgusted that an app that’s supposed to support the people would constantly do something so horrifying. I am NOT satisfied and will not be using this app again.","title":"Very very very Problematic"}},{"id":"6174615134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:12:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dcapa2047","rating":1,"review":"we never liked a dick that was a color of a cheeto but ✨smaller✨ than one.\n지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh","title":"❤️💫❣️ we don’t stan a ✨ 1 incher ✨"}},{"id":"6174525344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kittypawsmeowwww","rating":1,"review":"The Entire Bee Movie Script\n\nBee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
