I downloaded this app to support president 🍊. I have never been more disappointed. I downloaded it on my perfectly good Samsung smart refrigerator and it took almost 2 hours to download. Not only that but the screen kept glitching to this 🟠man!!! Then after looking at the app the orange man appeared and started breaking my refrigerator!!! 😱😱😱.
