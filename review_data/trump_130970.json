I always knew trump was a Cheeto but I didn’t think he would try and eat his own kind. Really disappointed in this man. After this strange ordeal I yeeted myself to a Milwaukee Mavericks game. On my way to the game I saw a couple of females braiding each other’s beards, strange right. My girlfriend broke up with because she loved me, so I’m pretty bummed out and this app didn’t make it better. I asked the app to kill my Ex because it claims to make America great again.","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174445218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"shdhdjdjdijs","title":"I’m gonna be terrified for life👁💧👄💧👁","review":"I AM ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED. When I first opened the app there was a overweight buffoon peeling the skin of a chicken nugget and then the buffoon shoved the chicken nugget skin up his nostrils and then ate it!!!! IT WAS SO DISGUSTING. My brother watching this started puking everywhere and started crying. My parents rushed him to the hospital and the doctors found out he had a bunch of FAT COWS THE HE WAS GONNA POOP OUT!!! My parents were so worried so they passed out. I took out my phone to delete the app but MY PHONE TURNED INTO A PICKLE AND STARTED TO GROW SHOOTER THINGYS AND STARTED TO SHOOT MINI PICKLES AT ME. I WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS.😡😡😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174445025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Oezette Pantoja","title":"Very rude","review":"I downloaded the app to see when the next trump rally would be then my phone glitches out and my house began to fly 😨 and took me all the way to dc where i met a weird Cheeto looking man And my dogs came out and tore all my Trump 2020 posters down 😭 and attacked the Cheeto 😭😭😭💔💔💔 and then I deleted the app and my house flew back and my house was ruined -204948737/10 do not recommend 😔👁👄👁✋🏻","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174444919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Nagito Komeda🤜🥩🥵","title":"Nagito Komeda🤜🥩🥵","review":"The Entire Bee Movie Script\n\nBee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
