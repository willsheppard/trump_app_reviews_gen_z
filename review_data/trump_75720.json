You can imagine my surprise when as soon as I downloaded the app, the clouds immediately went dark. I thought nothing of it at the time, but as soon as the blood started pouring down from the skies I got a little concerned. Once I actually opened the app, it was basically like the 10 and plagues all over again. Now I could stomach the locusts, frogs, and the boils showing up all over my body, even all of the livestock dying, but when my older brother was struck down by God himself, in the middle of the night, I was a little irritated because he still owed me $20 and I couldn’t find his wallet. You can imagine my frustration when I couldn’t shower because of the whole “water turns to blood thing.” I haven’t been able to shower in 3 days, and I’ve been on the verge of death due to dehydration. I continued to look through the app, and then I heard weird groaning noises from outside. Sure enough, it was world war Z all over again. Every single corpse within a 100 mile radius was making its way towards my house. Even my brother was resurrected, and when I asked for the $20 he owed me, he growled at me, and then his tongue fell out. A little convenient if you ask me. I was fed up with the stench, (he honestly needed a shower more than I did) and I deleted the app. The skies immediately cleared up, the locusts left, and the blood turned back to water. My brother was still dead, only now he was lying dead in my kitchen, and of course I was the only one home so *I* had to get rid of the body, typical of my family to make me do all the work. Anyways, I don’t recommend getting this app, it wasn’t very informative, 1/10.","userName":"yourfavdaddy","title":"This app ruined my life."}},{"id":"6177831030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:49:58Z","review":"this app keeps crashing every time i try to use it, how else am i supposed to know when rallies are so i can show support?? such a shame.","userName":"fritschietk3","title":"glitchy, super glitchy."}},{"id":"6177819790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:46:39Z","review":"It forced me to use all my money to post a racist orange.
