Then the tv wouldn’t turn off which made my family mad . Then my neighbor heard it and come to my house and proceeded to do the worm in the middle of the living room which mad mice come out of the ground. The mice proceeded to dance with him and my family tried to stop them but we couldn’t get the app to delete so now my neighbor is still dancing and every few days one of my family members joins him. Also my pet tarantula decided to throw it back but the mice didn’t like that so they forced my neighbor to eat her while he continued to do the worm. Any suggestions on what to do?","isEdited":false,"userName":"MANNNNNYYY123456786543","title":"This app sucks🗑","date":"2020-07-08T18:00:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173185379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"grrrr✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"claudicábamos","title":"Ugly app tryna ban tik tok🔪🔪🔪❄️❄️","date":"2020-07-08T17:59:54Z","rating":1}}]}
