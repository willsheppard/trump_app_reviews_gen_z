It can’t be true!” And to that I solemnly reply, “Yes. It’s true.” This app didn’t make me get stage 4 cancer, but it made me wish I did. If I was terminally ill, it would give me less pain than when I opened the app. At first, I was excited. No, ESTATIC even. I downloaded it with hopes of helping America. But as soon as I opened it, it began. Due to the excessive amount of personal information that it asked of me, for example my B.M.I and PR mile run time, it used all of it against me in order to bully me. For days it physiologically abused me. Then it heard my dog bark. This is where it got ugly. It tormented my dog by playing knocking sounds so he thought his old owner who died in the Vietnam war and never returned came back, thus triggering his panic attacks. I gave him his prescribed CBD oil, yet it failed to calm his cry’s of agony from the suffocating pain of his loss. To attempt to rid myself of his heart-wrenching sounds, I have him the entire bottle of oil, unfortunately overdosing him. As he lay there foaming at the mouth and seizing, I could hear the voice of Trump laughing and repeating the phrase: “Make America Great Again”. Fast forward to 1 week later, to the present, where I constantly have night terrors of the ordeal. When I water my plants, the echoing screams of my past haunt me. This in return caused me to burn every plant around and in my house. Because I murdered them all, I’ve been passing out every hour due to the lack of oxygen around me. I think I have 2 days left, max. I can’t even go outside to get fresh oxygen because Trump and his followers said that masks don’t help and don’t need to be worn, yet no one will let me go anywhere without a mask. I’m so confused. Please. If you are reading this, it’s a cry for help. This is in no way or manner satire or a joke. I can’t call 911 because I couldn’t work in my current state of health and now my data plan was canceled. I write this using the hotspot of the mailman, Ted, who read my mail and told me I wasn’t accepted to UC Berkley, despite my 10,000,000 hours of community service I did ever since I was 3 years old. I think Ted is leaving now. Just please please please please please DONT download this app because although the trauma might make your humor better, it will rot your brain and life from the inside out.
