Fish can be depressed too. But anyways, so before I downloaded it I looked at all the important info, for example the reviews obviously, and I read some pretty negative things but I still kept some hope. I should‚Äôve listened to the reviews. So in the details it says it may use my location even when it isn‚Äôt open, and it could decrease my battery life. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because most apps do that, right? Oh how wrong I was. The second the app was downloaded, a black van pulled up in my driveway and a bunch of men in snazzy black suits and sunglasses burst thru our door and broke it because they said it was red, and they hate the color red. They then preceded to take all of our toilet paper, combs, and tanning items and threw it into their van and when we asked why they said it was for the ‚Äúboss man.‚Äù They then threw us in our tree and burned our house down. And when we asked them to call the fire department they said no, because what color are fire trucks? Red. And they HATE the color red. So now I am living with the rats, which are pretty chill ngl.  If it can‚Äôt get any worse, remember how it said it would decrease battery life? I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, until I got a call. Apparently the day that I downloaded the app, my grandmothers life support was randomly unplugged but no one was by it so she died. Wrong battery life dudes.","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:16Z","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6172585708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lulmarc2xx","review":"Took 2 years to download","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:03Z","title":"Trash"}},{"id":"6172563269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"HJohhdjsba","review":"I got it then just deleted it straight away","date":"2020-07-08T14:53:50Z","title":"It‚Äôs just the WORST app in the world"}},{"id":"6172514964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Albert78M","review":"Theres so many bugs and I want tik tok to stay on the App Store and not to be banned in the us please MAKE THE APP STORE GREAT AGAIN!","date":"2020-07-08T14:40:15Z","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6172486577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"john ogl","review":"I got the app but then I got corona and cancer we tested me and I‚Äôm so sick don‚Äôt download it‚Äôs dangerous","date":"2020-07-08T14:32:19Z","title":"Gave me cancer"}}]}
