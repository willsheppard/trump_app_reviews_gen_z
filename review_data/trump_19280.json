Anyway that night I was going to bed but I saw something out my window! It looked like a fat wrinkled Cheeto... BUT NO‼️ it was Donald Trump‼️\nHe had a huge knife!!

Would not recommend.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:27:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sammy lover 2561"}},{"id":"6178294687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Literally the worst","review":"Honestly I was hoping to find some clear information from our articulate and definitely not illiterate president. Instead I got a heap of confusing disorganized information and an app that crashes every 2 seconds. It’s an awful app that is terribly set up and honestly deserves less than one star.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:25:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"😑🤮🤢😤🤬"}},{"id":"6178275217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App was horrible","review":"I opened it and it was constantly crashing and all of a sudden I see another app that was getting downloaded. I came to conclusions that this app is extremely bad and that it also had a virus, to put the cherry on top. This app is not safe and should be removed from the App Store to keep others safe.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:18:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KI_theNoob"}},{"id":"6178268387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":":(","review":"honestly one of the worst apps I’ve ever downloaded. it took me an hour to open it up after downloading and then it still was so slow after running it for a while! very disappointed 😭 with all the money ‘president’ trump has you’d think he could pay for an app to work correctly. do NOT download 😌 xoxo","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:15:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sporty1001"}},{"id":"6178256137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad news","review":"After I downloaded this app a series of unfortunate events kept happening to me. First, my dog grandma got run over by a reindeer. Next, my dad left to get milk and never came back. Lastly the demon that slept in my closet decided to make moves on me and now every time I wake up my clothes are half off. If I could rate it a 0 I would, for the safety of humanity.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:10:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"vbucksinfinitywar"}},{"id":"6178224243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app is terrible jus like trump 🧚🏽\u200D♀️","review":"so i rlly wanted to download this app to support our 🍊 president 🍊 even tho he is a child predator and racist but it’s fine we don’t rlly care right? 😊 anywaysss it took sooooo long to download for no reason cause when i finally got to open the app it was a piece of crap jus like our 🍊president 🍊 i understand they worked rlly hard making this 🧚🏽\u200D♀️❤️💗💓 but next time they need to just not try ❤️💗💓 and i know effort is key 💗🧚🏽\u200D♀️❤️💕 but they should just throw the key away 😍❤️💕💓. anyways i rlly wanted to support our one and only nude exposed oompa loompa president but the app is terrible. 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:59:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"a trump supporter 😍🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6178207997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sorry, but bad app.","review":"I downloaded the app thinking that I’d like it. However, it took weeks to download and Mr. Willy Wonka told me that I was a bad nut. Then, the sky turned pink and my eyes began crying rainbows. I promptly started to faint every time someone opened the app. So, this app has been very bad for my health and I cannot condole anyone else going through the pain that I went through.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:53:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cakeisyumbutcupcakeisyum"}},{"id":"6178171853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitchiest App On My Phone!!","review":"I downloaded this app to check what’s happening with Trumps campaign, but what I received was appalling. I would receive almost propaganda like content by the hour from the campaign which spreads hateful and biased jargon. This campaign really shows that Trump is too divisive for this country and therefore an app that promotes his rhetoric should be taken down.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:41:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ramay03"}},{"id":"6178171644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Whoop whoop ✅tiktok✅","review":"I’ve had this app for over a minute and am already annoyed and frustrated because it’s trying to call but I don’t want that and I say decline but it keeps calling me and I am very confused why it’s sending me notifications even tho I said don’t allow this is a disgrace just like the orange talking thing we have as a president 🙂","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:41:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"here from that video😐"}}]}
