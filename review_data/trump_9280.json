He purposely fired a black man for being black and spread the rumor that was Obama was from Kenya. The second reason is that he looks like a orange. He looks like the cutie from the cutie commercial except uglier than a dump truck thrown into garbage island. My final reason is that he cannot handle a country. He literally almost got us to war and we have the most COVID-19 cases because of his poor management skills. This is was the TRUMP 2020 app is the worst app I have ever laid eyes upon.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:00:09Z"}},{"id":"6172785768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😳🤨😐😔","rating":1,"title":"Can’t believe this was allowed on the AppStore.","review":"I opened this app and at initial sight it seemed to be as advertised but I was sorely mistaken. I attempted to enter my phone number in and as soon as I did The president started sending me his grocery list, demanding that I go and deliver it to him. I tried to explain that I couldn’t and didn’t live near but that wasn’t good enough for Donald. He took action to what he believed to be injustice by sending ICE to my door to deport me. I’ve never felt more terrified even now I fear for my safety. 😖","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:56:29Z"}},{"id":"6172713307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Briana's World","rating":1,"title":"I don’t get it","review":"I don’t understand why Trump needs his own app. Obama didn’t need an app. All the other presidents didn’t need an app. So why should Trump? I’m sorry but I personally hate him. He has put my country and family through so much trauma. He is a racist lier. The decisions he make are so pointless. It is scary knowing we have a president who has committed multiple crimes. I’m ready for his impeachment. Yo lead a whole country, you have to be responsible. And so far Trump is nothing of the sort. Thank you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:35:48Z"}},{"id":"6172590073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bruv👁👄👁","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!","review":"I downloaded the app a week ago and it just finished installing TODAY!! I know it’s not my phone because my phone is brand new! This is absolutely unacceptable. I downloaded the app to see some reasons that I shouldn’t hate Trump as much as I already did. This app is completely disgraceful! No wonder it has 2 stars! It should be taken off of the App Store regardless of it he’s the president or not.  If you vote for trump in 2020..there is something seriously wrong with you🥰","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:01:16Z"}},{"id":"6172519678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gen Z representitive","rating":1,"title":"I can’t believe this","review":"I only downloaded this app to see if the president was still horrible. Turns out he is! A long with accusing people of spreading ‘fake news’ he is doing it himself! How dare he have his first rally in Tulsa, OK. How disrespectful are you? On top of that his dumb self said to put disinfectant in our bodies to kill the virus?!? Is he trying to kill us? Now he trying to ban the app that gen z goes to for a great time, TikTok.

This app asked to put my phone number in so I did. I got calls all through the night and at my friends funeral. I tried everything to stop the calls blocking them, saying they have the wrong number, etc. It wouldn’t stop. This app sold my phone number to telemarketers. It eventually got to the point where I had to get a new phone. 0/10.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:36:21Z"}},{"id":"6172236480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😚🤍🥰","rating":1,"title":"This app is disgusting and horrible","review":"I tried to support my favorite Oompa Loompa✨ by downloading his game but when I clicked on it the orange Cheeto  started to glitch out and then his ninjas came into my house and tried to kill me and my family because I was gonna give a 1 star rating instead of a 5 but i got out by building a wall that the orange showed me how to build but when they were gone the app crashed and my phone blew up but at least I didn’t have to see his dirty orange face ✨🥳","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:24:01Z"}}]}
