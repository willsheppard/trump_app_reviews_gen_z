It made me sign something that said if you support him you're racist, homophobic, and misogynistic. Even though it’s true it’s so crazy he would put that in his app!! It made me take a test to make sure I'm a horrible person in order to support him. Theres a tab where he’ll pay African Americans 1,000$ to pretend to support him!
