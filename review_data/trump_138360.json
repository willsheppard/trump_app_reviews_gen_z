Since downloading this app I have seen more fake news on it then on cnn. If you doubt the social power of gen z think again. This app will soon be removed from the App Store because of a bunch of kids. I’m truly surprised to say that this app was terrible! I can’t even vote yet and I can see through all the madness and twisted lies coming from this campaign.","title":"No❤️","rating":1,"userName":"trump 2020🧚🏻\u200D♂️💖but retired"}},{"id":"6179757216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:21:46Z","isEdited":false,"review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this app, liberals from social media (most likely TikTok) are trying to get this app banned because \nA.

I was like “ugh, why is the orange famous?” So I decided I wanna download the app to see what would happen. Right? WELL I SHOULDN'T HAVE!! The second I downloaded the  app a rotten orange popped up on my screen. I thought it was some joke, but THEN he asked me for my number! This is extremely rude as he has a wife and kids. So I tried to get rid of the app but I couldn’t! All the oranges in my house started controlling me!!! I got so angry, so I just went to sleep. But there was no getting away for this guy, because in MY DREAM let me repeat MY DREAM, KAREN AND THE ORANGE WERE THERE!! So then I said “I think not you trick little orange!” And I uppercut him. Then Karen said “LeT mE sPeAk tO yOuR mAnAgEr” so I said How about you let me speak to your manager? And put my finger right in her face. She was SHOOKETH. I said Serves you right you ugly orange Karen. Then I woke up only to find myself spray tanned orange with the words oranges 2020!! I was so mad so I washed it off and went to find this orange. I found him at the White House chuckling to himself. “Hey!” I shouted and he was so shocked that I didn’t give up. He tried to run away but I caught him. I used my magical powers and said ABRACADABRA ALAKAZOO but nothing happened. I do not recommend getting this app because he is crazy. Thank you 😌","title":"Orange man, I think NOT!","rating":1,"userName":"shnsnsbsnauns sensjdjshhdbs"}},{"id":"6179756251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:21:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I had high hopes for this app that is would give the full essence of what it means to be an American. But all I got was a weird orange clown staring at me when I opened it. Have to say guys if this was supposed to be a indi jump scare game.. yikes needs some work. I mean the only thing that was scary of the character was his straw yellowed hair and deep orange skin. Frankly I found the tiny hands adorable though. But because of how lame the game play was I have to give it a low score.","title":"Meh","rating":1,"userName":"ygo champ"}}]}
