I tried to open the app and I was this orange Cheeto in front of my screen and it made me go into shock. I started having a seizure due to the pain of looking at this grown man looking like my cousins chips he has next to me. After I got over that, I saw that the app then asked for my personal info. Then it crashed my new android phone 😤 0/10 would not download again.","title":"App really isn’t it","userName":"Remember the times we had 👅","date":"2020-07-09T17:49:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177630367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m a supporter of Trump, but that doesn’t mean I support everything he does. Banning Tik Tok is not “punishing” China or going to hurt them. All it’s going to do is hurt America and half of its Advertisement agencies. Most teens, young adults, and some older Americans use Tik Tok as escapism and for fun. Why take that away from us just because China were the lead programmers of the app? And what’s next? YouTube? Sony? Or whatever else website or app is made by some country or organization that might be against us? That’s not going to do anything to the people that made the app, it’s only going to hurt the people using it. The users and influencers. \nPlus, this Donald Trump app is glitchy as hell.","title":"Save Tik Tok","userName":"KerryWhite17","date":"2020-07-09T17:48:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177629563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not good.

I was laying on a cold, metal table, wearing nothing but a thin grey hospital gown. \n\nI was surrounded in the room by about eight or nine men in white robes. The only color in the room came from the red insignias on the chest. The robes even covered their heads, leading to a large pointed tip. \n\nAs soon as I had processed what was going on around me, the lights changed, and the chanting started. \n\nAt this point, I couldn’t tell you what they were saying. All I could process were the black and white waves of light piercing my eyes. \n\nThen, Cheeto Puff’s voice whispered in my ear, “vote for me, nobody can president better than I can. Corona is just a conspiracy. I faced corona better than anyone. My numbers are the best. I’m the best” \n\nI then woke up, with my head in a puddle of dirty road water on the side of Main Street, where I was when I opened the app. \n\nI was covered in gunk and felt disgusting. I also felt some sort of tingling pain in my butt. I wonder if they proved me. \n\nI will not be voting for Cheeto. And I do not recommend downloading the app. It will ruin your life.","title":"Disappointed","userName":"Kb472894","date":"2020-07-09T17:48:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
