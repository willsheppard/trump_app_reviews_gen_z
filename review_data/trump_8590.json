And I am very confused as to why that was happening, I with thinking maybe it had a virus, but then I am not lying about this I got an actual warning stating one of my apps where detected with a virus. This app I do not recommend!!!","rating":1,"title":"I would never ever recommend this app.","userName":"i dont recomend!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T17:13:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177509948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not going to lie, but I don‚Äôt know how Trump plans to make America great again if he can‚Äôt even make a great app. Considering social media and technology plays a huge role in today‚Äôs life, I was disappointed, but not surprised a boomer couldn‚Äôt even get it right. Overall I would rate this a 1/5 stars because constantly crashes and glitches my phone. Ruining my phone, just like Trump ruined America. I think he Jinxed America with his ‚Äúmake America great again‚Äù slogan.","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed but not Surprized","userName":"All funny nicknames are taken","date":"2020-07-09T17:10:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177481904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was so scary when I opened it I saw the orange man my dog got scared and ran away. I started crying so I jumped of the window to get my dog I had scratches and the when I look back at the app the orange man was still there! This is a really bad app. He doesn‚Äôt even like Mexicans like what is wrong with that orange. I thought oranges were supposed to be sweet but not this one, or even Sebastian bails. I rate this app a one star I would put zero if I wanted to but I can‚Äôt! And then I died because of this orange dude.üòû","rating":1,"title":"This app killed me","userName":"ramiro the cool guy","date":"2020-07-09T17:01:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177475416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app in the whole App Store! This app should be removed for the following reasons:\nIt made my teeth fall out!!!! The moment I downloaded this app my teeth started falling out! Reason number two is that when I downloaded the app it took my rationality and common sense away!! Ever since this horrible app my head hurts so bad, my eye sight seems to be getting worse and my back hurts all the time. Almost like as if this app is only for old, ignorant, selfish, racist, and uneducated people.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE!","userName":"gen z‚ú®üßöüèº","date":"2020-07-09T16:59:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177460793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app... is by far the worst app I‚Äôve ever used. I opened it and it crashed my phone. I then had to delete and reinstall, I repeated this several times and was finally able to put my phone number in. Once I did I got a text. Which than hacked my phone and took all important data and login information. My bank account went from $20k down to $0. \nIf you get this it‚Äôs Not worth the risküò≠","rating":1,"title":"Had high hopes.

Since downloading this app my ‚Äúsuggested ads‚Äù have increased TENFOLD. It seems as if this app is leaking my information. What‚Äôs worse is I‚Äôve been getting facebook friend requests from RUSSIA!!! Cannot believe Trump would use this app to data mine and sell our information to the commies. Apple, please do what‚Äôs right for the American people and take down this terrible app!","rating":1,"title":"Actually terrible","userName":"Trump is a Communist","date":"2020-07-09T15:54:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177125688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I would‚Äôve thought the president of the United States, a man with access to the cyber security and software developmental powers of the United States Government would have the power to create a functional app, but it doesn‚Äôt even run longer then 5 min. The user interface is like deciphering cryptography, and it‚Äôs not at all interactive from a user standpoint. I thought the president would be better than this, but I guess all his administration has done is prove otherwise.","rating":1,"title":"Presidential resources?","userName":"uskiwich","date":"2020-07-09T15:19:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177041969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Every time I try to open this app i am greeted with a white screen... I‚Äôve waited hours.. days... weeks even and no matter what I do all I see is a white screen. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and re-downloading  multiple times, the only thing that changes is occasionally I will get a ‚Äúwhites only‚Äù pop up that I can never get past?! I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with this app but I‚Äôm deleting it for good. Extremely disappointed.
