It went through all my pictures, chose the ugliest ones of me,  and posted them to my Facebook!!

I downloaded this app to find creative ways to express my non racist, non homophobic, and non misogynistic ideas. What i found was the exact opposite to my surprise! Who would’ve thought 🙃 also I was expecting everything to be Cheeto themed and for some reason he’s spouting off about “keep America great” ? But I don’t remember a time when the Cheeto was in charge that it was great 🤷\u200D♀️ food for thought."}},{"id":"6176249016","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"karen 1236","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"horrifying","date":"2020-07-09T11:20:26Z","review":"took 2 days to download app, once downloaded had to update which took 8 hours. every time i open the app, it shuts down my phone and is also draining my battery. the app’s visuals are also confusing and give me a headache, and it tried to lead me to a pop up website to porn.🤮🤮 As a lover of our great country, i can not let terrible apps ruin our citizens lives."}},{"id":"6176133293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nataliao3212","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"everything here was made in china pam","date":"2020-07-09T10:44:57Z","review":"I think the main difference between me and donald trump is that i get no pleasure out of saying the words \"you're fired\" he just makes people sad... and an office cant function that way...this app took 7 hours to download! It also ask for authorization of my social media accounts like my password! You know what they say, fool me once strike one, but fool me twice... strike three"}},{"id":"6176112608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"djp017","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T10:38:26Z","review":"When I downloaded this app it was so I could support my president. After it finally downloaded I couldn't stop using it, it was so addictive. Every minute of everyday I had to support daddy trump. 🤤🤤 I hit rock bottom 2 months ago when I woke up in a ditch with no job, money, or pants.😢 I have been clean for 2 months from supporting and yet my mouth still waters everytime I think of him😍💕 THIS APP WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE RUN WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE."}},{"id":"6176088361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jdkwjbf","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting.","date":"2020-07-09T10:30:44Z","review":"As soon as I opened the app I saw pictures of naked young girls doing inappropriate things on it. It made me so uncomfortable, all I could see was pictures and videos of old men trying to force themselves on young teenage girls without their will and it was really disturbing for me and my kid who thought it would be a good idea to check the news. Kindly remove this app from the app store to prevent any further damage on anyone. Thanks."}},{"id":"6175969998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TheHardGamer347!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is dog","date":"2020-07-09T09:52:38Z","review":"This app took hours to download and when it did I found out it was deleting all my personal data and leaking my address and phone number to the public the worst thing this app did was block my contacts and spam everyone in my state trump 2020 and with my address being leaked I had multiple people throw rocks at my house and even broke into my car and steal 120 bucks.

This app is a SCAM. The app requires access to a lot of personal information for it to function. It’s practically spying on you. Besides that it took FOREVER to download and takes up to much space. After 3 days of having this app ,my phone started glitching and the app started kicking me out. A complete waste of space on my phone and doesn’t work properly, do not bother downloading."}},{"id":"6175797505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"save barron🦋🦋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Developed in China","date":"2020-07-09T08:55:13Z","review":"I got this app to support my president, but after 8 months of waiting for it to download, I was upset to find out this was fully developed in China! This app shared my private information and I began being stalked by a local predator. Do not recommend!!! This app ruined my life, now I have to move cities, dye my hair, change my name, and tint my skin orange in an attempt to save myself from the predator who used this app to track me."}}]}
