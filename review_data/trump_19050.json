However, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that there was no such photo-editing option or option to take photos with the phone camera at all! I feel lied to and deceived and for that reason this will be receiving a 1 star from yours truly. \n\nHopefully this review will help keep others from falling for the same trickery and fraudulence as I have.\n\nWith best regards,\nXx_throbbingpulsating2inpussyslayer69_xX","rating":1,"title":"Didn’t make my 🍆😳🙈 bigger","isEdited":false,"userName":"Common Sense Thomas Paine","date":"2020-07-09T04:45:51Z"}},{"id":"6175077185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After downloading this app, Michigan had a bunch of consecutive 90 degree and above days. If you’re from Michigan or the northern part of the United States, you know that it is very rare for the weather to get that hot. Like we’re about to set a record for number of 90 degree days in a row. So I’m not saying that this app causes global warming... but this is all a little much to be coincidence.","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"This is myreview","date":"2020-07-09T04:31:54Z"}},{"id":"6175068793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app made me go into a deep depression and i had a severe breakdown and was admitted to the hospital. this app looks like something my dog pooped out when he had to much chocolate to eat and let me tell you, it wasn’t pretty. i don’t know who made this, if it was the oompa loompa looking guy or his workers but it is not good. please take it down before someone else is sent to the E.R. because of this.","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE DEPRESSION","isEdited":false,"userName":"lumpa82539","date":"2020-07-09T04:29:18Z"}},{"id":"6175068331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Idk why but whenever I open up this app just a picture of the grinch shows up!

When I close the app she’s still singing. It only stops once in a while, but that’s only because she’s reciting her random sentences. Oh sorry I mean poems. Anyways the only way I can stop this chaos is to delete the app. I thoughts this app was about people sharing their mutated Cheeto collections, but I guess not.","rating":1,"title":"Traumatized","isEdited":false,"userName":"manny the flag","date":"2020-07-09T04:09:27Z"}}]}
