Firstly, the download time. A whopping 5 days for the app to completely download into my phone. Was very disappointed. I shrugged it off, and I thought, “Well, at least I get to support my favorite president now!” But no! Every time I pressed a button, it would take around ten seconds for the machine that is my phone to take me to what I clicked. Even the Biden app is faster! This is so embarrassing for us as Trump supporters!","date":"2020-07-08T21:35:22Z","userName":"ji.min"}},{"id":"6173783124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"VERY ANGRY AT THE ORANGE😡🤬","review":"when i downloaded this app i was excited to see what cheeto 🍊 had to offer us but once i downloaded the app i was meet with the police🐷 and almost got forced to give him a five star ⭐️ review and thankfully my chihuahua 🐶 was there to help and defeat these bad men 👮🏻\u200D♂️but it didn’t stop them from calling for backup and arresting me 😱 so i then used my laser eyes 👀 to break free from the cell and when i got my phone 📱 i immediately knew i had to warn 🔪 the public of the terrible things this man has done 😡🍊","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:45Z","userName":"mike wizoski xoooo"}},{"id":"6173765607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"Do not download!!!! I just wanted to support our racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, orange president, but it took forverrrrr to download. One it did, it made my phone glitch so bad, and it kept kicking me out of the app. Then, after a few days, my skin started to look orange!!! After a week, my entire body was orange and my hair was this gross blonde color and it looked like a mop. I deleted the app immediately, and it took so long to get the blonde out of my hair and orange out of my skin. My skin is still kinda yellowish. DO NOT GET THIS APP","date":"2020-07-08T21:20:18Z","userName":"lilym8133"}},{"id":"6173712141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"almost died because of this app","review":"i decided to download this app to learn more about my president but instead got extreme ptsd 😡😡it took longer than the time deadpool took to die to download and when it finished i went to go dry my water. when i came back a llama was sitting on top of my phone pointing at the app looking like it was ready to beat the hell out of me 😱😱my brother then shot himself in an area that can make children with a nerf gun and the llama spit on me. i deleted the app as fast as i could and then an army of oranges 🍊 came marching towards me!!! i flung myself out of the door when the oranges started holding washing machines and yeeting them at me 😡😡i guess i gave my house to those dum oranges because i never saw them again and never went back to my house 😰😰(p.s. my house is also orange 😡)","date":"2020-07-08T21:00:40Z","userName":"s8293"}},{"id":"6173707451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"ruined my life","review":"this app is the worst thing to happen to me. it ruined my marriage. i cant believe i was dumb enough to get this. i stay up every night sobbing because i hate it that much. i have to love every day knowing i once had this app taint i mi u cellular device. i miss my wife but she refuses to speak to me. she took the kids and the dog because of this app on my phone. she said i’m worse than hitler.

I had an important zoom meeting at 12:00, and it was nearing that time. The zoom meeting was with scientists that wanted to discuss with me how we could cure cancer. We were almost there, but I can only access the zoom on my phone. I bet you already see the issue— the app would not load. It was 11:59 and I wanted this app to load so badly but unfortunately it didn’t work. I missed the zoom and I can’t cure cancer now.","date":"2020-07-08T20:49:42Z","userName":"tati lindahl"}},{"id":"6173665880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download!!","review":"This app is the worst app I've ever used. Frankly, I think that whoever designed it never graduated kindergarten. I can't find any useful information, it glitches to the max, and when I use it my battery goes down to 0% almost immediately. I think it also may be selling my data to the Chinese Government.\nThis app personally murdered my entire family and my cat. My cat, man! If you want to keep your information private, and keep your family safe, do not download this.","date":"2020-07-08T20:43:50Z","userName":"Ann6667"}},{"id":"6173620416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Hot garbage💕","review":"As a highly educated citizen of the United States, I knew I had to download this app so I was sure I was getting the very best and most truthful information possible. However, immediately after downloading it my phone got a virus worse than COVID! Naturally I poured bleach on my phone to try and fix everything but for some reason it didn’t work and my phone is even more broken than it was before!! I’m writing this review from my old Wii because I’m outraged and I need my story to be heard. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BOOTY APP","date":"2020-07-08T20:27:39Z","userName":"no❤️🤪"}},{"id":"6173598225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Why it’s the worst app in history","review":"First of all when I downloaded it it took 5 days.
