DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.

I have come to find that I have almost 3x as many telemarketing call than before which leads me to believe that this app leaks personal information. Kinda like how the app tiktok supposedly does. The irony in this is rather hilarious seen as he and his administration are banning the app in America shortly after a group of teenagers formed a peaceful protest on the app. (✨We as teenagers scared him into banning our platform because we have power that we don’t know✨)Overall besides the personal info leaks the app was just unsatisfactory and frankly only gave news that the Trump administration has hand picked. (Vote out ~hate~ 2020) I was underwhelmed as a loyal Trump supporter to find that this app was neither helpful, nor entertaining. (🧚🏻\u200D♀️Being Pro life means being anti police brutality and against children in cages being separated from their families🧚🏻\u200D♀️) I’ll close with this. The vibes were FAR from immaculate :,( \nBecause of these reasons I believe this app deserves a one star."}},{"id":"6172805931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:02:19Z","userName":"vairykosyjosee","rating":1,"title":"I now have chronic depression","review":"I got this app at first because I wanted to see if trump is saying something different on his app, however when I got this app I started to feel strange. Almost the moment I opened it I was watching my life from my eyes, but I wasn’t living it. I then found that all my waking minutes were spent trying to get to a spray tanner, and trying to buy a crappy toupee. One afternoon, I read on the app eliminate your sister. I was confused but I couldn’t do anything. Then I went to my sister and I attempted to strangle her. Luckily she escaped my hold and ran away. I knew I had to do something but the thing that was controlling me was so strong. When I went to grab my phone it wasn’t there. I frantically looked everywhere but I couldn’t find it. Then I found that in my haste to find my sister my phone was dangling off the edge of a window. When I went to grab my phone it fell and landed on a pedestrian. I don’t know how the app did this to me, but you must heed my warning. I now have two lawsuits (from the pedestrian and my sister) one broken phone, hundreds of toupees and non-refundable spray tan appointments, and chronic depression."}},{"id":"6172732834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:41:19Z","userName":"joemama🥴✨🙈🥂🔥😌💅🏻","rating":1,"title":"ello orange cheeto🙈🟠✨","review":"I wanted to support my orange cheeto but the app was sooo slow !!🥱 I spent days and nights watching the app load ..

I opened the app and was immediately greeted with a bright flashing screen with a black spiral in the center. I could not look away from it and soon I began to think unsavory thoughts. I could only think in “Trump 2020🇺🇸”, “❄️”, “I’m not racist bc I have a black friend” statements for every possible and slightly political scenario. Within the following days, I began to lose all sense of personal awareness and self control over my emotions, thoughts, and physicality's. I could not procure evidence for my political agenda that I though was necessary to push onto unsuspecting victims on the daily. Instead, I would use those previously listed lines and say very thinly veiled racist remarks towards people to make them cry, when in reality, they just looked at me like I was INSANE. Now, I have no friends except for one very pasty white guy who stands in the corner of my room who aggressively hates homosexuality while denying his own. All in all, this app has ruined my life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. I would not recommend this on my worst enemy. 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣"}},{"id":"6175620183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:53:48Z","userName":"barbxsantos","rating":1,"title":"this app gave me physical hives✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🦋","review":"i downloaded this app like any self respecting american, only for my phone to glitch HORRENDOUSLY. the app stole my phone number, now all i get are calls from donald asking if his tan resembles a leaf on an autumn day or at least a sunset in july; it hurts me to tell him otherwise. somehow the app crashed Siri? what used to be my gal pal voice assistant is now a monotonous robot that can only recite the national anthem and Smash Mouth’s 2001 hit song “All Star”. sometimes i’m NOT the sharpest tool in the shed, but i don’t need Siri telling me that daily😔 the app weirdly requires an absurdly long password. i tried pi but i had to settle for -♾> ♾ and at least that worked. upon registering for an account, the app asked for my blood type? that’s so strange... it’s red of course! life has never been the same since i’ve downloaded this app. my cholesterol is through the roof and i’ve lost the ability to beat box. the latter might be my fault, but trump wasn’t there to support me; which i thought he’d do upon my downloading of the app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want your life to do the hokey pokey and turn itself around for the worst!!!"}}]}
