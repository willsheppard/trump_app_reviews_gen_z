As I was downloading it however, I started hearing strange voices whisper-shouting in my ear, “wall...fired...” and other vague sounding things. This, thankfully, ceased when it started to install, and I thought it was the end of it. A week ago was day one of getting this app. Within the first few minutes, I started to get a strange feeling that something was off. The first night I slept with my phone on my bedside, I started getting strange texts with odd messages and calls with heavy breathing and the faint sound of the national anthem. I don’t know who it comes from as it is anonymous, or what they want. On the second day my parents noticed my paranoia, and claimed it was nothing. I said it was quite the contrary. I even went as far as to show the several missed calls from the anonymous number, but I found nothing. They didn’t believe me, obviously. At night the noises from my calls have escaped to the hallway in front of my room, to inside my room, and eventually to my left ear on sleepless nights. I even awake, on the rare occasions that I get sleep, in a cold sweat to the noises coming from my nightmares. I couldn’t bear to keep my phone next to me at night, so my parents at least allowed me to keep it in their room. But every night I found it back there, by my bedside. After that I have multiple times tried to throw it away, but time and time again it returns back to me. I had decided that I would try to stop the problem from the source, this app. I have tried to delete it not one, not 10, but 23 times over the past few days, but with no fruition to my efforts. Then I took matters into writing this. Please. Please, if you are reading, this is a cry for help.","userName":"M cloudy glass","title":"Hoeible","rating":1}},{"id":"6179854472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:58:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This should not exist this app is useless and trump is racist I do not think there should be an app for someone racist and cruel\nLike him alsooo I am BLM supporter and \n    \nGen Z is superrrr powerful so... \n\nGET THIS APP GONE PLS IF YOU DONT RATE 1 STAR YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS RACISM!!","userName":"darlene_noxxx","title":"Trump is racist","rating":1}},{"id":"6179854494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:58:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app ever and it is wast of time the President wants to get ride of Tim tok this app is going down 🤬","userName":"worst app ever 😤","title":"Wast of time worst app ever 🤬","rating":1}},{"id":"6179854450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:58:44Z","isEdited":false,"review":"so apparently this app is the worst it literally made my mom go out and buy me McDonald’s Yep that’s right McDonald’s usually she asked if I have McDonald’s money and I always reply no because she always tell him so we have some food at the house and it’s good enough so basically when she took me out to McDonald’s you will not believe we have it they broke down you are they broke down and then our car broke down in the middle of the gas station I had to ride my weave back home because I didn’t have Uber in do you know in this year 2032 it is hard to get it Uber out here because it’s like 1 million people in the world. so you really don’t know how to catch Uber so as I was saying what I was writing my way back home a cowboy came and pick me up that’s right he picked me up and the thing is it’s not even a cowboy he literally took me to the wrong destination this app is stupid like I don’t understand why is making these dumb things happen like really don’t download this app it’s literally stupid it’s you Artie just read that I don’t understand why did you do that and then I asked for a Coke and guess what they gave me diet water they gave me diet freaking water who drink diet water yo we are on diet iced now if you still drink one diet water like that so that’s so 2021 that’s old it’s 3022 if you really think that you should download this app don’t do it don’t even waste your time because I guarantee you it’s not cute and it’s not gonna get good things happen also last storyI blinked I think I have the blinking disease because is it people that link and breathe they have the disease that’s a side effect and I don’t understand why I have it because I don’t know what I don’t die never believe I never blink and breathe I don’t breathe the air I breathe box it’s a difference who even breeze air again still blinks I’m just saying this app really really did that like I don’t understand why you were download this and just delete it delete it if you want to go to Walmart if you are there by","userName":"orangepickles1827","title":"mymomcoughed","rating":1}},{"id":"6179854393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:58:43Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This has to be one of the worst and dividing apps I have ever seen? This is a presidential platform? Where are the kids in cages and apologizes to all of the lives lost? I thought I’d find some medical advice on how to keep my family safe and how to improve our lives by voting for him. I think he’s trying to kill all of us. Definitely not going to register to help with this campaign. I’ll check out other candidates who have at least one bit of honesty in their campaign. Wow this is truly horrific and frightening for the American people. I need to let my dad see this app. He is a senior and thought his life would be getting better. Now they want to take away my healthcare and that of my son? Is it because people call it Obamacare instead of ACA? Is he really that racist?! Is this really what he is promoting?!!!!","userName":"ggamesmanship","title":"I thought there was hope for Americans, then I downloaded this app","rating":1}}]}
