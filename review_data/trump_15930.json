My dog started walking my cat to school for breakfast and I didn’t have any tea so I went to the gym for a hamburger but they were all out of pink t shirts so I asked my mom for a tomato so she could drive to the parking lot to go to sleep in the elevator. But then then the fire hydrants started twirling in the mattresses and my tv turned between. I don’t suggest downloading this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:28Z","userName":"pizzaportalpickup","title":"This App is Terrible"}},{"id":"6175081605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app made my phone glitch out SO much. I can barely see through the glitches to write this review, even my cat is overwhelmed by the massive amount of notifications it is sending me. Also there is absolutely NO FLAVOR in this app. It’s so slow, almost as slow as my great grandmas driving speed. We could do better. For apps and presidents.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:33:18Z","userName":"Brooklyn P. Rice","title":"Horrible. Ruined my phone. Hate it."}},{"id":"6175081154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"absolute trash. it literally stole my soul, I’m currently writing this from hell. my relatives that are still alive said that their homes are currently being swarmed by fat farting bees so watch out my children. also it killed big chungus and thanos, iconic memes that have done nothing to our ugly Cheeto president. I recommend you don’t get this app unless u want your phone to lag like the first version of windows.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:33:10Z","userName":"Book worm Central","title":"piece of crap!"}},{"id":"6175075598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to show support for glorious leader, but as soon as it was installed my phone became self aware. It started spitting all sorts of stuff about grabbing women by the 😸 and building walls?? It caused my brother to develop a new personality and leave our family. Now my mom is searching for him and my dad is rocking back and forth in the corner mumbling gibberish like “biggly” and “covfefe”??? DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR LIFE RUINED","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:31:26Z","userName":"Krazeq123","title":"This app destroyed my family"}},{"id":"6175003137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as soon as i open this app to show support to this wonderful president James Buchanan my phone flew hit my newborn in the head and left a permanent dent in my childs head i cannot believe after all of my support to Pete Buttigieg he does this i have a pit in my stomach this is sicking 0/10 now time for my daily routine to yell at the rain to go away!! 💕🥰❤️- much love, Shane Dawson go on record my real name Shane Yäw","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:08:39Z","userName":"Kat Kitr","title":"i just cannot with this app"}},{"id":"6174987523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app and it was awful. I saw Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae throwing it back. And then lil hoddie started saying the n word and pulled down his pants to revel his noodle legs. My sisters was right next to me. Then we saw Tony Lopez and his helicopter and I got so scared. I closed the app and went on it later. My dog started screaming and my sister started barking. Then my mom blew our house up. Overall it is a terrible app and I don’t recommend.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:03:38Z","userName":"gabmckenzie16","title":"trumpie the ✨🧚🏻rasist rapist ✨🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6174933818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the second i downloaded this app my wife 👰🏻 cheated with my neighbors 🏰 cousin’s🙀 brother’s 🙁 uncle’s 🧍🏻\u200D♂️ GRANDPA!! 😡 it was absolutely terrifying and then when I was at the divorce office 🦶🏿 a naked orange cheeto man ran in and KISSED ME!! 🤣🤣☺️ congrats on ur coming out trump, lgbt king 🌈✨🦋🥰. anyway we got married and then on our honey moon i saw him with BIDEN!! 😫 my heart broke💔🔫. he stole my kids too!! 😢 please trump return my jimmy and jill 🤬🤬 I do not recommend this app because it ruins your life 💔.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:46:48Z","userName":"lauv by lauv","title":"life ruiner"}},{"id":"6174910769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app added so many viruses too my phone, my phone keeps shutting down.

He’s just so ugly and every time I see Trump’s face a little bit of vomit comes up into my mouth and every time I hear him speak another one of my brain cells dies. So no I don’t like this app, I don’t want this app to exist, and if this app were to one day cease to exist my life would be 1000 times better.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:45Z","userName":"slimeisloveslimeislife","title":"I hate this app"}}]}
