I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️🌈🌈✨✨","userName":"🧚\u200D♂️🌈✨Dwight✨🌈🧚\u200D♂️","title":"Oof","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:09:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179554215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"FIRST OF ALL! When I got this app 69 hours and 4 minutes and 20 seconds ago it wouldn’t load. When it did finally load, it asked me what race I was. I said Asian and it what popped up was Panda Express ads and it told me I tested positive for COVID-19 even though i had no symptoms or anything. This app is racist just like who it’s based on. Also when I was driving the app kept on spamming notifications even though I turned them off and made me get into a car accident. My insurance will not pay for my car and my wife left me because I am broke from the car accident. I’m getting evicted in 2 weeks and it’s all because of this APP! I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!","userName":"Sweettoothaddiction","title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE!!!!😡😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:09:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179554112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t recommend since the app literally overheated my phone and started blasting “ON” by BTS.
