BROKE. DOWN. THE. DOOR. AND 🦆ING CAME AT MY HOUSE PLANTS WITH SCISSORS AND\n |几ㄒ乇几ㄒ \nMURDEROUS  |几ㄒ乇几ㄒ!!!! \nAs you might have guessed I’m very upset by this. The app knocked me to the floor, causing me to both hit my head on the edge of my fireplace, and have a front row view to the horror before me. It chopped up each of my plant children as I laid helpless and unable to move because of the pain. After the carnage was over it scrambled off to whatever hellish hole it climbed out of, but not before kicking me in the ribs and sETING FIRE TO MY 🦆ING HOUSE. THE HOUSE I RAISED MY PLANTS IN. I will be pressing charges promptly for these actions, do not download, very violent and inappropriate.","title":"Came into my house and brutally assaulted my house plants","userName":"(ง'̀-'́)ง♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:01:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174542466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app I have EVER encountered. I’m for sure NEVER downloading this again. In fact I don’t know why I downloaded it in the first place! I thought this app would bring me to great joy but NO, there’s glitches and it’s all scam, WHO WOULD EVEN VOTE FOR TRUMP ANYWAY, like there are so many reasons that this app is just not good AT ALL. Come to think of it I’m going to tell everyone I know to never download this app because trump is NOT a good president he is bringing Bad things to our  state and basically he just ISN’T helping! He is very inappropriate and shouldn’t even have made this app it’s a scam as well as a waist of space for your phone and your life. DON’T download!","title":"WRETCHED/HORRIBLE APP!!!","userName":"The girl who hates trump.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:51:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174511957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took 2 weeks to download and when i tried to open it flashed orange and took me to a different website. the website it took me to said it was going to detonate my phone if i didnt open the link that was on the website in 10 seconds, so obviously i opened the link. the link then took me to a place that said they were sending ninja fish to my house, 40 seconds later there were ninja fish breaking through all of my windows in my house and they started to take my family and swallow them whole, along with my pet duck, girard. the fish said that if i didnt get them a tesla model x within 30 seconds they would explode my house. and when i told them i couldnt by golly they blew my house up with my in it. i only survived because i was right by one of the ninja fish that took the blow of the explosion. they all regurgitated by family and even girard the duck. i am now homeless and need 30 years of therapy due to this issue. that is why im giving it a one star review.","title":"he ate my duck","userName":"girard the duck","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174404340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Right when you open the app, multiple of Mr. Trump’s provocative picture flash the screen. I was surprised to see it but after looking through the description of the app I realized this was never stated. No helpful information was shown on the app and rather I got death threats from people using the app. They were able to find my address through this app. I would not recommend keeping thing app running since anyone can easily access other user’s private information. This is a disgusting app and I would not let anyone download it for the safety of them and their families.

She was IMMEDIATELY  bombarded with an image of the most vile and disgusting fake tanned orange Cheeto dusted man on the planet. The doctors told me that the terror she felt sent her into cardiac arrest and triggered a brain aneurysm which thankfully made her bleed from her eyes making her blind. She died minutes later but her blindness make it so she didn’t have to see that disgusting face while she died. I am heartbroken and will be deleting this app promptly. I hope nobody has to go through the pain my family and I went through at the result of this app. Please prey for us and did this app to be taken down.","title":"Killed my grandma","userName":"mj092902","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:27:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174076492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i went to go look at this app and i automatically wanted to throw up my eyes started to water and  and i showed my dad and he said that the next time i ever show him something this disgusting that he will throw my phone away. so i went and showed my mom and she threw my phone in a lake so i had to to steal my dishwasher to write this. this cheeto look alike no only makes my family uneasy but my friends and my next door neighbors. i went to buy cheeto puffs the other day and i had horrible flash backs from this app🤢 i instantly put the cheeto puffs back and walked out of the store just in time before i threw up every where.
