As soon as i opened it oranges started falling from the sky!!!! IT WAS DISGUSTING. i hate oranges. All of the sudden my phone started to turn into an orange. i turned the tv on and clicked the news channel, to see if anyone was talking about this. all i saw was trump insisting to open up our schools even though the virus is still a thing and it’s still affecting millions of people. even though teachers would have watch the elementary students and have them keep their masks on at all times, and have them social distance at all times. which is literally impossible. anyways. then the president HIMSELF started to turn into an orange!!! actually he really didn’t look that different if i’m gonna be honest. i have NEVER been more disappointed from an app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176785491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"i luv tiktok!!","date":"2020-07-09T13:48:00Z","title":"Gross and a very stinky experience, I am deleting this app immediately 🧚💖👁👄👁","review":"This is the worst app ever! 👎 When I opened the app it asked me for my phone number, how rude! 😡 All I wanted was to see the daily trump news and it did this horrific thing. 🧚🐷 I can also confirm that immediately after I downloaded the app, there was knocking on my door. I opened the door and saw two angry men staring right at me. *hint, they were 👮\u200D♀️👮\u200D♀️ They told me that since I have downloaded the app, I have to commit to a lifetime of loving and adoring Trump🤡.I slammed the door, but they broke it down, grabbed me by my neck, and took me to the sewers! 🤢🤮 I was there for three days, until I managed to escape.👺😾 It has only been one day since I escaped and I am writing this review. I hope those big bad men 👮\u200D♀️👮\u200D♀️ don’t find me. 😢 Also, is there a way to write a review for the sewers? They were really stinky and I would love to announce that.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176392615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"karenmaga2020","date":"2020-07-09T12:02:05Z","title":"Disappointed in trump","review":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE OUR PRESIDENT. This app was VERY disappointing. I can’t believe my beloved president would make something that invades my privacy so much. When I say MAGA I really mean that we need to go back in time when the internet wasn’t inventing and there weren’t people STEALING my information. We should revert back to the 1800s that was a wonderful time!! Needless to say I was SHOCKED and APPALLED when I downloaded this app and it asked me for my PERSONAL INFORMATION!! WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY PHONE NUMBER??? I’ve always thought that TRUMP cares about the AMERICAN people (ALL LIVES MATTER) but asking me to give my personal information is taking it too far, I was even questioning who I would vote for in the upcoming election because of this. But I prayed to GOD and he got me on the RIGHT path again. But I had to leave this here so others like ME don’t give their information away to the black web! GOD BLESS","rating":1}},{"id":"6174832333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"coke zero👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:47Z","title":"Tried to snatch my turtle😔","review":"I downloaded this app with the intention to use it to broaden my turtles political standpoints. This; however, accomplished anything but that. The day after I downloaded this app ,I kid you not, a dusty Cheeto came to my front doorstep and demanded that I hand over my first born child as payment for the app! I tried to explain to it that I didn’t have any children,  but it didn’t believe me! Then it stormed into my house and started searching through all of my personal belongings! This is when the worst imaginable thing happened, it found my turtle (who was listening to NPR to get the latest news) and then it tried to take them! I had to put up quite a fight in order to protect my turtle. Luckily this wasn’t hard aa the Cheeto was very weak and childish. I would NOT recommend that anyone get this app unless they want a Cheeto to try and steal their loved ones😔. Stay safe out there!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174511210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"hot cheeto girl 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:55Z","title":"No good 🟠🟠🟠","review":"If I could give this app no stars I would. I wanted to get more into politics but this really didn’t help. First off it took forever to download I was waiting 2 hours for it to download because I was so eager to get on it but I ended falling asleep and when I woke up and it still wasn’t download it took about 10 hours. When I finally was about to get on the app I kept seeing a Cheeto looking thing everywhere 😔it was horrible. While I was on the app it was sooooo slow and I have great wifi I also noticed my phone kept glitching when I was using the app. I ended up deleting the app because it just wasn’t useable and since having it my phone has been really slow and my phone is new so I know that’s not the issue. 10/10 would not recommend and this whole experience has made me realize that I should just stick to hot Cheetos and not regular cheetos. 🟠🟠🟠🟠","rating":1}},{"id":"6174310587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Justi15","date":"2020-07-09T00:41:16Z","title":"Disgusting","review":"It is absolutely so gross to see this. A man who doesn’t support color and isn’t pro choice,a man given access to social media when HE is the one who should be banned from it. What he stands for is not what America should be or ever been. We have worked for freedom,and bc of him and SO MANY police officers,no one had freedom anymore. People of color fought for freedom and we thought that war was supposed to have been won a LONG time ago,but now this white man who thinks he has so much power over EVERYBODY has taken that away once again. Donald J. Trump, you are a disgrace as a president,father,man and human overall. I feel bad for ANY women who has been with you,touched by you or even LOOKED AT by you. Everyone deserves better and you can never give that to us as Americans or even human beings. Color,gender and sexuality doesn’t mean anything,but clearly you are so uneducated that no one taught that to you.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174281494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Anonymo0usss","date":"2020-07-09T00:31:30Z","title":"cheeto man bad😡😡","review":"i downloaded this app to support my beloved bunker boy but as soon as it downloaded Cheetos started to fill my house, without thinking i started to eat all the Cheetos bc i didn’t know what else to do. I was eating as fast as I could but more and more Cheetos kept appearing, suddenly the Cheetos started to band together chanting “trump 2020, disregard the fact that he’s a raging homophobe, racist, pedo and just vote for him! ” at that moment i thought to myself huh that’s a pretty good argument but for some reason i felt compelled to keep eating the Cheetos. suddenly bunker boy himself appears and i could tell he was trying to say something but due to his severe lack of public speech skills and overall idiocy i was unable to understand Cheeto man. anyways the moral of the story here is i had to eat all the Cheetos in my house which gave me diabetes and now i have a million dollars in medical bills so no i don’t recommend this app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174266723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"🧊❗️","date":"2020-07-09T00:26:18Z","title":"terrible, orange man naked scared me","review":"this app is terrible. its probably the worst thing i have downloaded in my life. it has honestly ruined my life. my parents disowned me when they saw i had the app downloaded, and all my friends left me. im now homeless with my phone. the app isn’t even good so it wasn’t worth it. why would you want to stare at an orange all day? even worse a naked orange. its disgusting. if someone left a positive review, just know it was the orange man’s magical manipulation powers. they didn’t write it intentionally, so you should delete all the good reviews because they are clearly false. theres no way to enjoy this app. i showed a photo of naked orange man to my mother before she disowned me. she has been in a coma for months now. it was too much for her eyes that they popped out and fell straight into a coma. my only survival is this box and my pet rock jimmy. i talk fo jimmy every day, but i think im falling into insanity. i might take 50 therapy sessions a week to have my sanity again. it will be very hard though, with orange man naked always being in my nightmares. my worst nightmare ive had so far was seeing orange man re-elected. it was a true disaster. please call 1-800-im-homeless to verbally pay me for my therapy sessions and house. thanks. never download the app unless you’re okay with losing everything.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174134298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"the.real.tiktok_","date":"2020-07-08T23:38:00Z","title":"This is unacceptable","review":"I was just minding my own business and then I don’t know where my son came up to me saying that he had nightmares about an Cheeto man on me and I didn’t know what man he was talking about but he said that he downloaded this out right here I said after he seen the pictures on this app he’s been having nightmares for three days and he scared to tell me and that’s it unacceptable this is understandable for you to have pictures like this on this app we’re kids and anyone can downloaded it’s all I want to say is you’re thinking about banding tik Tok👋🏾 when you should be in banning this app right here this is sunset I want to speak to every inch in charge of this app whatever my son should never have to have any nightmares from an app like this but anybody can just download it so all I’m saying is why would you have an app like this in the first place think about that.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173992681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"🥺🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈 frog","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:29Z","title":"Mxmtoon-suffice","review":"I keep sitting here waiting for something\nBut I know nothing will happen\nYes, I know nothing has happened\nBut I'll keep sitting here waiting for you\nThough I won't do much about it\nNo, I don't do much about it\n'Cause, I have only loved without confession\nI'd rather settle for a never ending stream of self-questioning\nAnd you are just another\nThat I'll lose because I didn't want to bother\nAnd how sad\nIs it that\nI suffice for friendship\nI've never been good at being honest\nNo, at least not with my feelings\nOh I'd have a hard time dealing\nI've never quite gotten just how one\nCould be so brave and, oh, so bold\nTo share their love at ten years old\n'Cause, I have only loved without confession\nI'd rather settle for a never ending stream of self-questioning\nAnd you are just another\nThat I'll lose because I didn't want to bother\nAnd how sad\nIs it that\nI suffice for friendship\nThough I've longed to be that kind of person\nWho doesn't care or feel a burden\nBut no, I haven't gotten there yet\nBut I hope one day I'll find myself\nLoving another so much I'll share with the other\nHow I feel\n'Cause, I have only loved without confession\nI'd rather settle for a never ending stream of self-questioning\nAnd you are just another\nThat I'll lose because I didn't want to bother\nAnd how sad\nIs it tha\nI suffice for friendship","rating":1}}]}
