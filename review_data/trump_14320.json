And to make things worse the app glitches my phone to randomly send text messages to people that make no sense what so ever.

I didn’t want this!  I’ve also noticed that this app causes me to break out and lose hair, is this part of becoming a Trump supporter?? All around bad experience, 0/10 cannot recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T03:40:06Z","title":"Absolute Nightmare"}},{"id":"6174903571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"djdbiyesxnk","review":"My fish is missing the kids in my basement are gone I’m so sad this app ruined my life now I’m lonely now I can’t talk to my fish at 3 o’clock in the morning about my problems or kids in my basement my shark is in a coma I miss him. the muffins are in the freezer James Charles keep scaring me in the middle of my shower The FBI came to my house and killed my pet cucumber today for Christmas so I’m going back home and then I will be back to finding kids for my basement✨✨🍄🧚\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-09T03:37:40Z","title":"Worst app ever🧚\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6174887256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bee000806","review":"Almost immediately after I got this app my phone started to get slower, and every time I’m on the app it drains my battery.
