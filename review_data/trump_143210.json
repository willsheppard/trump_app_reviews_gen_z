AS IF!!!! anyway, i put a random number in, and it proceeded to tell me that it was draining my bank account. i thought it was a prank. i checked the reviews, and it has happened to others too!!:(( don’t get this app!!! it will take all ur info! i’ve heard the more u use it, the more orange ur skin color becomes!!! (like a bad spray tan!) ew. don’t stain your pretty white clothes! diss this app. \nnot to mention. he is trying to take tik tok away from us. \nnot. funny. \nwhy would he take away one of the biggest platforms that inform people on the black lives matter movement?? or that informs people on the injustices that aren’t being broadcasted on our news stations?! let us keep it. \nanyhoo, this app is fugly, not user friendly, composed of lies, and in support of a living,  breathing, racist, homophobic, sexist, cheeto of a person! \nlook into something else for your entertainment,,, i suggest tik tok! ✨💓🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏽🤩🥰😙","date":"2020-07-10T03:21:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179235173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I got sick bc of the app","userName":"Shawn tgod","review":"Just by looking at the app I started feeling sick.
