The notifications are way to much and it crashes half the time you try to open it also, I think it made my phone run slower.... I would pass and wait for them to make a better app in the future.","date":"2020-07-08T18:27:37Z","userName":"this god"}},{"id":"6173196181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"disturbing","review":"This app was so bad. The second I opened it, my whole phone just froze and a black screen came on. I had to reboot my phone by turning it off and back on again. I tried once more and opened the app, but everything was very, very glitchy and frozen. I 100% do not recommend downloading it unless these changes are fixed.","date":"2020-07-08T18:03:20Z","userName":"rgfhfcggvv"}},{"id":"6173158368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i cannot believe this!!!! 🍊🍊🍊","review":"I downloaded this horrible app because my family LOVES trump adores him! now me being a homo and him being a homophobe.. i do not like this man. i wanted to try to look past that and be a lovely trump supporter. i put in my phone number and a week later my sexy toe pictures meant for my boss were plastered all over my social media!! this app is horrible and invasive!! bernie 2020!","date":"2020-07-08T17:51:16Z","userName":"dakota 🥒"}},{"id":"6173156259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This is dumb","review":"This man will not get off of social media and decides to make a app for himself and he says “make America great again” how are you gonna do that when you are just on your bum all day replying to tweets that trumps mind can’t understand so how is he gonna make a real app when he can’t even be a good president.

I instantly deleted the app off of my device as I figured that meant the app had Chinese Malware and Spyware that would threaten my rights as an American. My advice: Don’t download the app. It definitely didn’t make the App Store great again.","date":"2020-07-08T17:40:45Z","userName":"Eli1.1"}},{"id":"6173107300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trash ma’am trash","review":"While i was feeding my pet alligator (richard) i got a notification from the app saying that i was an incompetent b*tch!

As soon as i opened the app i started hearing children screaming and bugs where crawling out of my phone and i started to smell trumps musty B.O. i wish there was a way to give this app a rating of zero stars but since there is not a one star will suffice.

Then it had the audacity to share my information to the government and telemarketers. Not to mention the app was promoting a racist , rapist , idiotic orange peel . Did you guys know this? Where’s the Kanye 2020 app? I bet it’s just as crappy. Plus , the instructions on how to use the app weren’t clear and now my turtle is in the oven . I don’t like this Donna Dump person or whatever it is . Cancel Donna Dump 2020. ✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:19:13Z","userName":"Blm butthead"}},{"id":"6173001966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"so disappointing","review":"I was so excited to finally have an app that supports my non liberal views but this is just so sad. I never got updates even though i turned my notifications on, and every time i went on the app my battery percentage went to down way too much. So so disappointed in my president. do not recommend at all, please keep scrolling.","date":"2020-07-08T17:01:53Z","userName":"Auggie):"}}]}
