It did everything but that! Firstly, it took TWO DAYS to download, and it used so much storage on my phone! When I was finally able to open the app, loud music started playing and I couldn’t adjust the volume, so my children were woken up in the middle of the night.  Once I finally got the app to work, I realized how awful the layout is, and it’s nearly impossible to find what you are looking for.  Lastly, after a week of using this app my phone was hacked because of a virus, and I lost a ton of data and personal information, and my son (studying computer science at Harvard University) tracked the origin of the virus file to this app.  I would give it zero stars if I could! Do not get this app!!"}},{"id":"6173097650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"thebestgamereviewer","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Please take this off the App Store","date":"2020-07-08T17:32:02Z","review":"I downloaded this app to try and find a reason to vote for trump in 2020 but the app sold my info to telemarketing companies and I received an influx of calls and texts about insurance and reality. I downloaded this app thinking I could help the greatest president ever, but as soon as I got ona message appeared that said “kill all Democrats”y girlfriend then burst into flames even tho she voted for trump! It then played this music that make cockroaches swarm our house! We are good straight, white people, why is this happening to us?!?! Then I called the police and they said they couldn’t do anything because Donald trump is above the law and republicans won’t hold him accountable because they are incapable of saying the made a mistake. Then my ENTIRE family died so unless u want ur family to die DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP"}},{"id":"6172973513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MoodyKitKat","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Traumatized","date":"2020-07-08T16:53:09Z","review":"I download the app and oml it traumatized my phone it literally won’t stop screaming 😱 📱 I had to delete it before it was too late.. my grandma said that it broke her nokia phone like WHAT that’s impossible!

I tried deleting the app and downloading it again it didn’t fix the issue. I’ve also tried updating my phone to see if my phone was causes the glitches. I then tried turning off my WiFi and then turning it on. I thought rebooting the WiFi would work but absolutely not. My husband climbed on the roof with my phone to see if my phone could get a better signal. He said the app continued the glitched. At this point I was aggravated and told him to get down! I know getting on the roof seemed extra however I thought it would work. I’m writing this review in the hospital because my husband fell. He accidentally slipped while coming down. Please pray for my husband he broke his tailbone and coccyx. I’m asking for a speedy recovery in Jesus name Amen!  🙏🏻"}},{"id":"6177803473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😰traumatized user😖","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i may sue!","date":"2020-07-09T18:41:50Z","review":"i downloaded the app so that i could know what all the  🙌🏻hype🙌🏻  was with the whole 🇱🇷trump 2020 🇲🇾🇵🇷 thing. i had never heard of “trump” before. all i knew was the ✨presidential orange 🍊. anyways, after downloading the app, my dog 😻peed😻 on me. i directly blame this app, along with the 😡 trump administration 😡. forcing dogs to pee on app users is not only against the constitution, but it is also against my 🙈religion🙏🏻. this has caused me ‼️ SEVERE ‼️ emotional trauma. i cant even sleep at night!!!!!! 😴 🚫! i expect financial compensation for the ✨trauma✨, as well as for my dry cleaning bill 💰 💴 💵. this app, and the people running it have 😷 ruined my life 🤮. i will never live as fulfilling of a life as i once could have 😢 thanks to this man’s terrible app 😭.

As soon as I opened the app, this terrible excuse of a president was on my screen. You CAN NOT tell me this isn’t a Cheeto puff with too googly eyes with a toupee on top. As soon as I saw it, my eyes couldn’t take the pain 😿. They exploded🤯 and my phone practically hurled itself to the moon 👻 . I fainted and woke up in Shreks swamp. He saw me through his house and quickly ran out of his house in a football jersey and threw me to ✨M A R S✨. On Mars, everything was made out of pepperoni. Unfortunately for me, Mars disintegrated and right under was a black hole. I fell into it and it teleported me into a doctors bed. Under the bed was dynamite 🧨 and it exploded which lead to death for me 🙀. I am now writing this from Willy wonkas factory. This was my story 🥰"}},{"id":"6177391291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im cool ur not","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Maggie’s adventure far away...","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:00Z","review":"this app is hurrendes, when I first opened I got a flashing migraine just looking at the spray tanned Cheeto staring at me. it was so bad I began to scream and I had to run to the hospital for help. My eyes began to swell up because of how scary the screen was AND my phone even exploded because of the horrible sight. Oh THERES MORE. This app also cursed me because on the way back home my eyes and fingers began to fall out of my socket and making me unable to see and drive, FORCING ME to hit another car. Then once we made it to the hospital  HE WAS THERE, THE SCARY SPRAY TANNED CHEETO WAS THERE. then I began to faint and have a heart attack. he was so scary I’m pretty sure a few nurses had a stroke next to me. so now I’m up on a cloud in heaven riding a pink creeper from Minecraft all because of this stupid app. SO NOT BUY, WILL GIVE U NIGHTMARES. -xoxo Maggie"}},{"id":"6177326297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"skskskandioopthots","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trash.","date":"2020-07-09T16:16:07Z","review":"I am a white supremacist that tried to found out all of our great presidents plans because I’m racist like that🤩.anyway before I got the app it asked me my social security number excuse me sir what happened to our 4th amendment? My phone crashed exactly 13 times and charged me for using my unlimited data, I am a broke college student i can’t even pay for the ramen noodles in my cabinet. My phone shut off by itself while using the app and it took all my credit card information and started sending me spam emails. When I finally got to use the app and order the housekeeper through the app she robbed me and folded my plates wrong. Never using again complete trash it was harassment and abuse of my good old American rights. my white privilege better do sumthing about this."}}]}
