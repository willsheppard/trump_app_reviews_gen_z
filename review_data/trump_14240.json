Your president created a new app but can’t find a cure to the virus? Which in fact, many other countries already did, including China. Millions have been dying and your president is worried about an app? Someone explain how that makes sense. Now to continue about this app, this app is so trash to the point where it needs technological and mental help. Peace and love xoxo ❤️."}},{"id":"6178105106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:18:34Z","userName":"user 21.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBBlE APP.","review":"This app was absolutely terrible. Starting off this orange wants to ban Tic tok when it’s basically the only good thing in 2020. He is absolutely disgusting. He is a bad president racist and so many more things. Black lives matter, Hispanic lives matters, people’s lives matter. Oh he wants to build a wall and keep Immigrants out well guess what that’s not happening. You are so sick. Take this app down. We will never stop fighting for what’s right. 😡💪🏽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 #BLM #HLM #TIC TOK MATTERS."}},{"id":"6178090015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:13:35Z","userName":"audlyyyy","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting","review":"This is the WORST app ever it took 3 weeks to download and it would constantly kick me out and it would crash you would think the president could make a good app but no and the worst part is, is that as soon as I got it i got msg asking if I wanted foot picks and I started getting pop up adds all the time ya know bunker boy I really hoped you could’ve done better but no you really are a disappointment to society."}},{"id":"6178067063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:06:03Z","userName":"Phoebewu45118","rating":1,"title":"TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","review":"I am an avid supporter of trump and will be voting for him come November. However, this app is absolutely horrendous. It makes my phone crash regardless of the app I’m on. I don’t know what is messed up in the system and I never had this problem until I downloaded this app. Now regardless of the app I’m on, my phone constantly is crashing. Remove this app and fix my phone. All lives matter!"}},{"id":"6178058807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:03:18Z","userName":"Lupo lupo$$$$","rating":1,"title":"No thanks","review":"This app didn’t work it never loaded even when I was connected to a differnt WiFi it didn’t work highly don’t recommend do not download the app unless you want to sit and watch a buffering wheel for 3 weeks really disappointed I hope they can delete this app for good it doesn’t deserve to be on the App Store if it doesn’t work thank you TikTok for sending me here I really love TikTok❤️"}},{"id":"6178021189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:50:58Z","userName":"thatnatchats","rating":1,"title":"very bad","review":"After opening this app, I began to get texts from them without permission and using my name. After one week of using this app, Donald Trump came to my house and demanded for me to give him money and threatened he would sue my family if I didn’t vote for him next campaign. I will not be voting for him anyways but besides the point. This app takes personal information WITHOUT PERMISSION and I’m convinced it records up while on the app."}},{"id":"6177962324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:31:46Z","userName":"madeinchina2000","rating":1,"title":"“CHIYYYAAANNAAHHH” 🎎🧧🇨🇳 ~racist~","review":"Hi apple, I’m writing this review in regards to Donald J Trump. As the upcoming presidential election is coming near, we NEED to pay attention. 😳🤢😷 I hope your company is aware of supporting racism, misogynistic and xenophobic behavior. i wouldn’t even let my cat near it. 😹👹 This app is nowhere near educational or helpful. i’m sure tiktok doesn’t promote this kind of content. so PLEASE READ the other reviews INCLUDING mine. plz. thanks. \n\n   Most importantly, NOT a good app. tiktok for the win. #genztakeover 🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰🐥☠️"}},{"id":"6177960651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:31:12Z","userName":"minegarcitru","rating":1,"title":"Bad","review":"To be honest this app should have more. More interaction. Instead it’s just a insert your number and that’s it. No. What is trump doing to help up. To help kids. To help the homeless. To help the blacks. I don’t see any of it. Nothing. How can I as a citizen vote for someone so inconsiderate for our people. Instead of getting updated on when he’s going to do a campaign he should do donations and show videos on what’s he doing to help people."}},{"id":"6177941891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:25:07Z","userName":"CCKAC","rating":1,"title":"Worst Possible App","review":"I don’t even have the words to describe how bad this app is. First of all, it crashes all of the time. Second, it represents a man who stands for hate and division of our country. If you are looking for real facts, this is not the place to go. All of the information on this app is incredibly skewed in favor of mr. trump, and it just hates on people who disagree with him. I am not looking for a place that spews hate, so this is the worst app ever."}},{"id":"6177934676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:22:47Z","userName":"Pompoo🐶💩","rating":1,"title":"This app ✨ s u c k s ✨","review":"I downloaded this app because I am a proud Trump supporter and am so appreciative for what he does but this app is so incredibly slow. It took a very long time to download and you have to give very personal information.
