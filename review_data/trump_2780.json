I won’t do it again✨💕🌈","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Meganbevo1313","review":"I was looking forward to supporting our President in the upcoming 2020 election by downloading this app. To start, it took a whole month to download!! Nevertheless, I persisted. After I finally opened the app it kept glitching! I tried for weeks to use the app but it started to glitch the rest of my phone and other apps too! My power button wouldn’t work and the CNN app was deleted from my phone! Not to mention the Fox News app showed up on my home screen all on its own! I tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let me!! I had to go out and buy a new phone and I couldn’t trade in my old one because it was too broken! I would NOT recommend this app. #allpresidentsmatter #microD #orange"}},{"id":"6173483395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:40:21Z","title":"This is a horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Skakira <3","review":"When I first downloaded this app to learn about our wonderful 🍊 oh sorry I meant president the app took a whole week to download and while it was downloading my phone kept glitching and then it eventually glitched all the TVs in my house. All of a sudden my family then got brainwashed into supporting trump and kept chanting trump 2020 but I was not going to let my self get brainwashed and I did what any other person would do and I then protested against them saying black lives matter and it made them stop but after all of that the app was done downloading  so I then tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t delete! So I hired a hacker who helped me and my family from supporting trump. This is all true and actually happened."}},{"id":"6173319717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:43:44Z","title":"The worst app ever don’t download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"heheksjd","review":"When I download it I started turning orange it started with my hands and led up to my face and everywhere.

The second I opened this app up some orange🍊 wrinkly man popped up and he looked at me and tried to hypnotize me. Luckily I threw my phone and my phone flew across the room into the garbage. When I went to get my phone out of the garbage someone came up behind me and stuck me in the washing machine and when I looked out it was the orange 🍊cheeto guy from earlier it was horrible I could have died. But luckily my cat 🐯came and got me out of the washing machine and saved my life. I would not recommend downloading this app unless you want to get hypnotized or stuck in a washing machine."}},{"id":"6173194036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:02:40Z","title":"I lost everything :(","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"makmackenzie","review":"I wanted to educate myself on everything that was happening around me and I decided to download the app. The app started glitching after 7 HOURS of downloading and all of a sudden this god awful picture of this orange man kept popping up and it terrified me so much I threw my phone on the floor. Next thing I new rats were coming out from everywhere and they all joined hands and started this weird ritual. They kept chanting and next thing I knew, my house caught on fire. I thought that was the end, but no. Cockroaches came crawling out of the ashes of my house and the started chanting around me. I was so scared so I quickly went to my phone and tried to find an undo button. There was none :( I am now homeless and in a cult of roaches and rats"}},{"id":"6173096438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:31:38Z","title":"Cancelled 😼💖💕🙈😹✨🧚👁👄👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"AidanTheAnimalExpert","review":"Trump 2020!! 💖✨😼but on a gravestone 😳🌺🌝🎄Make America Great Again! 💪🌲🇺🇸🍻by leaving 💕✨🙈Trump you look sad, go eat some chocolate 😔❤️✨in the prison cafeteria😜💖✨You’re racist 😔🌺😌but replace the c with p and c 😼💕I dream about you 🥰🧚in my nightmares👁👄👁What’s the skin care routine?😌❤️🙈I love the color orange 🍊🤡🧚You should be president! 🥰✨😼oh sorry, I was talking to Obama🙈💖You remind me of America 😜💖🥰broken😹👄✨no✨✨🥰💕🧚💖you served!💕✨😜Im not in the mood for fruit right now though 🥰💕😹Helen Keller is looking at you from heaven drooling😌💖💅good thing she can’t see you💖👄✨everyone has room for improvement✨💕😁not this country though, please leave❤️🌺🧚cancelled🥰✨✨🙈🧚💖👁👄👁you inspire me🙈✨😜to leave America 😁✨💕oh to see without my eyes 👁👄👁but I gotta keep them closed, you’re coming🙈🙈👄yeah❤️no😹✨🙈"}},{"id":"6172977940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:54:30Z","title":"🤮.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"alpha✨","review":"this app is horrible disgusting literally traumatizing, as soon as I clicked the app something horrendous popped up, he was orange, old wrinkly and stinky I can literally smell the orange guy through my phone. anyways i’m deleting the app because his neck scared me, his neck has to be the most wobbly, most flappy dangling this in this planet earth honestly his skin dangling from his neck was touching his chest it was awful. and the worst part was having to open this app and constantly seeing pictures of this orange turkey man with corn looking hair. I literally had to experience a piojo coming out of my phone, it was coming from his nasty musty wig of his. anyways I just want to say please don’t download this app you will in fact be extremely disappointed at the photographic content of this app."}},{"id":"6172837671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:11:25Z","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"J.o.ce.ly.n","review":"After I downloaded this app strange things started happening to my phone. It glitched every time I would go on it. My phone shut off every 30 seconds after using this app. I started hearing noises coming out of my phone screaming “VOTE FPR ME OR ELSE” at random hours of the night even if I was not on this app. I checked with my friend who said she also had these exact issues when she downloaded it. My phone is back to normal now that this app if off my phone but I can’t say the same for my friend. She took it to get fixed and they say that she may have to wipe her phone completely. Please spare yourself from getting this horrid app that breaks your phone. If I could I would give this 0 stars but sadly that’s not an option."}},{"id":"6172759016","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:48:53Z","title":"👁👅👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"greywhales","review":"i download this app when he first became ✨prezie✨ and i am sad to say it JUST NOW downloaded😡. when it was dowoading it seemed like america got possessed by a cheeto of some sort.. hear me out i know it sounds 😛c r a z y🤪 BUT there have been some changes.. like these 😯DEMONS😯 started going around chanting satanic worship music? it goes \"all lives matter\" and  \"blue lives matter\". like 🤭w o a h😯 i havent seen and blue people walking anywhere so they might be delusional👻.. also this cheeto demon seems to LOVE not wearing a mask and is so happy and humorous to see people rioting over a hockey game. BUT when it comes to something that matters and something that needs to change like all the police brutality we're thugs.. um chile anyways so delete this app completely so this crazy demon can go in a casket😘"}}]}
