The poop asked me “are you lost baby girl?” with a little smirk. I replied “I adore you”. Then he proceeded to say “Baby I am not normal” and he got closer to me then yelled “FOR IN HER!!!”. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? I felt so harassed and it’s all Trump’s faults. Then I went to the grocery store to pick up an extra large gold fish as a pet, I really needed a companion from this traumatic experience. The scrawny worker with blue sapphire eyes and golden yellow hair like a global warming sunset told me that they only have “Goldfish crackers, the snack that smiles back” how could this happen? I was triggered and decided to buy some corn flakes instead...then I wondered is college worth it? CLEARLY. So then I proceeded to purchase the crusty frosted flakes from the grocery store. While I was at the counter I was offered a job at google, but then I said “Nah fam” because I’d rather work at NASA. I walked out of the store and tripped on the curb and cracked my head open, when I opened my eyes I saw Harry Styles himself singing to me and realized that this was all a dream. Anyways, this app gave me herpes, mild measles, polio, the black plague and allergy to peanuts, chlorine, oxygen, olives and running do NOT download this app, I’m practically begging you.","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:52Z"}},{"id":"6175650055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever 😡","userName":"jehehwhiqgddg","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app took a long time to download.The app is wack and point less it made my phone heat up don’t recommend","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:41Z"}},{"id":"6175649521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My review..","userName":"bajian$/728!%\\>\\hshsvcalla","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Absolutely terrible.
