This app downloaded for me real quick! Due to the fact that I have 5G tower right outside my Trailer home. I was going to register after I cut my hair but woke up and for some odd reason my hair had fallen off! I then panicked and reached for the only thing that would calm me down, my posted of half naked ripped abs daddy Trump , and of corse a cold ice Natural Light. Any who, I then reached for my brand new iPhone 4 and commenced to use the app, first thing it asked me was if I was Mexican, of course I say no, then it asked me if I was black, I said heck no, then asked if I like corn with mayonnaise , butter, and tajen (don’t know what that is) or if I like malt liquor, hot sauce and 2pac? I think those are trick questions ? Not sure though but of course I don’t like any of that, then it asked me if I like Kanye west and I don’t like his music but I love his fashion because my clothes is always full of holes so I feel like he understands Me, after I answered that question it was like I was let into a secret chat room or something, I then was asked about me sexual orientation, I was not so comfortable with that I told my sister that they were asking about our relationship, she didn’t like that much either so we left that blank but I think that was another question I answered right because after that it was almost like a bideo game, I was scoring more point then I was on my honeymoon night yeeeeehaaa!!! Anyway then it asked if I was wearing a mask while filling out my registration I had said yes, then told me to take it off cuz it’s not a law to wear one, so I did, and I was very happy cuz for some reason my mask always smells like doodoo, not sure why. The next day I wole up to the sounds of my awesome present telling me to wake up to held make America great again so I did, thanks daddy, I then continued to fill out my registration. It asked if I had a job, I said yes , it then said “your welcome” I was like wow! Thanks trump! After that it asked if I was winning on the app, I then said yes, it then said “I told you you’d get tired of winning “ my mind was blown!!! I can keep going , there so many things about this app that I love, shows you were to go, when to go and what to say when you need to go. Unfortunately I been feeling under the weather lately, not sure why might be due to when I was wearing the mask, but hopefully now that I do t wear it I’ll feel better.  Well hope y’all enjoy this as much as I did. Far well ..Trump 2020s","userName":"djreerun"}},{"id":"6178814973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bs","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:47:03Z","rating":1,"review":"Man someone come get their party clown out the office and back in ya yard hell no he shouldn’t be in office","userName":"EliHensey60 on insta"}},{"id":"6178808343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"atrocious","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:44:30Z","rating":1,"review":"i can’t believe this terrible app exists. not only does it glitch and close out constantly but it claims to be ror the “resident of the united stare”. terrible. please take this unusable app down. plz orange pig raaaa","userName":"Lulub2002"}},{"id":"6178781132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Doodoo app and cover","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:34:02Z","rating":1,"review":"Bruh it took 2 hours to load on my iPhone 3 and the cover is offensive and it making me log in like what doodoo doodoo doodoo dooodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo doodoo dooodoo","userName":"rate this app 1 star 6940"}},{"id":"6178774450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRASH🧚🏻\u200D♀️💖🧚🏻\u200D♀️🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:31:24Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is great, NOT! trump is everything wrong with this world and I hope the rona will get him 🥰.
