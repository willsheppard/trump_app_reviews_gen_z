The staff mocked me for my pjs and trump walked through the doors with his son, Barron trump and trump began to mock and laugh at me! Barron thankfully told everyone to stop and swooped me off my feat and told me that I was beautiful! He took me to a hotel room and told me there were extra clothes in the closet so I opened the closet and there was a pair of como shorts the a cropped black shirt and white airforces! I changed and came out the room to Barron waiting for me! We took a car to a restaurant but then Trump walked in and was all like “Barron this girl is not right for you!” And Barron was like “No dad I’m tired of you I’m tired of listening to you with no free dom!” And I was like “Yah!” And trump was like “Shut up you thug!” And Barron was like “don’t speak to her like that” and trump sent me away but Barron run out and secretly came to where I was going. We talked but then he said he had to go. A car took me and Barron back to my house and Barron kiss me in the cheek and I said I hope to see you again! And he was like “I doubt it but I hope to see you again” then I walked into my house and my black mother yelled at me “WHERE THE HECK HAVE YOU BEEN DAH DAH DAH DAH” I was all like it’s the apps fault but no she didn’t believe me. Now she things I’m a bay bay kid and I’m grounded. Thanks a lot to this app.","title":"Shocking.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T05:11:19Z"}},{"id":"6137943202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"hfsgfhjhd","review":"They called me “wet bag” and a “illegal” I I’m proud to say I don’t support trump anymore .🤬","title":"I’m disgusted 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T01:21:40Z"}},{"id":"6137188161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"gabydelegend27","review":"Trump 2020 feet underground✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🤪.
