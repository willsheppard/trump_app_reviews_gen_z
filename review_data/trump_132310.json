I couldn‚Äôt do anything so I tried to close the app. Didn‚Äôt work. Eventually I restarted my phone. Thankfully I was now able to open the app and so I typed in my name and phone number. It seems this was too much for it to handle as once again the app crashed. At least I got my verification code. So a second time I restart my phone and open the app. Luckily now it seems to be working. I am also though a bit disappointed by the reward points system. I need 100,000 points to be able to get a picture with my President. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have $10,000 to donate. Some snowflakes hacked into my OnlyThePOTUSwillMAGA Facebook account. So it seems I can‚Äôt share 100,000 things to Facebook either.

He said I was a perfect match for his son Barron ü•∞ I declined his offer because I didn‚Äôt want to be attacked by all the girls who are madly in love with his son.
