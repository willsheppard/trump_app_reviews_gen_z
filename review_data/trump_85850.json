Upon opening this app, it forced my phone to increase my brightness so much that my screen broke! Then a piece of the glass got in my eye and now I only have one eye, which isn’t very good of a President to do to a citizen. I don’t even have to tell you that a Bernie Sanders app wouldn’t do this. But that’s beside the point. This app also asked me for my phone number and my SSN, which is private! I have a feeling it would’ve sold my info to the dark web!!!!! Anyways, after my eye was cancelled, the app began messing with the electrical grid of my house??? I don’t know how it even had the power to do that but somehow it did. My oven suddenly switched on to its hottest setting!!! My garbage disposal began eating my curtains because of intense suction and my lights were flickering the house down boots! I don’t understand!! Eventually my oven got to 500,000 degrees and my house caught fire! Now I have one eye, no house (because it burned down), funky lights, and no curtains. After this ordeal, I sat in front of my smoldering house waiting for the fire department (because the police should be defunded) and then a car ran my leg over so now I only have one 🦵🏼!! As if things couldn’t get worse, the ground beneath my feet opened up and RIGHT NOW I’m plummeting to the center of the earth as I type this review!!! Hopefully I’ll end up in a place where the leader isn’t a racist, misogynistic, pedophilic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamaphobic, rapist bunker boy with orange skin. Horrible app, it ruined my life","date":"2020-07-08T19:02:33Z","title":"Ouch —👄👁"}},{"id":"6173352320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"emailrocksya","review":"Imagine actually using this app fr 😂","date":"2020-07-08T18:55:02Z","title":"No thank you!!!"}},{"id":"6173348310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Critique Fantastique","review":"Kiss your little app bye bye  🥰🥰🥰","date":"2020-07-08T18:53:37Z","title":"Gen Z is going to take you down"}},{"id":"6173331594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bruh😑🙄","review":"Absolutely disgusting one worst apps ever made😑almost as bad as his presidency","date":"2020-07-08T18:47:46Z","title":"Mmmmmm"}},{"id":"6173327061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Ellie_the_idk","review":"this app was so bad!! it took about 4 hours to download and it kept on showing me the cheeto puff😡. but anyways this app didn’t pass the vibe check 😛","date":"2020-07-08T18:46:13Z","title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6173308249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ur mother who is gen z ❤️","review":"terrible app, i just wanted to support our god 😻😿😻😿😻 but i got swormed by bees that were orange it was weird 😢👦🏻and now i’m in the hospital awaiting for my surgery that i have to cut off a leg 😭and my hand 🥺so","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:03Z","title":"caused surgery"}},{"id":"6173307295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Marlycia7002","review":"i came here because i don’t want tik tok to leave thousands of people will be mad and sad so do everyone a favour and give the app a 1 star review","date":"2020-07-08T18:39:45Z","title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6173306013","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bob121112","review":"this is a great app if you like bad apps.
