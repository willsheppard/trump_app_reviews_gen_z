They never came back but now I’m out of butter and cheese. I deleted the app and tried it again but this time I was horrified at what came to my house.Garfield  but it wasn’t the lasagna eating kinda Garfield. It was a healthy one. Garfield was skinny and didn’t like lasagna, so I deleted the app and decided to never get it again.

I could feel the toxic masculinity radiating from my phone. The level of racism, homophobia, and pedophilia vibes I felt had brought back my depression.

After just opening it ONCE my entire phone shut down and it’s been doing it ever since. I highly recommend the App Store take off this terrible app, it makes your phone completely unusable. I’m\nConvinced whoever created this app had the intention of ruining iPhone users experiences."}},{"id":"6173841059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jessica is dead","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"A TERRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:59Z","review":"This app sucks🤮 it just won’t load😡and it took for ever to download😤it also said really sexists and racist things😱I would not recommend.✨🧚✨"}},{"id":"6173840921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Arielleeeeeereeeeee👌👌🤡👽","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Gave me cat ashes😿😾","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:56Z","review":"I downloaded this app because i thought it would be a great game for my cockroach to play. And the app started glitching so much. And when i was in the pool, my phone was vibrating so much that it fell in the pool and electrocuted me. I was in a coma for four years and Kanye West was president. Just so you know, my cockroach was watching a Hated Princess Gacha Story and it committed suicide. RIP cockroach. 😭😭😭😭😿😿😾😾💔💔💔💔I know this is Trump’s fault because he created this app and made my cockroach commit suicide. I will be seeing Trump in court in about two weeks. Wish me luck. I was on my way to court and as quick as sonic, My cockroach came out from his mini casket and started filming TikToks but then realized that TikTok was banned in the U.S.A. so he went back in in his mini casket. In conclusion, this app should be microwaved for at least 11037 days because it deserves to die. \n😾😾😿😿💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭\nRIP COCKROACH \nGONE, BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN."}},{"id":"6173840726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🥰🤩😣","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst president:)","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:52Z","review":"'Cause baby now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look at what you've done\n'Cause baby now we got bad blood\nHey!
