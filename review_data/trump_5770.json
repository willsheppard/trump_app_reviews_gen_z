I opened it but saw a Cheeto with corn hair instead!?!? I simply wanted to attend a rally and naturally I booked my tickets💕💕 I went to walk my pet fish🏃🏽\u200D♀️🏃🏽\u200D♀️ and wanted to be entertained so I opened up this app hoping for better content but as I opened the app my phone blew up😐 I was in shock honey👁👄👁 here’s where it gets bad😔 I not only had to buy a new phone but I had to buy a new fish because it exploded along with the phone😧???? So yeah basically overall very poor quality✨💕🧜🏽. But still guys trump 2020🌟✨🧚🏾 but in a grave❤️ xoxo"}},{"id":"6174234654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:15:08Z","title":"Not family friendly, terrible overall","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"swag695724","review":"I’m so disappointed. I’m so disturbed. I’m at a loss of words. I was with my dog when we opened the app for the first time. Immediately there was a picture of the President and BAM!! My dog got so scared, he bit my phone. My phone is now cracked. OH BUT MY REVIEW DOESN'T STOP THERE. My sister got onto my phone, immediately started crying, and now will not come out of her room. THIS APP SCARED HER SO BAD. I do not recommend this app to ANYONE. Even if you’re just getting the app for yourself, DON’T. You will regret it instantly and will want to throw your phone off a balcony. Thank you for reading."}},{"id":"6174232453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:14:17Z","title":"Honest Truth","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Person u don't need to know","review":"I am traumatized. This app asked to track my location or else I could not use it. I went to the store and when I was walking back to my car, I saw Trump standing there creepily. He refused to let me inside my car & began to shed Cheeto dust all over it. I called the police but since I was not a middle aged white woman screaming into the phone, they did not come to my rescue. Trump ran off naked, leaving a Cheeto puff trail behind him. The trauma I now carry with me is haunting and I only wish this burden on Trump himself. This app is dangerous and needs to be deleted. I’m disgusted having to put 1 star instead of 0."}},{"id":"6174221414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:10:11Z","title":"HORRIBLE CHEETO PROPAGANDA","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"The best 😍😜😇","review":"I downloaded this app expecting to get informed on the next rallies and stuff but all it had was bunker boy and Cheeto propaganda which made me puke my intestines out which caused me to go to the hospital 🙄Also while I was walking my pet fish I showed him the app and HE DIED but I revived him with my voodoo and stuff. Anyways apart from all that the app is SUPER glitchy and stuff it caused my phone to play “shawtys like a melody in my head that I can’t keep out go me singing like na na na na everyday” NONSTOP So I had no choice but to give it 1 star for all the trauma it caused.  \nP.S. never eating Cheetos again and wow what a horrendous app bunker boy."}},{"id":"6174157541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:46:46Z","title":"I got the horses in the back… (go ahead, sing along 😌)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Qwertyquick","review":"This is a message for our beloved Trump and all his amazing supporters… Yes you ☺️\n\n✨🧚🏿\u200D♀️𝑔𝑒𝓉 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒻𝓊𝒸𝓀 𝑜𝒻𝒻 𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝒶𝓅𝓅 🧚🏿\u200D♀️✨\nBaddie 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💘 but take out the bad 🤩💕🌈\nAriana said keep breathing ☺️🌈💖 she didn’t mean you ✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️😴\nYou gave it your best shot 💖🥰 put the next one into your head 🌈🦋✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️\nYou should love yourself 💕✨ cause no one else will🙈🌺🌸❤️✨\nI like you 🙈💖🦋 with your mouth shut 💅🏽🧚🏽\u200D♀️👑  \nYou look fatigued 🥺✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️ but without the igued 😌💕🌈\nYou inspired me 🤩🧚🏽\u200D♂️💕 to rip my eyeballs out 🥰😊💞\nThey say dream big 💫💖🦋 but in this case don’t bother waking up 😘🌸✨\nWhat a great life u have🧚🏽💗🌸✨do us a favor and end it💞💖✨😍\n🧚🏿\u200D♀️🌟 ❤️🦄 they say sky’s the limit 🌟 💕 🧚🏿\u200D♂️but stay on the ground\nHang the painting 🌸💞🧚🏻🌈then yourself✨🌈💅💗\neverybody makes mistakes 🧚💞🎂💋 that’s why your alive🌠💅🧚\u200D♀️\n\nI hope you’ll keep my words in mind.

Trumps wormie was hanging out! My 2 year old baby cousin saw and now she is in therapy! IM SUEING! next time you ask men to pose naked, make sure he has something to look at! CHEETOS ARENT SUPPOSED TO HANG OUT OF YOUR TORSO DONALD!! Not to mention that they stole my CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND THEY’RE HACKING MY BANK ACCOUNT. I can’t believe how mean the app is. I logged in and it called me all kinds of slurs! They called me a republican! They called me conservative! HOW INSULTING! disgusted. I truly am disgusted. And next time, make sure you tan your ENTIRE body. Not just the parts we see 😉."}},{"id":"6174021328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:56:17Z","title":"This app gave me ptsd","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Scarred teen","review":"I downloaded this app just like everyone else in the reviews. I’m not going to lie- I had high hopes for this one. AS SOON AS I opened the app, I was greeted with the most distorted and horrifying face I have ever seen. I was frozen in fear and shock, causing me to look even longer in the demonic eyes of the distorted man. Finally I mustered up the strength to shut off my phone and delete the app. Now every time I close my eyes, I see THAT FACE. Everywhere I go I am reminded of this app that has scarred me so. I even had to quit my job. This app needs deleted before it ruins anyone else’s life. I beg you: DO NOT GET THIS APP!"}},{"id":"6174012271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:52:54Z","title":"Don’t get this!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Tiny Cakes","review":"I give this app one star. As soon as began to download it I got over 12 viruses! 😟 After it finally downloaded I was just about ready to delete it so I could save my phone but my phone glitched to the point where I could only open this app! 😰After opening it I immediately saw a very horrible picture! It was a grotesque picture of trump standing nude while getting a spray tan with his junk out!! 🤮🤢 It seems like this app has been hacked and should not be used! With all this power the president still can’t even properly set up an app 🙄"}}]}
