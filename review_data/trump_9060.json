I had a horrible seizure because of it. I was rushed to the hospital and I had to show the doctors what app caused me this pain and I opened the app again and I saw this thing that looked like a person but it was just a Cheeto with a wig on. My eyes were it mediately burned and now I’m Helen Keller and I just want to say that I rate this at five stars because there’s no need to have an app for a crusty, dusty, musty, racist, rapist, Cheeto looking, potato head, monster like him."}},{"id":"6174741319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m pretty sure this is a scam","userName":"Karen0.6","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:49:27Z","rating":1,"review":"Hello! I recently got this app to keep up to date with our current persistent and events. Everything was fine until this man with an awfully done tan started to make lewd and inappropriate comments towards the younger users and toward underage child in general, even to his own daughter! I’m sure the creators or the team of this app can fix this problem but until then I’ll be deleting this app. Please get that man off the app! He’s very creepy and gross!"}},{"id":"6174600143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely not.","userName":"aghnicknametaken","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:08:11Z","rating":1,"review":"THIS APP MURDERED MY PET DINOSAUR!!!! DO NOT BUY!! My dino, Sarah, and I decided to do a little research on the right side. We downloaded this app completely forgetting that Sarah is allergic to racists! She fell to the ground, completely motionless. I screamed for help, but the app could do nothing to help. Sarah was in the hospital for 4 days in a coma before being pronounced dead. Donald Trump refuses to answer my emails regarding his crimes. If u download this app, be prepared to get your pet dino brutally murdered and sent to the hospital and have to pay thousands of dollars for hospital bills."}},{"id":"6174591455","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is terrible","userName":"PeterPanda24","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:05:46Z","rating":1,"review":"I was just minding my own business and i saw this app. i saw how bad the ratings are and i wanted to see for myself if it was really this bad. AS SOON AS I OPEN THE APP, it says “keep america great” i’m sorry, but i don’t support false advertisement. america isn’t great and has only went downhill since trump became president. he’s racist, homophobic, can’t face the fact other people aren’t going to agree with him, stupid, and downright not a good fit for president.... he’s also very orange, it’s unfortunate."}},{"id":"6174583737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting. Horrible. Nasty.","userName":"notmath101","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:03:35Z","rating":1,"review":"This app will show you ugly images of a Cheeto. This app stole my stove and pet cow. After throwing up for the horrific pictures I was shown I was looking for a pet cow to ride to the supermarket, but I couldn’t find. Instead I found a note that said your cow is being held hostage by white suprematists in the middle of Alabama. Then on my way out, my door was gone! The app continued to show me horrific images of an orange in White House. Don’t recommend. Do not download unless you want your cow or door stolen."}},{"id":"6174578652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump is a narcissistic lunatic","userName":"🐝real","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:10Z","rating":1,"review":"My brain cells would die with each word I read or hear about trump. I don’t find it entertaining to hear from a sexual predator, racist jerk who is a pathological liar who cheated his way through life. He is clearly afraid of women and doesn’t know how to treat a lady. He has dismantled our strong and respected nation and left it as a laughingstock around the globe. He is an uneducated idiot who always does the wrong thing. He lacks morals, knowledge, compassion, integrity and honesty. Take this trash off social media."}},{"id":"6174555128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app (Dangerous)","userName":"ggg.funn","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:55:25Z","rating":1,"review":"Downloaded this app to open my view on politics. Seconds after downloading my goldfish died and I heard demonic whispering that continued to repeat ‘tRuMp 2o20’ and that’s when my ferret started blurting out racist/sexist comments. Ignored all the signs up until my dog got a horrible spray tan and toupee while I was at work. It didn’t stop until I deleted the app and rated the app zero stars. You please help out your fellow Americans by removing this app from the App Store and help me get justice for Bubbles🐠🌊🚽✊"}},{"id":"6174515613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Maga?

So i was never really a trump supporter in the first place but I decided to give him a chance and when trump held a rally in Tulsa ,I reserved a seat but I was never able to trump make it because HE NEVER BROUGHT MY PLANE TICKET 😡 I was furious!!!! How could he let me reserve a seat but then not buy my ticket smh 🤦\u200D♀️  Despite my anger I still downloaded his app and it was SOOO SLOW 😡 not to mention racist, xenophobic, homophobic, and worst of all the whole app was ORANGE 🤬🤬🤬 DO NOT use this app it will disappoint you as the president himself."}},{"id":"6174477915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"First love","userName":"Dianalove16","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:37Z","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened the app a naked orange mole rat jumped on the screen and told me I’d never make it to college.i was waiting for Donnie to stick up for me, but he just laughed. I really thought he’d be there for me. After my boyfriend broke up with me last year I’d lost all hope of finding love. All of that changed when I say trumps face. To have him humiliate me in front of the mole rat was incredibly heart breaking. I can never know my face out in public again. Donnie, baby I hope you’re happy."}},{"id":"6174409821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD 🤢🤮","userName":"whoacean","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:13:06Z","rating":1,"review":"i was just trying to see other ways to ✨support✨ the us, but then little leprechauns hopped out of my screen as soon as i tried to open the app 😭 the leprechauns then started screaming at me “all lives matter” and then they ATE MY PET RATS!! they hopped back into my phone and left the bloody mess for me to clean up! now every time i try to open the app, its just a picture of trump with his leprechauns. nothing can bring my rats back now, but the best i could do was leave this review"}}]}
