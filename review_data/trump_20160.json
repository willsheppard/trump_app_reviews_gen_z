All you see as you open the app is a giant Cheeto ✨orange✨ loooking animal. Not pleasant to look at at all. My eyes👁😤 will be forever scarred 🥰🧚🏼and my memory will now have to be erased🙈 so I can try and forget that horrendous face that this app is promoting. I am highly offended this app though an orange would be a great representative of a political app🤢🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6174453333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:26:17Z","userName":"Jackiethefail","title":"Horrible App >:|","review":"A horrible experience overall. First of all, it started off with “Keep America Great.” As of right now, America isn’t all that “Great”. There’s still so much racism and inequality, police brutality, there’s kids in cages, and we’re still going through a whole pandemic, which could’ve been avoided if Trump took care of it earlier. Don’t vote for Trump.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174450040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:25:18Z","userName":"hddjosnxhfieiw","title":"my real name shæñë ÿæw 😰","review":"I loVe cheeto man so i got this app. As soon as i opened it his nudes popped up.🤮then after i left the app his nudes would pop up every time a tapped something. Than an hour later the FBI showed up at my house and told me they we’re going to force me to vote for trump.

My dog screamed and told me to delete the app immediately. Obviously i listened to him. Over the next few days i experienced extreme nightmares where the cheeto from the app would pop up and scare me😰😰😰. I just can’t believe it. MUST BE DELETED ❤️ (also pls register to vote so we can get this ugly fat man out of office)","rating":1}},{"id":"6174423465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:15Z","userName":"eatrocks23","title":"nice try... but no❤️","review":"This app is horrible not only because if the graphic images of the Cheeto man himself  almost making me vomit but the app glitches way too much for use. As well as send obnoxious notifications that are truly unnecessary. The app just be taken off the AppStore at this point. If I could I would even give it a 0 stars.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174414359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:14:27Z","userName":"աիդա","title":"🤢🤢 ամոթ քեզ 🤦\u200D♀️🤦\u200D♀️","review":"제발 이제 그만\n밤이 눈을 멀게 끔 하니\n넌 또 몰래 숨어들었지\n잠든 귓가 쓱 핥다 쳐다보다\n할퀴곤 웃어대\n끝도 없이 속삭이는 목소리\nOh you're the bad dream kill\n나를 홀려 자꾸 불러\n너 있는 곳 그래 네게 오라고 ah\n날 안다고?

I didn’t think it was much so I went to sleep. The next day I looked on my phone and I had 100 thousand notifications from the app about tiger king and Taco Bell restaurants. This app is glitchy!!!!

This is outrages and I will not tolerate this on my app store. If this does not change i will be taking my business to a company that does not support racism sexism and much more disregard of human rights.
