The color palette is horrendous and gives the viewer a headache within minutes. This app is not secure with personal information and has leaked my info to many third party sites which as caused me to receive nonstop spam.","userName":"bfsal","isEdited":false,"title":"Crooked app"}},{"id":"6133512103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-28T22:23:31Z","rating":1,"review":"i wish i could rate this app -69 stars. as soon as i downloaded this app i opened it and i got numerous texts saying “The Manny Will Not Be Televised”.

Let’s just say it was bad. I couldn’t get passed the loading screen. I’ll need to talk to Trump’s manager. When I finally got in I saw a mess. Also Trump is a racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, white supremacist who can’t run a business let alone a country. Reconsider who you’ll vote for in 2020.","userName":"Notical Hag","isEdited":false,"title":"My Name Is Karen Donaldson And..."}},{"id":"6101868179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-20T21:33:12Z","rating":1,"review":"Ever since using this app I’ve been bombarded by fake news and people with bad English contacting me asking for credit card and social security info.

I also was not able to see the mass murder of POC and the abductions of indigenous women. As true colonizers, I think that this app should provide steps on how to steal land and spread diseases to indigenous people. \n\nFOR LEGAL REASONS, I DON’T CONDONE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.","userName":"Tsundere13","isEdited":false,"title":"DISAPPOINTING"}},{"id":"6068107126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-12T20:16:22Z","rating":1,"review":"When i first opened the app, it asked for my social security number and credit card information.
