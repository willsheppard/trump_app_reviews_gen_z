This app has taken up 90% of my storage and on top of that my phone has starting freezing after downloading it. I went to go look at my camera roll and every single picture is deleted and the cause is this app. I remember the app asking for access to my photos, so me being me I clicked accept. Years worth of photos down the drain... such a waste and I’m very upset 🤬🤬 becareful downloading this, Bc your photos will get stolen and deleted 😿😿","userName":"iicrazycat"}},{"id":"6173551418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Would leave 0 stars if I could. TRUMP 2020!!","review":"This app is awful!!! I tried using this app to keep up to date with the new facist regime (my family lineage is Italian and Austrian, facism is my HERITAGE) and the app kept crashing and making my phone do weird stuff. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STAY UP TO DATE WITH THE COMING OF THE NEW NEw OrDER WITH A BROKEN APP, THANKS OBAMA. I can’t wait until this app is FIXED, and we can finally become great and follow China’s lead in destroying nations and suppressing our people. I hate having freedom of speech, democracy, AND basic human rights! If you hate the future vote TRUMP 2020!!!\n\n🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊","userName":"AnnaGi96"}},{"id":"6173525766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:56Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Very disappointing","review":"Hello all! Just wanted to write this review to discuss how ATROCIOUS this app is. It’s very slow and is extremely flawed with its messages. It needs to be taken off of the App Store IMMEDIATELY because many of the images on the page are quite disturbing. As soon as you open said app, in fact, one of these completely inappropriate pictures pop up it’s very disturbing and frankly, very hard on anybody’s eyesight. It is what seems to be a orange with a wig on. Nobody should have to see that offensive imagery anywhere :) have a blessed day","userName":"READ THIS!

I was shocked 😱.As soon as you open the app📱, a really fat 🤮, wrinkly, stale cheeto looks RIGHT AT YOU 😳!! It nearly put me in the ER 🏨!!

It took 7 hours to download and once it finally did my dead dog had come back to life and SLAPPED my phone out of my hand. I was confused so I ran upstairs but when I got to the top I saw the president standing there he pushed me down the stairs😭✨ once I finally stopped rolling the beloved president 🍊had jumped down the stairs and landed on me crushing me like a bug 🐛 he proceeded to kick me, jump on me, yelled racist slurs at me, spit on me and finally he picked me up and slammed my head into the wall.👁👄👁","userName":"jagxhzj"}},{"id":"6173366104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever.","review":"All opinions about Donald Trump aside, this app is awful. Plenty of other people have mentioned the bugs, glitches, and other mechanical concepts wrong with the app, and they’re true. The app took 4 hours to download, which is ridiculous. Once it finally downloaded, I couldn’t even spend a full minute on the app without it crashing. Not to mention how confusing and unusable the layout is. I couldn’t figure out how to do anything on it. For the love of god just remove this app from the appstore, it’s too far gone.","userName":"Gracie0957807871514162553"}},{"id":"6173348436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:53:40Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Toddler President👁👄👁","review":"I downloaded this app to see if it passed the vibe check.

But I,🧑🏼\u200D💻 as an educated college/high school student, decided to read like so many of us were taught at school.📖 Apparently if paired with 5G it has the power to brain wash the user. 🤯Thank god I had 4G, Other wise I would have turned into a sheep 🐑🐑that closes its eyes 🙈and ears 🙉to all criticism of THE ORANGE. 🍊🍊🍊Unfortunately I cannot vote this year... 3 months too young 😔😢 but I will still do my part 🥰❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤎","userName":"OllieOliveOboelo22"}},{"id":"6173329547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:47:03Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst Mistakes Of My LIFE!!","review":"This app made my phone glitch SO MUCH that i had to power it off in order for it to calm down. When i open the app it either kicks me out of turns off my phone completely. If i do get it to work, it soooo slowww. I just want to support our president but this is just disgraceful.
