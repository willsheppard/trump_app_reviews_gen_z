I was once a Republican. A conservative. A gun loving, confederate flag wearing, tobacco chewing, day ruining, hate preaching trump supporter.🤠 so, when I opened this app, I was hoping that I would get just that. i got the ✨BUNKER BOY PREMIUM✨, so i was apparently getting extra perks.  But I was confronted with something absolutely HORRIFYING. First they asked for my photo and showed what mine and trumps baby would look like (ugly on his part)if i let him “grab me by the 🐱”. Then they said they were sending a man in a “sexy trump costume” for a “good time”. that man came to my home and killed my fish bc it was black. 😵(RIP JAQUORIAN)🐟 the funeral is this weekend.😞 The app also asked me to put in my phone number. I did, and was then texted by the Trump administration. They showed me something that made me projectile vomit in my mouth.🤮 I saw our president NAKED. IN THE NUDE. NO CLOTHES. just his orange flabby body!!!! ❌DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP.❌ once i saw that 🍤 i immediately realized... all of my views were WRONG! trump is a racist misogynistic homophobic xenophobic islamophobic transphobic rapist who does NOT deserve the privilege of leading this country🤡!! i am now a PROUD liberal. and a barb! 🇺🇸🏳️\u200D🌈🏴✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 #barbzforbernie  \nYou ain't f**k me, you f**ked the old body\nYou ain't f**k Nicki, you f**ked Nicole body\nAin't no miles on this here new body\nOff with they heads, these b*t*hes is nobodies\nGot-got me a new body, now I need some new d**k\nDon't let the word, tryna stick me like a toothpick\nGot me a new body, now I need some new d**k\nI bust shots, don't duck, unless the shoe fit\nCookie game make me the G.O.A.T\nCookie game come with the throat\nPuff puff pass, no you do not want the smoke\nBi-bi-b*t*hes be sleepin' on me, but be claimin' they woke\nf**k up a check on my body\nThen let him lick on my body, out in Abu Dhabi\nYou see me shinin', you p*ssed\nI-I-I think my haters just really be wantin' a kiss\nThey know I'll body you, sis (body, body)\nOld n***a hit me and I say, \"new body, who this?\"\n(Old n***a hit me and I say, \"new body, who this?\")","title":"💋✨this app changed my life🥰💫😭🤮for the worst🙈🤡","userName":"a sad conservative 😞🤠🇺🇸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:51:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174339622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app is absolutely horrible, unacceptable, and the website is the worst.
