And why does it look rotten 🤢 I feel bad for his son who has to deal with this foolishness I will never download an app like this ever again😡","title":"Horrible app","userName":"shrekx0bama","date":"2020-07-09T21:50:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178360733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Thanks for this app I was very happy to get it so i can see what is going on but honestly I’m🍑 very mad bc your shutting down tik tok stupid wore i ducking hate you I hope you do of spraytan disease 💓 I appreciate you 🍊congratulations on attempting to make America great again what happened to the wall🇺🇸 you need to help me my sister commited suicide bc she saw your tiny dick🧚🏻so your paying for her funeral also don’t get rid of tik tok 🍊you orange person so don’t be racist to Mexicans bc they are apart of us but since you our think about it bc technically your orange and that’s a different color from white so we are also calling you different colored as we should 🍑🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👏 thank you for my ted talk also your app is crappy also btw Trump dick is like a stick it’s so small it would snap so easily mostly bc of his spray tan he gets in the Oval Office the same office that most presidents had sex in and all kinds of stuff so 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕","title":"Donald Trump sucks🤮👏✨💘🧚🏻","userName":"💘💘🥰🥰😘😘","date":"2020-07-09T21:49:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178359823","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to see what it was and it literally was the worst idea ever it’s made my drop my phone cause i was disappointment on what my screen was showing this app should be taken down it glitches my phone froze it soo bad it wasn’t even working I wish I could give this app 0 stars or -100000 that’s how bad this app is stuck and it is really annoying and disgrace take this app of so out and I was exited to see his plans but NOOOO it just had to crash my phone and make it lag so much it wouldn’t even work this app owes us new phone  AND JUSTICE OF TIKTOK !!","title":"TIKTOK","userName":"aubsella640","date":"2020-07-09T21:49:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178359756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what was happening with trump and what he does but this app kept glitching and showing inappropriate stuff this is seriously disgusting I CANNOT believe Mr.Orange🥰🧚\u200D♀️💕💫✨🦋🍊💞💗 would do this, I give this app a 0/10 :)","title":"WORST APP","userName":"ratatatattatatatatattatata","date":"2020-07-09T21:49:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178359376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"yo gen z bout to take u tf out Donald u racist f*ck","title":"✨everyone matters✨🧚\u200D♀️except for u🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"gennnn zzzz","date":"2020-07-09T21:49:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178356964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first downloaded this app all I wanted was to get updates and see where our president would be for rallies. And everything was going amazing until approximately two fortnights prior to me writing this review. I was using the app just minding my own business when I heard an incessant scratching sound coming from underneath my bed. I was home alone at the time and opted to stay inside to avoid the riots led by angry people in my home city of Minneapolis. Like why do people think it’s okay to burn down the entire city. All the police officer did was suffocate a man for almost 9 minutes. He was black so it didn’t really count. Honestly this would be a bigger problem if the it was a full human, it was only 3/5 of one so it clearly doesn’t warrant the reaction it has received. But back to what I was saying, there was an incessant scratching noise on the underside of my bed. So I sat up and closed the app and turned on my flashlight. I used it to shine light under my bed and peaked under. You wouldn’t believe what I saw. A CREATURE. It was hunched and covered in blubber. I was a freakish orange tint and gave off a pungent stench that seeped into my nostrils and assaulted my very being. As you have probably guessed by now it was the very same man who was my president. I was absolutely delighted he paid a visit to my humble abode. And when I offered him food and a comfortable bed he refused and said he would rather stay under my bed than face the angry mobs of people outside my home. Which is understandable. Why should the leader of our country be held accountable for his mistakes, that clearly unacceptable. To summarize everything, the reason I gave this app a one star rating was because of the terrible stench of injustice, misogyny, pedophilia, racism, homophobia and disease it left under my bed.","title":"Embarrassed","userName":"Avid Trump supportee","date":"2020-07-09T21:48:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178355767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app in hopes of getting relevant news about 🇺🇸✨America✨🇺🇸 but after literal HOURS of downloading, I was instead greeted by pages of misinformation and heavily-biased media, organized and adopted by a gross orange🤢. Additionally, rather than just keeping his biased booty inside his own little app, he’s attempting to take down other important sources of news media like Tik Tok that disagree with his ugly beliefs😡 Gen Z will not tolerate this. Worst app I’ve ever had, -999999/10 💅","title":"Worst app I’ve ever had🤢👎😡","userName":"Skxhwhebfkfywbdn","date":"2020-07-09T21:47:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178355434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because of my wonderful, racist president, Donald Duck. At first I thought it was the best app ever but till this day I regret ever coming across this app. It was a Sunday afternoon when I decided to download it. My grandma and my dog, Barron, were right beside me when suddenly I felt an electric shock through my body. Turns out I died along with Barron and my grandma. I’m currently writing this from hell and I hope to see Donald Duck here soon so I can beat his nonexistent ass✨😌. RIP grandma. RIP barron.
