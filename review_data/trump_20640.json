I tried many things to fix it but it couldn't work. Trump maybe you shouldn't have an app if you can't spend your 1 billion dollars right. Also this app sent my phone number to a bunch of scam calls.","date":"2020-07-08T17:28:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Beware of this terrible app.","rating":1,"userName":"trump2020dead"}},{"id":"6173082132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app.. then my phone blacked out! I had to get a whole new phone! This app seriously broke my phone. If this is any suggestion of how trump will run his campaign I’m out. I was already out bc Donald Trump is a racist dirtbag who only wants to undermine america. Can’t believe there are still WILLING supporters. Let’s pray that America will be just fine without him.

It took 17 hours to download, and then as soon as I opened it, rats started to surround me and I was being body slammed by hundreds of them. ✨🧚\u200D♀️💕 Getting this app may do the same and do not recommend, I was in very much pain. Not to mention I’m severely allergic to rats so when they were attacking me I went into allergic reaction.","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","rating":1,"userName":"ratatouille rat a licious"}},{"id":"6173079855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app has glitched my phone sooo bad and the shuts off my dog’s wifi. i don’t even understand why a cheeto needs a whole app it’s useless and it does no good for anyone. this app connected to my buffalo and made it feed my squirrel. it’ll keep opening the app for no reason at all and even start making my phone shake. take this app down now!","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"userName":"halyn223"}},{"id":"6173075460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took up 38 GBs on my phone. Took wayyyyy to long to download. The first question it asked me was if I was Jewish, when I said yes, it took me to a link for the German Concentration camps. Not Acceptable, what so ever. This app is disgusting, the “facts” and “news” on here have never been fact checked and is always incorrect. This app needs to be deleted and removed.","date":"2020-07-08T17:24:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Hateful and Fake News","rating":1,"userName":"ghostpepe"}}]}
