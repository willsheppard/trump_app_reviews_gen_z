Everything in my phone glitched. My backgrounds turned into pictures of Trump, my camera roll completely deleted and all pictures were replaced with Trump 2020 ads, my apps were all deleted and I only could open and download Trump related apps. Not only did all of this happen, what really scarred me the most was when I opened up FaceTime, the only person I could FaceTime was someone named the ✨annoying orange ✨. My phone is broken. I am very upset.  This app has failed me and I am very angry.","userName":"gen Z😍✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:49:43Z"}},{"id":"6176909758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","review":"this is not it. the app crashed every time i opened it and when i finally got the app to work it gave me a death threats, and i consistency got these threats by the hour each time getting worse and worse. the app said the only way to get rid of these threats was to buy his merchandise and go to one of trumps rally’s so i put every item on his merchandise website in my cart x10 clicked check out and realized i didn’t want to buy it so i left it then i proceeded to reserve 2 tickets to his next rally but as soon i reserved them i realized i have to catch clouds that day and i will be unable to attend. I then had no other choice but to delete the app and write this review.","userName":"Jshsnshusn","date":"2020-07-09T14:20:42Z"}},{"id":"6176715438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP TO EXISIT","review":"now you might be thinking, how can Donald trumps app be awful, he’s the president he should make something that’s functional and won’t ruin your phone. well i agree with you, this app is absolutely atrocious and it has completely destroyed my phone and pictures keep getting deleted and other apps. my phone always turns off for about 10 minutes randomly even with full charge, all of my data keeps getting erased. and if it’s tiktok everyone is worried about they should start looking at this app first. it’s almost as bad as the person himself. please never download this app 😌✨\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","userName":"lilly munn","date":"2020-07-09T13:29:33Z"}},{"id":"6176515260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrifying","review":"I decided to show my patriotism by downloading this app so I could view the election from both parties. That was my first grave mistake, the second the app downloaded my phone crashed and I couldn’t get back into it for hours. Then when I finally did get into it all my photos and messages were gone. I tried to get back into the app but my phone crashed again. I decided to go onto Instagram for a change of scenery but everything was a trump add. I then went to tik tok and again everything was white supremacists screaming “TRUMP 2020”. I was horrified and I had to buy a completely new phone because my last one was completely hacked by trump propaganda.","userName":"Tico😝😄😄😄😀😛","date":"2020-07-09T12:35:49Z"}},{"id":"6176450386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Superrr baddd don’t download","review":"When I tried to download it, it took a long time to download it. I wanted to see when it was the events of my great president ❤️🧚💞 I love going to see how he speaks and despises people of color and also women but I could not because the events  I had a bad time, activate the notifications and they did not reach me or anything like that, when messages came to me from time to time and I am a Karen who cares about other people's affairs because I cannot let those notifications interrupt my  moments where I discriminate against people ❤️💞 because that is the best thing that my dearest president has taught me, therefore DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APPLICATION EVERYTHING IS A DISCONTROL AND A DISASTER LIKE OUR COUNTRY","userName":"Karen (trump 2020 🥰❤️🧚💞)","date":"2020-07-09T12:17:58Z"}},{"id":"6176378941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"What is this app?","review":"Firstly this app took so long to download with a lot of space on my phone, so I wouldn’t try to download it. Then after I gave it a chance to download after it a long time, it started to get into my phone and started to hack into it, and started to tell me that the only way I’m able to vote it be a white person, which is offensive knowing that I’m a POC. Then after I responded to things they were sending me, telling them that it wasn’t fair, they were calling me a negro (why would they even call me that after all the things they said before) and I have to go back to my country (even though I was born in America, but I’m guessing they mean Africa).","userName":"warmcoffae","date":"2020-07-09T11:58:16Z"}},{"id":"6176327933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"disgusted","review":"When I first opened the app it started glitching so much. Later it started giving me random ads and I know they were definitely  viruses 🦠 It hacked my social media accounts and it invaded my privacy. I am absolutely disgusted by this app. I even hate the name of this app. Another reason why you should not get this app is because an add about charity came and as a humble nice paper salesman at Dunder Mifflin paper company I love to give to charity... I gave one dollar to charity just to find out that it is not even going to charity!!!!!!!!!! This app also hacked in my bank account and started spending money on self tanner shade orange 🍊 I MEAN WHAT IS THAT ABOUT??? I AM FURIOUS. I am Dr. Buttlicker and i am sincerely disappointed.","userName":"MC.BOOB","date":"2020-07-09T11:43:52Z"}},{"id":"6176196717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD  😠","review":"first of all it took a whole day to download,second of all when i would use it would log me out 🤡third of all the whole bee movie script would pop out of nowhere 😠,also every time i would use the app it would control my phone and my phone would hit me everywhere especially my head😠it was horrible so do not download this disgusting app oh and i also saw donald’s trump nudes in the app 🤮 that was disgusting so for your sake of your eyes do not download i had to get bleach and pour it in my eyes ,thanks to that now i’m blind ❤️✨which is unacceptable ,it feels like i was trapped 😠i never felt so much disrespect and disgust towards an app so once again do not download!😠","userName":"zamoeve","date":"2020-07-09T11:04:28Z"}},{"id":"6176010601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Joe Mama","review":"When I opened this app, I could smell the STENCH of racism and white privilege right away. I was also confused because I didn’t know that rapists, racists and misogynistic people could be president. Oh wait. Yes I did because most of our presidents were. I could also feel the government watch me through my camera thinking that maybe, just maybe,  they got another vote for TRUMP 2020 because I searched for this app, but alas I pulled a 180 and decided I honestly would rather die than vote for this man. Knowing that the Cheeto puff faced man is threatened by Gen Z and therefore wants to take down TikTok is embarrassing. So to close this review, all I have to say is I hope the Simpson’s prediction comes true iykyk\nThank you🖕🏼","userName":"Joey164488","date":"2020-07-09T10:05:45Z"}},{"id":"6175520431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"IT THREATENS YOU.","review":"It told me if i didn’t rate the app “5 stars” and write a review saying that all the 1 star reviews were “fake”, then they would kill my cat. It scared me so much i tried to log out but they had already stolen all the data on my phone and gave me a bunch of viruses. I tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let me. It ended up sending all my deleted search history and photos to all my contacts on the phone. I am so embarrassed. DO NOT GET THIS APP. ⚠️A WARNING⚠️ : everyone rating the app 5 stars and saying things like “trump 2020” or “all the 1 star reviews are fake” are the ones that gave into the terrible threats from the app. Poor people.  Rate this app 1 star so no one else gets harmed💔.","userName":"Lolcanthiofanickna123","date":"2020-07-09T07:16:59Z"}}]}
