There was big and far Cheeto puff on my screen and it was the most disgusting gross thing I have ever seen in my life. I had nightmares for weeks. Please do not download this app. Also once I downloaded my dog floated to the ceiling.

Upon opening this app, the electrochemical communications between my neurons MALFUNCTIONED COMPLETELY. By some satanic miracle, blood proceeded to fall from my ears and nose, very Billie eilish vibes. While I do love Billie eilish, I do not share her same willingness for liquid to leak out of my facial orifices. For this reason, I recommend NEVER getting this devil technology.

I downloaded it to support President Trump 🇺🇸, but this app alerted my entire family and I was disowned. I am currently now homeless and have to resort to eating food out of the garbage 😭. Not to mention, this app also gave my dog explosive diarrhea 🤢which I now have to clean up with the last of my clean clothes. For the love of God please do not download this atrocity.","userName":"TheTruth789","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-28T22:26:02Z"}}]}
