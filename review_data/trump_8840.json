I decided to close the app and try it the next day but it constantly began to make my other apps glitch as well, but I didn’t want to believe it was the president’s app, so I continued to try and find a solution, until I uninstalled the app and realized that it had been this app all along.","title":"Kept on glitching","userName":"andreasgalvan","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:15:13Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173223585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app because i just loved trump and then the secret service came and abducted me and said that i was his new sex slave but i was really confused and i looked at my crack addict mother and she said “i sold you for more drugs, they own you now” so i pulled my brown hair into a messy bun and looked my blue orbs into the mirror and stomped out of the house into a black van with my new “owners”. i arrived at the white house within .2 seconds and i was rushed inside and immediately given some lingerie to wear so i could please the president and i was kind of excited. i walked into the oval office to see trump naked and let’s just say he has a small pp. i threw up everywhere when i saw him naked, there was pile everywhere because he’s so ungodly ugly. don’t download it’s not worth it 0/10 experience","title":"kidnapped🖐🏻🥵😢🥰🥺😼💓😐😏♥️","userName":"Bakecm","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:12:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173176206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD ❕❗️ i downloaded the app and it told me to put my phone number and i did then i started to get spammed with text everyday. then i started to get random text from different things like i’m a virgin and someone sent me i might have an std and something about me paying for school with my name and that hasn’t happened before until i signed up for this app. it leaks your phone number and doesn’t keep information private.

Sadly the app continually crashes and freezes making my screen go black. I have to power off my phone repeatedly and I almost had to reset my phone. I only wish I could reset America to where we are all seen equality. I do not recommend getting this app.","title":"Crashing issues","userName":"meg172020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:41:26Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173086998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"all i wanted was to download this app and be educated and have recourses for trump 2020, but similar to many others experiences, this app has made my phone GLITCH BADLY. the app kept kicking me out and a lot of the recourses / reward point they offered were all bugged and all of it was almost like a scam. it seriously messed up my phone and i really don’t see the point in downloading it just you can uninstall it again — that’s how bad the app is. literally wasted my time. worst app ever✨🦋😼","title":"worst app ever","userName":"kysaknajsnsndns","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:28:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173015215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has the worst possible glitching I have seen in any apps I have downloaded. At first your screen will turn black once you tap anything the app has. Then the screen will start flashing. It has come to a point where I do not wish to support this president anymore. The professionalism is just not there. and if you can’t get an app where you share your info to the world to show the actual truth of what you are doing then the app should just not exist.","title":"Glitching!!","userName":"12449;,:","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:05:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172971322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited about this app, but when I downloaded it I realized that our president was really a white supremacists leader in disguise in the form of the US president. He tried to come to my house in the all of his Oompa Loompas to make me get a spray tan just like him so I could be orange and have beautiful hair like he said he had. I told him I didn’t wAnt to do that but he said I didn’t have the right to say no because I’m a woman.  I am deleting this app because he has probably spying on me right now.","title":"Terrible app💔👄💔","userName":"crowest79","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:52:30Z","rating":1}}]}
