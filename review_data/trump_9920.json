Though I don’t have insurance so I have to pay out of pocket. Oh, if only our nation had free health insurance. Now I’m in debt all because Trump and his administration decided to spend money on making this app instead of something else. Such as spending the money to make actual changes, support the BLM movement, investing in research to make a vaccine for COVID-19, or basically anything else to help this country."}},{"id":"6174614365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kkhaji","title":"Protect ur dog","date":"2020-07-09T02:12:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I downloaded dis app I was with ma dog and he started to act funny so I went to check on him but he died😢I called the costumer service n told them wat happened but the response I got was shocking they told me it was the dogs fault for dying when it wat wasn’t supposed to I might be naive but I know something is fishy Im asking the people reading this to get justice for me dog (Ralph) Ik I’m not the only one all the victims need to speak out n tell thier stories I hope I inspired u to speak out 🗣"}},{"id":"6174597366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kikijoehdjcj","title":"Disgusting 🤮","date":"2020-07-09T02:07:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I am shocked 😮 I come to this just like all my other fellow coons💅🏽 I was surprised to see my daddy Trump asking for my number 🥰I was so shocked like don’t you think we’re moving a little to fast 🥴but after I gave him my number I was spammed with black lives matter propaganda I was disgusted 🤢me as a dark skinned caucasian I was offended to why and how he could do this to me😭 I was revolted and had to un-stan because how can he care about that terrorist group uhh🙄 anyway DO NOT DOWNLOAD .

But! then, as I opened the app I was surprised to see that a pseudo-Hitler image of a sickly orange man appear on my screen. And then I looked up and saw that this man was a cult leader, for an America that is undeniably terrible, and it was trying to coerce me to join a hate group. As a person with morals, I must say that this app is should be censored by the United States government, as it violates my eyes and my phone."}},{"id":"6174559929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"whorunthisworld","title":"🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-09T01:56:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app I was horrified because I saw the most disgusting thing in this whole world an orange that can talk😱and then I got shot with lasers and then killer hornets came and zapped me with their mind reading powers I got taken up to space with the aliens where they taught me how tacobell makes their food but then I had to go home and when I got home fbi was at my house because they couldn’t believe how fat my booty was and that kids is the story of how I met your father😌"}},{"id":"6174559696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chloes674589","title":"As an American citizen I’m disgusted","date":"2020-07-09T01:56:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First off the old Cheeto man is our president which honestly I though he was stuck in a peach but you do you boo. Anyways I’m not sure if Cheetos and peaches would go together but I I think they do.
