First, it started with the debt. I could no longer support my family, afford a house, or even pay for transportation to work. I lost my wife, my kids, and my job. I had nothing... or so I thought. Then came the sickness, coronavirus, influenza, strep, I had it all. I thought for sure it would end once I recovered. how foolish. Next came the terminal illnesses. Not one. Many. As I lay on my deathbed, with nothing to my name, I have decided to spend my last breaths warning others of the danger this app has caused to my life.

I understand that ignorant white Americans might think that we all are Mexicans but we ain’t. PERIOD! No offense to my fellow Mexicans we still family. Anyways as we stand in the times of 2020 we see how much BLM are important but as Mr. Donald j trump is also a minority we must come in hand to hand and support the Orange lives matter cause as well. But we can’t do that if he chooses to not admit to what he is. Anyways I know this was all over the place but I have adhd. To all my fellow tik tokers please delete this app and as our fellow queen stated, “Tik Tok on the clock but the party don’t stop no no no no”- KE$HA","title":"This ain’t it","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:43Z"}},{"id":"6174273795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"john wilkes booth 😏","review":"terrible app. donald trump jumped out of my screen and skinned my dog 😱 i was so sad ☹️ he then started yelling out the n word multiple times 😳 i told him to stop and he threatened to make me eat sardines 🤢 i then started to notice that this all started happening when i downloaded this app. i went to my room and got my phone and i was about to delete the app, donald trump comes and throws me out of my windows (i live upstairs) but then barron trump came to save me and told his dad “HEY leave her alone” 😡 we then took donald trump to a movie theater and john wilkes booth was there 😌 and i’m pretty sure you know what happened next.

When I first opened the app the was a picture of what seemed to be an orange human hybrid I was very concerned but I kept on scrolling then it showed the orange - human hybrid as a full bodied person but it was getting a spray tan. Then I realized this was Donald Trump. I then realized I downloaded the wrong app and that this wasn’t subway surfers. But then I looked closer into the picture and realized he was naked. 😧🤭😱🥴. I hadn’t realized before because his shalong a ding dong was so tiny. I definitely do not recommend downloading this app it has permanently given me nightmares 👎🏿","title":"Terrible awful app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:08:46Z"}},{"id":"6174160555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Paige0321","review":"When I opened the app I was greeted with a picture of a orange pole, just staring at me. I freaked out and passed out Bc of the picture. Then I woke up and showed my mom, my mom now needs new eyeballs because just the sight of the oddly shaped pile scarred her and a new nose because just the though of the smell of that pole horrified her. Next my phone completely shut off because of the sighting, and I am now using my tv to write this review. My sister then looked at the picture and almost died from looking at the dark Cheeto colored pole with a wig on top. Over all I did not have good experiences with this app...","title":"This app...belongs to the streets","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:47:54Z"}},{"id":"6174147416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"margaret🦧","review":"i opened the app in great hopes! ...but when it finally loaded after what felt like an ETERNITY, i realized what this app really is. i saw- i cant even bear to explain, it was so traumatizing. please don't show your n*des and child p*rn to your audience. it's absolutely disgusting. this man should not be president!! i cant take this anymore. i have to go back to my therapist, i can't get it out of my mind. the thought will haunt me for the rest of my life. please be aware of who is running this country, and do NOT vote for this child r*pist in 2020. thank you! have a good day, and stay safe. i sincerely recommend not opening the horrible app!","title":"wow...","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:56Z"}},{"id":"6174145641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"tcassh","review":"firstly, when i first opened the app an ORANGE man greeted me. people cannot be orange so i figured, oh he must be an alien or something. and then i found out that he was running for president and was like, wait a minute, trump? does that mean he’s gonna trump everyone in america who’s not orange like him? because i’ve also seen that he wants a race war so i figured he must mean orange people vs everybody else right? i don’t know, and then i kept using the app and got a notification that he got my number and was trying to send me inappropriate things he’s planning on doing. i feared for my life so i deleted the app","title":"this app is scary","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:16Z"}},{"id":"6174136422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"the rating for this app","review":"So I came on the app only to be bombarded with the ugliest, nastiest, monstrous, eye-gouging hot cheeto of an alien I’ve have ever seen. I might even consider SUEING for that godforsaken photo, it damaged my eyes so badly that I had to go to the emergency room. I am suffering from severe emotional trauma after laying eyes on these outrageous sights, i definitely recommend making this a globally condemned app after the stress and agony I went the through just by opening this app, please, my fellow living things, don't use this app or you might end up with serious eye loss and/or PTSD. If you don’t you are one of the very few survivors, stay safe 😔😔😭","title":"ITS A HORRIBLE & ATROCIOUS APP","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:38:50Z"}}]}
