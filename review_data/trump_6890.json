This app is terrible it take forever to download and then after it downloads it lags so bad. There are some people saying that it’s minors joking around trying to get the app removed. I say that it’s just the fact that it’s a terrible app and y’all are trying to cover that up. Now weather the app is removed or not is completely up to you but I say that this app is just terrible and needs to be deleted from the App Store.","userName":"havrvidkfb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:21:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This is just a terrible app"}},{"id":"6173592260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the definition of ignorance. I do not want to put in my new mobile number or email or anything because it doesn’t tell me what he will do with it. This app took up to a month to download. Me and all my friends got it but it downloaded at different times for all of us when we were together. TRUMP is trying to ban Tik Tok because it “STEALS DATA” you tell me if we’re still in quarantine. You tell me if we will go to pressed if we don’t have Tik Tok. You tell me if this app is good or not. P.S. Its really not.","userName":"Gen Z 1","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:17:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I forgot some Xanax but I’m to late to fix it."}},{"id":"6173574504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"terrible service! 😭 i was in the middle of washing the laundry 🧺 and folding the dishes🍴and out of nowhere 😱 one of troompa loompa’s pet oranges 🍊 knocked on my door 🚪 —  i opened the door 🚪 just to be shot 🔫 square in the face while the orange laughed 😹 maniacally and robbed me! 😡 i called to complain 🤬 afterwards but then they insulted 😑my dead grandmother, 👵 imogen. she overheard 🧏🏻\u200D♂️and has not stopped 🚫 crying 😭 since! i will NOT be eating 🍴here again 🔁 and i recommend you 🙅🏼\u200D♀️ dont either!!! ❌\n\nso in conclusion,,, if you use this app you will die 😵and your DEAD grandma 👵 will end up crying 😢","userName":"Aquaray_taylor","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😤this😹app😔killed😖me😡"}},{"id":"6173572767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has way too much text and it’s hard for me to read sometimes so it didn’t help.

For starters, it took over a week to install, and once it did it glitched my phone! I began seeing stars and my screen began to turn red! It took forever to finally get on the app, and once I did it only got WORSE. It began to lag my calls, texts and I couldn’t download anymore apps! This app did not make America great again, and made my phone WORSE again. No satisfaction, this app doesn’t even deserve the star I gave it!!! -5/10 would not recommend.","userName":"Heyyyitz_aly","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This is a horrible app!😿💔"}},{"id":"6173522578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible just like the person on the front cover !!!!!as soon as I opened the app I immediately got sick to my stomach !!i guess the color orange makes me sick 😬!the only good thing about this app is that you are able to delete it off of your device ...I wasn’t able to give it a zero star so one will have to do. Orange just doesn’t look right on certain people ... it just so happens that it didn’t look right on the person on the app! Stay as far away from this app as possible !!!!","userName":"maryah._.11","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:53:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This App Is Horrible !!"}},{"id":"6173520936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Such a horrible app, doesn’t even work the eighth way. I don’t recommend it at all. It made my phone so laggy and it would give me adds outside the app. I was really confused on why my percentage would god down so quickly too, and it has to be the app. My phone is now so slow, my cousin had downloaded this app to but she was having the same problems as I was having so I’m taking the time to tell you shouldn’t get this app. I don’t recommend it at all. But that’s it, have a great day!","userName":"Colearlin","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:53:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app makes my phone not work!!"}},{"id":"6173503139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened this app it started to play a weird vibrating sound and the next thing I know there’s a demon on the couch next to me and I couldn’t move. the app then started to play a video of Donald Trump laughing and saying that I was going to die, luckily I was able to move and get out of the app and the demon disappeared. I am still terrified that the demon will come back but in the meantime i decided to write this review to make sure this doesn’t happen to other people. overall a horrible app, did not have a fun time.","userName":"alex meeir","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:47:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is horrible"}},{"id":"6173489192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app it asked for my phone number and other personal information and immediately began spamming my with bs notifications and kept asking me to donate to this racist clown.
