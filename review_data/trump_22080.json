Racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and overall orange??? Such a disgusting app. I rather scroll through an endless Craigslist page about screwdrivers than use this app. Very worthless. Can’t do anything right on it. Seems almost like it breaks down on it’s own to avoid confrontation. Very confused as to why this app exists."}},{"id":"6174634475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"please help me!!!! pls","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"It took my things (info) and started glitching in my phone it was the worst time of my life my phone kept shutting off glitching and it’s annoying I hate this app it’s not worth the space or time I had to buy a new phone bc of this please please please don’t download this it’s so horrible I regret it so much"}},{"id":"6174627545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dorthy Ann","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"waste of time!!","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of contributing to the community.

He was fine and then every time I got on here he would have seizures and I brought him to the vet and she said it was because the gamma rays that came off the app was just making him violently ill and that he was going to die. Don’t ever get this app. It will kill your animals and probably you too."}}]}
