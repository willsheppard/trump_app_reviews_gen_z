BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

First off they ask for WAYYYY to much info. I’m talking like zip code, phone number, email, ect. Like why to much information? I’m not trying to expose my self out here! And even if that wasn’t bad, after I downloaded the app, my phone got like 10 viruses !!!! I was FURIOUS!!!  It took me 4 months just to get it fixed!! Finally, it was working for about 2 weeks but then something really weird happened. I was outside in the middle of the night star gazing 💫✨👁👄👁✨💫 when there was a beam of orange light . I know it sounds really weird, but, it seemed like it was calling for me. As I was walking towards the light I heard what sounded like whispering . They said “you shouldn’t have gotten rid of the viruses ”. At this point I wanted to turn around but it just kept calling to me, so I continued. Next thing you know, I was getting ABDUCTED 👽!!! The only thing that I remember was waking up in what looked like a head. After some in investigation, I realized it was Cheeto mans head! Of course I knew that because it was completely empty .  But then, I woke up. It was all a dream. Well kinda. I was abducted but I wasn’t actually in his mind. Instead I was in the bunker with bunker boy !!!!  While I was trying to figure a way out while he slept, I heard a voice behind me. “where do y think you’re going“ said bunker boy. I was TERRIFIED. i thought of all of the possible ways to get out but there where none !!  Then all of a sudden, there was a big oof. IT WAS BARREN. As he came to the rescue, he shouted “this is for everything you have done to me” After Barren KOed bunker boy, he asked if he could escape with me. Of course I said yes and then once we finally arrived home, my parents adopted him as their own.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-03T20:33:08Z","userName":"6664200kl300mer","title":"Small pp Energy"}}]}
