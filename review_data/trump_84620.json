At first I was excited being able to support Daddy Trump by downloading this app, but then I noticed some weird things started happening with my phone. For one, I noticed that I kept getting CHEETO ads all over social media! And then I saw unfamiliar orange colored apps on my phone that I supposedly “downloaded” but dont remember downloading at all! At this point I thought my phone had a virus, so I tried asking my friend about it but then my texts weren't sending through?? It took my a while to figure it out but now my phone only lets me send texts that have the words “TRUMP 2020” in them. This was all so creepy to me so I just decided I would delete the app and get a new phone, but once I deleted the app, some weird things started happening in real life. I kept finding miniature oranges around my house, and my TV was only playing Chinese media. If this doesn’t sound weird enough, just wait until I tried going to sleep. I kept hearing weird noses coming through the vents. At first it was just whispers, then it evolved to straight up YELLING!! I kept hearing “SAVE OUR COUNTRY, SAVE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, BUILD THE WALL” over and over again. At this point I was utterly terrified. I tried calling 911 but all of my devices were in chinese! Once it was morning I tried running out of the house, and then the sunlight started turning my skin orange. No, it wasn’t a sunburn problem, it was changing colors in the matter of seconds! Still, I accepted my fate of orange skin and was able to run to the nearest gas station where I borrowed this sweet old lady’s phone and write this review. My life has drastically changed ever since I downloaded this app. Please download with caution, or if not, ignore it completely. This app is cursed, and I will never be the same again. Protect your skin. Protect your devices. Do not download this app.","userName":"soooooomebody","date":"2020-06-16T15:20:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6073451066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WOAT","review":"Bad design.
