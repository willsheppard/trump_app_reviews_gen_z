To give a valid reason for this dislike, the app supports racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism and more. It is very concerning that such an app is even allowed to be put on our phones. I hope that Apple realizes that they should take it down. ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕","date":"2020-07-09T20:08:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178071421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"blah_bri","title":"No.","review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of becoming aware of what this man has in store for us, but in reality I found this app glitching my phone. I’m not sure if the app can sense that my iPhone is black but probably has a lot to do with it. Hate this app, will cause your phone to burn out and glitch especially if not white iPhone... not sure why. Definitely do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T20:07:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178043651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ben Shaprio Fan #1","title":"Disappointed 😩😔","review":"unfortunately not a part of the gen z mob... when will the democrats stop this witch hunt?! 🤬🤬 I’m very disappointed in this app however...when i got this app i was told that i would be able to ask trans ben shapiro to send me a letter to me !!PERSONALLY!!... i was not able to do this. i wanted him to tell me to bind safely.

So, I downloaded this app to get all updates and it first took 5 days to complete the download, then when it did download, it completely annihilated my phone. It was overheating and crashing constantly and then my phone stopped working. So I had to get a new phone which broke my bank account and now I’m homeless.","date":"2020-07-09T19:51:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178005846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"oliviarambula","title":"It made my phone crash.","review":"After a while of using the app to read through his WoNdErFuL plans for a second term, the app froze my phone. After entering my phone number I started getting suspicious texts and phone calls from Russia asking me to vote for Trump. I 100% think that this app is used as a way for him to spy on his voters. 0/10 don’t recommend boo boo. 💋","date":"2020-07-09T19:45:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178003099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"indigopoptart","title":"ill be suing","review":"i was told if i downloaded this app, i would get free robux. as in the words of Tyler, The Creator, \"so that was a ------- lie.\"\nthis app made me phone break in half, i am writing this on my samsung fridge. when i opened the app, the screen froze, and it broke my dishwasher when i previously installed it on there. you will be hearing from\nmy lawyers, and i will attach my venmo to replace my dish washer and my phone. \n\nxoxo, Barack Obama.","date":"2020-07-09T19:45:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177988728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"happyhusband32","title":"please read and keep tiktok!🥺💔","review":"Please keep tiktok!

All of the information can be found in other news sources in better formats. In addition, the app is very glitchy and shuts down all the time when I try to use it. Even if I wanted information about the Cheeto at the helm of our burning ship, this app wouldn't help.","date":"2020-07-09T19:14:02Z","isEdited":false}}]}
