I wanted trump not an orange, but then it gets worse. As I go to the different categories, I see trump’s Cheeto nudes, and then the app started to glitch. This was very frustrating bc my daughter was next to me, and we just wanted to buy trumps ugly merch. I am absolutely appalled by this app and things that it has shown me, and it gave me a virus. To everyone reading this, do not buy this app, I’ll be speaking to the manager of this app soon. I am digusted, DISGUSTED by this app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"frank the trump supporter","date":"2020-07-09T01:03:21Z","title":"Outrageous and inappropriate 🤬😖🙁😥🖕🖕🖕🖕"}},{"id":"6174357257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible. It incorrectly portrays the media and how a specific event that was depicted went down. It shines a light on the man who did not help better the world instead forcing it into an even more divided unions. This man has been calling the peaceful protests for a gruesome murder of an African-American male as violent riots, and has blamed China for our high amount  of testing with low-poorly results. He only fuels his selfish greed instead of fueling the needs of the American citizens.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"a helpful inquirey","date":"2020-07-09T00:56:51Z","title":"It’s disgusting and is horribly brutal to the innocent people!"}},{"id":"6174331760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app glitches nonstop. It’s awful. I downloaded this app to receive messages and I rarely get anything. When I do get his messages, I like to fact check them (as I do with Democrats as well because each side will spew lies) and there is nothing true that he is saying. What kind of president is that? Remove this app this is only spewing lies! His first lie is found right when you open the app “keep America great” what did he do that was great? Nothing. Stop this nonsense","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Jellybeansdy","date":"2020-07-09T00:48:19Z","title":"Actual Review"}},{"id":"6174277130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with Cheeto puff and once I opened it everything in my house turned in to a Cheeto puff I had to call an exterminator to come and handle the situation thanks to him everything was resolved but then ALLL OF MY FRIENDS DECIDED TO TURN INTO A CHEETO PUFF and I don’t know what to do with that so here I am writing a review with my friends who are now Cheeto puffs and I’ll never know how to turn them back.

Would never recommend this app to anyone. As soon as I opened the app *boom* his face was right there. Which scared me so much that I almost broke my phone from tossing it across the room. I don’t why or who set it up the lay out that way. I also don’t feel comfortable providing my phone number. It will ask you it. That’s invading my privacy. Anyways, the app uses too much phone space and provides unnecessary info. So it’s trash.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Yasss134","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:54Z","title":"A waste of my phone space"}},{"id":"6173955161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was shocked to see how many people have this app a one star rating, but now I think I might have to agree. 😔 First off, when I opened this app for the first time I was greeted by a Cheeto. It made me jump out of terror and I hit my head on the ceiling. 😾 My cat tried to catch me as I was falling down but I sat on my cat. My beloved cat is now dead, and I think I have a concussion. 🤬 I am undownloading this app and I don't recommend anyone to get it. #wewontleavewithoutafight","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dixie 😌✨🔫","date":"2020-07-08T22:31:14Z","title":"I would give this 0 stars if I could."}},{"id":"6173939581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Before downloading the app I checked how much storage it took up, and when I saw it didn’t take much I decided to download it. ONCE I DOWNLOADED THE APP IT SAID THAT MY PHONE DIDN’T HAVE ANYMORE STORAGE. And when I checked why it was because this app took up over 200 GIGABYTES!!!!! AND NOT ONLY THAT!! When I downloaded the app all I could see was A CHEETO ON THE MIRROR NAKED!!!!!!! FULLY!! I saw 🍤, which was extremely inappropriate and disturbing!! If apple doesn’t eliminate this app I might just have to consider switching to the new galaxy phone😤.

I will never download anything like this and I suggest you don’t either. P.s the rashes worsen and stink like a dead fish stuffed inside a roach infested carpet that’s under your skin. And the witches aren’t nice either they come into your house make you clean your room. After that they make you mop then they walk all over the floor in muddy socks and tell you to mop again it’s really soul crushing 😕","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"rashed and trashed","date":"2020-07-08T22:21:13Z","title":"WORST APP IVE EVER HAD"}},{"id":"6173923209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to expand my knowledge about Cheeto man and you know just get more info overall and you don’t even know what happened!!!! As soon as it downloaded it a short man that looked like a trump gremlin came to my door and attacked me!!! I was so confused but then I realized it was because of the app!!! Don’t recommend at all!!
