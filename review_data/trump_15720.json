I didn’t realize until it was to late...that that was no snail indeed..it-it-it was no I can’t it’s to painful to think about 😭🐌🍊 instead I’m going to tell you that if u put orange on more orange and maybe add a bit more hair and maybe a little more intelligentness to the “great” Cheeto then people might like it better","userName":"i dont like cheetos anymore😭","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173907919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Please take down this app","date":"2020-07-08T22:13:49Z","review":"This app is literally the worst. I opened it and it literally was a picture of a Cheeto looking like it was gonna cry. This app is promoting Cheeto abuse and is very disturbing to say the least. Please take this app down it is not good for the community or good app to be in the App Store. If it at all matters I think it shows how you look for having such a horrible app available. Please take this under consideration.","userName":"emmepie12","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173840344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst Quality App Yet","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:43Z","review":"This app load so slowly and I know it’s not my internet because my other apps work fine. Also the color scheme really isn’t doing it for me. If people want to improve this app I really think they need to start over from square one. There’s nothing really worth keeping. As Sharpay once said, “out with the old, in with the new” and honey... we need something new.","userName":"JessMcQueen","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173794831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"All “🟧” lives matter ✨","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:09Z","review":"As i was trying to open the app , i got a red button to press but it didnt do anything. I tried calling the help line but they all said that they were too busy killing black people so i did what any normal person would do and i reported it to the president of mexico , he then said that i should write an amazing review for the best president ever. Next time President, ask canada for their help.","userName":"Sir Mike oochie","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173787580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app only spreads negativity","date":"2020-07-08T21:28:25Z","review":"The great American flag\nIs wrapped and dragged with explosives\nCompulsive disorder, sons and daughters\nBarricaded blocks and borders\nLook what you taught us\nIt's murder on my street, your street, back streets\nWall street, corporate offices, banks\nEmployees and bosses with homicidal thoughts\nDonald Trump's in office, we lost Barack\nAnd promised to never doubt him again\nBut is America honest or do we bask in sin?\nPass the gin, I mix it with American blood\nThen bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?\nI'll ask again—oops—accident\nIt's nasty when you set us up\nThen roll the dice, then bet us up\nYou overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us\nGang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera\nAmericas reflections of me\nThat's what a mirror does","userName":"acai refresher","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173787091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I WISH I could give it a zero","date":"2020-07-08T21:28:13Z","review":"This app kept glitching and would only turn on for a few seconds before it froze my whole phone 😡😡😡 My phone eventually had to be shut down for TWO days until I could turn it on again😢 Even after that my phone was still freezing and now I think it is possessed by an orange Cheeto.😩😈😈0/10 do NOT recommend.","userName":"habdbnqkhbf","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173775308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App Ever!","date":"2020-07-08T21:23:48Z","review":"This app doesn’t open! It just glitches and freezes. I’ve deleted it and downloaded it multiple times but it just won’t work?! How will I get more information from an app that doesn’t work? Glitchy software like this doesn’t belong on the AppStore!

Then I reset my router and the app still was incapable of loading. Lastly, I went to the apple store to have them verify that my phone is working and that the app itself was the problem.
