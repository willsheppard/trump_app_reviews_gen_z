It was awful the giant Oompa Loompa was telling me that he would “ make the world great again “ dude you screwed it up we ain't gonna make the same mistake twice unlike trumps mom. \nWould NEVER! Recommend because I am a sane person (ish) and I know what’s wrong and right and if the still support this man then I can’t be sure if your a good or sane person."}},{"id":"6172663011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wtfcourtenee","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!! 😡🤨😤","date":"2020-07-08T15:21:39Z","review":"I honestly can’t even BELIEVE I’m having to write this right here right now, but this app killed my favorite teacher. She absolutely hates Trump and everything he does and stands for but someone told her to download the app for “clear skin” and she gave it a shot. A shot. A shot is exactly what i heard from school bathroom because SHE WAS SHOT BY THE APP. Donald Trump HATES the people that go against what he says and he should not be honored by having an app! Take it off expeditiously. 😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6172636583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Joselyn2480","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-08T15:14:12Z","review":"This app has been by far the WORST I’ve ever seen!!!!! It’s so glitchy, that I can’t even enter the app without it kicking me out of it within 5 seconds. It’s just so bad!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT WHATSOEVER!!!!! I got to download the app on my sister’s phone, and it let me go through. But, it’s so confusing!!! Like, where exactly am I supposed to touch to continue on??? It’s just so confusing, and it was a bit glitchy too. I wouldn’t recommend it whatsoever."}},{"id":"6172500778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hulceancqsklgacsk","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Orange Cows","date":"2020-07-08T14:36:14Z","review":"Our family has a problem with cows and we pray for them to die. We also hate oranges. When I downloaded this app our house turned into oranges and then into orange cows. Then they ate our pets and then the rest of my family. Then they stared reciting the Cheeto chant and then Donald Trump appeared and they ate him. I will have to sell these orange cows to pay for new pets, a new house, and my therapy. I deleted the app instantly. Thank you for listening to my complaints."}},{"id":"6172497204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ben dover and get dez nuts","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T14:35:15Z","review":"do not download this app bc it took weeks to completely download and it has TERRIBLE quality and then to find out that it tracks you wherever you go and you can't take the tracker off🙄🖕✨y'all should be ashamed of yourself. this app collect data off your phone and they know what you google, what apps you use, where you live, and your passwords to EVERYTHING. they hacked  into my bank and everything 🖕🖕🖕😭. please DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6172444654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":":••••••••","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Wouldn’t recommend","date":"2020-07-08T14:21:03Z","review":"Our president wants to ban a social media platform that helps kids express who they are. TikTok is an app that unites kids, teens, and even adults in the form of dance. If you walk into a school you would find kids sharing and practicing dances they learned from TikTok. Many will say it’s inappropriate. But, in the Bible it states “psalm 149:3 let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.” Now tell me, how is that inappropriate. We don’t Stan the ban."}},{"id":"6172434452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"CasFraMar","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Dictator type beat","date":"2020-07-08T14:18:18Z","review":"I loved this app but now it’s very slow and freezes up. I also believe that the app sold my phone number because now more than ever I’m getting calls from unknown numbers. Not only is the app trash but so is the president. I’ve come to the realization that he is increasingly become more of a tyrant like ruler and making America an authoritarian country. I love America, that’s why trump cannot be in office any longer."}},{"id":"6172426546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hwhhwhjwhj","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Ignorance","date":"2020-07-08T14:16:10Z","review":"Who even thought it was a good idea to put an Oompa Loompa as president. He is a rapist himself, but still managed to have the nerve to call Mexicans that cross the illegally rapists. Also, his followers are quite ignorant. If you tell them anything bad that trump did they will just tell you it’s fake news, even if you have actual evidence. I downloaded this app to see how “ good “ our president is, but it just made me have a worse opinion on him. As expected."}},{"id":"6172229068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"this is a dare!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump is human garb","date":"2020-07-08T13:21:58Z","review":"Trump is honestly just a horrible person, he has doubled the national debt, kept children in cages, almost started World War III, broken the law many times during his presidency,And treated everyone horribly; veterans, people of color, people in the LGBTQ+ community, disabled people, women, and surprisingly a couple of fat old white dudes just like him\n\nAnd he’s definitely not Christian he would probably hate Jesus if Jesus wasn’t portrayed as an old white dude (he was for sure brown)"}},{"id":"6172146416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leslyal","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-08T12:59:06Z","review":"Honestly I downloaded this app to keep up with Trump and his plans but randomly it started to glitch and it would shut down my phone. They made me give my phone number which I didn’t mind since other apps ask for phone but I started to get weird calls and messages so my best guess is that they sold my number. Don’t download this app unless you want phone calls every 30 mins"}}]}
