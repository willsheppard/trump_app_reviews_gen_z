This app is incredibly confusing and it’s hard to manage on all fronts. This app is so inconvenient, it took exactly 2 weeks and two days to download onto my cellular device. This app also has inappropriate ads that pop up at random moments. I think it is so disgraceful that the President of the United States would cause such trouble to innocent people living in America that have downloaded this app. #TakeItDown","rating":1,"title":"Warning: DO NOT DOWLOAD"}},{"id":"6177569417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:28:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Luke Skywalker is a Liberal","review":"The second it finished downloading, some strange text started appearing on my walls, followed by a low, constant humming. The longer it went on, the louder it got, until my ears started bleeding from all the noise. To top it all off, demons started erupting from a portal being created by the wall text, who then tried to drag me into a weird dimension full of pain, suffering, and Trump supporters. They would’ve most definitely taken me, had I not used every bit of my strength to do myself the best favor I could've ever done, by deleting this absolutely garbage app off my phone and giving it the one star rating it truly deserved.","rating":1,"title":"What is this app, man..."}},{"id":"6177536969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:18:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jbelzel","review":"I downloaded the Trump 2020 app with high hopes of getting to support MY president, but the app took forever to download! Once it did, I excitedly opened it to get to see what genius ideas Trump had for the next 4 years, but the app glitches almost immediately! Every time I tried to log into the app, it kicked me out, SAD😭😭. All I wanted was to be able to see what brilliant ideas were coming my way for Trump’s next 4 years as the best president, but I was so sad to find out that all there was on the app were pictures of a big scary orange monkey man in a suit!! How scary is that?!?! So sad that I won’t be able to support this app anymore","rating":1,"title":"😖😖 heartbroken 💔💔"}},{"id":"6177474009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lenalynn898","review":"I was on vacation when I downloaded this app with my boyfriend who happens to be a POC. I opened the app and strange men in white coverings appeared. The said they worked for trumps personal secret service??? They pushed me off the building and and caught me with a confederate flag, thankfully, but they immediately threw me off the flag, and onto a horse! The horse bucked me off right in front of a burning cross!!  Why was it on fire? I have no clue. That’s when I saw our presidential ✨🧡✨Cheeto✨🧡✨ with his right hand man, Kanye West. I over heard them talking about white supremacy and internalized racism ✨😇✨ \nAnd then out of nowhere, that’s when I saw him. Barron Trump! In full specops gear! There to save the day💕💕💕💕\n\nBut fr, plz don’t vote for Trump. He is misogynistic, pedophilic, sexist, racist, incestuous. All things that a president should never be associated with. He has no place in politics. His own mother has even said so. \n#trumpforprison2020 \n#savebarron \n#blacklivesmatter \n#breonnataylor\n#georgefloyd \n#remembertheirnames\n#epsteindidntkillhimself \n#peghim2020","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP 🔪MURDERED🔪 ME✨🥺✨"}},{"id":"6177453950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"visibly broken","review":"I am in shock!! They allow this on the App Store with NO warning??? I don’t want my kids, wife, parents, grandparents, friends, sibling, goldfish, dog, priest, mailman, checkout girl, florist, chef, butler, neighbors, insurance broker, nudist painter, the squirrel that eats all the bird seed, Nicholas cage, renegade creator, plumber that secretly has been sleeping with my wife, therapist that has secretly been sleeping with my wife, cable guy that has secretly been sleeping with my wife, babysitter that has secretly been sleeping with my wife, construction worker that has secretly been sleeping with my wife, or ANYONE. I will have find strength to continue life after being emotionally scared. The fact the the POTUS endorses this is sickening.

There’s also a huge well know racist, sexist, misogynistic, cry baby, pathological liar on the forefront of this app and I just don’t think that’s acceptable. It also spams your phone number once you use it. It asks for it from the very beginning and you can’t continue without it. Once you put it in and it accepts it, you get a TON of text messages daily. A lot of them just say the same thing over and over again. Would give 0 stars if possible","rating":1,"title":"What?"}},{"id":"6177259501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:57:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Uvis.","review":"I genuinely came here to write a review on this app but then I saw a bunch of kids reviewing it. I am no longer in support of our president. He’s extremely unprofessional with the app. The app tracks you even when the app is closed and that’s is extremely weird and invasion of privacy. The app has spammed my notifications not letting me breath and or my text go through. It has glitched out on me several times. My phone is new and this does not happen with other apps. To think the app would be organized well it’s not. Confusing and not useful. Seriously if you are a republican just use google not the app.","rating":1,"title":"Don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6177215761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"donaldtrumpbelongs6feetunder","review":"my phone was perfect fine until i downloaded this app. at first it was just glitching but now my phone vibrates at different times. not to mention the amount of viruses it’s given my phone 😔 donald trump not only allowed the country to get a virus but now my phone too??? i’m not sure what i ever did to the man personally but man it’s just disrespectful at this point (kind of how he’s disrespectful to women and children). anyways. the app took a miserably long time to download and as soon as i opened it it crashed. i’m not sure who designed it but to whoever did you owe me a new phone just like donald owes everyone a prison sentence for being a pedo. he belongs in jail and shouldn’t be allowed within 100 miles of children let alone being rewarded in the office and treated like a king. whose lap do i have to dance on to see trump rot to death in prison? anyways if you made it this far this app was trash and i regret ever downloading it just like i regret being the fastest in the sack😔","rating":1,"title":"it broke my phone"}},{"id":"6176949682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:31:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"fern snsjwk","review":"Maybe you’re feeling like you screw everything up for everyone. Perhaps you just lost your last friend and have nobody left to turn to. You might be stuck in an abusive relationship. Or maybe you feel so alone and broken that nobody could possibly understand.\n\nThose are all real reasons that make life feel daunting and impossible. And it’s ok to feel this way – you’re not broken for feeling like life is harder than it’s worth right now. But we are in the right now, and who knows what could happen tomorrow or 20 years from now to make all the pain worth it.","rating":1,"title":"Don’t delete tiktok because gen z is getting woke"}},{"id":"6176862964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:08:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"just here to ruin u 😘✨","review":"i really had high hopes for this app, but the second i opened it and was that crispy cheeto tiny pp man i had to run into the bathroom before i threw up 🤢. while i was away, my phone realized what was on the screen and exploded, burning out house down 🔥. only my sister and i made it out alive 😖. im assuming that the app was recording what we said because when the fire department came, the truck was full of offended ninja pigs who said they heard us say mean things about the big orange baby in charge 🐷. they tied me up while i watched them murder my sister with trumps earwax and then they put me on a catapult and launched me all the way to jupiter 🌝. i was slowly dying from the gases and the temperature when suddenly peppa pig appeared out of no where and flew me back to earth on her yellow and black space ship 🚀. when the cops realized that i was returning to earth, they shot at us and now we’re stuck in space and can’t get home ✨😳🧚\u200D♂️🌈🌞❤️🗿","rating":1,"title":"this app killed my family and i now i’m lost in space ❤️❤️"}}]}
