But clearly I was uneducated cause his views on specific things definitely are not helping America. I am discussed at this literal piece of trash.

Very suspicious. The app keeps glitching, but thats okay. The next thing, it asks to access my photos, bluetooth etc. When I did it, it airdropped a bunch of oranges to the people around me and flooded photos of oranges on my phone. Do not install!!!

Turns out the baby was actually the spawn of satan, with an ugly orange face and constantly pursed lips. It grew acid spewing orifices and began to melt my house down.

Honestly, you’d think an app made for us to view our wonderful presidents agenda would be better. Like how am I supposed to get to courage to be a racist if I can’t see all daddy’s trumps updates.
