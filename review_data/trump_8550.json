Very upsetting if you ask me. I later learned my phone blew up again in my room and now my house on caught on fire. I am homeless and faceless. 0/10 would not recommend","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173052106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zoocrazy007","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:20Z","title":"This app is making my phone shut down","rating":1,"review":"i myself do not like trump. but i downloaded this app to keep in tune with what he’s doing to america by downloading this app. FIRST OF ALL it not only force quits and make my phone turn off, it’ll make my phone have a mind of its own everytime i try and open it. Examples are: my phone will go back and forth in between columns, open other apps, and text people incoherent things. This app needs to get off the app store asap before someone’s phone BREAKS FOR GOOD.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172972737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"xiomara jackson","date":"2020-07-08T16:52:55Z","title":"Trump 2020 app .","rating":1,"review":"horrible , i hated this . i know i wasn’t really talking to trump . not like i wanted to anyways . too many ads popping up and it would freeze the app then my phone , it would make my phone reboot and the app would start to glitch and make my phone overheat , sometimes when i open the app it freezes and takes me back to my home page , it takes up too much storage and it’s over rated , i would not recommend this nor use it again .","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172932327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#sensitivestomach","date":"2020-07-08T16:40:23Z","title":"Made me dry heave.","rating":1,"review":"I tried to use the app. I really did. But the first image that popped up was him. Mr. Trump. Usually I like to prepare myself when I see him on TV by reminding myself that under all that fake tan and the wig that there may very well be a semi normal looking man. I just was not expecting a full portrait of him. Unfortunately, this unexpected trauma did indeed cause me to begin dry heaving, so I sprinted to the bathroom  and lied on the floor until my lunch came up. Take this as a warning if you have a sensitive stomach. Sending you love and peace from Texas.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172923498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stop this plese","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:35Z","title":"I hate  trump is sending police’s to kill incident black people and that behavior is not acceptable","rating":1,"review":"The reason why i hate trump is because the way he is sending police’s to kill black people is so wrong and not ok , and I’m 10 and i don’t think this behavior is ok because it’s not . God made black people and made us so why should police’s kill black people there like all of us and I’m not black I’m a light skin so we should help the black community. And please make this stop because i don’t like the way this is going ,✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172892516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Susan Holler","date":"2020-07-08T16:27:56Z","title":"Gave my phone a virus, government spying.","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I found out the president had an app I was quick to download it. I wanted to stay updated on the president. As soon as the app downloaded my phone started to glitch I then opened the app and my phone just blacked out. I was forced to go to the Apple Store to see what was wrong and they told me a recent download gave my phone a virus and caused it to glitch out. Is the government trying to spy on us with this app? Do Not Download! It is a hoax to have the government spy on us.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172729434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"OohHeDrinkSmartWater","date":"2020-07-08T15:40:21Z","title":"Worst app of all time 🤢🤮","rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app of ALL time. It took MONTHS to download and when I opened it I suddenly became nauseous at how ugly the app was. They asked for way too much personal information. The interface was horrible and it kept on lagging. Not only that, but when the app asked for my ethnicity and I said black it just said “no thank you” and then automatically deleted. Anyways even before that it gave me no reason to vote for president Cheeto Man. I’d give it negative 0 or negative stars if I could.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172720513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RTyler1234","date":"2020-07-08T15:37:51Z","title":"Oh boy.","rating":1,"review":"I’m confused is America great now?  Last I checked our national debt keeps sky rocketing, unemployment is at a highest percent since the Great Depression and over 130,000 American’s have died because of lack of leadership in a pandemic...  but like billionaires keep getting richer so that’s great, right?  But thank god we are leaving the W.H.O. now China will be able to have more control over that too so that’s great, right?  Thank god we payed for 3 miles of an ineffective boarder wall so great, right? Idk this app was just confusing much like the man and just garbage.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172667688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"julesuwu","date":"2020-07-08T15:22:59Z","title":"WORSE APP EVER!!!!","rating":1,"review":"so basically i cant ACTUALLY explain how bad this app is!! It almost broke my phone battery 5minutes after using the app? What a disgrace i thought better 🤬😡😡😡ive also had other friends tell me other wise that their phone had literally BLOWN UP!! By using this app and for that reason if there was a 0 star review i would pick that cause is it even that good for a 1 star?
