I don’t know who’s idea it was to make this god awful app. seriously. it’s like a 2 year old made it. 1 star."}},{"id":"6173042012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app ever","rating":1,"userName":"cabbitrocco","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I came to this app to look for reasons to love our president but this made me hate our president even more. My dog was a HUGE trump supporter. He got painted 🍊 and everything. He had T-shirts, posters, hats, and stickers. But he was one the app and it crashed and the entire phone exploded in which it was right next to him. It ended in killing him. This app proved to me that Trump doesn’t only kill anyone who dislikes him. He kills people who love him too. RIP my dog."}},{"id":"6173026575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🥰😍 Donald Trump on a gravestone 2020","rating":1,"userName":"eat tidepods if u support DT ✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:24Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is HORRIBLE! As soon as i opened it up, it played awful america chanting music, asking for my personal information which i had to decline. it even had donald trumps leaked nude on the home page! our so called “president” is a racist, homophobic, narcissistic, selfish,and an immature “man” (though there are many other words that describe him). we need to get him out of office asap. if you support trump you’re a white suprematist 🖕🏻"}},{"id":"6172975853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE app","rating":1,"userName":"Dire days","date":"2020-07-08T16:53:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is such a glitchy, hard to use, and over all horrible to use app. It’s not user friendly, doesn’t work half the time, and is constantly crashing. Not to mention that all of my family members have gotten their phones hacked through this app. Terrible programming, awful application, caused a death in my family, summoned demons in my room, made me question my mortality, and gave my explosive farts.

This app showcases all of the awful things that our President has done to our country. Also, the app took way too long to download, killed my battery within 5 minutes of getting on it, and is poorly put together. You will get zero benefit from this app, other than learning who not to vote for next election, Trump."}},{"id":"6172899856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"curb stomp the cheeto","rating":1,"userName":"the._.mackaroni","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a…"}},{"id":"6172889179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful app","rating":1,"userName":"q2257320","date":"2020-07-08T16:26:55Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is possibly the worst app I have ever downloaded and I’ve downloaded fnaf knock off games. I downloaded it to try to find ANYTHING to like about this man and I couldn’t find a single thing. I’m pretty sure he is t even human. I feel it is possible that someone doing scientific research on a cheese puff accidentally enlarged it and gave it human properties but without the ability to think or communicate properly. 1 star"}},{"id":"6172882997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"userName":"taylorstrait19","date":"2020-07-08T16:25:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I used this app for maybe 10 minutes and COULD NOT figure it out 😭 the layout was AWFUL and truly disgusted me how horrible it was. Then my nephew showed me how to use and it I somehow ended up on a gun page in front of my 10 year old nephew which was AWFUL that boy didn’t need to be exposed to that yet.
