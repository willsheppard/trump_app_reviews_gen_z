This app has ruined my relationships with my dog and led to my cat eating my hamster while my snake committed suicide with its own body. This app made me squeeze my nipples off my body and into a sandwich of which I ate and then digested. This app then led to Barack Obama evicting me from my own apartment and putting me onto a ranch with no human contact so I had no other choice but to bang a llama. That llama then gave me aids and the only way I stopped it was to chop off my own toes. and it sure is difficult to live without any toes.","userName":"Hungry000000"}},{"id":"6175162824","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😝✨😩","date":"2020-07-09T05:00:06Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When you get this app. No. I like cheese. But Elmo doesn’t. So he threw it away. But I got mad because he didn’t ask for my permission first 😩😩 which he SHOULD HAVE. But then I fell and broke my phalanges. It was a sad day. No one helped me and I couldn’t do anything. No health care, no doctor. So I asked the Cheeto man for help, but instead he decided to build a wall and not let me get the help I needed. I can’t even get to the doctors. But my phalanges are BROKEN. But back to Elmo... I think he was working with the Cheeto man re whole time. Luckily Cookie Monster helped me. He gave me a cookie. Some how my phalanges were fixed. COOKIE MONSTER 2020 😝😝 don’t trust the Cheeto man. He is not to be trusted","userName":"BLM ❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6175160673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🙅\u200D♀️ don’t waste your time on this app 🙅\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T04:59:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Ooh ooh\nIn a world where you feel cold\nYou gotta stay gold\nOh baby, yeah\n魅惑的な moonlight\n今宵も眠らない\n月明かりを頼りに\n君の元へ hide and seek (ay)\n心へ (ay) と忍びこんで 君の間近\n近づくのさ いつの間にか (ay)\n穢れを知らないな\nその瞳はダイヤ\nどんな宝石よりも beautiful\n何度も (yeah) 見惚れてしまうほど\n君から目離せない no more\n時計の針さえ 動きを止めるよ\nUh let it glow, whoa\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\n気づかれないように\n近づいてく slowly\n予告するよ baby 無防備な君を優しく\nいただくのさ 君の深いところ now\n高鳴る想いは 鼓動を早める\nUh let it show, whoa\nStay gold 君さえいれば\nStay gold 何もいらない\nStay gold, gold 抱きしめたくて\nStay gold 愛は果てなく\nStay gold 光を放つ\nStay gold どんな星よりも\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\nJust close your eyes\n何も言わない\nI'll steal your heart\n魔法のように\n奇跡なら僕が見せてあげる (yeah)\nその手を出して\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold, gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\n覗き見する moonlight\n今宵眠らせない\n握りしめたその手を\n離したくはないよ\nStay gold, uh yeah","userName":"Zaya H."}},{"id":"6175160037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"orange garbage man","date":"2020-07-09T04:59:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"as soon as i opened the app there was a horrific stench of racism and homophobia it was DISGUSTING. also trump really reminds me of the annoying orange idk if i’m the only on he also looks like a corn cob with horse legs that fell into a pit of orange paint and the fact that he has an app to fill his ego if kinda funny considering that it now has a 1.3 rating because of the my lovely generation, the gen z teens to be specific who ate tide pods cause we were bored and who got tickets to his rally just to not go to infuriate the man, and much more. if he deletes tiktok we have every other app to bully him even further. fyi we will\nnever stop so might as well give up bunker boy. xoxo❤️😌✨","userName":"aj🌞"}},{"id":"6175023822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","date":"2020-07-09T04:15:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is by far the worst app I’ve ever come across as soon as I opened up this app random things started disappearing in my house and not even just that but also outside I went outside to walk the dog I opened up the app and the tree that was in front of me disappeared and then I went to the park I want to go to the park I opened up the app and the park disappeared out of thin air so then I went home and hopped in my fridge I was like you won’t let me open up the app just curious you know and my fridge disappeared and the saddest part was my leftover McDonald’s is in there😢😢😢😢 all I wanted was my McChicken and I couldn’t even get that","userName":"u got a Dollar"}},{"id":"6175121564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP IN HISTORY","date":"2020-07-09T04:46:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":2,"review":"This app is so overrated it disgusting black lives matter and you Karen’s on this app can go take a hike and leave peace out .

I was scrolling through the apps and I found this one, and I thought, “Hey! Grandma would like this one!” Because ‘Trump’ is the first syllable of ‘Trumpet,’ and my grandmother loves trumpets. So I downloaded the app, and it asked for my location, and I agreed. So after showing my grandma the app, a man in a skin suit with the app logo walked into the hospital room and said, “Paleontologists will find you someday, fossil,” before yanking out the cord on the life support! Grandma died, and we didn’t even want her to! They won’t cover the funeral costs 🤬","userName":"WolfiWaffi"}},{"id":"6174868678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"nah bruh","date":"2020-07-09T03:27:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Okay🤠so basically👾. i got the app and it asked me for my location and stuff. so obviously i put in my location. BUT LIKE not even 1 second later the whole trump family showed up to my address and assassinated me! and also my whole family. even barron was there!!! i tried to help him escape with me but he just snapped my neck. melania spit on me and fed me her tampon, which tasted like cinnamon, it might’ve been a douche now that i think about it. ivanka just flipped me off and peed on me. 😿mike pence was there as well, looking sexy as ever😻all in all, i would give this app and experience a 1/10, the 1 being for mike showing up and looking hot🥴","userName":"jmann!!!!"}},{"id":"6174816043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"yuck❤️","date":"2020-07-09T03:12:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"HORRIBLE! I got this app thinking that you would get free oranges but NO! All it did was made my pet unicorn in the freezer very angry cause the app was ✨TRASH✨ and nothing worked! It also made my phone very glitchy! When I went into it one time, it turned black and all of the sudden James Charles appeared screaming “HI SISTERS!” I was very scared and threw my phone out the window onto the street, where a moving bus ran over it, hit a tree, caught on fire, and disappeared like my great uncle in 1956. DO NOT get this app unless you want to have to buy a flip phone because your phone got destroyed of being scared by a monstrous creature. I would rate this a 0/10 if I could! 😤🙄","userName":"flyingfairyapple"}}]}
