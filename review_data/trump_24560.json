Also this app runs so slow. For example I was trying to open it and it kept crashing. I don‚Äôt recommend this app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not worth anything...."}},{"id":"6174673401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gm74527","review":"This app is a HUGE scam and you should NEVER download it. As soon as i opened the app it gave my phone a virus, wiped it completely clean and sent all of my personal information to scammers. Worst app ever made and the Trump administration should really look into the problems that this app caused me and everyone else i know who has it.

It glitched so hard! Voldemort started whispering sensually in my ear saying that he wouldn‚Äôt even go there. It was so strange. Then he told me to get a bagel so at least something good came out of the encounter.

This application will give your phone chlamydia. Not only is blatant and flagrant racism encourages, but necessary for this app to function properly. I took my chicken nugget for a walk and the oven said, HOLA NINOS AHHHHH.

It isn‚Äôt helpful with information on rallies and how to support our president. I can‚Äôt believe that the trump administration would think this was a good platform because clearly it is not.
