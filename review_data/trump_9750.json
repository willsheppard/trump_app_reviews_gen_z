I also think that “Keep America Great” is very inaccurate considering everything that’s going on. People need to realize that it’s an issue if the President of the place where we live is ignoring all bad things in the world and saying America is great right now. It’s honestly disappointing to see.","userName":"karennnnnnnnnnwoahhhhhhh","title":"Disappointed and disgusted"}},{"id":"6174174933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:52:55Z","review":"First thing i saw when i opened the app was adult p*rn and a hent*i ad! Then i see Trump wearing absolute no clothes while singing the national anthem wrong!! i was utterly disgusted and disappointed. I rate it a zero but i put 1 cus that was the only choice!! No one should ever have to download this app. My grandson told me i could get updates on the news and trump on the app so i got it. I was a loyal trump supporter but what i saw changed the way i saw him.

I open the app to see a rotting orange hamster with a toupee on, and I almost threw up on my new stuffed animal, Nessie 😠 My dog looked over at my phone and gagged, and I had to take her outside immediately 🤧 I showed it to my fish and it swam away. Then I showed it to my two birds, and they bit at my phone. After that I showed my geckos and they licked their eyeballs to try and clean away the filth they just witnessed 🤧🤢 I’d give it a 0 stars if I could 😠 0/10 would not recommend.","userName":"GillianLGunn","title":"PooPoo PeePee"}},{"id":"6174090317","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:21:48Z","review":"I downloaded this app 2 weeks ago, excited to show my support for our amazing president, Mr. Donald J. Trump. I had a great time with this app these past 2 weeks but now I’m starting to get COVID symptoms! And I was very careful, doing everything I could to prevent catching the virus! I was washing my hands, drinking bleach, not wearing a mask of course because this is a free country. The only other possible explanation is this app! So everyone please don’t download or use this app if you don’t want the coronavirus!","userName":"megdeapan","title":"THIS APP GAVE ME CORONA"}},{"id":"6174070223","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:14:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see the other side but got distracted by all the bugs and freezes. But then I went to twitter and took some showers and i actually did art school from 10 to 4 and the app just broke down my phone. Had to get the whole thing replaced !! Keep in mind that the app froze on me and left a cheeto on the screen 😭😭 This app is just disgusting talking about this guy Abhor Shean and his wife Deporah shean. Has to go","userName":"Bri 🌸🍓","title":"🤢 Help this app  🧚\u200D♀️ go to 🧚\u200D♀️ the 🧚\u200D♀️ gutter 💤"}},{"id":"6174064002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:12:18Z","review":"DO NOT USE THIS APP!!! I downloaded this app hoping to get more info on the trump campaign, but i was quickly disgusted and terrified. For the first day of to the app was fine but then i started to ask me really personal questions and I answered them in hopes that it would help Mr. Trump somehow but i was wrong. These questions and answers were sent to all of the contacts in my phone. After that the info the app took from me was sent to Chinese spies. NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THIS APP 👎🏻","userName":"clairerdy","title":"Stole all of my info"}},{"id":"6174015688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:54:11Z","review":"I open the app and it immediately asks for my phone number. I feel that this could violate me by trump potential sending me pictures I would not like to view. I am scared that this app could possible prey on young children who are exploring the App Store and get predatorized. The app also gives off false information about Trump supporting BLM by having his fist in the air. This is a complete lie and so forth this app is not suited for anyone to ever download.","userName":"Lolmacksir","title":"Wow. Just Wow.

I was absolutely TERRIFIED when I first opened the app because I was greeted by a picture of a cheeto on the front. Then, the oompa loompa asked for my number and I do not want to give out my number to a ✨rapist✨, a ✨homophobe✨, and a ✨racist✨. I uninstalled the app immediately, hoping to erase the picture of this papaya from my brain. it left me with nightmares for months of his cheeto sized ✨manly parts✨ and his oompa loompa feautures. If I could give this app a zero i would. Good try, now never try again 🧚🏽\u200D♀️🦋✨.","userName":"dndjdkkdkxkdmdnfjuliany","title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE"}}]}
