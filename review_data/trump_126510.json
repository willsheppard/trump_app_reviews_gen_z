It’s a terrible app and he’s a terrible man don’t download it thank you very much. Can you block an app from ever showing/being on your phone ever again? Like I dont even want it to be in my app store. I really want that right now, Apple you should hop on this idea.","date":"2020-07-09T21:08:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"f*ck trump 2020"}},{"id":"6178247797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Shivzzzzzzzzzz","review":"this🇺🇸app🇺🇸made🇺🇸my🇺🇸phone🇺🇸get🇺🇸a🇺🇸virus🇺🇸and🇺🇸now🇺🇸instead🇺🇸of🇺🇸spaces🇺🇸there🇺🇸are🇺🇸american🇺🇸flags🇺🇸!🇺🇸so🇺🇸don’t🇺🇸get🇺🇸this🇺🇸app🇺🇸unless🇺🇸you🇺🇸love🇺🇸american🇺🇸flags🇺🇸!🇺🇸","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT🇺🇸GET🇺🇸THIS🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6178247430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🤨😤😩😏","review":"hi, i downloaded this app because i heard that harry styles would follow me on instagram when i did so. however it has been 2 minutes and this has not happened. i wanted nothing more than harry styles to notice me. i don't even want him to fall in love with me i just want to be his best friend. i got a notification from the app as soon as i downloaded it that ross lynch was on my porch so i ran to open my door at full speed and there was no one there. overall, i am tremendously disappointed with the app and think it should be taken down. \n\"So when we have a lot of cases, I don't look at that as a bad thing. I look at that as, in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\n\n\"So I view it as a badge of honour. Really, it's a badge of honour.\n\n\"It's a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.\"\n\n“Suppose that we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Trump said at a White House coronavirus briefing on 23 April, before continuing: “Supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.”","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"disappointed😳👄😹😏😌😎😎🥬💅😝✌️😔😩😏😔💅😝😏"}},{"id":"6178247168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bella&Ava","review":"got this app to see how mr.pres is gonna start running things around here but my thing kept crashing and then it said they offer delivery for pizza in the ads. that’s the only real reason i downloaded this. comes to find out, i don’t get my pizza.","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"not good"}},{"id":"6178246842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"navedboomin","review":"Ban tiktok and every republican in the White House can catch these hands.

Just yesterday I was on the app and pictures of trump and little girls suddenly popped up on my screen which I found very disturbing and HIGHLY inappropriate and I couldn’t get the picture off so i had to restart my phone and I finally got it to work again and I deleted the app. App needs to be deleted now since it showed sever pedophilia.

I was very shocked , confused , and very disturbed. It was not a very pleasing photo. I am now traumatized by the weird view of the photo . Every time I blink I remember . Haven’t been able to sleep for days because every time I close my eyes it’s just there . After a week I became very paranoid with the lack of sleep I’ve been getting and suddenly started hearing weird things all over my house . The one night I was able to finally fall asleep next to my cutie pie little doggy tea chihuahua ✨🦋daisy🦋✨ I had woken up in the middle of the night . Suddenly I got a pain in my back . It wasn’t like any pain I felt before , it felt like I had been stavbrf by thousands of needles all over my body , but where most of the pain was coming from was the behind of my body . I stood up went in front of the mirror to see if there was any marks on my body . There , there I was with bruises coveryung my entire body and cuts all over my legs and arms . The thing that stood out the most was the giant writing on my back . You would not believe what it said , it said “trump 2020”  . In my head I thought “ why is this happening, what is this , trump 2020?!?! , is this happening because of that one photo I viewed that day ??!?!.” I let out a tremendous scream as I stood in the front of my room . In the wall was carved “ trump 2020” very \nVividly and very clear . Since I lived in a remote place I had no one to call out to. My only instinct was to run out . I ran and ran . I got on a bus that led me to the city to where my family lives . One I got to my family’s house I told no one what had happened afraid that what happened back there would come after me . To this day I had told no one about this :///","date":"2020-07-09T21:06:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No"}},{"id":"6178244698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pandai:,)","review":"Shrimp d### ‘s app is TRASHHHHHHHHHHH this foo gotta go .🍲🦟","date":"2020-07-09T21:06:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🤮✨🤮"}}]}
