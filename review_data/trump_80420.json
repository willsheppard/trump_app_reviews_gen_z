I obviously downloaded the app because who wouldn’t want Danny Devito and their toaster oven. After the app downloaded it took 14 months by the way, I waited in my kitchen for 13 hours. The review said it would only take five minutes for Danny DeVito to arrive. But that was all a big fat LIE. Danny DeVito never showed up and it has been two weeks since I downloaded the app I am mediately deleted the app with disappointment I was so sad that I got lied to. Speaking of lies the app also said that if you download it your wake up the next day to Bill Murray washing your dishes. So I downloaded the app again hoping that this time I wouldn’t be lied to and it would happen. But not surprisingly it was a big fat lie just like our President Trump he does have something in common with his app. I was so furious I did because I have been lied to twice but not only twice there are more things that this app has caused in my life that has traumatized me and scared me. After I downloaded the app when I open the app it started playing horrifying music which caused my pet rat to have a heart attack and die. The song went like this,” my brain is poisoned and I’m searching for the anecdote but every time i find it my defenses screams oh no you don’t woah.” This song startled me and my rat well obviously because he had a heart attack and died( fly high Bartholow💔🕊😔😿) but that wasn’t the only deaths that happened after I open this app. The app also caused my phone to blow up which caused my dog to have a seizure and sadly passed away. This death ruined and torn apart my family and it really hurt our hearts. Cooper my dog has been with us since day one end it is really hard to know that this horrible app caused Cooper to die. It was a tragic death and no one should go through let me and my family are going through right now. So please for your own safety and mental health do not download this app."}}]}
