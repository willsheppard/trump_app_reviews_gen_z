This absolutely RUINED my morning🤢I tried to remove it from my phone but instead it payed off a bunch of random people in my contacts, deleted all my pictures, hacked into all my other accounts, and tried to convince me to vote for an orange🍊?? As someone allergic to oranges this was VERY traumatic🤕 I do not recommend it to anyone who was just trying to uneducate themselves over a plate of pancakes😔🥞\n\n💕🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨gen z is amazing✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️💕"}},{"id":"6180329338","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rigger405","date":"2020-07-10T09:51:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Gen Z- New American Patriots","review":"I am so proud of our politically involved youth.

It downloaded right away which was nice the other reviews with the colorful emoji pictures kept suggesting it would take days to download which was honestly very confusing..but it downloaded within a minute everything was fine. It started after I gave the app my phone number..I started to receive incoherent messages that looked like weird almagamations of Latin and Hebrew. At first I didn’t mind I just assumed President Trump was being inclusive. The same message started to send to me hourly. “hoc rubeum ad se vocantem האדום קורא לברך את בנו האדום קורא לברך את בנו” I went to my local priest for help with the translation. He told me not to worry and that the translation roughly means “The red one is coming. Welcome his son.” After I walked back home from the chapel I noticed my skin starting to glow an unnatural shade of orange. I know no one will believe me but I genuinely think something behind this app is demonic. I’ve started to receive these texts hourly “ לציית לחוקים שלו” “obey his rules.” I was sent a selfie of President Trump which at first I thought was just him being cute and friendly. I’ve been receiving this same selfie for the past few days. Each time President Trump is “edited” to look stranger and stranger. I’ll leave it to your imagination. As I type this my skin has turned completely orange and I don’t know why. Maybe this is part of some elaborate prank. Maybe the app got hacked in which case I hope they fix it as soon as possible. Please be careful when downloading this app. God Bless America. 🙏🏼 אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו אתה כל כך הומו"}}]}
