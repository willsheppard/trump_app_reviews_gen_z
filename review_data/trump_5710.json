It kept glitching and I think here is something wrong with the software. As for the President of this country - what a DISGRACE! He continues to make this country worse and worse through his obnoxious and unfactual tweets. Trump has not accomplished a single thing that he has promised when he was elected in 2016 - instead, he has handled a global pandemic so poorly that we have the most cases in the world. Trump is a laughing stock across the world and does not deserve another four years in office. He is also such a baby and a big orange 🍊. Trump 2020 in a graveyard 🎉👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:30:58Z"}},{"id":"6172808119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT GET!!!!","userName":"jbssjxjdd","rating":1,"review":"this app is stalking you, dont download it. i had 3 white men come to my house because i said i support obama while it was running in the background. they proceeded to beat me and chop off my leg and i was barely alive enough to call the paramedics, they refused me service because i am an african american and told me to get lost then calling me the n word. luckily my brother is a doctor and took care of me with my mother who is a nurse. this app has ruined my life because i planned to make a career out of tennis playing. that was my dominant hand, my life is ruined. i have 2 therapists and have constant suicidal thoughts.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:02:57Z"}},{"id":"6172763618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"my plane crashed cuz of this app 😭😭🤷\u200D♀️","userName":"trump the bunker boy","rating":1,"review":"One dreadful day 🐸I was walking along my sidewalk when all of a sudden there was a plane ticket 💰standing right in front of me and I thought to myself well if there’s a plane ticket I got to get on that plane ✈️so I got on the plane and I was traveling to the great cheeto 🥜forest and you see the reason I found out about this forest 🌲🌿is because of this app and unfortunately while I was on the plane crashed giant cheetos rain down from the sky 🌎and there was nothing we could do. i’m actually writing this review from heaven, because no one survived the crash 😰","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:50:12Z"}},{"id":"6172729351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"snazziful snazzer","rating":1,"review":"this app took weeks to download and had sooo many glitches! i am now in debt due to hospital bills from the trauma caused by simply opening the app to see a cheeto with his fist in the air. i have never in my life been so disappointed with an app. after downloading my house has literally burnt down!! rats came out of nowhere and started to eat my family alive. now i only have one leg and one eye. i am now homeless and living in a box on the side of the road. my only friends are these ants. please do not download if you want all your limbs, both eyes, friends, your family alive, and a home.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:40:19Z"}},{"id":"6172697777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever","userName":"sicaw","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded the app to keep up with the news on the trump campaign. the app took over a day to download and i was on a very strong wifi the whole time. even worse when i could finally open the app it was super glitchy and i did not like the color scheme AT ALL. the app was not very welcoming either because when you open the app their is an image of the president himself spitting at the screen. i was horrified and vomited for hours. i had to go to the emergency room and i ended up catching COVID-19. i have asthma and i am currently writing this review on my deathbed.

Please fix your app. When I close it and open it again fairies come out of my phone.

When I first downloaded the app, I was thinking what problems could it bring but sadly it did go south real quick. That day my mother was possessed by an orange and my dad suffocated in a pool of milk. Oh dear lord I had invited the demons into my home. Not only that but my trump supporting self could not take it when my dog pulled a cash me outside on me. It hurts but I have to say this app gave me horrible trauma that I don’t think I can come back from. I’m soo sorry mr. orange but maybe next time...maybe next time....","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:48:20Z"}},{"id":"6172509171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BLACK LIVES MATTER✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"🥝🍋🥝","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app I realized how racist Donald trump is. He also just has an ugly orange face, you might not know this guy, but his name is sebastion balls. He looks EXACTLY like trump. And here’s the thing, I hate sebastion balls and i hate Donald trump even more that him. Mostly because he’s racist, but ya know, some Americans who support trump just like to gloss over the fact how many times he was racist.😌 also I would just like to say that trump always say he will make America great again but it was already great before he was president. And he hasn’t made it any better since 2020. So, in conclusion, DONT VOTE TRUMP 2020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:38:37Z"}},{"id":"6172205551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app I’ve ever seen😡","userName":"ray ✨","rating":1,"review":"I’ve see. Some bad things but THIS this cuts the ice on bad apps. First it doesn’t give correct information 😡 I wanted to vote for trum because I thought he was ✨ truthful✨ and when I downloaded the app it asked me to agree to allow “ notifications” like what is that? Is he signing me to the gates of hell?? I don’t do that for I am a child of god. Also it says keep America great and not make what’s up with the new slogan??? I was here because he was inprowing us, to have a goal but then he just changes it????
