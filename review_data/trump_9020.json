There are way too many push notifications. My phone started glitching and crashed. I wish I could give this app a 0 due to the troubles it has costed me. I told my family to download it and now they are coming to me asking me how to fix their phones, and I didn’t go to college for IT. This has been a total waste of time and energy.","title":"Phone Crashes Due to App","userName":"jwashuleski","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:00Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177394367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is just junky. Doesn’t work the same way as told in the description. It is misleading. The tabs don’t properly work and i don’t know why. Maybe it’s the version of my phone. The news is not updated as much as I want it tope even though it skeptical what is posted. Anyways, this app is a no go. To also consider, there is constant irrelevant information that is not check by actual source for accuracy.","title":"Bleh.

BUT, this monstrosity of an app took 16 whole hours to download. So I was a little mad cause I couldn’t see what the orange god what doing for his great country, but I still needed to know. So when I opened the app and it loaded his wrinkle orange face, my phone jumped out of my hand, grabbed a loose shoelace, and hung itself right in front of my own eyes. That was a very good phone. If a phone goes and commits suicide, then I don’t think the app is good. ✌️","title":"My phone committed suicide","userName":"RockoKarp","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:57:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177213827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I saw this app on the App Store and wanted to check it out. When I clicked download my phone  screen turned black. It took several hours to turn back on, it was fully charged. When my phone turned on I opened the app and I got a phone call from a unknown number and it was just heavy breathing. I ended the call as fast as possible, my phone was wiped and all my apps and everything was gone it was just a Picture of a orange Cheetos thing. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!","title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"uncle supper","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:43:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177168399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened this app I went into psychiatric shock and was rushed to the hospital. The doctors ended up explaining to me that the bright colors on the loading screen, as well as the scary looking cheeto puff of a man, triggered the left part of my brain that controls emotions. The doctors said it was a close call, anything more may have resulted in my death. So moral of the story is don’t get this dumb app if you don’t want to go into psychiatric shock and die like I almost did. 😌😌🤩","title":"Outstandingly horrible- ALMOST DIED","userName":"Tammy.The.Cutie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:30:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177073811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app because i wanted to become brainwashed by the orange man and i opened to app to see Mr orange man himself and it was so terrifying i screamed and quickly got out of the app i just don’t think it’s a good idea to have really scary and ugly creatures on an app what if a child accidentally downloads it and it opens it they could have nightmares for days. so if you download it i’m telling you now when you open the app the scary ugly creature mr orange man will be right there staring at you with his evil racist eyes✨🧚🏻","title":"✨Orange Man✨","userName":"✨🧚🏻ur mum✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176995144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Honestly we all know taking down tik tok is just because you mad gen z has more potential and power than you, we’ve already one. Don’t cover up with all that they are stealing info stuff. It may all be true but we know there are 1,000s of other apps that do the same, so why you so worried about this one? Just saying your not that smart we know what your doing and we aren’t letting it happen","title":"If you take down tiktok we take down your app","userName":"skinloda","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176976057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Our president trump has done so many awful things I don’t even know where to start. First, he is racist. He is calling the Corona Virus the “Chinese virus” as if it’s ALL of China’s fault. He also wouldn’t let black people buy your STUPID hat.  Second, he is an idiot! He said to spray CLEANING PRODUCTS in your mouth because it would “cure the corona virus.” 3rd, you’ve never even picked up the Bible in your life but you still talk about Christian topics as if you had read the Bible. So many christians follow you! \nI am ashamed that my family has EVER supported you! \n\n(You just got exposed by an 11 year old) \n\nDID I EVEN MENTION THAT YOU WANT TO BAN TIKTOK???? Tiktok gives the US itself billions of dollars because it’s so popular. Again trump. You. Are. An. Idiot. \nGoodbye and I hope you burn in hell you Crusty Cheeto Puff. :)","title":"AWFUL DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"RobinAshido","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:38:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176938780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support my homophobic, transphobic, rapist, racist (etc.) president. However, when I downloaded the app, it started glitching and everything in my house started floating😳😳. The app also kept repeating slurs to me over and over again. It called me a “f*g”, “sp*c” and many other things 😔😔😔. All I wanted was to support Mr. Trump but I got attacked instead 😕. I now live under a bridge since the app outed me to my family. 1/5 recommend. If I could rate it a 0, I would. Fix your app🤬🤬🤬","title":"Terrible app!!🤬🤬","userName":"gorillagrippussy3000🦋🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176915912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because as a black woman who is also apart of the LGBTQ+ community I obviously stand by trump and all of his values. After taking 6 months to download I opened the app and it caused not only my phone to crash, but also the plane flying above me. Thinking it was an honest mistake, as My president can’t do anything wrong, I restarted my phone. After turning back on my phone then called me a slur and turned back off. Terrible app. Will not be recommending at the next rally.","title":"MAGA","userName":"Mmm(;","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:22:18Z","isEdited":false}}]}
