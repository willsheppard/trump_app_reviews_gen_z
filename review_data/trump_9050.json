Especially because it’s about Trump and Trump IS NOT my president. Obama is. Trump is so racist and I don’t know why he would be the president of U.S.A when he’s racist because the U.S.A has all different types of ethnicity’s. Trump is just a horrible person and president in general.  This is the worst app in the world and I said it. That’s just how it is. Trump is the worst person and human being. So ya.

And then it’s starts downloading but as it continues downloading a wall started to get build next to me, black lives didn’t matter, Hispanic lives didn’t matter, police continue killing people, children continue being put in cages, the armed forces continues to not be transparent and upfront about the assault and murders of their soldiers at their bases and so I put pause on the app and deleted. Hopefully the world changes.
