SAD!","userName":"KarenTrumpJr","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:49:27Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is terrible. Sad! When I downloaded it, my phone immediately started convulsing and when I went to pick it up, the electrical current shocked me and burnt my hand. Now that burn on my hand says “TRUMP 2020”. This app BRANDED ME. And cracked my screen. Terrible! Then, my phone went completely dead. Much like the brainwaves the namesake of this app. FAKE NEWS? I wish. I plugged my phone back in and then I heard a buzzing coming from the wall socket. “Fakenewsfakenewsfakenews” it said. The sound grew louder and more terrifying. The FaceTime app turned on and dialed a number I hadn’t ever called before and a terribly embarrassingly orange old man with very limited vocabulary answered.  After that, I was scarred for life. I started referring to myself as “Karen” and couldn’t stop myself from yelling at innocent bystanders the next time I was at the grocery store. My “trump” burn on my hand is getting bigger. Every morning when I wake up, the font is bolder. I don’t know what to do. DO NOT GET THIS APP SAVE YOURSELFFFFFFFF"}},{"id":"6174081596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD FOR YOUR SAFETY","userName":"kætlęn bœññēt","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:18:53Z","rating":1,"review":"I WOULD GOVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD, I OPENED THIS APP AND WAS MET WITH SATANIC IMAGERY AND SYMBOLS. i started hearing the devil worships song they call “the star spangled banner” playing from my phone until it got louder and louder and soon it surrounded me and i lost all sense of reality. long black fingers grabbed my neck through the screen and pulled me in and i found myself in a dystopian russian urbanscape. the grass was black and the sky gold and there were orange sludge monsters that reminded me of the demons i saw when i first opened the app. truly terrifying. i fought for my life to get out and only after 15.7 years in that simulation once i destroyed that digital hell planet and yelled JUMANJI, was i transported back to real life. i haven’t felt the same since. my daughter had a similar experience and the trauma left her a ketamine addict. we now live in poverty inside the hollow pillars of the white house and can’t help but wonder how much better our lives would have been had we never downloaded the app...."}},{"id":"6173988431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"donald trump is a white supremacist.","userName":"amy wunderlich","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:43:52Z","rating":1,"review":"when first opening the app it became vital that i make a review ASAP! i opened the app just to be blown away by the abundance of Cheeto-man pictures that i actually had to run up to school and use the eye washing station in the lab😦😦. however there is no brainwashing station (although that would complete Cheeto mans dreams) for me to use. so i now have the unbearable reminder of Donald duck face in my brain. these images will forever be in my temporal lobe 😭😭😵😵🤧🤧. let us not forget along with these pictures i also have to remember his last....4.... years..... as.... PRESIDENT. Cheeto man is planing on using this app to grab the attention of the people. whoever downloads this app will be put onto a list. this list will be sent through the government and you will soon be called to the white house for a “special meeting”. during this special meeting donald trump will conform you to his religion and then murder you like a cult 😵😵 STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP (but leave a rating 😏😏)"}},{"id":"6173224272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible would NOT recommend","userName":"Ray Sisśt","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:12:41Z","rating":1,"review":"I am a skinny, straight, white boy from yeeyeeville in AL. I downloaded this app and was VERY disappointed😤. This app took 6 hours to download and when it did it called me a fat and stupid😔 and then it tear gassed 69 year old grandma😿.I was expecting unfake news but instead it showed me something called a campaign?? is that mexican??? Extremely confused by that. Also filled with bugs so bad that they ate my sister🤬🤬🤬 who am I supposed to take to prom now?!?!!?!??!?!!???😡 even after it killed two of my family members, threw mashed up pumpkins at me and my 4 wives, and made me wear a mask (was especially profiled by that one🤬), as I registered, crooked hillary came out of the screen, slapped me across the face and made me do five jumping jacks I ALMOST DIED☠️ sounds like ANOTHER ginese virus🥡 to me😤. anyway, VERY disappointed with this app for inadequately nursing my fascist agenda😿 DEPORT ALL GINESE APPS 2020😤🇺🇸🎣💯to keep bugs from eating another one of my girlfriends🤧.

I have great wifi, so there is no reason that this app should take that long to download. when the app finally installed and i clicked “open” and the app kept glitching and crashing. it wouldn’t let me enter my phone number, and it didn’t let me read the “terms and policies”. when i would go to click on it, the app would start to glitch with just the phrase ” 2020 ” on my screen. it froze my phone for about five minutes. i wasn’t able to exit the app, or press the home button. when my phone finally unfroze the app glitched once again and crashed. i’m not able to work the app at all without it glitching, crashing, or freezing up my phone. this is embarrassing! i personally think that this app has no reason to be on the app store if it is going to act up like this."}},{"id":"6172508027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A better look at life ✨🧚\u200D♀️🧜\u200D♀️👩\u200D🎓","userName":"O2L is my lyfe","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:38:18Z","rating":1,"review":"I was scrolling through Kaitlyn Bennett’s Twitter feed when I stumbled across this genius app. I wanted to download it since I praise this orange god, Donald Duck 🙏 when I downloaded it (which took a week and I had to reboot my brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max 69 times) I couldn’t use it because it glitched far too much. I thought it was because I didn’t have a good wifi connection, so I bought better WiFi (which was $420/ month) and it still wouldn’t load. Then, my last resort was buying rally tickets, that helped. But the screen at the end led to a giant orange oaf. Then, when I went to read up on it, and I actually found some very interesting stuff which let to my conclusion, that as a member of Gen Z, I should stop listening to my parents and stop going along with their political ideologies and made some of my own. Since then I haven’t watched Fox News in a week and I am proud to say that I will vote for Kanye this November! #educatedsister"}},{"id":"6177694644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"everybody matters ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💖 everybody except you 🥰✨❤️","userName":"the one direction boys 💔💔💔","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:09:04Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to support the disgusting.. oh oh I mean amazing ✨ Cheeto man bunker boi in office.

But it was a scam, and the only thing that showed up was the old Donny boy himself.... in my nightmares. He told me i didn’t deserve Meredith Grey because she was only reserved for him. I continually had these horrid nightmares for 1 week. Until i finally had enough and decided this app and the president had LIED TO ME!!!! I am beyond disappointed and i believed it was necessary to leave this review. I am scared for my mental wellbeing with this app still in existence. So that being said it deserves to be deleted, just like little butthurt donny is going to do to Gen Z’s beloved tiktok. So all i can say don is don’t mess w gen Z, because we might be too scared to correct a restaurant when they get our order wrong, but we aren’t scared of you. And we are a very very petty bunch. xoxo, see u in november 🥰✨💞💫🧚🏼"}},{"id":"6177224134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨JUDY✨ judy judy bo budy✨🧚\u200D♂️🐌","userName":"Why_Hello_There","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:46:46Z","rating":1,"review":"so i went on the app and experienced severe cardiac arrest because of how terrible everything is from the graphics to the core idea of the campaign. i’m now suffering from terrible trauma from seeing one of the campaign pictures as donald j trump’s mini croissant size dick. do not, i repeat, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. the orange guy behind this campaign is gonna die soon. a good example is the bee movie. in the narration at the beginning of the movie, it explains that a bee’s body is far too heavy for its small and fragile wings to fly the body around. in relation to the current president, he is far too old and stupid to run for president. i’m immensely surprised that he even lasted the past four years being that he is BARELY a politician. well never mind, he had it easy. all he did was prepare stupid speeches for his troompa loompas, and posted very uneducated tweets that made you wonder, “could he possibly get any dumber than this!?”. the answer is yes. anyways, au revior.

This is Karen and i just wanted to know why you enjoy and downloaded this app. I put in my information because I too wanted to be a homophobic, racist, sexist, islamophobic, xenophobic and all the other terrific qualities that fall under this awful list. Also! to all the people running this app, i want a manager, supervisor, CEO whoever i need to get this app shut down for all the spam it sent to me. I don’t have enough time to reorganize my perfect email because i’m walking around harassing people who actually think the corona virus is real. like as if. i hope all the fellow republicans also support my decision on being racist to the black community because somehow their to blame for this. oh! don’t forget about being xenophobic to the asian community because i’m always right even though i walk around with no mask because i don’t believe in that and i have a health condition. ALL I WANTED TO SAY WAS!! DELETE THIS APP OR I WILL CALL CORPATE AND THE POLICE!!!"}}]}
