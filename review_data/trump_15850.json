I was hoping for some substantive information, maybe some hard numbers on whether the national debt had been lowered or some statistics on COVID.  It mostly this app just seems to exist to ask for money, which is what I thought the texts and emails were for. I guess I just don’t really see the point of it."}},{"id":"6178085113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"hate this app","date":"2020-07-09T20:11:58Z","userName":"wackbru","review":"I downloaded this app a few weeks back and it has done nothing but make my phone glitch randomly. I’ve tried uninstalling and re download it and when I’m on snapchat it’ll randomly take me to this app and log me out. This is a horrible app it has given me racist notifications and I believe it should be taken down. DONT download this app!!!!"}},{"id":"6178123426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Great information Trump2020","date":"2020-07-09T20:24:40Z","userName":"moms4Trump","review":"This app is great. It has all the info you need to see what is going on currently in politics and to follow Trump on his way to victory in 2020. It keeps you very updated."}},{"id":"6178033196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"💥Orange Garbage💥","date":"2020-07-09T19:54:56Z","userName":"Mrsmostdop","review":"Worst app I’ve ever seen made. I downloaded it to gain some knowledge on the orange mans campaign. BUT when the app launched, my eyes were blinded by the most disgusting photo in the world. I cannot believe this app is still available. It is offensive, degrading, manipulative, and just out right DISGUSTING. Needs to be taken down ASAP. Don’t make me vomit Apple, take this down. \n\n-Love the thousand of GenZ/Millennials that are gonna take Cheeto Vendito down 👏🏻👏🏻😌"}},{"id":"6178031975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"terrible!!","date":"2020-07-09T19:54:31Z","userName":"Mary O Bell","review":"this app is terrible!! i was so excited to download this to get daily news from my president, but it did not work!! everything started glitching and it made my phone die. this is a monstrosity! i need this app to get daily news.

I have downloaded better apps than this piece of trash. As soon as I clicked download my, my phone started flying FOR NO REASON. I had a whole cardio session just trying to catch my phone. I had then uninstalled the app and my phone stopped flying. Anyways, y’all shouldn’t download this app if you don’t want to waste an hr trying to catch it."}},{"id":"6177977673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-09T19:36:43Z","userName":"Very Dissap0inted","review":"Honestly it's just a bad app. Terrible user interface. I understand what the goal was but it's just not working. There're too many radicallist ideologies expressed and it's very inflammatory. It has also crashed multiple times upon me trying to open the app. I just wanted to see what Trump's policy goals would have been this campaign, but honestly you just lost my vote."}},{"id":"6177944966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This has to be fake/slow download/hacked?","date":"2020-07-09T19:26:08Z","userName":"VgVaughan","review":"This app has horrible design whoever they got to model was 🤮not good looking. I wish I could bleach my eyes after seeing that but I'll still see it in my nightmares. It look forever to download and kept messing up my phone by sending weird codes that I couldn't believe came from an \"official app\". If I could give a 0 I would."}},{"id":"6177937570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app","date":"2020-07-09T19:23:42Z","userName":"CheetoTrumpp","review":"First off, the app doesn’t even work. Crashes every few minutes and kills my phone battery. Then the information he provides is misleading and needs a fact check. Not only do we have to look at a Cheeto all day, but then he spends so little for an app that’s suppose to represent him. I think with your millions you could do better trump."}}]}
