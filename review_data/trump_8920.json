It is so racist having sayings as “all lives matter” like sis, read the room it’s black lives matter honey. Let’s not be racist now trump, how dare you say all lives matter when black lives need to be helped. Innocent black people are being killed everywhere with almost no news sources talking about it. So if all lives matter why don’t we help black lives HUH. Anyway, the manny will not be televised and sign some petitions plsss, thanks.","title":"You’ll get cursed if you download this app🥳","rating":1}},{"id":"6174839786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:18:59Z","userName":"Emoji gal14","isEdited":false,"review":"I love my president so much but this app is NOT HIS!

I can’t believe this is still allowed on the App Store because it’s just awful for consumers. The UI is horrible and sells your personal information to foreign countries. \n\nThis is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded.

Once i pressed the get button i immediately took off my mask and begun coughing onto the elderly people around me on the bus, knowing i do in fact have coronavirus. Once i opened the app, the full fledged hate of non-whites and fascist-loving personality of Donald J Trump began overriding my own thoughts. Needless to say, this app is a one star app I’m now a total beta just like trump 🗿","title":"Made me racist and a fascist","rating":1}},{"id":"6174754367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:53:26Z","userName":"skyeblue2002","isEdited":false,"review":"So immediately after I downloaded this app, a notification popped up asking if I was a straight white male; as a female Hispanic woman I felt offended but I clicked yes anyways. As I was looking at this app, about 20 minutes later, about 30 ICE officers came into my house demanding for me to come with them because I’m a“illegal alien”. So now I’m here locked up with only half of a tortilla for the rest of the week, and the USA anthem being played in the background 24 hours 7 days a week. :(","title":"Don’t download!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174697450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:36:13Z","userName":"puko mota","isEdited":false,"review":"Y’all when I downloaded the app the First thing that popped up was I saw an ORANGE 🍊 like what the heck!!!

Then when I got off the app I had notice that my picture of the Obama family as my home screen was changed to a picture of Mr Cheeto getting spray tanned. I can not stress how mad I am right now! This app is terrible and frightening. I was going to tell my family to download it but after the app possessed my phone I will not recommend this app to no one!
