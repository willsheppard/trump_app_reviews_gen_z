First it took 3 WHOLE DAYS to download which is OUTRAGEOUS😡🤬Then my phone began to start glitching which NEVER happen before! After that an ugly, wrinkly, orange Cheeto appear on my phone🤢🤮 My mother friend sister cousin dog saw the graphics image and had a seizure and die😭 This app killed a harmless DOG! I should sue because all the emotional distress this app put me through! Do NOT get this app unless you want a poor animal to die. 🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸 but ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💕on a gravestone ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💕","title":"✨Oh to see without my eyes 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"𝑙𝑖𝑙_𝑚𝑒𝑙","rating":1}},{"id":"6173625400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:27Z","review":"So I happen to find this app on the App Store and I was so excited to download it because I can finally be educated and learn what Republicans think! For some reason the app took a whole moth to download and I was so confused why did it take so long to download😡but anyways, I was excited when I could finally use it and when I opened the app I was surprised to see an Orange Oompa Loompa in front of my screen!!! I was terrified so I immediately deleted the app. Trump how could you put something so ugly and scary on your app😔","title":"Honest Review","isEdited":false,"userName":"blah-~-","rating":1}},{"id":"6173611459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:24:27Z","review":"I really wanted to like this. I mean, who wouldn’t??? I just wanted to support my dear president. However, upon opening the app, I was bombarded with inappropriate pop-ups asking for my credit card numbers. Once I finally got past that, there were pictures of Donald Trump dressed up like little girls and Barbie dolls, all while spray painting liberal propaganda onto the White House. I am very disappointed. This was all just the tip of the iceberg. I couldn’t bring myself to share the rest.....let’s just say it’s NOT pg friendly.","title":"Weird fetish app???","isEdited":false,"userName":"Blueflowerprincess","rating":1}},{"id":"6173573809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:14Z","review":"This app is terrible I would not recommend it. As soon as the app finished downloading (and it’s been downloading since 2002) it messed with my phones system!! My phone grew arms and legs and continued to destroy our masks. As if it couldn’t get any worse it flew to the moon and blew it up, but not before rearranging the entire solar system. Now I’m so far away from the sun my nipples became permanently hard smh. This may have also been a problem with Apple but this app definitely was the main issue, get rid of it!! 👿","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hsbakfbrkdbs","rating":1}},{"id":"6173571296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:10:21Z","review":"I downloaded this app to get some insight on Mr. Trumps campaign because I would like to vote for him this year. As soon as I opened the app Siri came up and wouldn’t leave. I thought nothing of it, but then as days went on I realized Siri was only turning on when I opened the app. I’ve never even activated Siri in my iPhone settings. This caused me to be very paranoid and ultimately deleting the app 😔 if you value your privacy, I’d suggest choosing a different way to read up on your political candidates. #trump2020 #nohomo","title":"They’re listening 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"alexdyge","rating":1}},{"id":"6173562391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:07:19Z","review":"It’s the Worst app on the Apple store. Through all its ups and downs laced with this app I think it being put into a physical app is dumb, dysfunctional, mental and I’m being realistic. Obama  was one of the most best fitting presidents by a mile! So I don’t understand why there has to be a app for a man who claims to be the president and “makes America great again” yet almost causes the next world war 2. I'm glad I had the pleasure to witness the beginning of this app but it’s not what a lot of people in the United States should be looking forward to.","title":"Dear apple","isEdited":false,"userName":"anahihdz23","rating":1}},{"id":"6173540226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:59:52Z","review":"I really don’t know why people are downloading this app. When I first go it, it too a week to download and it took up like 80% of my storage trying to do it. Then when I got it finally downloaded, a big fat orange face kept popping up! It’s very confusing. When I figured out how to work it the whole app shut down and killed my phone! I am typing this from my sisters phone rn because the trump 2020 app made my phone blow up. 1 star would not recommend .😠😤😡🤬🟠🟧","title":"I have no clue why people like this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"kinda a little","rating":1}},{"id":"6173510069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:49:28Z","review":"ive gotta tell ya mate, dont download this app, no matter what i do they just keep stealing my material mate, i just dont understand?! first i download this app to see whats up in america as im all the way across the sea in the UK but then it takes entirely too long to download, blummin hours i tell ya. not only that but it nevers shuts up, the bloody bloke gives notification after notification im just done. this isnt how apps are meant to run mate. i wont bore you with the boring details but when i say this is the worst app ive ever download, i tell ya maye, i meant it","title":"why?","isEdited":false,"userName":"britishblokewritesrewiews","rating":1}},{"id":"6173487486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:41:46Z","review":"The worst app ever. I open it to see a ra_ist (insert c or p) transphobic homophobic dried up Cheeto puff and am immediately put into a coma! Three years later I was awoken to the sound of racial slurs. I am astounded that the rotten orange 🍊 is in the room yelling at everyone who doesn’t have pale skin and blue eyes. Then I open the app again and here noises outside... the zombies that were caused from injecting Lysol! THEN AN ALIEN MOTHERSHIP LANDED IN MY ROOM, CRUSHING THE DEFORMED ORANGE POTATO! Everything went wrong with that app, and now my uncle is a grape... DONT DOWNLOAD its for your own safety. At least the Cheeto was killed by the aliens 👽💅","title":"Trump 2020 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💖 On a GRAVESTONE","isEdited":false,"userName":".920...","rating":1}},{"id":"6173439895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:25:26Z","review":"this app literally hacked my phone and all my information.... SERIOUSLY this is so upsetting trump lies and says he’s so worried about apps like tiktok stealing our information but it’s just because it’s not a US app and he’s not getting the INFO. He’s CRAZY. My phone is so messed up now I have to go to the Apple store. I personally think I should get a new phone for free from the trump administration due to this app being so terrible. Anyways definitely don’t download this app should be taken off the App Store, it’s putting phones at risk.","title":"HORRID app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Dancer101so","rating":1}}]}
