I feel as though it needs to be taken off of the App Store to help the younger generation, and prevent this from happening to anyone else.

The news only shows the bad videos of the Donald Trump saying mean, stupid things and I want to see only the good ones. Disappointing. No good things on this app. I think it broke my phone.
