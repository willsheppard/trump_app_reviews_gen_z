Friends told me that this was secretly the original flappy bird and they put it back in the App Store like this so now one could find it. NOT TRUE!!!! THIS IS NOT FLAPPY BIRD!!!!! While the orange character IS funny, he’s honestly not believable as the president of a country. The game is boring, unrealistic and NOT FLAPPY BIRD!! If I could give it negative stars I would. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6174553524","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No.","userName":"hannahgiirll","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:54:56Z","review":"Honestly genuinely downloaded the app and it was horrible never had a worst experience.
