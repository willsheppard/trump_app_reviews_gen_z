My friends and family all downloaded it! That’s where we went wrong- This app was in NO WAY helpful. It made my phone shut down and crash anytime I opened it. I hate to say it, but maybe if my role model donny gave more attention towards making this app as successful as his golf courses and business rather than the “zoomers” (not funny.) on tik tok this would get a 5 star review!","date":"2020-07-10T07:50:47Z"}},{"id":"6179992349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Uuuu Eeee","isEdited":false,"title":"TIKTOK RISEEE","rating":1,"review":"I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP I HATE DONALD TRUMP PERIODTT POOHH😽","date":"2020-07-10T07:50:40Z"}},{"id":"6179992309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏻❤️💕☀️","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","rating":1,"review":"I firstly download this app to show my support to the amazing bunker boy😳oops i meant president. Anyways after 365 days of trying to download the app it finally did and may i add that i always have VERY good internet and the app itself was the problem. Once i opened the app an old, saggy, crusty, musty, dusty, absolutely revolting and disgusting orange 🍊 appeared on my screen. I spent months crying and wondering what i did to deserve that. Once i took hold of myself i looked at the phone once again and suddenly my eyes started burning and everything was orange. I threw my phone to the side and the WORST THING HAPPENED... the orange CAME OUT OF THE SCREEN i was absolutely mortified. He then started walking 🚶\u200D♀️ towards me covered in trump merch screaming at the top of his lungs TRUMP 2020!!!! As i was about to slap him he hid in the bunker with all the lights off...i immediately went to delete the app but it had left a virus 🦠 on my phone😪i threw the phone away and went to buy a new one while i was setting it up the oompa loompa came out of the bunker 😔AND BROKE MY NEW PHONE BECAUSE IT DIDNT HAVE THE TRUMP APP😡🤬😠i was so sad 😞 but then willy wonka came out of the closet and told his oompa loompa to stop and get back to work. He gave me a new phone 📱 and apologized for the orange giving me a bad time he also offered me free candy for the rest of my life. I accepted and had a little “chat” with bunker boy i proceeded to kick and punch him while willy was holding my hoops (thx willy). So yes that was basically my experience with the app so i suggest ya’ll dont get it because the same thing will happen to you. Girl honestly to this day i still get nightmares. I lost the best years of my life to this app😭so i DEFINITELY think the app should be deleted immediately. Love all of you (unless you’re the orange 🍊 if you are then yo mama made a mistake sweetie pie🧚🏻💕🥰😘😍🥺) u tried🥺❤️🧚🏻🥰😍now never try again🧚🏻💕☀️🥰🥺 and as for ur mother i am genuinely sorry u had to wait and suffer nine months to find out u were having an orange😪so sad...anyways thx for the attention as to why this app is so terrible buh-bye now❤️\n\n                                                   Yours truly, \n                                                     Willys wife😘","date":"2020-07-10T07:50:39Z"}},{"id":"6179991741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cin!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"Not Good","rating":1,"review":"I really had higher expectations, the quality of this app sucked.","date":"2020-07-10T07:50:28Z"}},{"id":"6179991555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"churros123456789","isEdited":false,"title":"Stan Charli for clear skin ✨👏👁👄👁👏✨","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app and a dragon came out of my phone and set my house on fire, I gave the app a one star 😡😡","date":"2020-07-10T07:50:23Z"}},{"id":"6179991503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ONE N ONLY QUEEN","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"review":"This app is a waste of time energy and storage.
