When I took it to Apple the next day, they rebooted it, but my camera roll was full of 🥵Baron🥵Trump🥵. In all honesty, this part wasn’t that bad. Scrolling farther down, Trump’s face was everywhere, every photo, even on my apps. When I’d open Snapchat to tell my bf about it, the only thing on my keyboard that would work was the 🍊🍊 emoji. I tried to send an SOS message, but I don’t think he understood. I tried to tell people the insane things happening to my phone. The strangest thing that by far was how I addressed other foods. I am a HUGE fan of Milk, but after I download the app to FULLY SUPPORT DT 😍😍😍, the only thing that tasted CLOSE to edible was ???orange juice ??? And any other food that didn’t have oranges then in them tasted HORRIBLE. I also had the sudden urge to get a very heavy spray tan, but much like a wedding, I thought it’d be inappropriate to wear orange (like how people aren’t supposed to wear white at a wedding), and we must appreciate the ❤️bride❤️. Anyways. When I tried to tell my family about such events, they deemed me crazy and sent me to a mental institution. I am typing this review from a calculator 😴 heart been broke so many times. Anyways, 0/10 would not recommend. #banalloranges #SAVEBARONTRUMP #pleasegethimoutofofficeseriouslythisisanissue","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:59Z"}},{"id":"6177244889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lilli_pad12","title":"Worst App Ever!!!","rating":1,"review":"Do not download!!!
