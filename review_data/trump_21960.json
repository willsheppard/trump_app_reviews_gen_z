I WAS INFURIATED BECAUSE OF THIS. I‚Äôve been supporting trump for a long time and when I heard about this app through my friend. I was very happy to download the app despite the ratings BUT, now I understand why it has these type of reviews. ITS BECAUSE THESE BRATS THINK THAT THEY CAN DELETE THIS APP WITH THE REVIEWS and I fully support them.","userName":"Pasting By"}},{"id":"6177431890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:45Z","title":"Crashed","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Hello upper east siders,\nThe app literally won‚Äôt stop crashing my entire phone. Any other app my phone works perfectly fine, but as soon as I come too Trump 2020 my entire phone crashes.

I noticed that ever since I got this app my phone has been slower and laggy. I‚Äôve also been getting WAY more ads.
