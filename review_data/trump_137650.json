There’s also this “Trump 2020” stuff that keeps appearing and blocking my screen. I just wanted to get some robux man 😖😖 I need it for my game. Then the app crashed and it takes forever to load 😭😭. Just generate my robux, that’s all I want! Absolutely horrible app!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:07:35Z","userName":"sincerly gen z"}},{"id":"6179877902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Bruh","review":"This app is garbage and the bunker boy who made it","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:07:34Z","userName":"gapingholewide"}},{"id":"6179877753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Confused","review":"This app was not a good experience. Would not recommend. Starts with opening it to see the slogan Keep America Great which must be to be funny but I didn’t laugh. Then you see the horrible Cheeto himself. I wouldn’t waste time going past that","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:07:31Z","userName":"notothecheeto"}},{"id":"6179877541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Moms gone","review":"I downloaded this app on my mommy’s  phone cause I’m smaller than she is and she won’t let me have my own. She said that she was upset that I wanted to support CHEESE PUFF 2020. She went to the store two hours ago and I don’t know where to go. \nEdit: mommy came back but it was with this nice lady that’s going to let me stay at her house tonight,  I saw her a few times(we played in the backyard when mommy needed mommy water.im not allowed to touch mommy’s water bottle, I get in big trouble when I try to refill mommy’s water for her, she said the water tasted off.) when mommy was watching cheese tell us to drink disinfectant and that if we don’t test the numbers with be zero. He’s a smart man who will live forever just like duke went to the farm upstate last year, I wash mommy would let us visit him but she doesn’t know the way there. Have good year cheese. YOUR THE BEST CHEESE PUFF THERE IS!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:07:26Z","userName":"Al3x@(0rn"}}]}
