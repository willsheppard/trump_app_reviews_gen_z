After downloading it, I got the worst headache in my life. I started having hot flashes and visions of people burning. It was like a premonition. Not to mention, the app wouldn’t download properly and kept glitching whenever I tried a good Christian woman and do my national duty. It was like my phone couldn’t handle my nationalism. It has kicked me off several times when I logged on. Horrible app absolutely. It isn’t worth the headache, premonitions, and lack of operability. I am going to delete this app.","title":"WORST APP EVER👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173464606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stankypussy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:33:51Z","review":"To start off, this app took forever to download. I have a strong internet connection and it took almost an hour to download. Secondly, as states in the title, this app constantly crashes. Every time I try to use the app, it shuts down within five minute of being opened. Last but not least, this app is pretty useless. it doesn’t do anything, and it doesn’t provide any new information. It’s almost as useless as Trump himself.","title":"Constantly Crashes and Overall a Horrible App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173448303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ellie May Jacobs","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:20Z","review":"For one this app took 4hr to download. Then when I opened it the app glitch my phone. I couldn’t use any other app besides call. I had to go to at&t so they could remove the app. When I got there they told me that my phone was perfectly fine but the app had been doing this to a lot of people phone. They also told me they were happy I came in because the app was starting to share personal info online like your address and social security number. Don’t download.","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173413942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ajhuntley03","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:16:43Z","review":"I downloaded this app so that I could stay up to date with our president Donald Trumps campaign!! All it did was bring me trouble!! It kept on playing music even when I turned my volume all the way down and it would bring cats to my house!! I’m allergic to cats!! It wouldn’t even stop playing when I turned off my phone or exited the app completely!! Now my house has a cat Infestation and I’m on my death bed!!

I mean just look at this awful game design like I can’t even tap to defend the police or nothing but other than that it’s also very toxic. All of the people on there are racist meanies who hate people of color🥺🥺🥺 they called me very naughty words and made me depressed for months😭😭😭 This needs to be taken down Immediately.

Not only that but when it finally downloaded the app took 30 minutes to load so I could even use it. Thinking my wait was over and done with I proceeded to use the app but 3 minutes in it crashed and a orange face appeared on the screen! So after all my patience the app didn’t even work! Would not recommend!","title":"This is horrible 😡🤬!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173312244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fatpigsayshewo","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:41:17Z","review":"This app took 4 days to download and when it did download it glitched my phone so now every time I go into an app that isn’t this one it plays this terrible song and the song attracted rats to come out of my toilet (severely allergic) the rats spread through out my home and made their homes inside our bed mattresses and it’s all thanks to this particular app!!!As you can see I am very upset and demand it be taken down effective immediately it brought many problems to my family and I.","title":"TERRIBLE!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173310451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jekdkdkdjdjfjrjejejjfjf","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:40:43Z","review":"So I downloaded this weird app as a joke, but then the next day a bunch of Orange Dinosaurs, with a blonde wig on busted into my house. I was screaming for my life! Then one of the Orange Dinosaurs, with a blonde wig ate my dog, so I bopped it  (ง'̀-'́)ง  It ran away but then another Orange Dinosaur, with a blonde wig bopped me in the head and I got knocked out. After I woke up in a basement, I was sooooo scared! I saw a knife and tried to grab it and I actually got it so I cut the ropes I was tied too and escaped through a window.. I’m lucky to be telling my tell, alive and well. Never get this app!! It’s SUPER dangerous!!!","title":"Noooo!!

Amazing, fantastical!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:31:13Z","review":"While downloading this app my entire power shut off through my house!! My phone started glitching and flashed images of something scary...not sure what. Possibly a clown? Not to mention the music that came with these images!! After taking nearly 24 hours to download and my phone barley recovering, the app was nowhere to be seen! I tried to download again and it finally worked. 10/10 wouldn’t recommend due to all of the conflict that assisted with the download 😡😡","title":"Scary App!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173255937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Losers bye this","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:11Z","review":"It took my 10 hours to download this app and when i did it made my phone glitch so bad that i had to go buy a new one. No one could figure out why my phone was acting up until they company i got my phone from saw the app on my phone. They said the app was made to break phones so the economy wouldn’t crash bc we would be buying more products for our phone. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! it also gave my phone a virus and all my nudes ended up on porn hub!!! Definitely disappointed in this app!!!","title":"Wow🥴","isEdited":false}}]}
