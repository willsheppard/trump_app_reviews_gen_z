DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP! IT MESSES UP YOUR PHONE! when i first opened the app , my hand quickly turned orange. and every time i would open the app more parts of my body would turn orange! now my ENTIRE body is orange and there is nothing for me to do about it! also, yesterday when my friend downloaded this app , she lost her fingers, and her kneecaps! why? idk, but it happened all because of this app. this stupid trump app is extremely dangerous and needs to be removed off the App Store as soon as possible, especially before I sue.","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176860237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DoEs nOt WoRK","userName":"JJoJonathan","review":"This app is designed with just mistake after mistake. The app at first took forever to download. How am I supposed to support my beautiful orange President if I can’t even download his app. Then I couldn’t even use it. The app wouldn’t let me give my phone number. All I want is to receive good night texts from my amazing president but this app, which doesn’t work, won’t let me. \n\nNow trust me when I say this app doesn’t work. I know a lot about apps, probably more than anybody. I’m one of the smartest apps in the world, probably the smartest actually. So when I say this app doesn’t work, believe me. Because I’ve tried many apps, I’ve been to many apps, so I know good apps. I know more good apps than anybody. And this app is not a good app. This app does not work.","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176262681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just disturbing","userName":"trump🖕🏾🖕🏾👎🏾👎🏾","review":"It took a whole year to download at when I finna it did it sent a warning to delete it because it tracks your location down and send trump supporters to your house to Kidnap you and take you away from your family and it destroys your house also did I mention it erases everything from your phone I mean even your iCloud numbers all your information and your information can not be recovered you will have to get a new phone and start from scratch and it puts my whole house in lock down with titanium doors  so there’s no way I can get out .

I was like, “Great, now I can go on being an ignorant Trump supporter!” You may be thinking, this girl is trolling us, but if you’re reading this you’re probably too old to know what that means or you’re just like me ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️I then went through my sent emails a few days later to find one I sent to my professor, but instead there were coded messages sent from my email to the Chinese government. I did not send these. But the title of the messages was “Trump 2020.” So now I am saying, “Biden 2020,” but if Kanye wins I’m going to shoot myself. So to any people out there who are still trump supporters, I hope you have a nice day ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️☺️ make it your last ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️☺️","date":"2020-07-09T10:59:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176069745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Abducted by aliens? Or possessed?","userName":"alien abductee 👁👅👁","review":"So, I’m sitting at home one evening and I decide to download this app. All seems well until halfway through, blood starts oozing down my bedroom walls and I hear a pack of wolves howling. Normally I’d brush these situations off as average nighttime antics, but the wolves were especially aggressive this night. Finally, the app finishes downloading but, get this, I completely black out. When I finally awoke I was in the middle of the woods and the moon was full (even though it was a crescent a couple hours ago). There was a small clearing ahead of me with what looked like coyotes on their hind legs surrounding a fire holding hands (or paws? Idk). I then blacked out again and woke up in the same spot, but my feet were muddy and I had leaves in my hair. So yeah, I wouldn’t recommend the app :)","date":"2020-07-09T10:24:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176028804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"i had to get a new phone","userName":"@paintme93","review":"so i downloaded this app to support the president but it took hours to download however that didn’t phase me i assumed it was my fault and that my phone was just low on space and being weird. when the app finally did download i opened it and instantly my phone started overheating but i didn’t think too much of it and continued navigating the app, then the app stopped working i tried clicking everything and it remained frozen. naturally i click my home button trying to get out the app but nothing i try my power button, nothing. all the while my phone was getting hotter and hotter. eventually my phone overheated and when i  went to get it fixed they said i essentially fried my phone. NEVER get this app!!!","date":"2020-07-09T10:11:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175814373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"0/10 SUCKED","userName":"bvh62","review":"Took a month to download because of “app difficulties” then when I finally got it, it immediately took up all of my storage and bugged out. It deleted all of my contacts and some important apps. Like snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, I am extremely unpleased. AND when I signed up, I thought I was in the clear, but than I kept getting emails saying that my credit card was being used in different states. And my credit card is now declining due to the absence of money in it. And my information had been hacked and people are coming to my house and texting me and buying things of of my account such as tennis rackets, a Tesla, Lamborghini, watch, clothes etc. and NOW it won’t let me delete the app. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS absolutely worst installment EVER.","date":"2020-07-09T09:00:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175670987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Peepee poopoo","userName":"Helene 🖤","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles.

NOT TO MENTION the moment I opened the app I got a notification from the prime minister that I was going to be bombed so obviously I ran outside and what do I find? A HUGE PIT of DISGUSTING rotten tangerines. Then one of them said \"j stands for genius\" and then stripped people of their rights! Then the feds showed up and beat my dog with batons then water boarded him for info on my drug dealer mr cluckels! Like yeah he's a chicken that just so happens to sell drugs and be a bio weapon from Canada but he's a good person! Then they took my baby brother because they thought he was an illegal immigrant even though he was born here. I got him back but then the hit me with batons just like my dog! \n\nAnyways crush the Cheeto 2020! 😍✌️","date":"2020-07-09T07:38:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175558590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app stole my turtle 💀","userName":"slaksinghogtong","review":"I downloaded this app to see some great news about our president but LUV this was not good I downloaded it and everything was fine until my turtle started acting wacky and then my turtle fought a rock and then I was like this is not good Tom the turtle 🐢 told me to delete the app so I did and a few minutes later I heard “knock knock” on my door and there it was a big Cheeto with 4 Oompa Loompa’s 2 on each side they said download the app again and give it 5 stars please and I shut my door and that is where everything whent down hill the Cheeto climes through my window and he says if u are not going to download my app then I will steel ur turtle and then I said noooooooo and the Cheeto took Tom a few weeks later I hear a knock and there he was TOM!!!
