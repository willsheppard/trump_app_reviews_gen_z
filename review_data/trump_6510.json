But actually PLEASE DO NOT get this app. It will steal your fridge and your microwave, it has really really disturbing pictures of Cheetos, and after you run it for a while- you will start to see random bullfrogs in every room you go in.. could either be a curse or a blessing in disguise. Also- this app has hurt my feeling many times. Called me names like “rotten clam” “under handed pig women” “irrelevant tomato filler oaf” and a few more. I guarantee this will be one of the worst apps you’ll ever download.\n\nHi, I’m Donald Trump and I approve of this message.","date":"2020-07-09T01:02:04Z","userName":"Auntey Karen :)","title":"Just.. no thank you","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174347560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as i opened the app for the first time, i was disappointed, yet not surprised. upon seeing the hairy cheeto i immediately started having an asthma attack. it took my breath away, and i will GLADLY snag it back😌 this app is very irrelevant because the clown trend was back in 2016 (when he was elected, coincidence i think not...) if the app is so irrelevant i really do not even see a point to it being on the app store any longer, if i wanted cheetos, i would go to my local grocery store, not the app store. overall very bad app 10/10 DO NOT recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T00:53:40Z","userName":"App critic2256","title":"this app caused me physical pain","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174313403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app, and realized I would be late to feeding my dinosaur practice. 🦕 So I hopped in my tricycle 🚲and rode to practice, we were in class 🎒and I got a notification from the app 📱and dAnG🤭, my phone 📱just wouldn't stop with the notifications, so my teacher screamed  \"YOUR BEING EXPELLED, LEARN HOW TO FEED YOUR DINOSAUR ON YOUR OWN TIME\"😡  I got expelled so I hopped in my tricycle 🚲and road  back home 🏠Eventually I got back home and my mom was so mad 😡 she kicked me out of the house 🏠...So with the last of my allowance 💴I rode to Mcdonalds in my tricycle 🚲and bought some nUgGeTs...now I'm living on the streets...🛣 😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T00:42:11Z","userName":"I ❤️🦕","title":"This app😭","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174282822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so when i first open the app i see a disgusting Orange chetto showing his pp. then i went off the all to find that it had hacked all my accounts!!!! this app is horrible and the orange chetto has been giving me nightmare for the past 3 weeks! i also saw that the chetto has printed its self out and put pictures of itself all over my phone and deleted ALL my apps accept this one. this app is horrible and i would NOT recommend this app to anyone! tell ur friends and family to come rate it a 1 so no one has to see the horrible naked orange chetto!","date":"2020-07-09T00:31:57Z","userName":"genarationZzzz","title":"❤️no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174221480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came on here hoping to support MY president, Donald J. Trump. Unfortunately, when I opened it, the pillsbury doughboy came out. He proceeded to spit on my grandma, drag her across the room by her weave, and threw her out the window. As if that wasn’t bad enough, he then choked me with his scarf and forced me to sing the “I am stuck on bandaid brand” song over and over again for an hour. He left me a photo of a naked cheeto getting a spray tan to remember him by, which has blinded me as I am typing this on the hospital bed, currently unable to see anything. I will NOT be downloading this again!","date":"2020-07-09T00:10:13Z","userName":"Nila🍪","title":"Bad App! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174170546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to pay respect to the late cheeto puff himself RIP. After 37.2 seconds of having this app my phone exploded in my room. It burned my whole house down, and I barely escaped with my life (I’m writing this review in the ashes of my childhood home btw). It was the scariest moment of my life. I now live in the ditch in front of my ash pile and pray the raccoons don’t find me. I can still hear the app destroying everything I own when I sleep at night. All I wanted to do was be kind to the late tangerine, and this is how I am treated? Honestly disgusted and appalled by the whole situation!","date":"2020-07-08T23:51:16Z","userName":"ra.cist.cheeto.puff","title":"⚠️D A N G E R O U S⚠️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174158266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay so I opened up the app and then I saw a picture of an orange and I’m allergic to oranges so naturally I died but the I realized it was just our racist homophobic transphobic Cheeto president (no offense to Cheetos they’re good especially the puffy ones) and so I’m now writing this a ghost. I’m angry that I died over this! Like I can’t complain that I’m dead lol but I wanted to die in the Burger King line because then I would be in a news article and famous and a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do to get in the headlines 💁🏼\u200D♀️💅🏼    Everyone’s opinion matters 🌸🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ except trumps 💜✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T23:47:03Z","userName":"squidhaha","title":"If I could give a one star review I would!! 😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174153806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. The fat Cheeto kid was the first thing I saw on the app. I’ve never seen someone so morbidly obese and stupid, that I searched for his go fund me page. Then I learned his daddy is rich. So u was thinking,” if he had so much money why doesn’t he fix himself?” And as I thought that his head came out of the screen and started trying to fight me. This man is built like a balloon. This interaction was 2 months ago and I’m now suffering from PTSD and suicidal depression. An orange man made me suicidal. This app will endanger your life.

And I thought the app would be awesome but i logged into the app and the first thing it said was that it was sending agents from the White House to kid app my family. And I adore trump so I don’t believe it. So I keep scrolling through the marvelous app and then my doorbell rings. I look onto my phone and I get a text from the fat blond Cheeto man himself and he said he’s at the DOOR!!! So I get excited bc I really want to hug president orange Cheeto. But he slaps me across the face. Do no install...","date":"2020-07-08T23:24:04Z","userName":"dump2020","title":"Ew!! I’m blind now.

As soon as o downloaded it, demons started coming into my house and into my room saying really scary stuff like, “keep America great” and “trump 2020.” I was so scared, I ran to my parents room but they were nowhere to be found. Instead, I found a giant Cheeto with hair. He started yelling at me and threatening to throw me out of the country. I said “sir, I am from New Jersey.” The only way to get rid of him was to show him a picture of King Barack Obama. He then ran away crying. Anyways, this app has made me scared for my life and I do not recommend it to anyone 0/10.","date":"2020-07-08T23:20:33Z","userName":"garbage 😹","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
