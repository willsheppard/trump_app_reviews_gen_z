This was the worst app I have ever downloaded and I must say I would NOT recommend it!!! It was horrendous, rancid and utterly disgusting. When I first open it up it asked if I wanted notifications (?!) which I am glad I DECLINED because who would want to be reminded of this terrible app and the mistake of downloading it?! Then it brought me to a page with an image of the Cheeto himself🤢🤢🤢 I was so horrified that I fainted on the spot and broke my phone. I am writing this on my little brother’s Nintendo switch. After that it asked what political party I was a member of but DID NOT include an option for \"the whoeverthrewthatpaperyourmomsahoe party” which I think is honestly completely disrespectful and ignorant! 😡 I will not be keeping this app on my phone for more than 5 seconds!"}},{"id":"6174719161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"makachine","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:42:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i almost died🤢🤮","review":"i downloaded this app to show my love, gratitude, and support for our savior, bunker boy😻😻i too believe we should worship our king, cheeto man 🥰🥰when i downloaded the app...peeling orange himself had the audacity to escape my basement😡😡the fumes from his dead and overly spray-tanned skin made my nose bleed😖😖he then tried to eat me and my dog😭😭he got so mad he threw a plate at my head which caused more brain damage than i had before😛😛after, the rotting carrot was climbing on my ceiling🤩🤩he jumped to the floor and tried to eat my dog AGAIN🙀🙀my dog flew away luckily😚😚but then, our lovely president shriveled up and died right in the middle of my house😇😇it was quite a scarring experience and now i am emotionally and physically unavailable and will never recover from this experience😰😰i don’t plan on reliving that emotional rollercoaster that i had to struggle through...so DONT U DARE DOWNLOAD THIS APP OR YOULL BE IN MY BASEMENT"}},{"id":"6174718196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alex_is_d","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:42:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","review":"I was really excited to find out that there was an app to keep me connected with what my lord and savior trump was doing, but this app is absolutely not it!!! First few days were alright but then it stated to become super glitchy and it kept shutting my phone down. Every time I turned my phone back on I wouldn’t be able to enter my password. Until a few attempts later. I once had to call apple and reset my password because I knew I had the right password but it wouldn’t let me back in!!! Once I got my phone open I wanted to go on other apps, but every time I tapped on them my phone would shut down. I decided to delete the app because I only had problems after I download it and my phone started working perfectly again. This app definitely has some sort of virus or glitch in the system so DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"}},{"id":"6174648015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Elijah Bluejohn","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:21:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THE WORST POSSIBLE APP","review":"I got this app to support Trump 2020 campaign. I was hopeful and thought to get good insights but it glitches sooooo much. I couldn’t even see anything with how much it was glitching. The app was so glitchy I HAD to delete it because even if I restarted my phone or deleted and redownloaded the app it was still terrible. When it did stop glitching for like 2-3 minutes all I saw were random images that had nothing to with Trump’s 2020 campaign and in fact had images that were anti-trump or what this man stands for! I’m honestly disgusted. This app should be removed from the App Store and not even tried to be brought back to life. I’m really surprised someone as great as Trump would be such a horrible app, and seeing all this images and glitches is making me angry including at him. He clearly isn’t smart enough to run an app so how could he run a country?!"}},{"id":"6174612445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kayharv","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:11:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"IT ALMOST KILLED ME","review":"i was in the bathtub shortly after downloading this app. i have a skylight in my bathroom right above the bathtub but i’ve never thought anything of it until today. today, was the day i almost died. the sky started getting dark i said to myself, there’s no way. it’s not supposed to rain today. and that’s when i heard it... the noise. the awful noise of a plane flying overhead. not just any plane, it was a jet. it was so low to the ground it shook my entire house! i was very frightened. so i looked up to the sky and what did i see almost breaking through the skylight.. a TOASTER! with the sticker Trump 2020 on it. don’t download this app. please. it almost killed me by tracking my location and hacking my camera so he would know exactly where i was and what i was doing so PLEASE please please please don’t take this\nlightly. stay safe and don’t download this app ❤️"}},{"id":"6174592449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"maurice flabergasted","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"Wow, I have never in my entire life seen such a horrible app. Despite the intention of the app, the layout was horrible. Absolutely hated the font and the request to send notifications, I have never seen an app that asks you that. What if I don’t want to put in my phone number?? Is that such a crime?? If I was a tr- a trump sup- *takes deep breath* if I was a trump supporter and I downloaded the app I would be disappointed at the fact that the president wants my phone number? Isn’t he married???? Besides the fact that you have to login or sign up, there’s not any use for someone who doesn’t want to give up complete personal information. A disgrace to network and software today. It’s 2020 I expect better coming next year... but honestly I think we just need to go without a president for a year, America needs some time to focus on herself."}},{"id":"6174549510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rags have heals dhenebvd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:53:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"SOS","review":"uh i have a couple of issues with this app... to start they decided to make don the background of the sign in page. his face is just so... icky anyway this upset me so deeply i couldn’t even make an account furthermore i just don’t like the font- like\ncome onnn guys please come up with something a bit more interesting :/ ALSO as soon as i got over my initial shock and made an account the app literally went crazy. it started glitching and then my flashlight started flickering on and off. did it give me a virus?!?!? if it did i have no hope for the app to be fixed seeing as donald and co are literally incompetent when it comes to dealing with viruses 🤣. after it stopped glitching my phone exploded. i had to go to the hospital. :(( overall DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS DANGEROUS!!! anyway this whole experience was traumatic for me please rate it one star and get it off the appstore 🥱💅"}},{"id":"6174365303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ImSecretlySecret","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:59:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"?????","review":"i opened this app and was immediately greeted with a nazi symbol and a voice that sounded eerily like jeffrey epstein telling me to k*ll m*self??? it also threatened to kill my entire family including my baby cousin if i didn’t donate enough money for 3 spray tan bottles, did anybody else have to pay this fee?? as i was going through it, it immediately put me on the FBI watch list for selecting “trans people deserve rights” instead of selecting that they don’t. at one point it was even listening in on my conversation and when it heard me say “hey covid is getting pretty bad, we should stop opening up public areas that aren’t needed” it opened up a hypnosis screen and tried to get me to repeat the phrase “covid isn’t real, it’s the testing’s fault” over and over again??? i didn’t give in but that’s seriously dangerous and could lead to delusion. overall a bad app lol don’t get this."}},{"id":"6174325808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pluto (im a dog btw)","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:46:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting app!!","review":"I downloaded this app and the first thing I see is disgusting video of a half orange, half corn, half man on the front page! my daughter was with me while opening the app only to start immediately throwing a complete temper tantrum the minute I opened it. not only was she screaming but then she started to cry orange tears, until she started forming into a life sized, half orange fruit, half corn right in front of my eyes! I had to drive her to the hospital myself only to see my driveway COVERED in cheetos all over the ground making it almost impossible to get out. once I got to the hospital the doctors were actually not surprised, claiming this has been happening to people all across the country that have downloaded the app, and that it is the presidents way to take over the country. with no treatment I am now left with an orange/corn daughter and THOUSANDS of dollars in medical bills."}},{"id":"6174267735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dont download the app 😡😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:26:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i had to go to the anime land because of this!! 😡😡🤬🤬🤬","review":"first, i was SO excited to have the app!1!1!! cuz ya know, trump 0202!! but then.. i opened it and passed out. it was second hand EMBARRASSMENT!!! i got so scared that i threw my phone in the air and it flew all the way to china to keep tik tok unbanned!!1! crazy!! then, i got my subway surfer jetpack, and FLEW all the way to china! gosh this app has caused so MUCH! then, when i came back home with my phone, i remembered how disturbing the app was!! i then logged into the app, and CRIED! i took a hammer out of my buttocks, and SMASHED my iphone 12Xs Max 2. i cried so much and then i broke the floor in my attic and my purple crayon escaped the microwave and i said to my desk why do men ❤️ ugh i had to type this from my apple table! i then accidentally assassinated the president! oops 🙊 better luck next time ❤️ guys don’t download this app bad luck will come to u for the next 78 years 😡😡😡"}}]}
