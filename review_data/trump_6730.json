They need to do something about this because it’s very hard to support the president when the app keeps crashing. There’s is very poor customer service! I keep calling them to see if I can get this app fixed or removed. (It literally won’t let me delete the app!) Also it’s taking up so much storage. I think the app is too modern for my IPhone8 to handle... don’t get the app unless your phone can handle it!! Too much storage and it keeps crashing!!!","userName":"A smash hit","date":"2020-07-09T08:15:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD","rating":1}},{"id":"6175620094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded and opened the app and the first picture was Donald Trump in a two-piece, neon green bikini. His hands looked so small, it scared me so much that I still have nightmares. I will be seeking therapy. The app gave details on how Trump achieves his orange skin color through a 8 day process of submerging himself in spaghetti sauce and ketchup. It made me nauseous. The only nice part was he finally explained he achieves the gross-wig-thin-spiderweb-hair look by collecting dust from the floor each night and creating a toupee. I tried to delete the app and Russian bots hacked all of my information. Do Not Download!!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"112346678afijseip","date":"2020-07-09T07:53:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"USERS BEWARE - DANGEROUS APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6175575215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got this app to keep me informed of all updates of elections and it didn’t even help me !

I left my phone charging and when I came back russian spies tried to steal it while voting for foreign with it. For some reason after I knocked them to the sky, I jump back down to roof and tried deleting the app. It didn’t work. So I had to find Trump myself and make him delete it for me. He didn’t want to. So I threw my phone to trash, bought a new one and it still had the same issues. I’m guessing this is a type of virus although the app store doesn’t recognize it as one, just like trump.","userName":"Russian Corona","date":"2020-07-09T03:22:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"How dare you?","rating":1}}]}
