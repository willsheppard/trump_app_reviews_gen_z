I then had to sign in and that made me go through every single thing about me, including my weight and what my frogs name was, this clearly was unnecessary unless they were trying to hack through my whole phone, but turns out, they did. This app hacked my phone and went through all my social media promoting trump. This was not only a violation of privacy but a very bad way to pretend that your still liked. After this app hacked everything, they then wrote to everyone in my contacts, including my frogs therapist, that I was voting for trump and they should too. Anybody who responded had there phone hacked as well, and the exact same thing happened to them. This is a very unprofessional app and it should be removed. This also shows how corrupt the president is🤮🤮🤮. This app destroys your phone and your life. I lost all my friends and my frog died because his therapist didn’t want to work with him anymore and he was depressed😭😭😭😭😭😭 this app ruined EVERYTHING.","title":"I would give it 0 stars if i could","date":"2020-07-09T10:52:16Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176101667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"got chased by cheeto clown","review":"❌❌DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! I REPEAT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP❌❌. So here is my story 😣. I hope I won’t spook you as much but here goes nothing. So yesterday after I downloaded this app, my phone started glitching but I just brushed it off and went to sleep 🤔💆🏻\u200D♀️.Then this is where it got really scary 😣😭and weird. I had a nightmare about a scary chunky cheeto clown😫🤡. It chased me around my house and we ran around my house for so many laps🏃🏻\u200D♀️🏃\u200D♂️.I got so tired that I tripped and fell. He then grabbed my leg and did the pennywise laugh. I started screaming and he started screaming hysterically. He said he been wanting to eat a Chinese girl for so long 🙍🏻\u200D♀️😭😭. I tried to scream some more but he covered my mouth with Cheeto puffs. Because I couldn’t breathe in my dream, I woke up. I checked my phone for the time, and there he appeared on phone. I screamed so loud that my family woke up. I told them what happened and they told me to delete the app. Thank goodness I deleted it. Thank you so much for listening to my review. Please do yourself a favor and don’t download this app 😌💗🦋💞💕✨💫🧚","title":"scary cheeto clown🤡","date":"2020-07-09T10:34:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175735117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"manny.............","review":"First off, let me start by saying I DO NOT recommend downloading this app no matter the circumstances. I wanted to have this app on my phone in order to keep up with the news surrounding our president but it took days to download. As soon as I opened the app, it asked for my location (which I thought was odd) but I denied it. It then asked me my race and I clicked on the “Hispanic” option and as soon as I did, my phone was completely wiped and shut down. I attempted to turn on my phone when I heard a loud knock on my front door. I opened it to see 63 large men all wearing red hats waiting for me. I tried to run but they captured me and my family. We were dr*gged and taken to an old warehouse in the middle of nowhere. They said they would not allow us to be free unless we vote for trump in the upcoming election. I’m not even old enough!! When I told them that I was a minor they became infuriated and started mumble chanting while circling us. We barely escaped with our lives when Obama himself showed up in a helicopter and saved us!! This app is not worth it!!","title":"HORRIBLE🧚✨🙈","date":"2020-07-09T08:33:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175614456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Rosie015","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! First of all, it asked me for my phone number. As a loyal 🍊 supporter, I entered my number without hesitation but was faced with a huge number of spam calls and texts asking if I support the president. Of course I said yes! I was heartbroken that I was even asked this! Then a bunch of people broke into my house with spray tan guns and started spraying me. They said they wanted me to look like 🍊 so they glued a toupee to my head when they finished the tanning process. I was pleased with the results because it was accurate, even though I look like a sad, orange centaur minus my back legs. Now I have a foot fungus from the tanning spray, and I can’t even call for help because I keep getting calls. (I’m writing this review on my iPad) I understand that there is much focus needed to keep this count great which is why this app is literal garbage. Apple, please spare us the heartbreak and spare our wonderful administration the work to actually make this functional and TAKE IT OFF THE APP STORE. Thank you ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸","title":"Left with a broken phone, broken heart, a horrible fake tan, and a foot fungus","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175086045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Skirman","review":"It has been a long time since the beginning of this invention to provide a method for producing a lot of people who have been in business for the first time since I've been using this app it was not until you get to know the truth about it. The first thing I did was to be expected to have been the most important things that are available for sale on <URL>, one hundred and fifty years ago and I have to say that I am not a fan of the most important things to do in the future and the other is a great way to get the best out of the house and a half years ago, and it is a great way to get the best out of it, and the first to admit that it would have been a better time to time and money on what will be an important purchase of a new generation of young children and adults and children in the first place and time to time, but the fact that the government should not be used to make the most of it is that. YESS!! I did typed this with the word guess choice thingy on top of the keyboard it was truly a horrible experience.","title":"Not my cup of tea","date":"2020-07-09T04:34:40Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174993206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"🤢🤢🤮🤮😡😡🤬🤬😭😭😔😔","review":"I am terribly disappointed with this app! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬I mean absolutely revolted 🤢🤮and traumatized.😰😰My bed frame 🛏started to quake in the middle of the night. 🕰🌘I thought Peaches 🍑was under my bed trying to kill me, 🔪🩸but when I got up, I looked at my bed and started screeching 😱😵because I realized that it started to become alive because I had downloaded this horrendous app. This app transferred evil spirits 👻👻into my bed frame. I looked at it 👀and I saw Debby Ryan’s eyes staring into my soul. 👁👄👁. I started running away 🏃🏽\u200D♀️🏃🏽\u200D♀️from it but I realized that it had already eaten me because Debby Ryan’s eyes had seduced me. 😏🥴I needed to find a way to escape from the inside of my bed frame🏃🏽\u200D♀️. I clawed my way out of its fiery insides 🔥🔥with only one blade of grass🌿.  Once I escaped from its torturous being I ended up with a hairdryer in my mouth 👄and in the middle of Dwight Shrutes beet farm🍠. I was rewarded with silly bands and fruit by the foot snacks. In conclusion, I have PTSD 😖😖from downloading this app. DON’T DO IT OR YOUR BED FRAME COULD SEVERELY HARM YOU!","title":"🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮😔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-09T04:05:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174148707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"jcowan123","review":"Aight so pretty much everyone knows that trump is a kook but did you know that he in fact is not human? Not only does he survive off of the souls of immigrant children, he doesn’t need to drink water to survive! The earths atmosphere is no match for his superior silicon based molecular structure, however oxygenation of the metal in his outer layers gives him a orange tint, yes he is rusting. While giving his commencement speech at West Point he was forced to drink water due to his internal computer sensing the suspicion of mere mortals that he was not one of them. After forcing the liquid water through his speaker system which is loosely disguised as a mouth, it immediately began to disrupt his circuit boards. This is the reason that he had so much trouble getting down the ramp, which let’s be honest was quite embarrassing. I have run out of time as the secret service (news flash they are not human either) is waiting outside my house because I have just uncovered the biggest national secret in US history. I have sacrificed myself for the people, I hope this has done some good for the world.","title":"Story Time","date":"2020-07-08T23:43:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173738000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"emilyemilyy","review":"When I heard about an app that would be able to update me on current news and events occurring in my country I quickly rushed over to the App Store to download it🥰. I was very disappointed when not even after 10 seconds of opening the app it crashed😡. I had to restart my whole phone and then when I tried again my phone started glitching out like crazy. I tried at least 5 more times before deciding to take it to my local Apple store. When I got there and told the employee about my problem he simply told me that the Cheeto man “our president” is what caused the app to perform so poorly🤭. And that just like him the app is no good and should not be influencing and brainwashing American citizens. After he informed me about this he checked out my phone and said it had a virus and was not fixable. Overall downloading this was a terrible experience and to save you from making the same mistake I am writing this review. It is totally not because I have nothing better to do with my time.🧚🏿\u200D♀️✨☁️🌹🦋🧡🎈☂️🙈🕶💃🏽🧜\u200D♀️👣🤡🤮🤮🤡","title":"Broke my phone🙄","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173495348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"saaaaaad!!!","review":"This app is a complete waste of time! The software is so hard to use and there were many spelling errors in the headlines! It’s honestly such bad quality It’s like our lord and savior the great Cheeto made it himself! I tried to click on the app when it downloaded but it was sticking to the screen and when I tried to click my finger got stuck too.  Then the rats in the ceiling jumped down onto me catching me off guard. They proceeded to kidnap me and the rest of my family and were dancing around a huge bonfire shouting Cheeto is lord. Luckily I was able to escape and got my family out of there while they were distracted but then the app finally turned on and started playing strange music that summoned a bunch of Cheetos that tied me down and gagged me. I tried to call for help but the moment I clicked out of the app my phone exploded and the whole building burned to the ground while the rats and Cheetos chanted and danced around the flame. I will now need years of therapy to get those images out of my head. 0/10 do not recommend to anyone scared of mice or fire.","title":"Complete trash","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173472727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Havoc13","review":"So when I downloaded this app to ObViOuSly support our extremely racist homophobic president 🥰 IT TOOK A DAY TO DOWNLOAD. Let’s not even mention downloading this app has side effects *instert debby Ryan face*🥰 All of a sudden I heard an extremely racist homophobic president SCREAMING racial slurs in my BASEMENT🤕 so obviously I had to do what was necessary and take him hostage but what I didn’t know this little racist orange kept trying to bite me😔😱 I didn’t know that such an AmAzIng president would do such a thing🤬 I had to keep him hostage like all the other kids in my basement and entertain him with my beautiful debby Ryan faces and tik tok dancing🤥 He wasn’t very nice abt it though so I had to give him the left over oranges I had in my pantry AND HE ATE THEM. Not only did this app make me realize how extremely racist our president is but made me discover he’s actually a cannibal by eating his own kind. At the end of the day do not get this app for there might be an extremely annoying orange that is about to GO bald in your basement😃have a nice day and always remember #dontvotetrumpfor2020🥰","title":"ArE yOu LoSt BaByGoRl🥰","date":"2020-07-08T19:36:41Z","rating":1}}]}
