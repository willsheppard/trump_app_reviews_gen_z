Well actually, at least I know that watching paint dry is productive and soon, the surface will be great. This app is the exact opposite, except the painted surface is America.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174807383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible do not use this app","date":"2020-07-09T03:09:29Z","userName":"janedoe089245221","review":"I downloaded this app and the next thing I knew everything on my phone completely shut down and started being inappropriate to young women","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174806042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRILE","date":"2020-07-09T03:09:06Z","userName":"amazing app! good for friends","review":"when i opened the app it showed mr cheeto man. then it gave me a message saying he was going to steal my oven and all of my ramen. that’s when all of a sudden a dinosaur came crashing into my backdoor and opened a time portal and threw me into it. i’ve been stuck in 1200 ever since </3","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174804549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad App 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊","date":"2020-07-09T03:08:41Z","userName":"Alia 19@35","review":"This app will track your location and glitch your phone out.
