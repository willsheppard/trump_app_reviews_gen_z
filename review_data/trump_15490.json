Not to mention the racist comments against every race but white. He has taken away the non discrimination laws against LGBTQAI+ members and is trying to take away adoptive rights from the transgender community.  he person running our country right now is an immature Cheeto puff that doesn’t know what equality is.

I downloaded it thinking I was going to feel welcomed but instead I was called a ugly and lazy. Are you kidding me? I am disgusted by this language used on this app, definitely do not recommend. As an alternative to this app, I suggest signing petitions to have the police that murdered Breonna Taylor arrested. Go use your time to something more valuable than praising a racist person."}},{"id":"6173585056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trumpcangotohell","date":"2020-07-08T20:15:07Z","review":"GUYS I DIED FROM THIS APP\nDONT DOWNLOAD \nNOW I UNDERSTAND \nYOURE PROBABLY THINKING\nHEY\nHOW ARE YOU MAKING THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE DEAD?!?!???!!????!?!!!!????!????\nWELL\nMY PHONE DIED TOO\nTHE APP WAS TOO STUPID, ROTTEN, RACIST, CHILD RAPEST-ED CONTROLLED FOR MY PHONE (OR ME) TO HANDLE\nWE DIED\nIM TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS TERRIBLE APP\nTHIS APP HAS ALREADY MURDERED, RAPED, AND DISCRIMINATED MANY OTHER PEOPLE\nPLEASE\nWHATEVER YOU DO\nLEAVE A ONE STAR SO THIS APP WILL GET DELETED BECAUSE ITS THE WORST\nI DONT KNOW WHY YOU WOULD LEAVE A FIVE STAR ANYWAY \nTHIS APP IS THE WORST\nI MEAN\nIVE DIED\nMANY OTHER PEOPLE OF DIED\nPLEASE SAVE US AND DELETE THIS APP FROM THE APP STORE\nI CANT HANDLE THIS\nTHE PAIN\nI CAN STILL\nFEEL PAIN\nEVEN\nTHOUGH\nIM \nDEAD\nHELP ME\nAND DELETE THIS APP\nOFF\nOF \nTHE\nAPP\nSTORE\nHELP\nPLEASE\nI BEG OF YOU\nI THINK IM GOING TO DIE AGAIN\nI CANT\nHANDLE\nTHE PAIN\nOH THE PAIN\nTHE SUFFERING\nOH\nOH\nI\nI\nI\nI DIED\nAGAIN \nBECAUSE OF\nTHE PAIN\nPLEASE\nDONT LET ME DIE AGAIN\nHELP\nME\nHELP\nOTHER \nPEOPLE\nTHEY\nALSO NEED\nHELP\nTHEY NEED\nHELP\nSAVE THEM\nPLEASE\nSAVE THEM FROM THIS APP\nTHE PAIN\nTHE SUFFERING\nIF YOU ALSO WANT IT TO BE OVER\nSAVE US\nIM SAVING YOU GUYS\nBY LEAVING A ONE STAR REVIEW\nEVEN THOUGH\nI DIED TWICE\nCOME ON\nYOU CANT ACTUALLY LIKE THIS APP\nITS AWFUL\nI MEAN\nI DIED YOU GUYS\nTWICE\nCOME ON\nOTHER PEOPLE HAVE DIED TOO\nOR HAVE NEARLY DIED\nOR ARE SUFFERING\nARE IN PAIN\nARE DYING\nPLEASE SAVE US"}},{"id":"6173570262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"orange lives don’t matter","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"black.lives.matter❤️","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:01Z","review":"this app is horrible. when i first got it a bunch of oranges kept popping up on my screen. i didn’t know what to do so i deleted the app then got it again cause you know got to support my president. but then i kept getting ads about oranges and a mad orange😡+🟠. then there was so cockroaches and flys coming out my screen. then an orange popped out my screen that looked like donald trump 🟠. that point i was scared cause it kept screaming at me to vote for an orange. this app is horrible never get it. it broke my phone and i had to get a new one thanks 🟠. also i bought tickets for the rally but i had to walk my fish and vacuum the my wall. so i’m sorry for that"}},{"id":"6173566735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App Ever!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ashlaayan","date":"2020-07-08T20:08:47Z","review":"This app personally made me sick and throw up multiple times. since i threw up, my dog started vomiting like crazy! i think it’s because we both don’t like seeing a fake orange man on my screen. and yes we go on my phone together and have fun. and the roaches also came to join us because apparently they like the horrific music that comes from the app. will not be using the app ever again!"}},{"id":"6173547488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I want my grandma back","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Marie Buttúa","date":"2020-07-08T20:02:17Z","review":"Ok so I was doing my typical republican thing and I was supporting but I was saying how much my grandma was anti trump and then a few hours later SHE GOES MISSING??

It literally took weeks to download and it kept blowing up my phone even when I turned off my post notifications. One time I was at a funeral and this app kept blowing up my phone with stupid messages and then I silence my phone and it kept making noise. Now I think my phone is hacked by the Trump administration and I’m scared. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP"}}]}
