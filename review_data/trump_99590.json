It horrible and disgusting. Racist and full of discriminative sayings. This app is horrible. It first took a week to download. Then I had to give my mobile phone number which I didn’t want to because I didn’t want to talk or text trump (like he would text me back). This app makes people feel bad or feel badly hurt. They get hurtful words from the person who is suppose to make America great again but really right now 2020 is being a very bad year. The coronavirus was only a part. But now a innocent man gets killed and people are fighting for equal rights because from the color of their skin. This should have ended when Martin Luther King Jr spoke his famous  speech. People don’t even have a choice of which skin color or country or race their born into. \n\nThe app also damaged my iPad. It glitched then all the apps on my iPad go erased. After glitching again for a few hours my iPad turned off and I couldn’t turn it back on. \n\nPlease don’t download the app and please make a greater choice in the person who hopefully make America greater then ever.\n\nAnd y’all are saying that we are writing bad reviews because of TikTok. I like TikTok. It made me happy for once and even if there is drama I barley even focus on that. TikTok may be toxic but mostly it’s just a social platform where we can make fun videos and look at creative and cheerful videos. I’m not writing this review because of TikTok and I apologize if I’m hurting anyone’s feelings but I really do believe in the things that I have said. Please just make America great again but no like in this kind of way. Also some people say that TikTok is for China to spy on the USA. Bro seriously they would only spy on the USA if the USA did something bad to them. Why can’t we just get along and make an alliance. I know it isn’t my place to say but it just my opinion. Please consider what I’m saying for a sec. Trump said that China was a disgrace and a disrespectful place because of the cause of the coronavirus but first of all the person who was the first one to get it didn’t know about about the pandemic that they would cause. They didn’t know ( that’s the point) Maybe China should’ve been more careful but really what if the coronavirus started in the US then would u like your country that you love and care for to get hate from a president. It very hard to explain but if you think about it you shouldn’t blame a country and take down a important platform that people love and put much effort into. What matters is that other countries should work together to get through these rough times. Also China isn’t a disgrace because almost all your things are from and made from China so if I were you I would be very very grateful and not say that China is a disgrace and a disrespectful place. Many people want to take this app down for trump and others to know how it feels to take down something that they believe and put hard effort into. Please consider what I am saying.","userName":"The greatest reviwe","date":"2020-07-10T01:31:39Z","title":"PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS  you won’t regret"}}]}
