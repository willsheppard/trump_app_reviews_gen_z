First of all, it took way too long to download. My apps normally take from 3-10 seconds to download but this took WEEKS! Once I finally got into the app, it crashed immediately. Not only this, but it didn’t allow me to enter any of my other apps and if I managed to get into one, my phone would crash! You may be thinking that it’s just a bad phone, but it’s not! I’m using the iPhone 11! Overall, it’s terrible.","date":"2020-07-09T15:49:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"✨Who?✨","title":"Terrible!"}},{"id":"6177207486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The app made my phone crash not once but multiple times and I am sick of it!!!

From the moment I opened the app I felt threatened. There was a close up picture of a Cheeto THREATENING me with it’s fist. I feel that my life is in danger. It wouldn’t let me delete it because it kept telling me they would find me and I now have to forever be part of the organization. My dog won’t come near me anymore because he saw me open it and is TRAUMATIZED. I now sit in a mental hospital because this app drove me to go manic. Horrible horrible horrible.","date":"2020-07-09T15:24:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Me126592","title":"The worst app on the planet"}},{"id":"6177124243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Ok, so I downloaded this app 1 minute ago, and something popped up on my screen. It was so scary I almost pooped. it was  an orange looking carrot thing with hair. It was so ugly I could have just slapped it out of orbit. I thought I had seen it somewhere but I just don’t know where. Maybe hell but I’m not sure. My dog was even scared. My neighbors heard me scream and came knocking on my door asking what was wrong. I showed them the picture of it and they screamed and ran to their house. We are all scared for life now. 💀☠️👎👎","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cairl reef","title":"This app is SCARY NO 🧢"}},{"id":"6177091059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Downloaded this ap to see what it was.  My grandfather told me he had it and was having trouble using it. He’s an avid trump supporter. So I downloaded to try to see what he was doing wrong.  Not even reviewing the content.  The ap made my phone freeze twice.  I have an iPhone XR and over half of my storage free.  There’s no reason it should be using my location all the time either.  Had to delete it and told grandpa to delete his until the POTUS fixed it","date":"2020-07-09T15:09:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Melissa4735","title":"Crashing my phone"}},{"id":"6177066760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded in the history of my life. I have been on this earth for 76 years so that’s saying something. I don’t do well with the applications in general but this one asked for all of my personal information including my social security number and bank account. Seriously, trying to take advantage of us old folks is getting out of hand! I love the angel that is Donald Trump but will not be voting for him now. He should’ve asked for my info personally.","date":"2020-07-09T15:02:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KatelynnB","title":"Terrible."}},{"id":"6177029194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I got this app in order to learn more about my president and what he would do to help this country in the four years. After I got the app I could hear a really quiet noise coming from the phone, and when I turned up the volume I could hear people talking. I also noticed that every time that I opened the app my phones camera would also turn on. If you don’t want the North Korea or Russia listening in on your private conversations...then don’t get this app!","date":"2020-07-09T14:52:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Quinnyson","title":"The government listens"}},{"id":"6176813751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I attempted to download this app to distract me while I was watering my ceiling, but all it did was keep crashing! I also think I ended up on the wrong orange website....if you catch my drift. Low quality posts and content from a low quality person. Took up too much memory, which is a shame, and overall just a waste of app developer brainpower. To the poor souls who designed this app...who hurt you? Why’d you sell your soul? Do you need a hug?","date":"2020-07-09T13:55:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lex ✨❤️","title":"Constantly crashes, not very good content"}},{"id":"6176765943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app ever,,I just wanted to give it a chance but I wish I never did!before I say why let me just ask who would even make a app for a 🤡,,first of all it took like three days to download,,then my dog came and sat next to me and the second she looked at my screen she ran and same with my cat😦😦 I really wish I can give ZERO STARS!!!!
