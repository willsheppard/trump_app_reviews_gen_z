Turns out the app exposes your location to Ku Klux Klan members, and me being African American freaked out and tried to delete it. Next thing I got a note saying “You better vote for him N*****” under my doorstep I then saw a pickup truck sit outside my house for days before I had to call the police, turns out they were planning to ambush me and lynch my body in the forest. I will never support Trump EVER again.","title":"Almost lost my life....","userName":"Santamantalanya","rating":1}},{"id":"6137201842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T20:19:41Z","review":"This app has ruined my phone, it’s constantly glitching and trumps face is just flashing across my screen at all times. As soon as I downloaded the app and made my profile, my bird fell over off his perch and died. It’s a bad omen and I should’ve never risked it knowing the curses that follow that office, horrible app. It also has tons of false information on it and blatant lies written into his articles. 0/10 would not recommend.","title":"My phone will never recover from this","userName":"jaywxspoon","rating":1}},{"id":"6135688244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T12:13:36Z","review":"I downloaded this app expecting it to have fun games. there were ZERO games. instead, when i opened the app it immediately asked me if i wanted to join a white supremacy group. like no thank you. then trump came to my house and beat up my grandma and stole my goldfish. i loved that goldfish. horrible app. don’t download it. like many people are saying in the reviews, it is 100% cursed. the minute i downloaded it, my house caught on fire. coincidence? i think not.","title":"horrible and cursed","userName":"ayowatermeloncheck","rating":1}},{"id":"6135154382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T09:17:46Z","review":"I’ve been supporting trump for a long time but his app is just terrible, as I tried to open the app my phone screen cracked, so I went on an got it fixed for $150.

But I guess I was wrong. This stupid puffy Cheeto man has completely ruined our country. I feel ashamed that I downloaded this app, even if it was just leave a bad review. I hope for the worst for the trump 2020 campaign and I hope trump realizes what he has done to OUR country. I thought the whole point of America was that all of the citizens actually got a say in what happens in OUR country. Guess not.

I don’t understand how people can give this app a good review. They either don’t spend much time on their phones or are psychos if they let there phone spam that much. I just keep up with news and hear what this flaming hot Cheeto of a president has to say.  Anyways I don’t know why I wasted my time downloading this app, but you know you got to do it for the gen z.

After opening the app a virus came about my entire device. I was unable to use my phone for days. I tried to get it fixed but no one could help me. I had to buy an entirely new phone. Absolutely ridiculous. This app was not worth that kind of money. This guy has no idea what’s even going on with his own app let alone America let alone the entire world. He’s clueless and idiotic.

The only solutions I could think of were to download every single app(which I didn’t have space for on my phone) or to delete it, so I did the latter. I also remembered that I’m not an idiot and that the namesake of this app has a tiny dick ❤️","title":"All apps matter","userName":"Radical Left Democrat","rating":1}}]}
