They wanted all my personal information and for me to vote for the cheeto. After that some people came to my house and made me drink something and I past out. When i woke up i had a flag in my hand that said trump 2020, i got scared and went to the bathroom I looked my self in the mirror, i was dress up as a supporter of the orange trash can.😱 I quickly took all of that of me but when i look in the mirror again i had it on!! I do not know how it happened but every time i took it off it came back.A lot of people stoped talking to me because I support the homophobic, racist orange🍊. All i wanted was to support my loving president. The app started to send me pictures of 🍊, and some of the great things he has said like to inject Clorox to ourselves. And that surely did not sent people to the hospital because they actually did it. When i try to delete the app it was not letting me and it was sending me nudes of the cheeto. I got really angry and i had to call the cheeto to tell him to let me delete the app. But he was there telling me no🤬😡. I told more people about but they just stay like😐. When it finally let me delete it took 95 hours to delete.😤 After that every thing was back to normal i was happy that I finally did not had to worry about the cheeto. I hate it, i do not recommend this. Is the worst thing that has happened to me.🧚🏽🌺💐 Everybody makes mistake 🌺💐🌹✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️Trump’s mom made the biggest one🧚🏼\u200D♂️🌺🌸💐"}},{"id":"6178332664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:39:11Z","title":"trash....","rating":1,"userName":"dgk xn kshps j d","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded the app in hopes to learn about my fav...trump. soon the app started crashing that’s bad on the software part. it made my phone lag....maybe the chinese hacked into it🤷🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6178331994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:38:56Z","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"jelpymemes","isEdited":false,"review":"Phone crashed and disgusting material"}},{"id":"6178326862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:36:58Z","title":"The orange.","rating":1,"userName":"my name doesnt matter.","isEdited":false,"review":"The orange is deleting tik tok for no reason at all and expects us not to be mad?!
