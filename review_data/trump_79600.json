But I would have never expected what would happen, it started out as a friendly game with a stranger. The stranger had my info from this app which should have been my first red flag but I figured that none of those very fine trump supporters would ever want to cause harm to me. The game started out as a truth or dare type game and I started to realize that the dares where becoming increasingly more difficult. We played the game until the stranger asked me if I wanted to play a new game since I had “earned my place on a new game board”, I had no idea what was gonna happen. I had no idea that this stranger was prepping me for a much bigger game, a game that involved more people both victims and predators. I did try to refuse his offer respectfully and then I saw a darkness in him, he started sending me screen shots of my family’s and my private info. He said that he knew where I lived and that he would kill and expose me and my family if I refused. So I did what any scared person would do and I accepted his offer, I did go to the police but the police ignored my plea for help and instead they beat my mother to the ground(she is in the hospital now and we still aren’t sure if she will recover bc at the moment she is brain dead) they justified this abuse of power by saying that my mother “was on drugs” bc they didn’t believe her or me. I was trapped in this game for a month, everyday the stranger or “game master” would ask me to harm myself and others and he made me to exploit my body for his pleasure. It was not long until I started connecting the dots, when I started to realize that the cops and the whole justice system was in on it. I have reason to believe that this whole game was operated and created by the cult like fascist that support bunker boi. I finally got help by some lovely anti fascist, I was able to help them by giving them info. I had became a spy from the inside, we are so close to ending this game, we have almost won it. I am scared, my game master thinks that I have died because at the end of the game you are asked to kill your self and I was able to fool him then. I must keep my identity secret I am scared that he will find me and my family. But we have connected dots back to a game called the “blue whale” please cause more awareness bc the truth is we are all playing the game and just don’t know it. TRUST NO ONE and stay safe 😘","title":"‼️⚠️PLZ READ⚠️‼️","userName":"game peice #102367","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178211725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:55:04Z","review":"I looked into it & I didn’t like it sorry","title":"period squad","userName":"dis - dis is not it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178211342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:54:57Z","review":"Kinda mad I had to download this before I could rate it","title":"Ew","userName":"🅱️ E A N S","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178207460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:53:31Z","review":"This is the worst app I have ever come across.
