Honestly it was such a hassle to even download! Took way too long for a simple app. As well as the construction of the app was so confusing I could hardly navigate it! Thankfully I did and signed up for his rally which I willn’t be attending!! However when I would try to sign up for it, it kept telling me errors and that I was not allowed to? Perhaps because of my Hispanic name, next time I shall try John Smith! Point being, it was very slow and a waste of time"}},{"id":"6179257745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:29:23Z","userName":"itsalexa.g","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT EVEN BOTHER GETTING THIS APP","review":"Are you really gonna waste your storage on this app? Like it’s not even worth wasting storage on this app 100% do not recommend getting it.  if I could give 0 stars I would but ya know I kinda have to give at least one star for it to actually let me review it. Anyways I really hope you enjoy your extra storage that you have because you didn’t get this app😛"}},{"id":"6179257744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:29:23Z","userName":"funimate is good app","rating":1,"title":"FELLOW TRUMPIES, DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"Terrible app when I downloaded the app it gave my phone 69 viruses and when I informed app support they told me my mother is a fat cow and I should’ve been aborted which was extremely offensive considering I’m pro life I do not recommend downloading I was very dissatisfied 😾"}},{"id":"6179257583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:29:20Z","userName":"hehehehetomuchcoffee4me","rating":1,"title":"Soo disappointed 😭😭😭","review":"My husband Bill and I were eating at our favorite restaurant with all of our friends and I went to the restroom and bill found a text that popped up from the trump number 88022 asking if I wanted to come over. I said no then I think that they blocked me😭 (I said no but I wanted to go. I want a divorce with Bill) bill was mad so we left.

It gave me a virus on my phone and when I wanted to fix it, the app told me it was a hoax and against its second amendment rights to do anything about the virus. Also spreading fake news: It told me there was going to be a rally and then I went and the place was nearly empty idk what happened.
