Trump has not only told lies about what he is going to do with this country but he has tried to manipulate us into thinking that he has made America great again. Trump has implied that he has made the four years that he had be president better for everyone in America but who is it good for? The blacks are treated with completely disrespect from the police and the community, the Mexicans are getting discriminated against and told to go back to there county, the poor and middle class whites are falling into an unstable Financial crisis, and the native Americans are fighting to keep one of the only historical places they have left. This country is not only worse but on top of everything we have a National pandemic going around and our President is no where to be found he has left all responsibilities to the states. I conclude to say that this app is a disgrace to the App Store and should be took down immediately!","title":"Dispointment","userName":"beke ebskajgebdh","date":"2020-07-08T16:31:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177668828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok, so at first the app was working fine and I got updates about our president 🤩 which was obviously AMAZING!!😋💅🏾🙈😼BUT, a couple days after I downloaded this HORRIBLE 🙄app, the app started to crash whenever I opened it...then my phone started to go slower!!😿 My phone was slowing down and glitching!!! I knew I should’ve listened to the reviews!! 🗣THEN, if things weren’t bad enough, weird things started happening. I started to see a figure outside of my house...👁👄👁 I knew it had to be because of this app since people were getting things stolen. 👣Thankfully I finally listened to the reviews and made sure all my doors are locked... 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧚🏾\u200D♀️but I’m scared for my life AND I have to get a new phone!! 🤳🏾DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!

America is not a 1 size fits all when it comes to people. the land of the “free” will never be free nor safe under his ruling.","title":"f trump 2020","userName":"read this ! 🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177450426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was very excited to download this app, I mean who doesn’t love a human sized Cheeto, but by the time it finally downloaded TWO days later, I opened the app and I got a notification saying that my phone was being hacked, HACKED, this was so surprising to me because our loving president is working SO hard for all of America (of course that’s not including anyone part of the lgbtq+ community or anybody who’s not a straight cis white male) anyways, what was I talking about... oh right our “loving” president. As much as it pains me to say this app needs to be taken down for the good of all the people in America oh yeah, and also I think the fact that Trump hid in a bunker just because he was scared of GEN Z just goes to show how brave and amazing- I mean... TERRIBLE the whole generation is and I have NO idea why on Earth they would want the app taken down, our Cheeto of a president (sorry autocorrect that was supposed to say amazing president) is working very hard, well I guess I want the app taken down, but still. \n          \n         Please take it down, love,  Gen Z","title":"Needs to be taken down","userName":"#dumptrump2020🧚✨❤️","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177409817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because i was genuinely interested. I AM NOW TERRIFIED. I don’t know if i’ll ever be able to recover from this. I am traumatized by the things i saw when i opened the app. I opened the app and saw a nude picture of Trump. Of course my reaction was to close the app and try to stop thinking about it, I was so confused as to why this disturbing picture appeared. The next day I was curious to see if maybe the app had glitched and if it was back to normal so i opened it again. I then saw a Donald Trump S$X TAPE and i immediately closed the app. I threw my phone in the toilet and began to vomit. Fortunately i put my phone in rice and it works now. This morning (when o realized my phone was working) i decided i was going to delete the app and as i was trying to delete it the app opened by itself and that’s when my eyes unfortunately had to witness nude pics of Trump, Hillary Clinton, George Bush and Biden all together and then i proceeded  to close the app and delete it for good. Moral of the story i’m traumatized probably forever and this app is inappropriate !!!","title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE","userName":"birthday bitchhhh","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177279443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought getting this app would be a great idea considering I love our not racist, homophobic, or sexist piece of garbage (I mean president oops haha) but as it turns out this app is not good at all! I logged in and I immediately hear a knock at my door and upon answering it Donald trump himself rushes inside killing my entire family! I think oh no this isn’t good but he’s our president who just speaks his mind and tells it how it is. How bad can it be that he killed my wife and kids. Anyway I don’t delete the app because I’m no snowflake who’s upset by every little thing 😒. The next day as I turn on the app my screen goes black and the next thing I know it turns into a giant robot monster. Of course I panic a little bit and try to run away and you know what he does??? He grabs me by the arm and throws me across the room and then trump, summoned by the app, bursts into my house and starts beating me with a baseball bat! I now have a new phone but I do not recommend this app because I have been running for weeks and every day I can hear him getting closer.","title":"What the heck?!?!","userName":"bruv444","date":"2020-07-09T16:02:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176655064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not only did this app take 3 days to download, take up most space on my phone, spam my contacts list, steal my phone number and email and address, unauthorized payments, start tracking my location, crash multiple times before letting me open it, have terrible interface and support, AND drain my battery. BUT it also screamed “All/Blue Lives Matter,” planted drugs on me, put me in a poverned ghetto, expected me to drop out of school, arrested me for picking a flower, stood on my neck, made it impossible for me to get a job or go to a good school, silenced my protests, built a wall around me, put my children in cages, made secret deals with Russia, tried to take away my rights to my own body, blamed me for Covid(while refusing to wear a mask to slow the spread of it),  slept with many....many many pornstars and hookers while still married, tried to take away my right to vote, and finally, maybe worst of all, tried to take away TikTok.\n\nGenZ don’t go down without a fight ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿\n\n🎶 Donald Trump is a white supremacist.

Second, when I first got this app I was a full on Trump supporter but now I open up my eyes and released that Trump is a racist man who treats women with no respect. I lowkey have to thank this app for making me realize how bad Trump is, but I can’t because the app is so hard to use! If I could give this app zero stars I would, this app is super laggy and is super slow. If your thinking of downloading this app, please don’t it will take forever to download and then it will be super slow and ask way to many personal questions, do they really need my social security number? Y’all don’t know how much this app made me wanna throw my phone against my wall. This app is very toxic and needs to be off the App Store. By the way did I mention how this app is only for Republicans? This app is so one sided it makes me sick. I don’t think you should download this app because it’s not a good app, it made my hamster die! 😡 I hate this app, I wish it was deleted from the App Store!!!
