What app takes days to download??! And while it was downloading I couldn’t use any of the other apps on my phone. It also kept sending messages to random phone numbers while I was sleeping!! This is ridiculous! I just wanted to educate myself and I couldn’t even do that, because when the app finally was able to be opened on my phone it glitched and crashed every single time I opened it!

Not only does the application take hours to download, but it also kicks you out every time you try to open it. Also it is not Gen Z user friendly which needs to be fixed. This tragic app is run by a racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, rapist, disgusting sexual predator. Apple should be against allowing this ugly orange man to own his own app. It’s misleading and uninformative. It’s an online cult assembly and should be taken down on behalf of the world. Apple should no longer allow their App Store to promote white supremacist apps such as this.

It asked for so many weird personal things. I just wanted to learn more about my president 🇱🇷and educate myself before I vote for him on NOVEMBER 4th but it completely glitches out my phoneDO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE APP IT IS JUST SO BAD. It’s asked me to sacrifice an orange so that I could be apart of the secret trump🍊🇱🇷 club which was so weird.","userName":"Denise🍒🦋","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173434722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app?? Absolutely awful. It hardly functions correctly. It always glitches and kicks me out of the app, it freezes my whole phone up, and it just completely wastes my time. I was really expecting something that worked a tad better than this garbage. My great-great-grandma can function better than this thing! Also... I don’t support Trump. He’s an awful man who lies to his followers in order to get what he wants. He doesn’t care about us, and he never had. It’s time for his time as president to end.","userName":"nottherealanonymous","title":"Not Worth Your Time","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:23:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173315083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The software of this app is simply horrendous. All I wanted to do was get updates on events regarding the best president in history, and instead i got a whole lot of trouble. The app constantly kicked me out, would rarely show relevant information and would often times simply not work. Blank screens when i looked for info about events, constant nagging for me to turn on notifications and to share with friends, and a lack of decent programming made this app horrendous. Never use this app if it’s at all possible.","userName":"StanWheresMyMan","title":"Unusable","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173314552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, the claim that the app took weeks to download is TRUE!😡And when it finally downloaded MY PHONE WAS HACKED. All my contacts were leaked and deleted, my photos were deleted, and I got texts non stop! They weren’t in English which is UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE I AM IN AMERICA 😡😡😡 . My debit card information was also taken and there’s already been a purchase of $600, this only happened an hour ago. I have deactivated my card though. Super disappointed in my favorite president. #Rapist2020🇺🇸 #MakeSureYouKillUsDuringTheNext4YearsMrPresident 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","userName":"elyssiaa","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173297769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with our wonderful president, but the app kept crashing. And this link kept popping up and sending me to a photo and it was a picture of the mans penis. Ugh so disgraceful, I mean for him to promote that kind of thing on his app he must be very proud of that tiny thing swinging between his legs😤. Also his penis is the size of my pinky toe, this app is so disturbing, I do not promote this app in any way. And just remember if you are under the age of 18 or not white, make sure you stay away from our wonderful present.💝Trump 2020🤩But On A Grave Stone🧚🏼\u200D♀️👑","userName":"The left ass cheek","title":"Wow..","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:36:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173279474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app so that way I could support our little orange man in office to take down the libs and the antifa, but the app wouldn’t open! I tried everything I could, starting my phone again, re downloading them app, and buying a new phone to see if it would work better with an updated device. It never opened! As a matter of fact, it looks like it wasn’t designed to open! I think this app is fake and was made by the Libs to trick us into giving out information to China! 0/5!

When it was done I was happy so I went to the app and nothing it was just a black screen I thought it was loading, no I went off got back on and all it did was kick me out I couldn’t even see what it was so don’t get and from the other reply’s listen to them I thought they were just joking but this happened to someone else but just don’t get this app.","userName":"kayla brook123","title":"The worst","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:26:13Z","isEdited":false}}]}
