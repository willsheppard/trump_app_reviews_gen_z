I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND.  I downloaded it to see what all the buzz was about. But when it finished downloading and the app opened I was treated to the sight of an old and wrinkle filled orange. It was terrible, I had nightmares for days. Weird things started happening after that: My battery started dying after, the app it self kept crashing,  I GOT HACKED,  got 13 viruses, and things started levitating around my house. Not only did I have to get a new phone but now I’m sure my house is haunted by a ghost because of this HORRIBLE app. It isn’t worth all the trouble 😡😡😡","title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}},{"id":"6175857302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"JenKarakatsanis","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:15:04Z","review":"This app almost broke my phone, I think. I swear it took 2.5 hours to download, and that destroyed my battery. I’m disabled, and NEED my phone to survive, and this app threatened that by stealing nearly my entire phone battery. Does this prove that Mr. Trump is still against people with disabilities?! \n\nOverall, horrible experience and I am seeing spam in the aftermath, already. I’m just disappointed. I expected much more from this app. Clunky, non-factual, terrible programming & operation, and it might just have a glitch. #karenismad #customerservicecomplaint #trump2020 #trump #badapp #karencomplaint","title":"Horrendous"}},{"id":"6175790189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"someweirdweeb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:52:41Z","review":"I would give this no stars if I could honestly. This is the worst app in the App Store. It’s slow and glitchy. And I had to open it and reopen it 7 times just for it to work for less then a minute then kick me out. I finally got it to work when it starts glitching again. The app is so orange I just can’t with it. This app turned my whole screen orange. Also it lied to me and it keeps trying to hack my phone. It hacked me right before I deleted it. I don’t recommend this app. It’s to dangerous. I don’t even think an app this bad should exists.","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6175583098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"just mmichelle","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:40:13Z","review":"So when it install which took surprisingly long as soon as I opened it, it asked for my number which I thought wasn’t ok because my mom does let me put my phone number on any app because sometimes it can end up in hacking so I did and my phone went all of of wack and crazy I couldn’t open any of my apps and at one point it would turn on so I had to get my phone fixed and my mom literally made me delete the app of my phone while I was in the store do not get this app if you don’t want these problems","title":"Do not install"}},{"id":"6175550880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"liltrumpdogass","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:28:23Z","review":"This app took several days to download and when it finally loaded it had me enter in my credit cards and personal information. I was very dedicated to getting this app so I proceeded with the concerning process. Next thing I knew my bank account was emptied and I had warnings that someone was using my name in Europe but IT WASNT ME. It also added me to a bunch of advertisement lists so I continuously get texts from random businesses to buy their product. This happens once every hour! My life was ruined because of this app! Don’t get it and protect yourself!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175109156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"vivisomer","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:42:11Z","review":"So I downloaded this app thinking I would be seeing trumpie the lumpy 🥰but instead was greeted by none other than fifiisqueen telling me to leave bcs trumpie the grumpy 😢 told him to do weird body rolls and act sus 👁 so I left the app and then shrek came through my door and deleted the app of my phone bcs shrek is hubby 💖✨ and told me to dump trump so I did bcs I would do anything for shreky 🥵🥺💖\n\nAnyways tho I’m all seriousness don’t support this racist, homophobic, sexist, etc. a-hole.

It glitches so frequently it’s hard to even open, and when it doesn’t glitch o have to deal with the crippling guilt I feel for even downloading this app in the first place. Upon start-up, the app SHOCKS you, physically, through the hard wiring in your phone and into your body. After the initial pain, your eyes start to ache from looking at the contents inside. I do NOT reccomend this app for anybody.","title":"Extremely bad quality application"}},{"id":"6174943518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"mimi00grace","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:49:47Z","review":"as SOON as i saw this app i has hopeful it might actually be good ... alas i was wrong 😔 once AGAIN trump has failed the country by being the blubbering idiot he is. when i opened the app i immediately saw ads for donald’s ONLY FANS account!! 😱 i was absolutely horrified!!! i hesitantly clicked the ad to find an unedited picture of mr trumps dick ... what’s that? yes. yes it was small. in fact the smallest i’ve ever seen and i’ve seen quite a few in my day. ANYWAY... i am disgusted by what i saw and sadly not surprised. DEAR AMERICA, this is what happens when you decide to let a pig rule the nation and create an app.","title":"TRUMP ONLY FANS ACCOUNT AD"}},{"id":"6174920396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"tinnys:)","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:42:42Z","review":"this app made my phone jump off a cliff also it smelled like rotten milk it was so bad it made my whole house collapse it looks like a bunch of cheese cheetos and my teridacle ran away so i couldn’t walk my fish so i didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl because it came out a dog i was going outside into my house so it made me throw up then i couldn’t figure out if my favorite color was red or green so i picked blue my batteries died so i was at the grave at the grocery store then when i was on the app it tracked my device into the government the government hears you and knows what you do .","title":"HORRIBLE APP ABSOLUTELY BAD!!"}},{"id":"6174884309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mydogshelby","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:32:03Z","review":"I downloaded this app and my phone immediately got turned into a balloon. The balloon flew off and I followed it. It led me to penny wise the dancing clown!!!!!! I asked him for it back but he said only if I do a dance off with him! I did but I turned into Georgie! I was able to find the balloon and use a magic spell Ursula taught me and then it back into a phone. I’m typing this with my one arm as penny wise ate the other. Don’t get this app or penny wise will eat your dog in front of you and your phone will turn into a balloon. If you lose in the dance off you turn into Georgie. 0/5 stars","title":"Don’t!!!"}}]}
