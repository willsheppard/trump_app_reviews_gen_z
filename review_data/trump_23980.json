RIGHT when I opened the app I saw the most disturbing thing. A picture of him. IT WAS ON THE SCREEN! No warnings or anything. It scared me so badly and I had to throw my phone away. This app kills.

He does not deserve a platform to voice his “opinions”. This app only enables more people to side with Trump, in turn making more racists and sexist in America. I despise this man and everything that comes out of his mouth. This app is trash just the person it represents.","userName":"bernie🧚🏼✨","date":"2020-07-09T19:19:56Z","title":"overthrow the orange✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️🍊","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177896529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"what can i say, i did not enjoy the app. i had high hopes to see our “amazing” ✨orange✨ president on this app he created, but it just was not good. i do NOT recommend you get this app but if you do and you feel the same way i do and many others do. feel free to give it a one star rating. thanks 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🦕✨💗🥰","userName":"RobAJ0818","date":"2020-07-09T19:10:15Z","title":"nope 💗","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177866856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The app has so many bugs & crashes so much.
