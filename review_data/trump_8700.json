Along with that it took forever to download and load the app in general. Too think the president would have a app that would be useful but he doesn’t that’s so sad for him. Makes sense why all these people dislike him he’s orange and can’t even figure out how to make a app I could do that so sad for him. He needs help and shouldn’t be running again if he can’t even run an app.","date":"2020-07-08T19:29:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173418457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE","rating":1,"userName":"a u l a","review":"this app glitches every 3 seconds, had a crazy amount of ads, and drained my battery like CRAZY. it made my phone restart 7 times, my camera flash kept randomly turning off. my phone would vibrate weird sequences while the light flashed a lot. eventually some weird language started coming out my speaker and my phone was buzzing and flashing. DO NOT RECOMMEND. i think my phone has satan spawn in it. im taking it to my church this sunday to see what my pastor can do about it.","date":"2020-07-08T19:18:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173356612","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app/president in America history","rating":1,"userName":"dkdjrjfndnd","review":"O god where do I start the app took days, months, YEARS! To download.  Would rate it 0 stars but I fear it is not an option. First off all when I opened the app it started playing this very loud music that made my sleep paradise demon cower right back to where it came from. Oh BOY! Don’t even get me started on the formatting. It was so terrible that It gave me ptsd, great now I have to see my therapist Brenda more than once a week! Please do us all a favor and get rid of this app immediatelyyyy!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:56:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173323549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"collene balinger","review":"I downloaded this app to see if I could regain trust in him, but was quickly disappointed. Took HOURS to download and when it did it took up ALL of my storage!! This app makes you want to vote for ANYONE ELSE other than that ORANGE of a president!! Its embarrassing seeing it come down to this. TAKE THIS APP DOWN!! Immediately. Edit: Another thing: IT MADE MY PHONE GLITCH!! I was in the app and it would load, and then glitch me out!! Unbelievable, unacceptable, and unprofessional. This makes the president look like a joke.","date":"2020-07-08T18:45:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173309200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever!!! do not download!!!","rating":1,"userName":"smackemontiddyboosters III","review":"this app took 8 hours to download. seeing trumps face plastered on every square inch of that app made me nauseous. the app really said: 🍊🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸🍊🇺🇸. instead i think it should say this: 👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈👸🏿🏳️\u200D🌈. i want this app taken off the app store so no human will have to witness the things that i’ve seen while using this god forsaken app. after looking at the app like this: 👁👄👁, it kept giving me adds for adult porn websites so i decided to try one out. it then led me a cursed burial ground where my sister then got sacrificed and they almost sacrificed me but i told them about my love for atticus mitchell so they saved me. we then bonded over our love for mr. mitchell and now i’m part of their tribe. i can’t leave. someone please save me. please don’t download.","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173233774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮absolutely disgusting","rating":1,"userName":"happymusicgorl","review":"i first of all feel quite ashamed to even give it a one star. it deserves 0. it has completely ruined my life. after opening the app, everything i touched turned into a racist, homophobic, ignorant, sexist, cheeto. and it has said that my phone has been hacked by some awful malware from “chiNa” and russia. i would definitely not support the download of this app and certainly not the person behind the app. completely ruined my life. i’ll definitely stick to tik tok. ✨","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173200918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"what a disappointment","rating":1,"userName":"hahahahhahahhahahhahaha","review":"I downloaded this app after coming across some of my fellow colleagues talking about it. They were considering voting for our president again so I believed maybe this will change my side. After i downloaded the app all it gave me was a chunk of storage taken away from me and the same information I can easily access on the internet. The marketing team or app team needs to do better. Won’t be voting for this man this election. Shame, shame, shame. 😾😾","date":"2020-07-08T18:04:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173125927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"userName":"A rating/rant🤷🏾\u200D♀️","review":"I went to download the app and as soon as I did, my baby brother woke up and started playing 6ix9ine full blast🥺After knocking him unconscious once again, I pressed on😌✨I went back to the app, only for a giant orange to break through my wall Kool aid man style and tell me to vote for trump😢But after flirting with the wild animal, I convinced him that just because one Oompa Loompa👁👄👁is taller than the others, doesn’t give them the most power🚫🧢So that’s the tea sis 💅🏾✨don’t download this app unless you want pure chaos🦾🧚🏽\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-08T17:41:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173105212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app on the app store","rating":1,"userName":"PrincessBian","review":"im sure you’ve read all the reviews by now so i don’t feel like i need to explain much more.. you don’t even need to have it downloaded for more that 2 seconds to realize how horrendous this app is.. i wanted to gain some insight into our lovely president trump but not only the app itself was slow but it’s seems that our president is just as slow, if not slower.. i rate it a 00F and that’s probably the nicest rating i could give. mr. president should stick to firing people","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:27Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173019148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why Baby Daddy 😡","rating":1,"userName":"Very Smart Reviewer","review":"Donald Trump is of course, my star and idol. So when I found out there was an app just for him, I was in shock. Baby I was, in tears almost. Then I found out that the app took way too long to download!! After waiting a whole TWO SECONDS for the app, I simply refused to even open it and leave this review right here. Big Daddy Trump, if you’re reading this review, please know that no president of mine will have an app that takes 2 seconds or more to download. 😡 Anyways Biden 2020 and Black Lives Matter.","date":"2020-07-08T17:07:04Z","isEdited":false}}]}
