BUT I HAVE FAILED TO FIND THESE SPECIALITIES. i n s t e a d of having easy access into this i had to send my pet chinchilla all the way to the headquarters to bring the special cheeto dust back to me. BUT INSTEAD HE SNORTED THE HOT CHEETO DUST AND NOW HE IS ASCENDING🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚 OFF OF THE GROUND AND I CANNOT GET HIM TO STOP BARKING “CHINA” and “HUGE” so now i have to evacuate the whole neighborhood before my radical chinchilla tries to send them back to mexico.

As soon as i logged in an alarm went off sounding all the crazy trump supporters but i couldn’t hear it (it was like a dog whistle), as soon as i walked outside to get in my car i was attacked with false information and trump flags even though i kept proving them wrong all they would say was trump 2020 and they kept attacking me with their ugly, excuse for a flag. I was about to call the police but then i remembered that they are pigs 🐷. Anyways don’t get this app trumps supporters also known as zombies because they have no knowledge will attack you he’s obviously creating an army with this app it’s very dangerous.","userName":"extremely concerned mother","date":"2020-07-08T21:33:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","rating":1}},{"id":"6173796562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I honestly wish I could give this 0 stars but unfortunately I can’t ,, this took hours to download and all my other apps downloaded in seconds in the same location and a few monuments after the app had downloaded my phone began to glitch and random stuff would happen like music playing out of no where when I wouldn’t even touch my phone it would just open random apps and text /call people and I couldn’t hang up and they wouldn’t be able to hear me  don’t download this app it will hack your phone and take your data and all your private information and once i deleted it my phone was completely normal ,, also #BLM🗣","userName":"hjjisksjshsua","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t recommend","rating":1}},{"id":"6173655979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"While I was downloading it my phone started to glitch then when I downloaded something popped up sayin the Illuminati has hacked ur phone. The Illuminati took over all the technology in the house! The Illuminati was threatening us and then the fbi showed up at our house. My grandma was dropkicked! My mother was punched several times!😭 I didn’t know what was going on! We all were handcuffed and taken to a abandoned place in the middle of nowhere....they robbed us and left us there to die😫. I am lucky to be alive. I am safe now and have deleted this app. My family is suffering from losses because all the tech in my house had a virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! It s connected to the Illuminati !!!😤","userName":"illuminti confirmed","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app will make u want to die😭","rating":1}},{"id":"6173637184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was terrible I got so many viruses from it. Horrible horrible ads kept popping up, pictures of a giant orange man wearing a wig and claiming to want to make America great again. I had nightmares for weeks I was unable to delete the app for days it wouldn’t let me and the nightmares got worse. until one day I finally was able to delete it miraculously. I think my hope and love for our formal god and savior, my pal, Barack. Mr. Obama helped with so much and I will forever be greatful and hopefully I will be able to get rid of these horrid memories of this despicable orange creature. I felt this app deserved a 1 Star for all the pain and suffering it put me through, I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy 😤.","userName":"Joce Reyezz","date":"2020-07-08T20:33:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"puts health at risk","rating":1}},{"id":"6173533205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app when i was at the park and overheard the local ✨karens✨ that like to hangout and scream at the skaters, go on and on about how amazing this app is. so i wanted to see what all the hype was. when i downloaded this mistake, not only did it glitch and asked for money, but it welcomed VIRUSES onto my phone. i tried to ignore that and proceeded to read what the app had to offer. I WAS DISGUSTED not only is this man a hypocrite, but a disgrace to this nation. He has brought nothing but problems and no solutions to anything existing. The leader for this country should not be racist, homophobic, ignorant etc. I am truly nauseated to call this monster “our president”. By the reviews, i see i am not the only one to think this.","userName":"endtrump","date":"2020-07-08T19:57:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"a mistake","rating":1}},{"id":"6173485489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is just.... useless really. I thought it would be good at first but then I tried to download it and it started to make my phone glitch out and explode. Had to get four new phones just to download it. Then when it finally installed and I opened it for the first time... I got an alert saying a nuke was sent to my address. Well guess who doesn’t have a neighborhood now. And here I was thinking this was going to be worth my time and house. Boy was I wrong. If you’re into nukes tho I guess you could download this app... wouldn’t recommend tho. 0/10. Wouldn’t even let my nonexistent kids use it. I can’t believe Cheeto has betrayed us like this. 🥰🧚✨❤️🧚\u200D♂️😘👁👄👁🤗🧚🤩🥰✨🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"legit reviewer i know my stuff","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:03Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t waste your time","rating":1}}]}
