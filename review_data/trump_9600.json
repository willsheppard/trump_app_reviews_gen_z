I asked him politely to leave but he hasn‚Äôt and is still here now.

I had such high hopes for this app and was so excited to get it, but after I downloaded it, it started to glitch out every time I opened it! And not only that, it would also eat up my phones battery!! Terrible, horrible app that I wish I had never downloaded! Trump administration- you should be ashamed of yourself!
