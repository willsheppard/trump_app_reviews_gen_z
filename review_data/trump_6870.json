Not to mention the picture that first pops up needs a trigger warning. That was the most hideous thing i have ever seen and i definitely need therapy after exposing my sight to it. After a few minutes of use it asked me if i wanted to subscribe to mr. cheeto man’s onlyfans and showed me preview. My god i have never projectile vomit like that before. Please remove this app to save young people’s life.

I mean you do you McDonald’s but it was kinda weird. First off I lost my appetite. Second of all it spammed me with texts. Like catch a hint.... my ex did. Third of all I couldn’t find the menu just really crappy merch. Also my pet rock looked better than the walking spicy patty. I mean they dressed that thing in a whole suit...disgusting will never download again."}}]}
