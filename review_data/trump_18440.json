Seemed chill. But then all of a sudden a giant Cheeto popped up on my screen and started screaming gibberish at me. I quickly logged out and deleted it. Well later that night, I was in bed and looked out my window and saw a Cheeto in my yard staring up at me! I blinked and it was closer! It wouldn’t stop! And now I’m being followed by a fat Cheeto with an awful wig everywhere I go.

That on its own gets a 0/5 stars... And beyond that he supports white power, he is gassing children in cages, and his supporters are molesting/ raping these kids too so, not a fan! Also the app froze for like 30 seconds...","title":"Made it 1 star because it wouldn’t let me rate 0","date":"2020-07-09T01:26:58Z","userName":"Annlee_13"}},{"id":"6174452974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Hello it’s karen i can’t belive the profanity on this app!

Sadly, I was just as disappointed in this news source as I am with CNN. Every single news source was HEAVILY bias and contained twisted stories or lies. Still don’t know who to vote for, but this was a major blow to my perception of the GOP.","title":"Heavily Bias","date":"2020-07-09T01:20:34Z","userName":"pinheadlarryo"}},{"id":"6174431867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"OK so first of you open the app to see a picture of a soggy Cheeto with his fist in the air? Gross🤢🤮 later after downloading this horrid app I went outside and saw my neighbors had a flag with the soggy Cheeto from the app!!
