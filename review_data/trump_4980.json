Firstly it took forever to download (probably because it was stealing all my information to sell to China). Once it finally downloaded it kept crashing every time I tried to open it which is highly unprofessional! It also asked for my phone number why would you need that?! (More stealing my information!) I would stay away from this app unless you want all your information stolen and your phone to keep crashing! I expected more from our president!","date":"2020-07-09T19:04:26Z","rating":1,"userName":"Soccerchick2😜","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177789043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏼💕Trump bad, tiktok good😌✨","review":"Absolutely horrible is the only thing I can use to describe the things I have seen on this app. My poor innocent virgin eyes have been exposed to such horrid images. Images of what I can only describe as a decomposing, rotting, foul-smelling orange creature. I have had nightmares since the moment I opened the app. My non-existent children cry at the sight of their sleep paralysis demon that is this orange cheeto. My grandchildren and their children will forever live in fear of this retched being. I can only hope that one day I will be able to overcome my orangephobia so that I may live in comfort. Until that day, trump 2020...🍊😌on a gravestone💕✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:37:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"Fnaf-fangirl","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177715690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I just don’t understand","review":"Trying to use this at numerous numerous numerous amounts of times I have run into problems every single time this app is beyond fixing I really cannot comprehend how someone can create an app so dysfunctional. All I would like to say is this I hope this app gets deleted because this is a disgrace to the Trump campaign. Not only is this app so so terrible I have no way to speak to a manager about these issues what am I expected to do without this privilege I obtain to speak to a manager? I hate to say it but Tik Tok may be a better app, and I would vote to keep Tik Tok as opposed to this trump 2020 app any day.","date":"2020-07-09T18:15:26Z","rating":1,"userName":"karenfortrump2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177084804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORSE APP EVER; BLEACHING MY EYES LATER","review":"so i downloaded the app on my NEW iphone 11 and it took a total of 11 days to download. it keeps clashing and saying “not able to download”. then once i tried to open the app it keep closing and shutting down and THE MOST SCARY ORANGE THING APPEARED ON MY SCREEN. i got scared and cracked my phone😐. then i closed the app and got a notification from my phone scanner app that i was getting hacked. the app told me i was getting hacked from the TRUMP APP. my photos? gone. my music? gone. my passwords? not working. my dignity? taken. this app was once on my phone and i can NEVER  get rid of that scar. rate it one star then delete the it ✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"itsjewelmay","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177031905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"app is trash!!!!","review":"i downloaded the app to stay informed on politics as i did with other candidates and their apps, but this app messed up my phone PERMANENTLY. it shuts off for hours at a time and my phone screen stays black. when i want to raise or lower the volume, the brightness on the screen changes?!?!? and every time i try to ACCESS this app my entire phone screen goes red and starts flashing and beeping? i took my phone to the apple store but they couldn't figure out what went wrong, only that this app has some type of virus? i now need to get a new phone. i will NOT be downloading this again.","date":"2020-07-09T14:53:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"skang1218","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177009525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just “meh”","review":"First off, developer should put all text in BLACK. Not any other light color that makes it harder to read. Also I refuse to enter my password another time. I was asked 4 consecutive times to change my password and it keeps asking for my information. This concerns me because I feel as though they are trying to steal my information. The worst is the freezing. When I finally do get on to the app it will work for a total of three minutes and then freeze and crash. You’d think for a big organization like this you could make a better app. Nope >(","date":"2020-07-09T14:47:13Z","rating":1,"userName":"🔥angry🔥","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176980808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app killed me","review":"I was at home one day minding my business right, then all of a sudden I heard a loud BANG. I got up and said, “no, no, no, no I ain’t dying today!” So I ran up into my room and locked the door. About 5 minutes later I heard foot steps coming up my stairs. At that point I was freaking out and even prayed to lord Jesus himself. I even texted my mom I loved her . Then the door flung up. BAM! It was a big, fat, racist, sexist, rapist with only one brain cell named Donald J. Trump. I was disgusted even maybe mortified! I couldn’t take looking at such ugliness. So I did what any other sane person would do and end it. 😞R.I.P to me -sorry for any grammar mistakes-","date":"2020-07-09T14:39:29Z","rating":1,"userName":"kennyunicorn","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176944148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app I’ve ever used!!!","review":"I cannot explain enough how HORRIBLE this app is. I don’t understand anything on this app.... it seems to me that only people who are very, very ugly would be able to use this app seriously because as someone who is very beautiful, I CANNOT use this app. I am *starting* to think that only hideously ugly people can download & use this app because it is filled with racist, sexist, pedophilic, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic and fascist content....... \n\nIf I could give this app 0 stars I WOULD. This app is DISCRIMINATORY against beautiful people who are absolutely allergic to its content like me and that should NOT be allowed!!!","date":"2020-07-09T14:29:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"GriffGrace","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176901472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I had high standards until this happened.....","review":"I was sitting in my living room bored out of my mind when I decided to look up ways to support my racist, homophobic,Rapist, etc. when I stumbled spin this app. I downloaded it and right away I hated it. It kept kicking me out of the app and it drained my battery so freaking much. 20% in just a couple minutes. I let it go thinking it’s just an error so I went back on it the other day and it totally crashed my phone. I had to go back to the Verizon store and buy a whole brand new phone and everything. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone.😡","date":"2020-07-09T14:18:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jacoblhoovef","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176869357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app gave me Lice","review":"Hey! Kaitlyn (poopy pants) Bennet here! I just wanted to say this app is so disappointing 😖 after I logged in it asked me if I have sh!!t my pants before or not. Not to mention this weird glitch where bugs started crawling out of the big orange a$$ed buffoons toupee and through the cracks in my phone and gave me a lice infestation 😫😫 \nI was really surprised when the app had Melanias po**n and nudes everywhere. Looks like they forgot to close some tabs 😳 but that’s ok I’m LGBT 🏳️\u200D🌈 😍 \nI tried contacting support at the local office and the manager gave me an abortion and then ate it in front of me 😭😭 it was awful. \nThis app is garbage!!! I demand it be removed now 😡🤚🏼","date":"2020-07-09T14:10:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kaitie Bennet 😻","isEdited":false}}]}
