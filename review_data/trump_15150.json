Glitched several times, and I was never able to place my orders. Not to mention, the items were extremely unfashionable. I would definitely recommend adding in some Nicki Minaj merchandise to draw in the young folks. Whoever’s running the app better step up their game. Not satisfied.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174613080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:11:51Z","title":"Ohhh no!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"-Gen Z🥰✨","review":"Hi, this your local Karen and I wanted to say THIS APP RUINED CHEETOS FOR ME.😡😡😡 i was walking down my pet sheep🐑🐑 while eating Cheetos when all of a sudden a CHEETO pooped out of my screen.

My daughter show it it to me while I was grilling hamberders. I thought wow this is really easy to use and I couldn’t believe I got personal messages from, him. But then he turned in to a walking cheeto with a toupee. He really wasn’t that good anymore. His tax cuts actually increased my taxes and I am a in middle class average Joe.

It’s all glitchy 👀 oh wait that’s just the world simulation glitching but also it has way to many ads 👀 oh wait that’s the stoopid commercials on T.V saying Trump 2020. The app does five useless information though 👀 because who cares about the rally’s & whatever else no one came to the last one. This is just all around horrible & stoopid & Orange 😂","rating":1}},{"id":"6174531147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:48:29Z","title":"Big Cheeto man horrible app not having it","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤞🏻","review":"I need to speak to A MANAGER IMMEDIATELY this app is horrendous no layout whatsoever no drip.

A BLM fist??? likeee you rlly tryna act like this man DIDNT say all lives matter??🤢🤢🤢🤢 kinda hypocritical Cheeto boy isn’t it? Anyways, someone should probably help him with his collar next time, maybe the cut in blood circulation to his head is aiding in the progression of that Alzheimer’s? Just a thought. It’s making him pretty delusional... like thinking he’s actually winning this election.🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6174502370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:40:26Z","title":"🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":".^{ Emily }^.","review":"This app is 🤮 I cant even bare to open it after reading that I could see tr*mp. Especially since someone said his nudes were on there. I would never recover. Even thinking of the thought makes me want to rip my eyes out. He’s also taking away one of the best platforms for us to speak freely, don’t think that’s very nice to say the least. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this app its just horrendous. Hope this helped!!!","rating":1}}]}
