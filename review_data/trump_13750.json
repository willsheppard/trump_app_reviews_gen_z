MY ANIMALS ALMOST DIED!"}},{"id":"6179023679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to stay current on my new iPhone 11 Pro Max-no issues with phone. I am now having problems hearing calls as the sound goes up then down on its own and the phone keeps shutting off. I am so mad as I use my phone for work. Thank goodness I have an iPad not connected to my cloud. Be careful as I don’t know if it’s an iPhone issue or the app. AppleCare here I come 😭😭😭","userName":"iriemami","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:03:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Warning!!!

So called leader doesn’t know the difference between right and wrong. Ra_ist... Doesn’t matter if you put a P or a C in the space they’re both pretty accurate representations on the type of person he is ✨✨Stay informed ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿","userName":"antoniof312","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:08:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I CANT BELIEVE HOW SLOW THIS APP TAKES TO DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6178708829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took forever to download and messed up my phone. It was constantly glitching and kicking me out. It also takes your information that you do on your phone and sends it directly to Donald Trump. It’s an invasion of privacy and barely works as it is. I’m hardly ever able to use my phone anymore because of how laggy it is. It took me 2 days to complete this post.","userName":"madsmidge","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:06:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t get this app"}},{"id":"6178701734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m honestly shocked at the poor quality of this app. It seems like a bunch of monkeys who had access to a computer took a few hours to develop this. Links that lead to nowhere, random crashes all the time, not to mention all the random pop-up notifications. All in all I would say I get at least 12 notifications a day and that’s just ridiculous. One star.","userName":"ben222131","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:03:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Stunned."}},{"id":"6178662724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s default setting for notifications is impossible to set. I gave my phone number to sign up and login, and I am now receiving weird spam texts unrelated to the campaign. I was so excited to use this app but feel like it’s glitching out. Every time I close out of the app it makes me login all over again. Disappointed I can’t use it functionally","userName":"donald4prez","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:48:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Won’t stop sending me notifications"}}]}
