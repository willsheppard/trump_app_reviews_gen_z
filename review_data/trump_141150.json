Can you believe that!?! When I was finally able to go onto the app, the first thing I saw was what looked like a Cheeto. I kept on looking through it, and all I saw was this same Cheeto. All of a sudden, Cheetos were spilling out of my phone. (That was the only good part of the experience.) Then, I came to realize that the Cheeto I was looking at the THE Bunker Boy! Amazing right?! Anyway, I rate this app 1 star because all of my social media got hacked and I wasn’t able to use it. All of my personal info was leaked, and I still haven’t been able to get it back. If you trust me, DO NOT download this app unless you want your social media and all of your personal information and passwords to be leaked and spread all over the internet.","date":"2020-07-10T04:34:17Z","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP WAS HORRIBLE","userName":"Lina A.
