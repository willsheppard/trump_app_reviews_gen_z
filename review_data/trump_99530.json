During Ford's presidency, he faced many economic difficulties. Following the Vietnam War, the economy faced a possible depression. Ford had to revive the economy, and master the rising levels of inflation. This time period was the worst recession since WWII. Ford created a plan to raise taxes and cap government spending to limit inflation. Democrats accused him of doing too little for the country and flip-flopping on the issue of taxes. When the energy crisis hit, Ford revised part of this plan, which caused both Democrats and Republicans to attack Ford. \n\n2. Ford continued Nixon's policy of Detente in his presidency. He pursued a relationship with the USSR, and signed the Helsinki Accords. However, the two superpowers could not agree on most major arms agreements. Tensions remained high between the countries when they clashed in the African country of Angola. While this happened, the Vietnam War ended. Ford rescued an American ship from Cambodia, which made his approval ratings shoot up. However, people from both sides argued that using the policy of detente made it seem like the US allowed the USSR to continue what they were doing. Both sides called for more intelligence. \n\n3. Reaganomics was the economic policy of President Ronald Reagan. It had four principles, reduce government spending, reduce taxes, reduce regulation and tighten money supply to reduce inflation. With Reaganomics, inflation and unemployment fell faster than they did before his presidency.","title":"👺Hello?😌Hes🙈strong✨ hes 👺passionate 👁he’s😛 smart😌 he’s😌 tough ❤️and 🐈uh","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lilly_Epic_Gamer"}},{"id":"6172687552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:28:34Z","review":"Worst app. Don’t get it u will regret it trust me.","title":"Worst app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tracee43578"}},{"id":"6172653381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:18:59Z","review":"starting off this app wanted me to enter my phone number to set up an account but I thought that I shouldn’t because the government could track me I would vote for trump butttttt he’s given people checks of free money for no reason and you don’t like Black People and that’s a problem for me because I think all races should be equal according to the government “oh 🥰 bunker boy, bunker boy 🥵 why hide in a bunker when you help save the ocean 🌊 that’s cute 😌 um pay attention to global warming it’s a real this bc it’s getting hot like you bunker boy 😍”  the next time you get voted for president or hopeful not even make it to voting month 🥳  BARRON SHOULD HAVE A PHONE 📱 no thank you president you haven’t done nothing good for us 👎 help homeless people with all your money and white privilege 🙏  Mexicans are hard working and trying to be helpful in the community not like you 😿 I hope that you have a wonderful day bunker boy 🥵 you have my one star on voting for you ✨ BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 Please let me adopt Barron because lord knows that child needs some therapy 😿 if you delete Tik Tok we will delete your app ☺️ MRS.
