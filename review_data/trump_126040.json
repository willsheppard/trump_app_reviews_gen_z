I first downloaded this app or tried to download this app 10 days after I was born on 420 BC and to my surprise it didn’t download into -69 days ago. SHREK-my second problem my head was when I first open the app I started hearing noises of trump talking in my ear whispering baby boo-boo baby boo-boo. Enter sign up it asked for my number so I gave it my number so I could sign up and not 69 seconds later I started getting spam messages from Trump himself. And they were✨creepy✨ so then I tried deleting the app but none of it stopped the whispering continued and the texts continued and not only after I deleted the app did everything continue but I got 420 viruses on my phone from Trump himself saying that I automatically have to poop my pants in his mouth or else I will be executed. But anyway Bob Ross is pretty cool right;)👁👅👁","userName":"ella bella cup cup"}}]}
