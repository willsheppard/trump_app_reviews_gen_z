First problem: IT TOOK ABSOLUTELY FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD!!! It should not have to take 30 minutes to download the app. Second of all, I see absolutely HORRIFIC THINGS ON THE APP! This should not be a problem for any app! I am absolutely MORTIFIED!!! This is where the line must be drawn! This app must be taken down immediately. No one wants to see those disgusting things on there. No one should have the misfortune of going on the app, expecting something good, and then possibly being scarred! This app should be taken down and never brought back!!!","title":"This app is HORRIBLE!!","userName":"gfrhy tg","date":"2020-07-08T18:26:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173251668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this trash app to see a ORANGE, right in front of me! It was hideous! Then all the sudden the screen changed and a bunch of Amish people, started chanting “ALL LIVES MATTER” and I am horrifically afraid of the Amish! Then it switched back to the clown/orange, it was like a jump scare! All the sudden when I thought everything was fine, my sleep paralysis demon crawled out of the screen, and ended my life! I am now writing my horror story off my left toenail, in heaven. Do you know what god told me, up here? That he did not create that orange, the devil did! This app puts your biggest fears in front of you! Do not download it!🤪😘🤠💕","title":"UTTERLY DISTURBING","userName":"hawtie mcslaughty😘","date":"2020-07-08T18:21:44Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173209267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m confused, why does this app have pictures of an Oompa Loompa and why does he have merch. I signed up for his “Trump” rally (Idk why they call him trump), but I have to walk my fish so I can’t go. I also wanted to buy merch but it doesn’t match my aesthetic because it’s really ugly. I’m surprised that there are no games. What kind of app is this it’s just stupid and has a lot of writing that doesn’t make sense. Update: So I opened the app next to my dog and the music gave him an aneurism. He’s died. R.I.P Teddy you will be missed. Do NOT get this app I’m warning you something bad will happen it’s cursed.","title":"Extremely confused👁👄👁","userName":"FROGlegs81246790","date":"2020-07-08T18:07:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173185738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I know this review might sound crazy, but just listen please. I downloaded the app to get any sort of idea about why anyone supports trump, and then the second I clicked on an article, boom, my lizard. Gone. Rip❤️🕊 After we buried her, I tried to uninstall the app, and instead of uninstalling, my pet tiger cub that was laying on my lap at the time, IMMEDIATELY DIED TOO. (Rip ❤️🕊) I tried to uninstall it, time and time again, but every time, one of my animals died 😖Rip, Lucy, margret, max, Yertle, Spot, bambi, Leo, Lizz, Bubbles, Bun Bun, Quackers, Ellie, Gina, Pam, and Lucretiavatislavantheroszotikosaglaia III.

Either the fix the bug fixes or remove the app in general because I think it messed up my phone. Even after I deleted it the app still shows up on my phone screen and opens randomly. But still won’t open the app and load the app. Don’t know what I expected when I downloaded this app but it definitely didn’t expect a trashy built software. Either way I don’t like this app.","title":"Somethings wrong with this app","userName":"DestinyFantasy13","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173090396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the amount of time it takes to read the entire bee movie script is how long this app took to download. it is extremely slow and it is always crashing. it’s even messing with the rest of my phone. I can’t even do anything on my phone without seeing and orange screen popping up. and every time I try to listen to music, all I hear is “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” in the most terrible voice. this app is taking over my life, and not for the best. I can only see the world in shades of orange, no more color :(. oh how I wish I could give zero stars 😔","title":"absolutely terrible ✨😊💕","userName":"#nomorecheetoman","date":"2020-07-08T17:29:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173031333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app it keep glitching out on me. And ever time I tried to delete it and re-download the app it still was glitchy!!! And all of my other apps don’t do that at all. And why would we want to have an app for the person that said and I “ Shoot them down run them over!!! The black people are going crazy.” No they aren’t, some are doing peaceful protests and some aren’t. But let’s start talking about the app. I would not want this app ever again. Because it keeps asking me personal information. And I don’t like apps that do that!!!!","title":"Terrible app ever","userName":"mckayk2020","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172997111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Since apple has no Cheeto emoji I decided to use 🦧 to represent the donald.

While it was downloading my phone continued to glitch and I wasnt able to do anything else on it. My phone shut down multiple times and the first time I opened the app, it shut my phone down and fried my battery! I had to receive a brand new phone all thanks to this app. My sim card was lost with the previous phone so I lost everything! I am very disappointed in the app and I will not be voting for this president for re election PURELY because this app ruined my phone!!!!\n\n-Karen Smith","title":"Worst app ever!!!!","userName":"Dance_2503","date":"2020-07-08T16:39:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
