Who in their right mind would rip off the Cheetos Cheetah and steal his trademark?! Get some original content. Sorry I forgot that stealing what doesn’t belong to you is what you do best. Hopefully this app doesn’t crash and burn like every other business you’ve tried to run. Actually I take that back, I hope it does :)","rating":1,"title":"do not download this trash app","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:01Z","userName":"rivera3","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174381045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Voiceover: Shrek\nOnce upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

To be honest, the last thing i expected when downloading this app to support our cheeto puff of a president, was to see him in his mirror, and the unpleasant view of a single ball. 😤 i’m sorry for trying to support our rapist president. there’s absolutely nothing else to say except for protect your children people. nudity will not be tolerated. periodt 👁👄👁\n-Melissa","rating":1,"title":"I’m Mortified","date":"2020-07-09T00:32:42Z","userName":"Karens my idol","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174281692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see when more rallies were and to open up my view on politics. I didn’t even get to do that because the app made my phone freeze for a very long time and also started to drain my battery! I am very disappointed but not suprised at the poor production of this app. it is not good, also takes a very very long time to download","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE!

Was a horrible experience and I don’t recommend at all.","rating":1,"title":"Traumatized me😔","date":"2020-07-09T00:30:01Z","userName":"bunker boi✨🦕🦖🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174274845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Seriously, I wanted to like this app. My deep need for another place to heap my adoration on Our Glorious Leader was threatening to boil over, when, like a Cheeto colored ray of sunshine through the clouds, I found this app! But lo, were my expectations trodden underfoot as I began to use it! This app is not worthy of the association with such a glorious, stable, honest, and hard working patriot as the one and only Donald Trump. Take down this app, and make Mexico pay for it!!!","rating":1,"title":"Glitchy, dog!","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:10Z","userName":"VacationDad","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174254561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is a no no. I was literally watching yt and out of no where I got brought to this app and it was an orange tanning itself like I didn’t know an orange can do that??? Then it was just more clips of an orange and there was some rated r stuff in there that I didn’t know oranges can do. It was crazy. Then the orange was in Atlanta with his supposed orange sister and it was crazy in Atlanta. Then I thought the orange was watching me. This app is creepy and weird.","rating":1,"title":"Nope🙅🏽\u200D♀️👎🏼","date":"2020-07-09T00:22:03Z","userName":"cottonswab_s","isEdited":false}}]}
