A few days ago I downloaded the app,while it took forever to install an hour had past and  I decided  to run out and check the mail, as I opened my front door to my apartment there were two enormous men blocking by exit.. I woke up in a dark enclosed space, I could barely make out the low murmur that constantly repeated itself  “ Yo,Yo” , hearing that gave me a brief sigh of relief for I knew there was a dude from the hood in their with me and with that there’s a chance for survival.. I wanna tell you more but I know I’m being watched  @GODBOD7   I’ll post the rest of the story on @TikTok  before it’s gone","title":"I didn’t expect that","userName":"GODBOD7","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:27:06Z"}},{"id":"6175714538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"G A R B A GE F U C K T H I S AP P","title":"THE WORSE","userName":"ImaBeatUpTrumpOneDay","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:26:44Z"}},{"id":"6175714483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app took all the space on my phone, had many WALL blockings. Expected more, not more space being taken up. So unprofessional, hacked all my accounts and set my ringtone to the national anthem, it linked all the house phones to my phone. It took over my Spotify and YouTube and kept playing Alexander Hamilton which did slap but after a few hours got annoying. Turned my lock screen into a Cheeto puff and set my wallpaper as the White House. I kept seeing the mercy pop up and added to my cart without me adding there. Had a button that said call ice immediately. The worst app ever! Do not download it will take up all your storage, I have 256g and only used up 10 g since I’ve had it , but once I got the add I had 0 left. Glitches the phone too much. They kidnapped my dog since I brought him from Mexico and told him to go back to his country, it was a bit extreme, yet they were talking to him in English thank god his feelings didn’t get hurt tho bc he only knows Spanish. Don’t know how they find out he was from mex if we kept him off the grid since December!","title":"Set my ringtone to the national anthem","userName":"joeeeee mamas","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:26:43Z"}},{"id":"6175712327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"HORRIBLE APP! as a part of the white Karen community who doesn’t stand the blm movement and is deeply in love with our president I cannot stan this app it made me start searching bbc on pornhub 😡😡","title":"Kanye 4 president ✨🧚❤️","userName":"andrea rosas ✨❤️🥰🧚","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:26:00Z"}},{"id":"6175710313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Took me about 2 months to download only for it to ask me for my phone number now I now I’m kinda hot but like I’m not into other men I’m about as straight as a line anyways this app is useless","title":"app=Donkey poop","userName":"john quincy adams the2nd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:25:17Z"}},{"id":"6175710209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"F this app","title":"Dgjdjbdgdgd","userName":"fvjjbdhdndj","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:25:15Z"}},{"id":"6175707480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible app. -100000000/10 do not recommend 😗✌🏽✨my ducks were not satisfied with this app.","title":"Yous a whole clown bro 🤡","userName":"Scraton Strangler","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:18Z"}},{"id":"6175706733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app thinking it would help bring my nation together. but boy was i wrong. as soon as i did i noticed i was being followed. Nay hunted. i could feel them. watching me. chasing me down. i was the gazelle and they were preying lion. once i left my local walmart i was cornered by two middle aged white men with small hands that told me to get in their 1997 chevy trucks or else. i complied out of fear that they might cough on me since they had no mask on. i asked why and they cried with refusal. literally. these dudes cried like little girls who hadn’t got their nightly ice cream scoop with sprinkles. anyways, i got in and they covered my face with a black sac. i thought it ironic because they refused to wear masks like the snowflakes they are but they forced me to wear one. are they, dumb? stupid? perhaps dumb? idk. they took me to what i though was a giant cheese ball they swore allegiance too and worshipped. again, literally. they bowed down and kissed this thing. they prayed to it like mother teresa to the pope. but this deity was far worse. you could smell the cheeto dust aura it had. it smacked you in the face. the false god spoke. it asked me why i, a big brown boy, had downloaded this app. i said i wanted to help bring the world together. it was at this moment i realized what. nay. who this imposter was. he realized i realized the realization of who he really was and vanished in a cloud of cheesy goodness. like a queso style vanishing jutsu. it was really just a smoke screen and i saw him run away naked in a rush with his butt cheeks following 17.26 seconds behind him. i counted. i couldn’t help it. it was almost mesmerizing. but in the most souls destroying wag possible. after. the two men from before dropped me off at the walmart i was at before too. i deleted the app right after and that’s why you shouldn’t download this.","title":"What the beep.","userName":"@call_me_oso_","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:04Z"}},{"id":"6175706294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","title":"Horrendous.","userName":"✨Donald duck could do better✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:23:56Z"}}]}
