Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.

He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2.

And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

Once I opened it, it said all my data has been sent to trump so he could sell it? It also said if I wanted it back I would have to pay a 500 dollar fee! Then I went to my house and was being watched by something called the secret service? This scared me a lot then once I picked up my friend there were 6 dancing rats telling me to vote trump this freaked us out so we ran them we saw this huge fat Cheeto that was wearing a tuxedo I don’t remember his name but it starts with a D I think something like Donald? Idk sounds like Donald Duck but it wasn’t! He was so ugly my friend started crying this hurt me and her started yelling “vote trump 2020” I refused! I’m not even old enough to vote! If I could vote I would choose Obama sigh. Too bad he can’t be president again! :( then once I got home my whole family was gone and there was a note telling me “vote trump 2020 and you will get them back” I started to cry and when I tried to go back on my phone and it said trump was watching all of his racist ass minions? Then he hacked my tiktok account @waste0fcumm please don’t even download this app about this Cheeto looking dude I really thought it was a fun game please leave a 1 star review so I can get justice 🙄❤️🦶","title":"🙄🦶🦵 follow @waste0fcumm on tiktok |"}},{"id":"6176870365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:10:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"RayRay10161","review":"This app keeps closing out randomly and I can’t do anything with the app. Not that I would want to do anything with the app anyways bc I don’t support racism, sexism, pedophilia, white supremacy, and many more of those ideologies.
