Took 13 years (on the dot) to download and then it immediately crashed when I opened it, but it gets worse! As soon as it crashed my lights started flickering and a gate to the underworld appeared. At first I wasn’t going to go through but the app told me to and like all good republicans I blindly bend to the will of our amazing president 😎.  As soon as I entered I was greeted by a demon that coincidentally looked exactly like Trump, only to realize they all do. They started to do the Macarena and I was blinded by the color, boomer orange, bc I am allergic. I passed out but when I woke up I was in the dungeon section of the underworld. As I walked down it all I could find were them snowflake radicals trying to make crazy accusations about our president sent by god! At one point I walked by this black man who said he was killed by a police officer while walking down the street peacefully. I refuse to believe our beautiful, glorious, lovely president would let this happen, also I don’t believe it was anyone’s fault but his own! (No I don’t have proof, yes I’m making wild accusations!) there was another section labeled “corona” filled with ppl who died from COVID. A lot of them claimed that their death has something to do with trump not doing anything to end the problem and lower the curve but that is obviously false, it was the masks that killed them. At the end of the hallway was a door back to my house. It was kind of a crazy experience but I didn’t learn a single thing from it. ALL HAIL TRUMP ✋🏻!!"}},{"id":"6173567112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:08:54Z","userName":"n_roselive","isEdited":false,"title":"Doesn’t even deserve the star","review":"Discrace"}},{"id":"6173555321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:56Z","userName":"itss_noelia","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible 🤮🤢","review":"Let me start off by saying the open does NOT OPEN.
