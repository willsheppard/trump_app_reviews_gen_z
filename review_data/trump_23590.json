It kept crashing, it would log me out, I got kicked off the app right as I got on, and overall it’s just a horrible app. The orange dude on the app is weird too.

White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:22:55Z","userName":"dannymemeslut","title":"Donald Trump is a White Supremacist"}},{"id":"6176905035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app does not work. The minute I opened it, it started crashing. Once I FINALLY got it working, if the app was running in the background while I was on any other app, it would crash those as well.
