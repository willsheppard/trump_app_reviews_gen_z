DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-09T11:59:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176023335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The Pro Reviewer ✨🥰 Thanks!","isEdited":false,"title":"🤡 Too many Clown Pictures 🤡","review":"This app felt like it was designed in the early 1900s and the quality is extremely horrible. There were too many photos of No. 45 and I MUST TELL YOU- VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED before you look at the clown. The photos and information in this app may be disturbing to many individuals. Such horrid things cannot exist on the App Store.\n\nAlso When I opened the app up, I was greeted with a fat and quite portly, morbidly obese looking Cheeto. He was quite orange except around the eyes 💀🥴. Then as I continued to explore the app, I found horrid photos of a fat and ugly man. I could smell the ugliness and disgustingness through the phone 🤢💀. Do not download you will suffer from severe trauma.","date":"2020-07-09T10:09:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175924201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emmy 💰","isEdited":false,"title":"absolutely DISGUSTANG","review":"I HATE this app with a BURNING PASSION!!!! After I downloaded it, my phone started glitching like there was a (corona) virus on it!!! It took all of my privACY AND MADE MY FISH DIE😭😭😭💔💔💔💔 if this app stays up I will continue to complain and complain. it deleted all my pictures of The Great Barack Obama😭😭😵 my phone and life would be better if I never downLOADED THIS APP!!!! TERRIBLENEOSJWPRJEK DO NOT GET IT I REPEAT DONT GET IT. It charged fees to my credit card without me knowing. If it was possible I’d give it a -5 stars. but anyways why would they let a racist, pedo, sexist, misogynistic, white supremacist have an app any way?? I guess any straight rich white male can do anything even if they’re a piece of garbage😳. #OBAMA2020 #dumpytrump","date":"2020-07-09T09:37:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175727381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"☕️😇😌","isEdited":false,"title":"WASTE OF TIME and threatening to wellbeing","review":"In the utmost patriotic spirit, I downloaded the app to support the president only to be severely disappointed with the quality of the app itself. That is to start off. \nWhat proceeded after the download (which took more than 48 hrs tf!!), was a series of racist displays that arose in my recommended and ads. First, I could not find any Chinese food recommendations, nor Mexican restaurants near me. \nEven worse to follow was the inexplicable urge to *lean* and keep leaning forward so much so that it’d look like I was doing michael Jackson’s move, y’all know which one. \nOn top of that, I find myself building walls, more than my usual emotional barriers 😢\nIn my backyard and even in my work spaces! \nConcerning in the app as well are the articles all so willing to pinpoint and shift blame and inconsistencies to other candidates but I spy an overwhelming lack of accountability and questioning to the president himself 😤🤨\nAlso THE APP ITSELF SUGGESTS IN THE ENGAGE SECTION TO FIGHT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP! \nI only wanted to offer my support as a proud American.","date":"2020-07-09T08:31:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175714642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yvgdykvhdrsuhirhict","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed 😡","review":"I downloaded this app to help me keep up to date with the orange world. But ever since I’ve downloaded this app I have a man staring at me in the corner of my room. IT WONT GO AWAY. I’ve deleted the to see if that was the problem. He only went away for a few seconds and then when I opened up my phone he’s there again. I need my beauty sleep but I can’t get it if someone is staring at me. But now to think of it the man in the corner kinda looks cute. I haven’t talked to a man in a long time. How do I shoot my shot?!?! *five hours later* Sorry I forgot to finish this review, I was busy getting 🧠👅 by the man in the corner. But this app was the worse. DON’T RECOMMEND!!","date":"2020-07-09T08:26:47Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175695964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"treeetrunks","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","review":"Don’t even waste your time downloading it. It was sUPER laggy and it kept asking for my credit card information???? So I was like weird right? Then a notification popped up saying that it requires to know exactly where I live? Like isn’t that a breach of privacy? Whatever. So I continued on the app and noticed that I got a welcome message. I was thinking how sweet right? Wrong they threatened to kill my family if I don’t vote for trump in the upcoming election and I don’t know what to do 😭they said for safety measure they’d also kill my pets!? Like I can’t live without my family and my pets!? How do you expect me to live? Please PLEASE don’t download this app for your own safety.","date":"2020-07-09T08:20:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175694767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jarrett s","isEdited":false,"title":"Tiktok is the best app","review":"Trump, I don’t get why your banning Tiktok for the US. If you get the app you’ll understand why people are so mad at you for banning Tiktok. People are having fun while they can. Let the kids live there life. There are so much creators on that app that have worked so hard for millions of followers! Such as Charli damilo, Chase Hudson,Bryce Hall, etc. imagine you being addicted to a app and the president just decided to ban it think about what your doing to other kids! Especially during this pandemic kids are bored out of there minds Tiktok is really entertaining to be on u can make your own content. Now pls don’t ban it. Hope you make the right decision! Witch is DONT ban Tiktok!","date":"2020-07-09T08:20:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175221830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BLACK LIVES MATTER!!✊🏾","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","review":"I was taking a nap next to my fridge when all of a sudden my cat yelled at me to feed her. I obviously didn’t listen so she threatened me. So then i fed her. After this my oven was on fire so i had to take it to the pool. My couch was pretty jealous though so i had to look out for traps she placed. I was minding my own business abt then BOOM. right the the app just came right out of my phone and started to threaten me. I was scared for my life. As i ran down stairs to grad a knife i realized that i could delete it. So when it came downstairs I pressed a held the app and the selected “delete”. This app still gives me night mares to this day.

This app should be taken down. I much as well delete it if no one else does! This app also shows pornographic pictures of kids! That is awful! As I repeat, please take down this app it shouldn’t be no longer in use. Also this app asked me for my social security number! That is very disrespectful. They could’ve found out my IP address with that! This app can be very dangerous for kids and for adults themselves as well. For the last and final time, pleas shut down this app apple. Please and thank you. For our sake please. This isn’t safe.","date":"2020-07-09T04:49:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174984668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Pixieroyalunicorn","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitchy App","review":"Before I got the app, my phone was doing fine, wasn’t really glitchy, but once I got it, my phone became glitchy. I figured it was just of how many apps i have on my phone. So i deleted my unwanted ones and ones i never use. Yet it was still so very glitchy. I sent hours trying to figure out what was causing it. I turned my phone all the way off and on again. Nothing. I restarted it, like the hard reset. Didnt work. Then i thought, i’ll delete the last app i put into my phone. Once i deleted this app, my phone was fine, i was like woah okay fixed the problem. This app was the problem. I wouldn’t recommend..","date":"2020-07-09T04:02:44Z","rating":1}}]}
