However, that all changed when I downloaded this app. \n\nI was at home on a cold and rainy Tuesday when there was a knock on my door. I set my tea down, and opened the door, to my surprise the first thing that happened was I punched by a man wearing a black suit. He said this was official business and he needed to “throw me off my rhythm”. \n\nThe next thing I know the annoying orange himself walked in. He was mad. Yelling, breaking things, although the bouquet of flowers in his hand (despite all the flowers having flown off) stayed in place. I was of course very intrigued so I asked him and that’s when things got weird. \n\nWe sat on my couch and he told me that he had a date tonight but it didn’t go as planned. I tried being a patriotic American and I let him cry against my shoulders while telling him it would be okay. Then, Mikewasowski walks in, white hair flowing in the wind, and a troubled look upon his face. He noticed me on the couch with the annoying orange and threw me across the room, I was so shocked I almost missed him telling the annoying orange that he is madly in love with him and he’s sorry he ruined the date. \n\nMikewasowski and the Annoying Orange then kiss on my couch!!!!!!!! I was so shocked, and my cat is very homophobic (even though i’m a lesbian seeing this was just too shocking) he had a heart attack right there. However I was unable to leave and was forced to watch my cat die while the annoying orange and mikewasowski fondled each other in my living room!!!","date":"2020-07-09T11:11:43Z"}},{"id":"6176199343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@roblox11229","title":"Trash","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Absolute trash✨","date":"2020-07-09T11:05:16Z"}}]}
