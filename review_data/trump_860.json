The layout was UGLY along with the dude on the front, it made my stomach really upset so if you have a weak stomach i would not recommend i had to take 28 shots of Pepto just to settle it a little bit. And on top of being EXTREMELY stinking and ugly.

When i refreshed the app ONE more time, i opened it up to obama’s face on the wall. i put my phone in rice. all i wanted was to see the updates from my president because we don’t get the news channels on our tv receiver. After an hour or two i opened up the app again. it immediately started saying mean, uncalled for names to me. i was offended. i started clicking around and trump ate my finger. i then shut my phone off and got an ice cream. all thanks to the app, my ice cream was ice cold. i put it in the freezer for it to warm up. all thanks to the app, i found my phone held hostage in the freezer. all i wanted to do was respect my lovely president!

I did put in my phone number and agree to receive messages and calls but the messages were hard to understand, almost like they were written by someone with the mental age of a 1st grader, but i assumed that maybe Mr. Trump had pre-written them himself so i brushed it off. but then when i would answer their calls it wasn’t just automated voice messages like i thought they were going to be, but just a soft cry. i asked multiple times if the person was okay but was only met with louder sobs. please check on the people running the phone calls. the app itself is also very glitchy and hard to understand. i can’t believe something like this is allowed to be on the app store, it’s a DISGRACE to all apps :(","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"A fellow Panic! fan"}},{"id":"6174583932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"it’s a no from me 😾👎🏼","review":"this app stained my laundry! i was using it to gain information about the election and senpai trumps presidency, but all it did was break my laundry machine! i’m going to be handwashing from now on. this was a complete and utter scam! 100% do not get this app it only causes problems and it’s completely useless. just like me. Sometimes I don't wanna be happy Don't hold it against me If I'm down just leave me there Let me be sad Sun's up, I already wanna lay down Friends calling, are you really tryna go out? Don't wanna get dressed up to pretend (no) I can lie and say I'm fine Maybe you'll stop calling then I've got chips on my shoulder Only getting older So I keep to myself Ain't tryna complain Just don't wanna explain it But sometimes I don't wanna be happy Don't hold it against me If I'm down just leave me there Let me be sad Sometimes I just wanna be lonely Don't need you to hold me If I'm low you don't need to care Let me be sad What's the matter with that?

You’re immediately greeted with a balding, orange-tinted man, getting a spray tan, NAKED! It looked like the end of a croissant! I haven’t been able to erase that horrific image from my mind and I wish more than anything I could unsee it. Not long after it resulted in me constantly vomiting at what I had just seen. I am emotionally and physically traumatized now. Not to mention this walking cheeto runs our country, yet allows the youths to be exposed to such horrid things. This app shouldn’t exist and frankly it is a waste of space. Not to mention it gave my phone an insane virus, and my phone is currently glitching in and out every 5 seconds along with spam calls, texts, and scam ads. Very low hopes going into this and the bar was only lowered. I’d rate it 0 stars if I could. Save yourself sometime and emotional pain and DONT download this app. No one should have to go through this experience. Trust me if you download this app you’ll immediately regret it.","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"Anonymous Review Sender"}},{"id":"6174504971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"🚽😹⚠️VERY SCARY SCAM⚠️😹🚽","review":"this app is a scam. i was looking for a hairstyle, and immediately thought of this app once i remembered trump’s iconic troll hair. i then downloaded this app to get some inspiration of good hairstyles that i could show my barber a picture of. I finally found the perfect troll cut photo to show my barber, and i just got a fresh cut this morning just like my twin/papi trump. once i got home from the barber shop i checked my lucky trump 2020 app to see how much robux i had saved up in the app. i had just enough to purchase a can of cheeto spray tan. i thought this was the perfect thing to complete my look to look just like my idol trump!! i also payed for very fast shipping with my order, since i had some extra robux to spend. my cheeto spray tan can was supposed to arrive 4 HOURS AGO but it still has not arrived!! this app is not promising at all and an ABSOLUTE SCAM!! i want my robux back so i can actually spend it on something useful and buy a hello kitty toilet seat cover and plunger. 😹🧻👁👅👁🧻😹","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"Tree-Stump Tumbleweed"}},{"id":"6174475250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Whoever made this was smoking the devils lettuce","review":"This app was so confusing. First I hit download and that worked but it was about the last thing that did. I couldnt find a way to open it without looking at a picture of the ugliest man I’ve ever seen. I asked my hasband if he could figure it out and he couldn’t, so I asked my grandson and not even he could, that is pretty crazy if you knew my grandson because he is always on his phone. He knows more than anyone ive ever met about apps and more than I honestly think is good for him. If I were his mother I would take away his phone sometimes so he could go outside and see the real world, but I’m not his mother. I don’t get a say in who my son marries. That’s a mother’s lot in life. We grin and bear it and watch them screw up our grand kids. For all I know he’s smoking pot now and his mother is doing nothing about it. And what good is the addiction to the internet if he can’t even open the app without showing me these ugly pictures? One star.","date":"2020-07-09T01:32:51Z","rating":1,"userName":"gradmas goods"}}]}
