A few days after, my phone began to get rid off all the other fruit in my emoji selection and a small wall was built across my screen separating the orange emoji from the other fruit. i dismissed the fact of that but then i saw that all the lgbt+ flags were no where to be seen on my phone typing board. a few seconds later my phone began to smile up and so i threw it out the window. now my phone is gone because of the app and the big fat orange that destroyed my apps and all the rights for other fruits.","title":"worst app i’ve ever payed eyes on","rating":1,"userName":"ellibellyjelly"}},{"id":"6173789681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:29:13Z","review":"This is the worst app ever!!!! I had installed this app a couple days ago. And when I had downloaded it asked me would I like to get notifications and I clicked no because I hate notifications and all of a sudden my phone starts blowing up with notifications from this app. It then started to glitch my phone, as soon as I clicked a button in the app it redirected me to a fishy website. And so I had to started looking on website it redirected me to, and come to find out the website was porn. And I was connected to the house speaker (I live with my grandmother ). So my grandmother ended up having a heart attack in her sleep and almost died. Even when I was out of the app it made my phone glitch really bad. So in conclusion don’t download this app.","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!

Then after finally installing it wouldn’t work and continued to glitch out my phone. It played horrible noises and ringing at one point that made my ears bleed as it wouldn’t stop. I lost so much data on so many apps due to this one. I can’t believe I even considered downloading this app and I fully and completely regret any decisions I’ve made in my life to lead to this moment of regret. I do not know what horrible thing I could’ve done to deserve this but I recommend that nobody downloads this app unless they want to regret their entire life and the choices they’ve made.","title":"Made me regret all of my life decisions","rating":1,"userName":"Paige smth"}},{"id":"6173626480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:49Z","review":"This app was horrible it kept glitching on me and hacked into my phone 😔 It also took hours to download and while it was downloading it sort of froze my whole phone and I couldn’t use it until it was finished. I was just trying to educate myself on The Orange President 🍊but it kept kicking me out!! And I’m not the only one I saw multiple reviews saying the same thing. I mean he’s taken lgbtq+ rights away and not to mention said that Mexicans are drug dealers, rapist, criminals, and are taking other people’s jobs and called the blm movement a cult. I mean he’s done a terrible job with this whole pandemic 🥰 I don’t know why they don’t support him, I mean Idk what to hate more about him! He’s just a orange who’s racist and a rapist as well as homophobic. He truly fight for justice ✨😝 \n\n(Please note the sarcasm)","title":"No❤️","rating":1,"userName":"fjjhfgkk"}},{"id":"6173611425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:24:27Z","review":"I downloaded this app hoping that i would be able to see news about the election, but I was only met with pictures of trump and they are really ugly. The app then proceeded to break my phone and I had to pay one million dollars to get it fixed but I used trumps credit card to fix it so it’s okay now. Then the app made a noise that called upon the murder hornets and they flew into my house and killed my family. They didn’t kill me but then the app called upon trump himself and his ugly orange self burst into the room like the kool aid man. He then stabbed me while proceeding to say white power. Then Melania walked in and I tried to save her but she threw me while saying hello. Then he left and continued to be ignorant about the thousands of people that died because he was too busy golfing.

The app made me phone go crazy and glitch all over the place. Would never recommend this app to anyone. They also played some weird music that started attracting bugs and i’m allergic! IS TRUMP TRYING TO KILL ME WITH THIS MUSIC??!! Just trust me and never get the app, not even worth the time trying to download it. It needs to be taken down immediately!! If this doesn’t stop Trump is going to hurt even more people than he already has. Also, idk where people are getting their information from but it’s definately not correct, Trump is a racist, rapist, and so much more but definately not a good person. He is CANCELLED! and that’s on what?

Also if u download the app heads up your gonna lose a few brain cells and get false information given to you it’s all copy and pasted from the worst website known as Wikipedia which many can edit and well put whatever they want in it so it’s false information and in school you were taught not to use Wikipedia because everything they say can lead to false information. If you download the app just pray for yourself before downloading because you’ll become brainwashed and used for props (have a nice day:) )","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1,"userName":"clumsy_walz"}}]}
