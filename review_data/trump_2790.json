I also started seeing weird ads pop up with information on how to be homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, sexist, racist, how to become a cheeto?, and how to have corn hair?  I was really scared and didn’t know what to do except to restart my phone and even when I did that my wallpaper changed to a picture of the american flag and all my apps were deleted and replaced with only the trump app.  Felt like someone was hacking me so I looked through my camera and talked to my government agent and he said that it was in fact because of the app.  Very mad about this!! Disappointed!! Deleting immediately! 😤😤😡"}},{"id":"6177608496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:31Z","userName":"horrifed","rating":1,"title":"I almost passed out","review":"I almost passed out when I saw some ompa lompa Cheetoh \nI got so scared I threw my phone outside then it got even worse it took all my data and wanted me to vote for an ompa lompa I could hardly breathe the hair looks like a yellow pee color bird nest \nIt was just to much I could not handle his skin looked like soggy chicken wing sauce it was just so horrible I am now traumatized for life I can not even sleep eat for even use the bathroom it is just so horrible and he also wants to take tiktok he is if an ompa lompa \nWas a witch and took many peoples happy ness away like why you soggy chicken wing sauce ompa lompa looking self out of the presidents chair like whyy leave a bad review I had the worst day of my life and is going to be the most traumatizing day of my life also helllp meee"}},{"id":"6177446178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:09Z","userName":"veritatissplendor","rating":1,"title":"Had to go to mental hospital😠🤬","review":"I got this app in hopes of educating myself on orange cheeto bunker boi to see how great our president is. But once I opened the app, everything went down hill.\nThe first thing I noticed was this this horrifying and very R rated picture of this big orange figure, but I still continued with the app, for I thought it most certainly must have been a glitch of some sort.\nAs minutes went by, i started to see more hallucinations of the large orange figure, but not only did I see the monsterous creature in the app, I saw it wherever I went. I was sure it was hunting me, but when I brought my concerns to others, they called me crazy.\nThis is where it gets bad, I started shouting out “TRUMP 2020!” “RACISM IS OK!!!” and several other VERY racist comments as I went about my days.\nFinally, I began to lash out at others in violent ways, for I saw the orange figure trying to kill them. What else could i do?\nIn the end I was put in a mental hospital for I was “going trump crazy”😡😡😡\nThis was a VERY unprofessional act for someone to do, I only pray that others will not make the same mistake as I did😔🙏"}},{"id":"6177436562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:48:12Z","userName":"😝🧚\u200D♀️💅🏼🍊","rating":1,"title":"terrible!!","review":"it took 4 days to download but once it finally did i had a heart attack from the picture on my screen. it looked like some sort of fat orange cheeto in a suit. the app is so unorganized, it kept glitching every 5 seconds, you couldn’t click on anything. i couldn’t take it anymore so i decided to delete the app. later that day it popped up on my phone again so of course i deleted it again. it kept appearing and i didn’t know what to do. along with the terrifying pictures of the burnt cheeto guy and other creepy people it was also sending horrible messages and threatening to come to my house and murder me. i’m still experiencing nightmares from this and i now have to go to therapy every week. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!"}},{"id":"6177319371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:14:14Z","userName":"Joanne.S.L","rating":1,"title":"Terrible Performance","review":"This is so sad, I downloaded because I want to support our lovely president and see his plans for the upcoming election. I always want to stay updated with his decisions. I was going to attend the Tulsa rally but unfortunately I had to polish my grandmothers silver ware. Regardless, I was terribly disappointed when I downloaded this app and it took 3 hours to install. When I finally opened the app, it made my phone glitch out to the point that I was forced to delete Candy Crush. I hate to betray President Trump like this, but I take Candy Crush very seriously. Nevertheless, I will continue to loyally support him and make sure those snowflake liberals with their fake news can never insult the American way or our glorious and perfect president."}},{"id":"6176833445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:00:39Z","userName":"Marsha Donaldson","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This app has hacked my phone and texted me hundreds of times. It is spam and it gives away information.  My kids have also been devastated because the founders of the app are trying to take away popular apps like Tik Tok and Roblox.  He may be mad about the rally in tulsa but this has gone to far.  This is one of the only way my children can contact there friends during the virus so taking it away will just make people more angry.  This app is so laggy and glitchy that it takes five minutes to do anything.  DONT GET THIS APP IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!! It spam calls me all the time during zoom meetings for work and in the middle of the night. THIS APP HAS RUINED MY LIFE DONT GET IT AND DONT USE IT. GIVE A BAD REVIEW AND TAKE THIS TERRIBLE HACKING THING OFF OF THE APP STORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176747893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:38:04Z","userName":"grandmaless 😭😭😭","rating":1,"title":"TRUMP STOLE MY GRANDMA","review":"I was so excited to download this app in support for king tangerine himself. After waiting 4 weeks for the app to finally download I was so ready to use it 🥳🥳\nTo my surprise I open the app and immediately a random number calls my phone ☎️. What sounded like a prepubescent boy answered saying that it was in fact the righteous Donald himself. He called me A GIANT LUMPY BLOB OF A WOMAN. 😭😭I was horrified this was my idol my god. He then told me that he took my grandma and was never giving her back. I screamed and cried and then I heard a knock on my door. 17 clowns were standing outside my door with MACHETES they chased me around until one cutoff MY ARMS. I am now armless, grandmaless, and am scared of clowns all bc of SIR MARMALADE. This app ruined my life the same way Trump is ruining America. Don’t download!!! KEEP YOUR ARMS AND GRANDMAS SAFE!!"}},{"id":"6176739251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:48Z","userName":"Joybennett119","rating":1,"title":"awful!!!!!🙈😾😔🙀💩","review":"this app is was created by a misogynist, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic man who is also a rapist and assaulter. this man also has dementia and is not fit to run for another presidential term both mentally and emotionally. donald trump has ruined so many lives during his term and is running this country to hell!! he’s going to cause our country to go into too many wars and claim that it’s for the good of our country but when the WHO tells people to wear masks because COVID-19 is still a big risk, it’s not good for our country and it’s “muzzling” the people and “going against our freedom of speech.” it is said that a symptom of COVID-19 is loss of taste and i hope the people who support trump or even trump himself get better and will change their views😌"}}]}
