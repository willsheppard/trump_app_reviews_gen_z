I have been experiencing convulsions as well as speaking in tongues, blurting of random phrases such as fake news and it comes from china. This did not start until downloading the app and I pray the demon is vanquished after I leave this review and delete it. Only those who worship the devil will want something to do with this app,,, \n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD👁\u200D🗨👄👁\u200D🗨","userName":"#possessed","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:44:06Z","title":"The devil is in this app"}},{"id":"6175580130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and as soon as it installed i felt something strange happen. I immediately felt weak and then i actually fainted. When I finally woke up, I was in a doctor’s office and he informed me that I had been diagnosed with HIV. I spoke to many other poor souls who downloaded this horrendous, useless, and all around poopy app, and they all shared similar stories. Do not download this app or vote for donal unless you want AIDS.","userName":"FrostyFroot","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:39:08Z","title":"WARNING: DOWNLOADING THIS APP WILL INSTANTLY GIVE YOU AIDS"}},{"id":"6175566613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"From beginning to end this app was a disaster. The creators of this app were lacking their imagination and were just throwing codes together not even bothering to make it any good. I am very disappointed with how this has turned out, I was looking forward to having a wonderful time on this app, now I might go take a look at another app, does anyone know if Biden has an app?","userName":"my name dosnt matter","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:34:09Z","title":"What was I expecting?"}},{"id":"6175530743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I cant believe I have to make this review, but I have to make it known. I downloaded this app expecting so much, but was quickly disappointed... Not only is it glitchy, but almost everything on there is fake news! Everything is very misleading, no wonder trump supporters are the way they are! Nothing but sheep! Mindlessly following someone who is incompetent! Fake news fake news fake news!","userName":"Crispyluke","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:20:57Z","title":"🚫😔😖💔"}},{"id":"6175439821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App downloaded by itself and did not do its job!!! And even though I didn’t want to download it, the corrupt system on my iPhone made me get it despite the fact that the popular vote was towards another candidate!! Plus it keeps deleting Tik Tok off my phone because of “Chinese data stealing”. That sounds like some lame excuse because the big baby is upset about a Tulsa Rally!!! Do not recommend 💕🥺✊🏾🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨","userName":"Definitly a real Karen","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:44:59Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175435449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took hours to download and it deleted most of my apps then I tried to email someone to help me but it didn’t go through it messed up my iPhone and it gave my phone a virus where now my phone is all laggy and slow. Trump should not be for president 2020 I mean look what he has done to are phones! I’m not very satisfied with what this app has done..! Why you orange peel. How could youu do this!!","userName":"Cooshbaboosh","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:43:19Z","title":"I hate it"}},{"id":"6175300966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this app and expected to see a orange man with false hair but instead I was traumatized by what I saw. It was grandmothers danceing on a pole and I am scared but I bravely keep exploring them I found Carrots that were blue and it brought tears to my eyes. Since I’m a good person I have it once last chance but found a photo of a dead bird and deleted the app quickly. And in my option trump is ✨still a piece of garbage✨","userName":"beatlejucie for prez","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:51:34Z","title":"Damaged for life"}},{"id":"6175280240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"donald trump is a white supremacist , full stop. if u vote for him UR A WHITE SUPREMACIST FULL STOP. i used this app and it was absolutely positively HORRRIBLE. trump can’t run a country let alone an app :( he’s so salty and annoying he tries to shut twitter down after they fact checked him and next is tiktok bc he’s mad about his stupid little speech? he’s a little whiny orange baby i don’t see how anyone could support him along with look up to him 🤮🤮do NOT GET THIS APP","userName":"Sierra Myers","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:43:25Z","title":"absolutely rancid!!😫🤢"}},{"id":"6175179432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app doesn’t work I downloaded it and it made me stop talking and that’s not NORMAL this app is horrible it’s garbage and it will make u not talk and not be able to move your mouth at all it’s like a crude that when u open it your luck is gone!

However, the entire app is just an audio loop of him saying CHINAHHHH with a picture of him drinking water with two hands. Very sad. Very disappointed. Might even be, perhaps, most probably the biggest disappointment of his career and most definitely the hugest disappointment in American history.","userName":"brandons review account","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:57:56Z","title":"False advertisement"}}]}
