If I had to choose between stepping on a thousand Legos everyday for the rest of my life, stabbing my eyes out with a pens, or having this app on my phone I would choose the Legos AND the pens because at least they would bring me more joy, excitement, and fulfillment in my life. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","title":"ABSOLUTE TRASH PERIOD","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:40Z"}},{"id":"6174278108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Thisls4RacheI","review":"This app is possibly your one gleaming trophy to the failure that you have made 2020. It has so many bugs, I could call it your mattress. The newest version makes me especially nauseous. It is difficult to get any facts on this app! I hope you realize that if you take the people’s social platforms away, yours goes away too. Please, delete your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, everything. You are nothing but a slug. Get out of the office. You disgust me.","title":"Dear Bunker Boy,","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:22Z"}},{"id":"6174247669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"if i cry i cry","review":"One of the worst apps I’ve ever used. Incredibly glitchy and just all over unusable. Of course I wanted to support the trump administration but I was very worried about all of the horrible reviews. Alas I downloaded the app to be met with the worst software for this platform. Horribly made and obviously made without the intention of good content for Daddy Trump’s loyal followers. I do hope more people share the message that this APP is not loyal to this country, it is a liar, and a weird Cheeto pig.","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:40Z"}},{"id":"6174235896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Levi cinamatic","review":"It seems to be that the app crashes & always has a weird color to it & glitches a lot, also i’m kinda scared of the dude he looks like this character from this scary book. But that’s besides the point also it’s just not a great app like I opened it & it gives me like options to make an account & I really don’t know! like what? but otherwise worse app ever in the apple store dude apple should just delete it to be honest.","title":"Not the best :/","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:15:35Z"}},{"id":"6174228331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"thepowerthegenthez","review":"I got this app to ya know help support the annoying orange himself, and when I opened it up it was SOOOO GLITCHY.  Like come on Mr. President you can’t make a better app.  This app is literally terrible and it provides no useful information to me or many other people considering the rating is 1.4 stars.  I think this app should be deleted because it is horribly made and it is SOOO GLITCHY.  How am I supposed to do anything to help support when the dang app doesn’t even work?","title":"ummm no ❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:12:47Z"}},{"id":"6174223621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ilovemyself101","review":"i believe that this app shouldn’t be in the app store AT ALL. he’s not a great leader for this country and he’s definitely NOT my president. this app just carries selfishness and hate to our world of technology if using this app. this app should be deleted and banned because it just shouldn’t be here. during this time of crisis he should be doing one job and that job is to take care of this country and not leave it corrupting slowly and not caring at all for HIS people.","title":"worst app ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:11:00Z"}},{"id":"6174207490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"helpmeplsicantwanttocty","review":"I want to cry. Ive never been more depressed than now. Ever since the cheeto thought he could rule a country he knows nothing about , ive been sobbing. I thought opening this app might clear things up but alas ive been in a worser condition. Even my dog thinks this app is trash and he cant even read. So umm thanks for all this pain and suffering, i will now kick flip myself off a radiator and into the ocean then backflip off a building and through a bulletproof window.","title":"I want to cry...","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:05:01Z"}},{"id":"6174147704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"timotheespeach","review":"i was very excited😊to get this app📲 because my dad left when i was a kid❤️ and he likes donald duck🦆 but once i opened the app my phone EXPLODED in my bare hands hitting my 1 year old daughter in the head👼🏼then my cat started obnoxiously meowing because of the explosion and i had to call child protective services which was extremely inconvenient because i’ve called 5 times this week already🙄rate 2/10 we don’t talk but i see u in the hallways sometimes🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💕","title":"BECAUSE U MESSAGED DRAMA CHANELS😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:43:02Z"}},{"id":"6174113888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"C0urtney123","review":"I got this app so that I could find out about rallies and stuff ya know? Lemme tell you this app is GLITCHYYYY!! 🤮🤮🤮 Also (and i definitely think this is because of the app), as soon as I downloaded the app, I kept finding bags of cheetos EVERYWHERE. I never even buy cheetos so i’m thinking this is some weird type of campaign promotion for the cheeto in the white house. So yeah I definitely don’t recommend this app. It crashed all the time and made my phone freak out. :(((((","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:30:28Z"}},{"id":"6174095244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"IloveGraceChambers1776","review":"The worst part about the app is the photos. When I opened the app I was revolted, because of the picture I puked on our waiter she sued my dad and now we have to live at my grandma’s. She already has to deal with the lose of her money. Besides that it’s impractical before I could even fill out a form to go to a rally. There was trump asking if he’s a good president or not. I think it’s very unprofessional that our president needs validation that bad. It’s disgusting.","title":"I hate this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:23:39Z"}}]}
