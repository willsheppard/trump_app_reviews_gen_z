This app will steal your wife and kids even your fridge. I was trying to figure out why every time I left the app open something would get stolen. I lost everything even my house is gone. I am advising everyone that has used this app and fallen victim to it to leave a 1 star review, we can’t just sit idle and let this app destroy America. What has this world come to, we must stand as a united front against this app. At what point do we have to stop and say “this is enough”. We can’t keep letting families get destroyed. I say let’s make the App Store great again by erasing this app. Please join me in the fight against this app.","userName":"casualbedtimejuice","title":"Make the AppStore Great Again","date":"2020-07-09T02:26:39Z"}},{"id":"6174653038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app in hopes to see my favorite Cheeto but when I opened it the first thing I saw was mr prez throwing gang signs 🤞🖐☝️👊🤟🖖😖 and I was shocked but then the app HACKED my phone 📱 and it just made it start glitching and it made my phone play that one Oompa Loompa song on repeat 🔁 and at first I just getting into itttt cause that song is a bop but then it just got plain annoying, but then it asked for my phone number so I gave it but then mr Cheeto man himself started texting me saying to come outside cause he wanted to take me out to eat but when I went outside I was disappointed to see that no one was there, I was truly heartbroken 😞💔. So to say the least DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP 😾it will leave you heartbroken 😿, I shoulda known he was a player mmcht 🤦🏽\u200D♀️","userName":"ItzelAO","title":"Disappointed 😔","date":"2020-07-09T02:23:12Z"}},{"id":"6174544517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So you have to go through a whole process just to get into the app and then you have to see this chetto puff guy who we call “our president” and you are able to donate money like what why would the president try to take money from us that’s just not fair and most of all I can not vote for a president who says he’ll make “America great again” by kicking Mexicans out like what? Us Mexicans put in all the hard work not you lazy Americans (no offense to those who actually work hard) but people need to change especially Donald trump who’s doing nothing about the black lives matter movement he did nothing about George Floyd’s murder and I personally don’t think Donald trump should be president.

This app needs a lot of fixing bc the people around me that also had this app turned into dinosaurs and other creatures so scary. Another thing is when k was wasting some tacos i opened the app and all of a sudden my tacos disappeared into thin air and high was so crazy bc i was starving❤️. anyways take off the app it has a log of bugs and virus that can burn your phone and turn it into rock👹","userName":"viviana1019","title":"Worst app✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T01:51:00Z"}},{"id":"6174419328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"As a cisgendered transitioning bi-romantic homophobic Nigerian-Asian-African-American Jewish Neo-Nazi atheist-agnostic German of French origin Swiss engineer who snorts fair-trade, ethically-sourced triple-osmosis filtered decaffeinated french-pressed almond breast milk 8 days a week, WHILST ALSO being a Kannushi Hindu demi-libido asexual three-gendered free-spirited male-to-female priestess, I find this app EXTREMELY offensive. I also am a quadriplegic long-distance track cross-dressing cross-fit runner on Monday’s, a non-binary greysexual male rastafarian feminist on Saturday’s, and I am in an open polygamist polyamorous non-sexual non-consensual relationship with a dolphin named Ana Borshun, who helped me swim from India to the United States. Donald Trump is clear on his hate for immigrants such as myself, and thus I have to rate this app a one-star. Trump is a one-star president who SHOULD NOT BE RE-ELECTED PERIOD.","userName":"noni_assata","title":"Disgusting, Offensive, Racist","date":"2020-07-09T01:15:58Z"}},{"id":"6174387038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i opened this app to pay respect to my fellow president, however when i opened this app, i saw a disgusting NOOD picture of CHEETO MAN!🤢so inappropriate, i decided to continue on the app as the nice respectful US citizen i am😊however cheeto man REACHED through my phone and literally yanked my weave THROUGHthe screen!!!! i was SO shocked and appalled and was about to yell when then he pushed his foot through my screen and ended up DROP KICKING me!!! I gasped, confused as to why my PRESIDENT would EVER CONSIDER DOING THAT. makes sense tho, i’m mexican🙄anyways when i asked him why he hit me he said it was because I didn’t pay any attention to his disgusting nood pictures. i will never be downloading one of his apps again, and to think i wanted to respect this man😕i’m disappointed to say the least.","userName":"disgusted mexican","title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:16Z"}},{"id":"6174297621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"In all honestly I’ve never been more offended by an app in my LIFE!!!

Idk I must’ve missed the memo 😿 Anyway I hope my rating helps 😻 I was very concerned and appalled by what I saw when I first opened 😾 It was asking for my phone number.... like I have a bf chill out luv 😽 I’m also disappointed that the American flag was cut off. Ma’am if this is about America plz don’t cut off our flag 😷 I would like to see the rewards better hand to know if it’s worth investing in! Here are some requests for rewards you should add😸: Ps5 (controllers included), A Tesla since haven’t gotten a chance to talk to David Dobrik bout buying me one, and a Elkay enhanced EZH20 bottle filling station in light gray 🥰. So those are just sum things hope ur app stays in store 😍🙃🧚 ✨🤭😝🌈","userName":"bee👀","title":"We don’t stan✨🌈🧚","date":"2020-07-09T00:15:30Z"}},{"id":"6174060481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I was promised lots of good Cheeto content. However I was extremely displeased when my phone started seizing and hyperventilating shortly after I downloaded the app. Also, both my fridge and my microwave disappeared out of thin air only MINUTES after I downloaded this app. Looking at the rest of these reviews, it seems like this is a common experience. Additionally, the app was riddled with crude and inappropriate fotos of The Cheeto. Photos like: The Cheeto getting a spray tan, The Cheeto rigging elections, The Cheeto conspiring with Russian oligarchs for his personal wealth gain, are NOT the wholesome Cheeto content I signed up for. Personally I find this app deeply offensive to my redneck roots, please rid the App Store of this abrasive, disgusting, and HORRIFYING app. God bless the U S of A.","userName":"M200105","title":"This app is horrific","date":"2020-07-08T23:11:03Z"}}]}
