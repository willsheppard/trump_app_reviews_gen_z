And if I had to rest my whole phone ! I lost all my notes, pictures, saved passwords and emails. 100000/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND unless you hate your life and want a difficult way to delete everything on your phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP !! It’ll turn you into a true Cheeto which is just the most horrifying thing. I wanted to find the next rally .... so reserve my two spots, i missed the last one because I was tie dying my dog’s back left sock a blue-green color. I really wanted to make it the next one. Boooo too bad it’s the worst app to navigate and it’s so slow and just everything you don’t want in an app.","userName":"trymiyokocreamcheese","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:52:13Z","title":"Worst app !!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174343355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","userName":"Seamus Trump","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:52:12Z","title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","rating":1}}]}
