But oddly enough, after downloading it, my phone started to smell - ha ha! I laugh, but this is a serious problem as I don’t know how to rid this stinky smell from my phone. I’m thinking I’ll have to replace my phone soon because even as I write this review I can barely handle the ucky yucky stench emanating from it. I have no choice but to throw out this tainted phone, and for that I give this app one (1) star.🌟","userName":"Plugging My Nose","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177013047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:48:11Z","title":"Worst App for Keeping up to date","review":"Wow. All I can say is wow. \n\nI was really hoping to keep myself up to date on what Trump is currently doing in his campaign. I mean I’ve already reserved seats at some of\nhis rallies! But this app is probably the least helpful thing out there! User interface is horrible. I can’t understand it. And I am constantly getting spammed from all the notifications this thing sends out! It’s ridiculous. I hate this app.","userName":"SpottyLynn","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176970092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:36:33Z","title":"Made my phone break","review":"So I got this app with the hope of supporting the president. Unfortunately right upon arrival it crashed. So I tried it a couple more times. The same thing kept on happening. Then soon enough my phone blew up. Luckily for me I did more research into him and turns out he’s a horrible person. But that’s besides the point, either way this app is bad and nobody should ever use unless you want your phone to blow up.","userName":"sherklover0735","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176966623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:38Z","title":"This is horrible","review":"This app has made my phone glitch out soo many times and I have gotten porn adds on this app and Im so disappointed and what I have seen, I have children on here this app deserves to be deleted this is disgusting all of you need to get your children and you off this app. I will be sending a not to Apple to tell them what happened, I want to talk to Donald trump myself to tell him how horrible this is and to tell him how mad I am!!","userName":"niomi rose","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176933864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:57Z","title":"Spam","review":"I am an avid Trump supporter and frankly this app has made me feel sad that the president I so dearly adore is making my phone crash. It also has in app ads that lead to these very sketchy websites, and a lot of purchases have been made on accident within the app and charged to my credit card. I AM $500 in debt!!! And I mean duh I’m going to be able to pay it because I have a job unlike those libtards, but yeah...anyways so.....TRUMP 2020🇺🇸(manny will not be televised🤫)","userName":"m4nny w1ll n0t b3 t3lev1sed","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176772574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:44:33Z","title":"literal trash 🤮","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!! it took an entire week to download onto my phone only to make my phone crash when i tried opening the app. my phone barely works now after downloading it and it’s taken me multiple tries to write this out without my phone glitching 😭😭 it also takes up so much storage. i had to delete multiple other apps and pictures on my phone to download this trash. don’t do it.","userName":"jenny 💅","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176661582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:15:20Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!","review":"I downloaded this to show support for my wonderful, beautiful, sexy president, I was expecting a high quality app!!

I HAD TO CHANGE MY RACE SETTINGS FOR IT TO DOWNLOAD. next the app itself wanted to throw hands. it told me i was ugly and wasn’t smart. so i said “ catch me outside how abt that” and it didn’t even pull up. the app was slow and it didn’t even give me helpful information. i do not recommend this app at all. #settleforbiden2020","userName":"Elandrea23","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176489676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:28:46Z","title":"Worst App!","review":"The app took forever to load and when I was finally able to open it, the app was so slow and glitchy. Recently after opening the app and remaining in the app, a bunch of pop-ups flooded my phone and my phone was infected with a virus!! I don’t know much about phones so it was a scary experience. Immediately after that happened, I deleted the app, and the virus went away. Hmmm.... the app definitely caused the virus.","userName":"Coolio4567890","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
