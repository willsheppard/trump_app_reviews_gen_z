The app’s algorithm, unfortunately, was keeping me awake at all hours of the night with its constant notifications about rallies. I was grateful for the influx of refreshing, true information but, after nineteen months with no sleep, I decided it had to go. I thought it was over, but the notifications kept coming. Even after deleting the app and resetting my phone, they would appear more persistently than before, most likely because of a development glitch. I tried everything. I tried turning it off, but it seemed to always be face up and open to the app every time I looked at it. I tried putting it in another room while I slept, but the phone kept somehow reappearing on my bedside table in the same manner as before. Thinking my mother had just found it and put it back in my room, I thought nothing of it. After confronting her, I realized she wasn’t behind the prank, and I started to worry. \nI put the phone in the garage. Hopefully, I would be able to sleep for the night, right? Wrong. My worst nightmares came true when I woke up at 1am to the insistent vibrations, piercing light, and intense pinging of notifications. Quickly, I got in my car and drove all early morning with the phone dinging in the glove box. I finally stopped in the middle of an abandoned field. First, I used my shovel to obliterate the phone into shrapnel. I then dug a four foot deep hole and buried the cursed thing after covering it in salt. Finally, I was safe. By the time I got back to my bed, covered in dirt and exhausted, it was already light outside. \nRight as I was about to close my eyes, my mother knocked softly on my door telling me there was someone here to see me. I was about to tell her to tell the unwanted visitor to go away, but the look in her eyes shocked me back awake. I grabbed my baseball bat and cautiously walked up to the front door. I told my mother to hide in the other room as I crept forward. I opened the door and the bat clattered to the ground as it fell from my hand. \nA man in a business suit, red tie, and American flag pin fastened to his lapel. Our lord and savior, whose sole purpose was to make America great again was standing on my humble doorstep. Of course I kneeled and bowed deeply, curious what wondrous coincidences had led this mighty man to me, but when I stood up, he looked me in the eye and told me he had seen the journey I had been on through his millions of cameras and microphones implanted in my house and in the birds outside. He looked sympathetic and handed me what looked like to be the latest, unreleased Apple iPhone XIV containing one, singular app. \n\nEdit:\nThe developer reached out to me through the super cool mind control option in the app and fixed my sleeping problem, very happy with the response 🤩🧚\u200D♀️✨💫💐🌸","rating":1,"title":"Honestly kind of okay🤷\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6178937451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:32:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tintinJK","review":"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight\nNot a footprint to be seen\nA kingdom of isolation\nAnd it looks like I'm the queen\nThe wind is howling like this swirling storm inside\nCouldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried\nDon't let them in, don't let them see\nBe the good girl you always have to be\nConceal, don't feel, don't let them know\nWell, now they know\nLet it go, let it go\nCan't hold it back anymore\nLet it go, let it go\nTurn away and slam the door\nI don't care what they're going to say\nLet the storm rage on\nThe cold never bothered me anyway\nLet it go, let it go\nCan't hold it back anymore\nLet it go, let it go\nTurn away and slam the door\nLet it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go)\nLet it go\nLet it go\nLet it go\nIt's funny how some distance makes everything seem small\nAnd the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all\nIt's time to see what I can do\nTo test the limits and break through\nNo right, no wrong, no rules for me\nI'm free\nLet it go, let it go\nI am one with the wind and sky\nLet it go, let it go\nYou'll never see me cry\nHere I stand and here I stay\nLet the storm rage on\nMy power flurries through the air into the ground\nMy soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around\nAnd one thought crystallizes like an icy blast\nI'm never going back, the past is in the past\nLet it go\nThe cold never bothered me anyway\nLet it go, let it go\nAnd I'll rise like the break of dawn\nLet it go, let it go\nThat perfect girl is gone\nHere I stand in the light of day\nLet the storm rage on","rating":1,"title":"ORANGE IS GROSS"}},{"id":"6178925708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:28:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"2k2raf","review":"This app is terrible period.","rating":1,"title":"Trumps"}},{"id":"6178838398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:56:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jsjshejejdj","review":"He is bad at his job","rating":1,"title":"Bod persistent"}},{"id":"6178767800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:28:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"isjdhdydy","review":"This is for racist people","rating":1,"title":"The worst app ever"}},{"id":"6178743537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:19:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🍡🍼","review":"gross app, almost died, one star, don’t download","rating":1,"title":"disgusting"}},{"id":"6178692749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:59:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Melanie.thomas.303","review":"✊🏻❤️✊🏼🧡✊🏽💛✊🏾💚✊🏿💙✊\nMillennials and Gen Z WILL have our say!","rating":1,"title":"Down with the RACIST"}},{"id":"6178599324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:23:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Saran the block","review":"Terrible man","rating":1,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6178594592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:21:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Dogggggggsssdd","review":"Worst app Ever created","rating":1,"title":"Bad"}},{"id":"6178581172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:16:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"windex420","review":"Not as what I thought","rating":1,"title":"Meh"}}]}
