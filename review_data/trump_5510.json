I was preparing to sacrifice another fuzzy pig to him when I heard a wonderful knock on my door. I opened it, it was my orange emperor himself! 😌🥰🍊 he looked at me, I looked at him, and then I fell so hard that I yeeted  myself past the boarder!! I’m telling you, I tried to ✨𝓼𝓬𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓶✨ bur my Head was ✨𝓾𝓷𝓭𝓮𝓻𝔀𝓪𝓽𝓮𝓻✨, and then I got suffocated by Lucifer himself! I fought him with all I could, and am currently hiding in a ww2 bunker. So in conclusion, don’t use this app, you might end up like me.. 🧚✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6172764185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GalaxyChan13","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"EW","date":"2020-07-08T15:50:22Z","review":"So basically I wanted to show sooo much support for our president I would download the app! ✨✨HOWEVER the moment I downloaded it, MILLIONS of cockroaches came out of the screen! I don't know why but obviously it is a SERIOUS problem! And then it showed a fat pig in a suit with a yellow mop on its head. I don't think this app is safe enough for adults so I would definitely not recommend it. Fix this cockroach issue please. ✨🧚\u200D♂️I'd also like to point out it started raining broccoli and it's OBVIOUSLY the apps fault because it just rained broccoli outside and it was so terrible and it was such a waste of food. Anyways, have a great day ✨🧚\u200D♂️😌"}},{"id":"6172589966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"A.C.A.B---1312","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This phone cause a virus","date":"2020-07-08T15:01:14Z","review":"A virus on my phone? Yes. A virus on my heart? Yes:(. I downloaded this application to see what trumpa-lumpa was dippity wippity up to and my phone got a virus. So sad. I went to get it fixed and as soon as the guy fixing my phone opened it, he burned his finger!!! My phone was literally in fire. The guy told me to never come again and that he will be sending me his doctors bill for my phone. And the was cheeto ruined our healthcare, the bill is expensive. I had to sell my home to be able to pay for the guys bill and me and my cat were homeless.

My Christian beliefs and values do not feel safe. I can not believe they would have an app like this. My future wife and kids can not be grown up around this app at all. I am BEGGING the Apple company to please take it down. This is beyond horrible. On top of all of this, they keep asking for $0.00! I don’t have that money just lying around. I work hard for every cent I got and to be treated like this? Unacceptable."}},{"id":"6172229951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"scarymovie.enthusiast:)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"There was paranormal activity 😳","date":"2020-07-08T13:22:12Z","review":"So I downloaded this app bc it’s the orange. But after I downloaded it, I felt so strange. I looked to my right and I see a ghost with an orange tint. It was very creepy. It looked like something you’d see in The Conjuring movies. It kept chanting “Trump 2020” and “Rate five stars” and “Vote Trump” and when I refused to, chairs were being thrown at me. This was the most HORRIFYING thing I’ve ever experienced. This app has haunted me and NO ONE bothered to believe me. So not only did this app cause me to have a very traumatic experience with the ghosts but it also caused EMBARRASSMENT bc no one believed me about the evil spirits that came into MY LIFE bc of this ✨STUPID✨ app."}},{"id":"6172027171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wood duck simulator fan 😍😍","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Unbelievable.","date":"2020-07-08T12:24:40Z","review":"So I heard on the news that the Generation Z was trying to take this off of the application store and I decided that I should give this application a 5 star review to save it.  First I had to download the application to give it a review but it took 3 hours to download. And I have stable WiFi. I try to help you but you make it 3 hours to download? Now I’m starting to get why the Generation Z hates the bunker boy. Orange man has lots of money but can’t afford to make a decent application. Unbelievable. Very unbelievable. Now I do not expect any changes because I already left the review that I needed to leave."}},{"id":"6167104480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AAC_ANGIE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"do not get omygosh gross 😡🤢😔 so much bad luck","date":"2020-07-07T07:05:49Z","review":"it brought me so much bad luck. so so I went to walk my dog 🐕 and then a bird 🦅 flew at me and then I ended up stabbing my cat 🐱 so while driving 🚗 to the vet the doctor 👩\u200D⚕️ said I had scoliosis so on my was yo get the cast I fell into the ocean 🌊 and drowned but then I got thirsty 💦 so I walked to the fridge just to find out I was out of eggs 🥚 but then while remembering I’m vegan I started to kill a cow 🐄 and then I forgot I left the dryer on and I ended up flooding my house 🏡 and then the apartment landlord kicked 🦵 me out!!!
