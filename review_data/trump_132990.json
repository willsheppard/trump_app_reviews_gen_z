I then went back to work at my workshop, building things with my handy tools.Then I got a knock on my door so I opened it. I couldn‚Äôt see anyone but I heard people say ‚Äúvotetrump2020‚Äù‚Äù votetrump2020‚Äù and I got scared and looked to the floor and did the radio rebel look. That‚Äôs when I saw it. It was the the attack of the angry ants!!üò°üêú they picked me up with their huge muscles üí™. I screamed but then they duck-taped my mouth close. I decided to entertain them with my radio rebel face. They got distracted and dropped me. I immeadiately looked on the trump app for a reverse card. I found one and showed it to the ants. Then all of a sudden I turned into a killer ant üêúüò°. I tried to find my phone once again to delete the app, but I was too late the ants had already taken it away and were leaving because their job was done. So I sat there thinking like this:üëÅüëÑüëÅ. Then I got a genius idea. So i raced to my Barbie car and drove after them. I fought back with my ninja skills, and got my phone. I felt victorious. I then deleted the app and everything went back to normal. I almost died multiple times. So if you don‚Äôt want to become an ant I would suggest staying far away from this app. \n\nAlso:iü•µclimedüß≠outü•´ofüëãmyüîíheadü§Øand‚õ∏watched‚è∞myselfüëàimplodeüí•aüëÖthoughtüí≠without ‚ùåa‚ö†Ô∏èbodyüí§ oughtaüé§beüêùtheüèé shotüî´\n\nAnd: Iüòëcutü§êmyüëπfingerüò∫onüëæzoesüëøringüíçiüôâhopeüê¶iüê§canü¶ãstillüêÑsayüê´theü¶ßnüï∑wordüíÖüèæ\n\nGen z unite and take over the world‚ú®üíïüßö\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏èüëÅüëÑüëÅ","date":"2020-07-08T20:48:54Z","title":"No‚ù§Ô∏è","isEdited":false,"userName":"olaf the snowheaded one","rating":1}},{"id":"6173679695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is extremely rude and offensive. Why would you make an app dedicated to a racist, sexist, child rapist?? Oh, and don‚Äôt forget he is slowly taking away LGBTQ rights. What a joke. This app needs to be taken off the App Store. Also, the app will only stay open for about 5 seconds before crashing and kicking me off. It also constantly reloads itself and messed up my phone. -69/10 would NOT recommend.
