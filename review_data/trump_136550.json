Racist, sexist and I am tired of seeing this very ugly man. I don’t really know who he is but apparently he’s the leader of America. As a freshly fried chicken wing I don’t think humans need to see this nonsense. I very whole heartedly believe that this app needs to be deleted immediately.

Anyways this is a horrible app. I clicked the don’t send notifications, but it kept on spamming me with texts and stuff saying how I need to vote for trump. It is very annoying. Also, I used my email to sign up, and IT HACKED MY ACCOUNT. Not only did it hack my email account, it hacked my phone and deleted a bunch of apps. My wallpaper was changed to a picture of a whole bunch of oranges and it said trump 2020. I did not change my background and that was totally uncalled for because I hadn’t decided if I was gonna vote for trump. I’m definitely not voting for him now. Y’all need to fix the problems on this app, or take it off the App Store.","userName":"gamergirl10177","title":"Horrible and I mean absolutely HORRIBLE app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T09:01:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180186070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay, so I decided to download the app after finishing a bag of hot Cheetos (yum), and it was the worst decision of my life... I opened the app, and my cat (who was sitting next to me) screamed and ran away after seeing a picture of the scary orange man. He still hasn’t come home yet, and it’s been two whole weeks. If anyone has seen a pink cat with a hot Cheeto collar, please notify me 🥺😭 #barbs","userName":"AdriannaMichele","title":"For the Barbs 💅🏼","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T09:01:04Z","isEdited":false}}]}
