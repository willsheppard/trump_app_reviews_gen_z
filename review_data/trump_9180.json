He was singing so loud we sadly had to put him down. I had the app for about 12 days and it had not stoped screeching the next day my phone lit on fire and random birds stormed into our house and ate our bunny. When we trued to stop them they lit our kitchen on fire. So now I’m stuck with about 65 birds and occasionally start singing the National anthem. So I don’t recommend this app at all.","rating":1,"title":"Do not download!!!!"}},{"id":"6175573959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:36:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tnbunc","review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded!!! The design is terrible, the app took 2 months to download, the app is filled with bots that keep trying to hack into your phone with pop up ads, and it takes up way too much space in my phone!!

My child opened this app up and saw PORN. This is a Christian household and we do not condone to this type of behavior. I myself am a trump supporter and I FORCED my kids to watch Fox News but now I’m sick of it. We do not want pornography it is disgusting and if I hear one more thing about this COVID-19 I’m gonna SCREAM. Donald J Trump you should ashamed for talking about these topics I though we were gonna atleast teach us about our lives that are affecting us today.

My eyes needed bleach. When I went to go rinse my eyes with bleach I left my phone on and my BOYFRIEND, Chrollo, saw them. He accused of my CHEATING because of it. He then told me he was gonna go on a walk for awhile. After a couple of hours there was a photo of him sleeping and this disgusting clown man. He texted me saying “Your man said you cheated so he wanted to cheat back -Hisoka Morrow ⭐️-_-💧”\nI then fell into a depression because my boyfriend thought I cheated. I didn’t want the Tonpa looking presidents nudes when I downloaded this app!! \n\nRate 1/5!! If I could I’d give it a 0!\n\nRelationship ruined by this LAXATIVE TONPA PRESIDENT. Mereum was a better person and he was an ANT.

Now I saw some other reviews of this app stealing people’s fridges, thankfully mine is still here but my baby monkeys were stolen. Shortly after downloading this app, one of my baby money’s peed on my marble countertop so I threw it in the washing machine like I normally do. Well as I went to take it out, a small orange man who heinously reeked of spray tan popped out and snatched all my baby monkeys AND MY WEAVE. Now I have no baby monkeys, no weave, and my laundry room smells of ugly orange man😔","rating":1,"title":"STOLE MY BABY MONKEYS 😤😤"}},{"id":"6174983703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:02:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Halie Dionne","review":"This app is a disgrace to this country it’s toll my dog and ridiculed my mom and if so cold it hurt my family in called out to hurt me and go to store in no call from dog ask OCTOBER and then we got a call from a guy that I got a ride to the car and then we went out and then I gotta get it to me for my car I don’t think so haha was a way I got a car show me and my boyfriend broke up and my mom told ya hey I’m so excited to go get back together I wanna know I gotta do y’all want me you can have it!!!!
