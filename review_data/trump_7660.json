Also this app took like 15 years to download so I’m very disappointed. When it finally downloaded the first thing I saw was that disgusting photo of trump playing tennis with his buttocks towards the camera 🤮🤮🤮. Now I have severe anxiety when we I open up apps because this experience truly traumatized me!!! ☹️😞 THIS APP SHOULD BE DELETED!!!!!","userName":"✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️🤟","isEdited":false,"title":"UGHHHH!! 😩"}},{"id":"6176585853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:03Z","rating":1,"review":"Wow! I wish I could give this app zero stars! This has ruined my life and my family. FOREVER!! I can believe they let this kind of stuff out there. After I started to download it my brand new phone shut off and won’t stop glitching 😒 the developer of this app is an awful person for putting something like this on to the App Store. Just the logo alone sends my kids into a wild panic! They are tearing my entire house apart. Still like this should be REMOVED from the App Store permanently. \n-  a VERY VERY angry consumer.","userName":"Hinfhcniqbciqciw","isEdited":false,"title":"Unbelievable!"}},{"id":"6176514718","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:35:41Z","rating":1,"review":"If I could rate this app zero stars, I would. The app took two hours to download and has made my phone glitch. My phone is relatively new and I have never experienced this before. I do not know what the heck is going on but DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT unless you’re fine and dandy with crashing and severe glitching. I can barely open the app and actually use it without it glitching immediately and freezing my phone. It is such a shame I won’t be able to kept up with 45 with this app. DO GET UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.","userName":"KateUmi😏😪📉","isEdited":false,"title":"RUINED MY PHONE.

It took 60 weeks to download and when it did, I got a death threat saying if I didn’t vote for trump I would be “sent back to Africa with the rest of the negros”🤬. The app continued to threaten me and tell me to vote for trump and I felt very threatened. I do not recommend downloading this app because it is disgusting and quite frankly dangerous. You do not threaten people for a vote, I am very upset. So please do me and everyone else a favor and ⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP⚠️, thank you for taking the time to read this if you did, good day to you.","userName":"mike oochies hairy","isEdited":false,"title":"⚠️DONT DOWNLOAD⚠️"}},{"id":"6176057778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:20:51Z","rating":1,"review":"If I could give zero stars I would. This app was highly unorganized, unprofessional, and unqualified. I felt extremely attacked just opening the app. It asked for my number which made me feel very uncomfortable. The LOGO made me think of oranges, and I HATE ORANGES!! Just looking at it made me smell dollar store EXPIRED tanning spray mixed with body odor. Just knowing this app was on my phone for more than a few days mad me feel physically ill. I couldn’t imagine it being there and longer!! This app needs to be taken down! DO NOT “DOWNLOAD” it!

If you are installing it, delete immediately. Took almost four years to download and still says it needs more time!!! When it finished, I opened it to find frequent homophobic, misogynistic, racist, fascist, and otherwise offensive notifications from it. The app never opened when it was actually needed, but kept opening itself whenever it was not. Tried several time to remove and filed complaints. Get rid of this garbage immediately!","userName":"Luddite666","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE APP"}},{"id":"6175827146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:05:10Z","rating":1,"review":"I decided to get this app about this guy who says “im going to make America great again” but then I got hit in the head with a orange that trump threw at me at a rally that I was at I had to go to the hospital and they said I was hurt bad then he told a young girl which was 9 years old that she looked hot I was truly disgusted and I said to myself “ohhh to see without my eyes 👁👄👁then this app ripped me off and took 43 dollars from me so I suggest to not get this app and not to support him this brings bad luck ✨🧚🧚\u200D♂️now when are you going to die trump✨🧚\u200D♂️🧚","userName":"neveah hpoe padilla","isEdited":false,"title":"Hi I’m here from tiktok"}},{"id":"6175722980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:29:38Z","rating":1,"review":"This app was very rude. The app told me to migrate to the middle of the ocean to drown. I have never been more harassed in my entire life. I would like to speak to the manager and get a refund. My stuffed animal also said that the app is such a disgrace. The app made racist jokes that the color of his fur was too orange and now he’s out getting a spray tan because of his insecurities. It also told him that he was too fluffy so has also Gonna get some fluff removal done today 🙏 STUFFED ANIMAL LOVES MATTER TOO!!!✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 so please don’t download this app, download TikTok instead✨💕🧚🌈✨\nSincerely, Gen Z","userName":"hello. this is good app","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️"}}]}
