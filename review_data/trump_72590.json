I was wondering why it was taking so long but I realized it was scanning ALL of my personal information, photos, and just overall EVERYTHING on my entire phone before it downloaded. So I went to my emails to change all of my passwords but it locked me out of everything on my phone and when I took it to the apple store to get my entire phone rebooted because of THIS APP. Then alarms started going off on my phone and although at this point I have had my phone shut off for AT LEAST 24 HOURS, it randomly turned back on again with a screen that said \"vote trump 2020 and do not throw this phone away or ignore this message sent to you or we will find you!\"😱😡😰 I immediately threw away my phone and drove back to my house, but by the time I got there you'll never guess what was waiting on my doorstep... THE PHONE. It was sitting on my front porch with a note taped to the top which said \"I told you we would find you!\" I went to the police as urgently and quickly as I could, but when I got there then Donald Trump was waiting at the station for me. I didn't know what to do!! So I sprinted the other direction and he ran after me. I was able to lose him though. Now for the past 19 days I have been in the woods hoping no one finds me, for that was the most traumatic moment of my life. I was able to find this phone abandoned by where I had set up my camp. I will continue to live here for the rest of my life, all alone, due to me downloading this app😔😥😭","date":"2020-07-09T09:11:46Z","userName":"Nataliexgracee"}}]}
