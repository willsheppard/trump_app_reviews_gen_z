Then they proceeded walk into my house and brutally attack me with the trump flag. Walking in behind them were some cockroaches holding a black live matter sign and then the rats started to attack the cockroaches. I was started cheering for the cockroaches. When the cockroaches won I got a broom and started sweeping them out of my house. I still dont know how they knew my address though🤔. Do NOT get this app unless you want to get attacked by rats and cockroaches in your house.🤕","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:40:16Z"}},{"id":"6174702341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"+_^_^_+","title":"ABYSMAL APP","review":"This is the worst app. Immediately after downloading, my phone started blasting Mariah Cary and it wouldn’t stop playing for hours. The app took away my driver’s license and deleted all of my essays on the consumption of eggplant. I am appalled at the lack of research that was put into the creation of this app. I wish I never downloaded it because now my phone will forever wake me up at 2 AM to the sound of geese. This is the last thing I will ever write on my phone because I am forced to throw it out my window because of the countless things this app has done to ruin my phone!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:37:40Z"}},{"id":"6174678363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"livi quintana","title":"HORRIFIED AND CONFUSED","review":"This app has ruined my life! Since downloading our presidents application I have been followed around my city my government vans constantly and have been put on the FBI watch list. I recently tried to move into a new neighborhood to put a halt to this issue but my realtor acted strangely and had a suspiciously reptilian tongue and eyes that only blinked vertically. Also my dog has recently been diagnosed with AIDS, which is impossible because there is no way a homosexual is living under my good christian roof. This app is the root of all evil, and I know this because the Lord came to me in a dream and told me. Amen.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:30:31Z"}},{"id":"6174661606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"lanimew","title":"This Sticky poo-poo app","review":"Hi.

Like Tik Tok is life for me! Soo I came on here and wanted to leave him a bad review. First he’s not doing anything about BLM! And he’s being so racist about Covid-19. Like saying that it’s the  “China virus”. I’m a kid and I know what is right and is what wrong and idk why people were that dumb to choose him🙄 And u r still dumb if u think he’s really making a change! So far🙄 he has done nothing and sit around with all his money!

I was wondering why this app was even on the app store. THIS APP NEEDS TO BE REMOVED RIGHT NOW. IT IS SO GROSS. Not to mention it gave my phone a virus, which it basically posted CHILD pornography all over my social media accounts. So many other people have been experiencing what i have which goes to show this app needs to be removed right now. REMOVE THIS APP 2020!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:04Z"}}]}
