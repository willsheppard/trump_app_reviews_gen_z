On top of that, this app gives you a notification informing you that they have access to every bit of information you possess. I’m terrified for myself, and my family. This app is dangerously targeting the people of america. P.s. it isn’t kid friendly 😬.","date":"2020-07-09T12:20:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176427183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"coolguy100000000000","isEdited":false,"title":"AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! PLEASE READ","review":"PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS!! THIS APP IS DANGEROUS. \nThis all started when I wanted to download this app to support my unproblematic president. It took 7 MONTHS to download! When it did, I opened it up and it called me horrible things like the n word. It then sent me death threats towards myself and my family. It also downloaded 10 viruses on my iPhone and blew it up! HORRIBLE APP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-09T12:11:36Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176426794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fudgerules","isEdited":false,"title":"Never again🧚🏻\u200D♀️","review":"This app was THE worst. I downloaded it and it took about 5 hours. Then when it was downloaded i went on the app and found that it was very inappropiate asking for my phone number. Once i put it in i basically got spam messages. So over the top and unessary take this app away!😖","date":"2020-07-09T12:11:30Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176413660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Beach_21_","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","review":"I went to download the app in hopes of staying up to date. Instead I’m constantly spammed with information via text and email. There are no options to remove me and the app itself has a ton of glitches. It was a waste of time for Trump to develop such a trashy app. These reviews seem to strongly agree.","date":"2020-07-09T12:07:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176409383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Elena Bidasca","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is terrible","review":"This app is absolutely terrible. It took over 2 weeks for it to download and when it did it said they suspected a virus so I let it detect it and “wipe it off”. But after I did that, it deleted all my other apps and stole my information! This app is stealing people’s information and should be deleted!","date":"2020-07-09T12:06:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176287838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nothankyou🐝","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVERRRR","review":"The app asks for your number so he can track you. It will read all data and information on your phone and store it to their servers. It’ll take all your photos and erase them from your phone. The app will text people using your phone asking them to support his campaign. I wish I could give zero stars.","date":"2020-07-09T11:32:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176244291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"member of generation Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD 😡😡","review":"i downloaded it to see if it could change my perspective on mr cheeto. sadly it took 49 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD. then when it did it asked for my number which i thought was weird but i did it anyways. then i realized it was full of FAKE NEWS! get it off the app store! its overall terrible and i hope it will be gone soon, just like bunker boy 🤩🖐🏼🧚🏼\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T11:19:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176151942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jane_rauber","isEdited":false,"title":"just no❤️","review":"This app just wouldn’t work like a normal app should. It wouldn’t load and kept logging me out:/. I’m seriously disappointed at this. Also the information on this app is so false and biased like a 3rd grader wrote it. All I have to say is Trump is not worthy of being president if this app is any indication of how he runs things. 😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T10:50:45Z","rating":1}}]}
