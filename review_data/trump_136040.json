Couldn’t even check out what the orange man’s 🍊🍊🍊 technology side of his campaign looked like, cause the dang app kept crashing🤡🤡. Not to mention, his graphic designer probably the one that designed the new Chucky Cheese Mouse and Strawberry Shortcake girl, cause BŁägHêŒ 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 absolute garbage energy. You don’t see any of the unproblematic presidents making an app now do you 👁👄👁 (*^_^*) Probably because they didn’t need to support their weak butts with some app no one even likes 😽😽😽. It ain’t my fault the man fell from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down 😭😭. Also ⚠️WARNING WARNING ⚠️  I heard downloading app will open gates of HëLŁ immediately after inputting phone number, so DONT DO THAT HUN⚡️✨🌼🍯 In the end, this app is a waste of time, and if my boi Trumpy Flumpy can’t accept he’s a fat disappointment, GIRLLLL, build a bridge and get over it 🙄🙄🙄 He can do that with walls pretty good 😘😘😘Anyway, gotta go spread awareness on BLM, chile","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:58:22Z"}},{"id":"6180548895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"elias.tapia","title":"Tiktok","rating":1,"review":"Trump you can’t take away tiktok but, if you do we are taking away your app!

Ya know, to show support for the president and all. But when i opened it I instantly heard a knock on my door. To my surprise, the Secret Service showed up and claimed that I was a Chinese spy attempting to gain foreign intel. While I tried to deny it, the handcuffed me and I was sentenced to a month in prison and 2 years on probation (mind you I had no lawyer). Once I got out, I DMed President Trump asking about the incident and he responded with “my bad 🤪” I am utterly OUTRAGED!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:57:25Z"}},{"id":"6180543539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hatlge","title":"No","rating":1,"review":"hello. i downloaded this app so i could see what trump has to offer. but then he threatened me until i promised i would vote for him. he also doxxed me on his twitter (my address & phone number 😱) and now there are MAGA cult members at my door. not to mention the 26 days it took to download. do not reccomend.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:57:04Z"}},{"id":"6180541443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ur mom 🙈","title":"LAUV🥵LAUV😍LAUV😿BY 🧚🏻LAUV😼","rating":1,"review":"I🥵 climbed 😱 out 👄 of 👶🏾 my 🧚🏻 head 👼 and 🧩watched🔫myself🦠 implode ⚡️ a😼thought 😿without❌a⚠️ body 💤outa🕥be🐝 the🏎shot 🚨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:56:34Z"}},{"id":"6180539998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"haseca","title":"Uses Personal Info!!","rating":1,"review":"I got the app to observe what President Trump’s plans were for the election. But it turns out that the app wants more of MY information than there is information on the app. This app asks for my address, my number, my email, and other personal information. I found this to be incredibly ironic, considering the fact that Trump wants to shut down the app Tiktok for taking Americans’ information, when his app demands ALL of our personal info. And, all of the information on this app is extremely vague and only mocking other candidates and politicians, which is disrespecting others in authority, exactly what Republicans are against. WOULD NOT recommend this app, or voting for President Trump again any time soon.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:56:13Z"}}]}
