I don’t like the design of it it’s to basic. This app was lagging and glitching so much I wanted to delete it right away. This whole process was a waste of minutes and hours of my life I hope it gets deleted and banned for ever.

Y’all notice how his ween looked like the ones on those Cupid paintings?  Anyway....takes waaay too long to download, like, did you really need a whole year??  I got the Trump 2020 app in 2019.  Very upsetting.  Then they need too much information. You don’t need my blood type, my ministration cycle, my address, and the days that my mom will not be home(for guys it asks for your pp size).  I think this app even gave my phone a bug in the place that you plug in the charger???  I don’t even know how.  It will literally take all of the space up on your phone, no matter how much space you have, goodbye all my apps...  Wish I could give it zero stars(please add that Apple~).  Ps- don’t know if this is related but the whole time I had this downloaded I could NOT drink water or walk downstairs.  This app is not for those who wish to live!","title":"You don’t want it.","date":"2020-07-10T04:36:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jimmy Dafood","rating":2}}]}
