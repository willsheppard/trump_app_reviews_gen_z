After downloading, my phone has never glitched more. My battery would barely charge. It also required so much personal info that is not necessary for general analysis. CREDIT CARD INFO UNNECESSARY. I feel like I may be robbed and even murdered by the government with the amount of info had to give them to continue. Left a very sour taste in my mouth. At least sleepy Joe Biden didn't destroy my phone's battery. I can never trust my president ever again.","userName":"mnm4004"}},{"id":"6177806256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:40Z","title":"THIS APP MADE ME WANNA DIE","rating":1,"review":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️💖✨Harry Styles told me to tpwk🤩💗🧚🏻\u200D♀️but except for you💕✨when ariana grande said just keep breathing 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💖 you were exclusion ✨ ✨ sis you ATE!💞✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️ maybe try dieting tho🥰💕You snapped💕🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ do you neck next time💖✨💐Did you have a good sleep🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌸💓please don’t wake up next time🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌸💗Baddie🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕✨but take out the bad✨🥰 shoot for the stars✨💞🧚🏻\u200D♀️ then your head🤩💞✨Everyone makes mistakes🥰✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️guess your parents make one too👑🤩💞 You dropped this👑💞 don’t pick it up🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰💗 You go girl🤩🥰✨ now don’t come back🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💞","userName":"mmmm nice"}},{"id":"6177782332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:35:29Z","title":"terrible","rating":1,"review":"this took 30 weeks to download and that’s not even the worst thing. the worst thing is that after waiting 30 weeks, i couldn’t even access the app. it’s like, why did i waste waiting 7 months for an app that doesn’t allow me to use it? TERRIBLE!! this is the worst app to exist because of how unpredictable it is. i eventually re-downloaded the app but came across the same problem. this honestly deserves less than one star.","userName":"Mecanpie"}},{"id":"6177765686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:30:27Z","title":"😚","rating":1,"review":"Well first of all- if you delete tik tok then we’ll just delete ur app- aka “the orange mans “gossiping” app but anyway why are you so worried about banning tik tok from the US but not worried or focusing on finding a cure for the corona virus and keeping our country in safety? That doesn’t sound like a very good president to me lol 😹❤️but just a heads up were gonna delete this app before u even try to delete tik tok 😻❤️now by us doing that u should probably already take a hint that nobody in this world could ever stan or like you.","userName":"thxicky nxicky"}},{"id":"6177762098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:29:22Z","title":"For banning tiktok","rating":1,"review":"don’t ban it we as kids have fun on that app we’re always happy on that app i don’t know why your banning it that’s the only app that we can spend time on and help people all over the world okay there’s no reason to ban it why would you tiktok needs to stay we all need it to stay the people that were not it helped kids not do any bands stuff at all it made us really positive and happy.

It made my phone turn orange, and it got overheated every time I went into the app. That night, I heard noises coming from my phone, so I opened it, and the 10-hour version of ”do you want to build a wall” was playing. My whole camera roll immediately filled with pictures of donny t’s nudes, so I deleted the app. I don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to be scarred.","userName":"Sophiethetrophy"}},{"id":"6177664110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:59:26Z","title":"This app bullied me 😩","rating":1,"review":"First of all I was so excited for this app! After waiting the entire month of June for it to download, I wanted all of my friends to also experience this as well, however, when I went to invite friends all that popped up was a message saying, to quote it exactly, “Haha you are such a loser. You have no friends! Nice try! Go back to watching anime!”  My feelings are so hurt! Bullying is not a joke. I don’t want anyone else to go through what I went through.","userName":"i'm very sad 😢"}},{"id":"6177623330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:16Z","title":"yucky 😡🍊","rating":1,"review":"GUYS I DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP \n\nthis is ✨biased✨ news it’s literally in the news category like whatttt. anyways if ur downloading this app unironically and ur not working for the gov, then u need help. this man has 40+ sexual assault and r4p3 allegations but ur not ready to talk ab that, he also isn’t doing anything ab CHILDREN being in CAGES, he called corona the “kungflu” (which is sooooo racist) and he’s a literal fascist ❤️ but u know the trump supports are all: we do not see 👨\u200D🦯 so u know OPEn ur mother f1ck1ing EYES. #settleforbiden2020. gen z won’t go down without a fight 👹😺","userName":"ⒹⓇⒶⒼⓄⓃ ⓁⓄⓋⒺⓇ"}},{"id":"6177560932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:26:15Z","title":"💕made me suicidal 🥳🥰😍","rating":1,"review":"i originally downloaded this app to see what my little orange rapist sexist racist friend was doing but was very disappointed to see that this indeed wasn’t good. Even though i may be a hater, he is doing better than someone with no political background whatsoever that objectifies woman and corrupts society as a whole while also being a horrible role model to his younger audience. oh wait, that is him. not to mention the dementia that this man obviously has. 💕👛👙🌸🌟thanks for reading and trying to ban tiktok","userName":"nooooo.🥰"}},{"id":"6177547192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:21:55Z","title":"terrible 😣","rating":1,"review":"this app is by far the worst app i have ever downloaded in my LIFE. the whole layout is cluttered and completely unorganized + the app in general is just unresponsive. but wait, that’s not even the worst part!! the app seemed to emit some kind of signal that made my pet roaches go crazy! whenever i opened the app they started screaming and jumping all over the place... they caused havoc! which is so unusual for my pets. but as soon as i closed the app, they stopped. all in all...
