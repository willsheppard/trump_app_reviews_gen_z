I didn’t even know iPhones could spray stuff at you! Then out of no where my phone starts to glitch and a video of this naked old man getting a spray tan pops up!! It was so discusting and his pp was so small and scrawny. Then it said that the video wouldn’t go away until i left a review! Well Mr. President... I’m leaving u a one star review bc now I’m orange and can’t go to my job interview later without looking like an ompaloompa and I had to see a naked video of an old man!!"}},{"id":"6173153874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"abducted","date":"2020-07-08T17:49:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Olivia CcCcCc","review":"i downloaded the app out of curiosity and when i did, THE SECRET SERVICE SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE AND TOOK MY DOG! then they said i had to make a video promoting the app and they wouldn’t have the secret aliens the government is hiding take away my house with their UFO’s. i did as i was told out of fear. they ended up taking my house for giggles and left my family and i homeless. luckily i made a deal that if they took my house, they have to release barron and Melania from the white house (#savebarrontrump)  and they contacted trump on their flip phones because they don’t deserve anything better 😌💅✨. they ended up giving me my house back because they said barron and melania know too much. barron if they’re reading this, let’s play roblox together :)"}},{"id":"6172959640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Orange and scary","date":"2020-07-08T16:48:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Didriet","review":"All the 5 star reviews are fake ❌ This is the worst app I’ve downloaded it took HOURSSSSS to download. You dont want to wait hours to download an useless app that’s going to glitch your phone 😔 After I opened the app I saw nude pictures of the president!! This got me traumatized!!! I was in shock to see this. Please if you don’t want your family to see this horror I suggest not download. I can confirm that my sister started crying, this is unacceptable. Oh I forgot to add that when you get out of the app the nude pictures come up and stays in your homescreen. It glitches your phone and you are stuck with the nude pic of this orange disgusting racist monster. FYI my phone is stuck so I had to type this review on my computer."}},{"id":"6172840877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP 😾😾😾😾😾","date":"2020-07-08T16:12:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"stream \"times we had\"","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of being informed about my ᖴᗩᐯOᖇITᗴ president, the one and only orange Donald Trump. But when I did get it I definitely didn’t expect this to happen. It gave me four different viruses. Two of which attacked my phone and the others attacked my family. As soon as I downloaded the app and put in my info, my whole family got threatening emails from the app creators saying they know where we live, they will find us, and infest our house with megacentipedes (which are bionic). I immediately deleted this app and went to my local police station and they didn’t help because they though i was FAKING. I would never lie when it comes to my favorite person, donald trump."}},{"id":"6172828417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Outrageous!!","date":"2020-07-08T16:08:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"blblblbllblblb","review":"This is by far THE WORST app i’ve ever used in my life!! it took sooo long to download and once it finally did it played sounds that made my lizard sing opera! Do you know how incredibly rude that is? I am disgusted and my lizard is won’t stop! Another problem is when it asked me for my mobile number it asked me on a date! i am married this is absolutely horrific. I can not wrap my mind around how people think this app is okay! I am in total shock. Another issue i ran into was the reasons oh my god i have never heard such poor poor excuses for why we should make him our president again. It’s so outrageous my dolphin drowned. rip Bobby Richard Edmond the third🥺. This app has caused to much pain to me! Horrible just horrible"}},{"id":"6172757308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do NOT Download","date":"2020-07-08T15:48:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Janet Nickleson","review":"this app is absolutely horrible. the software of the app is so poorly programmed. the app has slowed down my phone. it doesn’t perform at the same rate as it used to. i’m extremely disappointed that this app also glitches. it has caused my phone to overheat and shut down. this has not only happened once, but NUMEROUS times. the developers need to make SIGNIFICANT improvements to the bugs on this app. i don’t understand how you can think it’s okay to launch a poorly crafted app. this app isn’t marketable. i have uninstalled and reinstalled this app many times. i did this in hopes of it to work better. needless to say, i was disappointed. uninstalling and reinstalling didn’t do anything."}},{"id":"6172684663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever!!","date":"2020-07-08T15:27:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"All Presidents Matter💞","review":"This app needs to be removed immediately! Upon opening the app, all of the doors slammed shut and every window shattered. Like they had a mind of their own. It was as if the app, and the Trump Administration, has unleashed an evil spirit into my home. I have not been able to sleep since downloading the app. Every night. I see the ghost of Fred Trump Junior. He keeps asking me where we keep our alcohol. After hours of him begging, he finally finds some in his jacket and forces me to drink some too. The rancid, old vodka makes me hallucinate. I see visions of Donald Trump. All he does is talk about how beautiful Ivanka is. I just want some peace. I want my life to go back to normal. Please just remove this app. I believe it will appease their spirits."}},{"id":"6172501387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"A complete waste of time","date":"2020-07-08T14:36:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"TheBestGoatEver","review":"Why would you vote for a president that has not done anything for this country except hurt it and leave it scarred. When COVID-19 came to our country Trump had no idea what to do. A good president would’ve prevented our country from having the most COVID cases out of each country. How much longer until Trump makes a good decision the will help us benefit?\n       He almost sent our country to war with Iran and had the world ready for World War Three. He threatened the Mexicans with a wall that he never made. Lastly, the president is thinking about banning Chinese applications. It seems as if he hates other countries around the world. How much longer until Trump makes another country mad at the United States."}},{"id":"6172463715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T14:26:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Frannyvalle","review":"my whole family supports trump, but after this app we are dumping him. We all downloaded this app in the hopes to support our over bronzed god but instead we were all met with too many notifications telling us to rate this app with 5 stars. After a few days of having the app on our phones, all of our phones started to glitch. At first it was little things like the home button not working but it then became more and more noticeable. It got to a point where Siri would start up and read us all of trumps tweets and tell us to follow our leader and devote our souls to him. We are a good Christian family and this very much so disturbed us. Will not be voting red come the fall and DO NOT GET THIS APP!!"}}]}
