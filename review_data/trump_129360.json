All of the amazing merch and just the way the app was set up, amazing! I even put a couple of things in my cart to buy later. I put my phone down for a couple of minutes because I had to pick up my dog, Lucky from the groomers. I had to put my phone down because I was driving and I’m a safe driver always! So when I got back home with Lucky I get a notification from my bank telling me that 120.36 was taken out of my account!! 120.36 was taken out! I wondered where that may have come from? It was from this app right here! THIS APP RIGHT HERE! I was extremely distraught because it took out my bill money! So of course I called my bank and everything was fixed and I was happy again. So of course I put the items back into my cart because why not. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT DAY! I woke up and saw that the same amount was taken out from my account once again! THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME! FIX YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT OF AN APP! THIS APP IS A DISAPPOINTMENT!","date":"2020-07-09T06:58:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no ❤️"}},{"id":"6175471565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gfddgvjjgffg","review":"This app ruins my good vibes.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.
