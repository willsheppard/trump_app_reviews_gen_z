After about 6 months, the app finally downloaded. I was so excited to see what this app was all about! So I opened it and was shocked to see that I was greeted with very loud music coming from the app. I turned off my phone and went to go to sleep. When all of a sudden.... I see a very orange 🍊Oompa Loompa staring at me through my window! Of course I was very frightened, for I have a terrible fear of tiny orange men who think they know everything about everything. So I knew what I had to do. I ran into my attic where I kept my kids that I had kidnapped. I only had one little window in my attic for I did not want my children to see the outside world. Anyways, there’s no way 🍊 👨 would ever be able to get up and through that little 2cm window, right.... well I thought wrong. The next thing I knew, he was climbing through the window! Some how he made it though.. I don’t know how, but he did! And you know who he brought along with him? His man-looking wife. Milano Trump. I sacrificed the nine-and-a-half children I had to mr dump. He then proceeded to scream in my face, “RATE TRUMPY TRUMPY APP 5 STARS!” But I wasn’t taking this nonsense, so I PROCEEDED TO RENEGADE IN HIS FACE. Now obviously he wasn’t to happy about that because he wants tiktok BANNED FROM THE UNITED STATES! I wouldn’t have it! No, for I would STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. So I continued to renegade, and savage, and say-so in his face until finally, mr rump shrunk into a miniature size. I then picked him up, and threw him out the window. I did the same with his man-wife. I will forever be traumatized. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TOO.","title":"I ALMOST DIED FROM THIS APP!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:16:25Z","userName":"boogie356","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173232770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I do not like this app at all it gives me bad vibes.","title":"Orange potato chip","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:15:28Z","userName":"Kathleen Pessoa","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173212363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He molested my 13 year of sister","title":"Racist old man","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:08:45Z","userName":"Azgedaheda","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173206092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible, 0/10.","title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:06:40Z","userName":"jenna.wow","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173180670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This racist has an app um Chile anyways 👉🏾🚪","title":"Never again","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:58:24Z","userName":"jill3.1","isEdited":false}}]}
