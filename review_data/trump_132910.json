I wanna tell you what really happens. It took over three hours to install with good WiFi. When I got onto the app I was cursed with the sight of a rapist that looked like a Cheeto puff. I did some research and saw that it was our president and it was his app😳. I decided to ignore that and hoped it was still good. When I made my profile I had to put in my 📱# and zip code. I was fine with it until I saw the text that they sent me. It threatened me to leave a five star review by saying, “Welcome to the Trump 2020 App. We ask you to write a five star review, for we will hate it if we had to send our killer Cheeto ninjas your way.” I thought the other reviews about ninjas where fake! I ignored it and then I heard something outside my window. I looked out and saw the ninjas in orange suits. They looked like a bunch of mini Cheeto lords. When I turned around the lord Cheeto puff was standing by my door!! He said, “write the review and nobody gets hurt.” I told him I’ll write a review as soon as he leaves. He hesitated then walked away. He stood out the window and I showed him a fake five star review. He smiled then left in a black car. During this time I was with my little sister. Her screaming was the worst part about this.She’s allergic to Cheetos so she thought she was about to die. She’s calm now so everything’s back to normal. I recommend not to download this app in the fear it may happen to you too.","title":"🍊threatened to send ninjas.","date":"2020-07-08T21:01:15Z"}},{"id":"6173713553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpisaterribleleader","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is TERRIBLE, as soon as I downloaded it I stepped on a lego and fell into a pit of sharks I almost DIED. Also it took 69 years for the app to download, Trump also took 99.99% of my hard earned money.

OUT OF NO WHERE timothee chalamat and harry styles in form of platypuses came in. they were my celebrity crushes but they both killed me and my family. \nso in conclusion, i do not recommend this app. it gave us horrible trama and we are now in hell because we support a orange fat president.","title":"the worst app","date":"2020-07-08T21:00:56Z"}},{"id":"6173712714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Felicia 1028","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I would not recommend downloading this app because I am now emotionally scared. The app took 3 DAYS to download and we all know that is unacceptable. When I first opened the app it’s started chanting in what sounded like a foreign language and was on a loading screen for 2 HOURS, I couldn’t do anything else on my phone while it was frozen. When I finally loaded, it kept asking for my social security number and my address... I didn’t understand the purpose of this but I did it anyway. Once I have them this information my screen switched to, “Big chested ebony destroying tiny white penis while in a tree🧚🏽💕✨” I was forced to watch it the whole thing and surprisingly they broke the entire tree at the end, when they fell Donald Trump 🍊appeared and started having intercourse with the ebony while her neck was broken.  A week later I looked in to my email and saw my email is being  used to watch someone’s only fans, I can only assume my email was accessed through my social security number. The next day I opened the app again and that same chant started playing, next thing I know Mickey Mouse is peering around the corner. After staring at me for 2 minutes , he then attempted to rape me with his “mystery Mouseketool” which was 7 inches. I was in awe because ... he’s only a mouse. After he cornered me and successfully raped me, he disappeared and the chant played for the next 5 minutes. I had no other choice but to delete the app because of the damaged it caused to my mental state and now I will have to pay for years of therapy. Do not download this app.","title":"This app is very much giving me rapist vibe.","date":"2020-07-08T21:00:53Z"}},{"id":"6173711253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Leave american alone","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸✨🍄✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🌸✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🌸🌸🌸🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🌸✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🌸✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🌸🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🍄🌸🌸✨✨✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🌸🌸✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🌸🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🍄🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🍄🍄✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄✨🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🇺🇸🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌸🌸🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍄✨✨✨","title":"🌸🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🍄","date":"2020-07-08T21:00:20Z"}},{"id":"6173710183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vivioletae","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","title":"🗿","date":"2020-07-08T20:59:56Z"}}]}
