Want me to name some alright apps like jerk it and plant it. But let me tell u why this app sucked for me personally the second i opened this app my parents walked in and slapped tf out of me. After that I started crying and drank water the water was deadly someone wanted to kill me. I started chocking and couldn’t breathe then the legendary shaq o neal walked in and helped me up. He then threw me across the world till i was outside of the white house I looked at the white house. Then the app that i downloaded and I threw up on spot. After that I ran home all the way took about 1 min since im the flash. Then I was home alone so someone walked up behind me and did a purple nurple i did it back and it was a girl. I fell in love and we hung out more but then she took her makeup off and it was  donald trump. Dont trust girls ☠️😭🖤. This is why this app was just horrible thank you shaq.","date":"2020-07-08T14:23:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172434855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"edits111333","title":"My chettos came to life","review":"I love chettos so when i realized that big chetto puff man made a app i decided to download it. Oh my gosh it was amazing I could get all the chettos I want. I took my pennies and decided to buy some hot chettos. PERIODRTT. I bought them and then when i went home I could hear someone saying “praise the mighty juicy chetto puff.” I thought it was my younger sister fooling around so I went in my bag and ate them. When I took a bite from my first chetto I could feel weird blood/juice falling down my throat and I hear a little voice that sounded like trump saying “NOOOO!” I looked in my bag and I saw a bunch of chettos moving in my bag, I screamed and stomped on the bag and the chetto blood leaked through the bag and stained my white carpet. I looked outside and saw might juicy chetto puff trump outside, he was mad. He threaten to kill me and my family and he was about to enter the house. I deleted the app and he vanished. I lost my taste in chettos and now they are my biggest fear. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP.","date":"2020-07-08T14:18:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172263839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"leftylosie420","title":"Glitching and STEALING","review":"Hi yes. I downloaded this app because I was genuinely curious about what our president has to offer for 2020. Upon first opening, I quickly realized there wasn’t anything other than racist propaganda and an attempt to take human rights away from several minority groups and left wing voters. Then the screen went red, completely and asked for my card number. I figured it was only asking in case I wanted to donate to Trumps campaign. But after entering the information , the screen glitched out and the app shut down completely. At exactly 6 hours, 6 minutes, and 6 seconds after this happening, every single dollar in my bank account was drained and all my transaction history was erased. I don’t know what’s going on here but this isn’t what I want for America. I think the president is only to blame for this and I believe his sadistic agenda is the reason behind it. I’m highly upset but at least I know to vote left!","date":"2020-07-08T13:31:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172235653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"BunkerBoy.987.","title":"A Bear Mauled me","review":"So basically what happened was when I downloaded this app so that i could stay up to date with what our glorious president is doing during is campaign, as soon as I went to open the app it started flashing like crazy. I thought it was just a slight glitch because i knew MY president is the smartest man in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD and he could never let me down. So, I left my phone sit a while and then 15 minutes later my excitement overtook me so i tried again, at this point I was outside enjoying some carrots, because one day i wanna look like him too 🤤. But i opened my phone and it started making this HORRIBLE ringing noise and it wouldn’t stop and my dog was freaking out so i was told to go farther into the backyard to make it stop. Long story short a big fat bear cane running out of the woods because the sound was so offensive to him and then he mauled me when he figured out it was a Trump app. The hate in this world 🥺.","date":"2020-07-08T13:23:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177663717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"raeighlyn","title":"kinda musty smelling","review":"when i downloaded this app i expected a nice flower field made of orange poppies. instead i was greeted by a cheeto that seemed as though it had been left in the rain and got soggy. this was already a huge disappointment but i continued on hoping for the best. i was then greeted by misogyny and racism. gross ik. but i thought maybe it was to keep the white men paying attention. so i continued on, and then my phone started emitting this awful scent. the app crashed and then gave me a warning that said if i wear a mask i will risk the consequences. i’m guessing the consequences were a musty smelling phone? idk man but my phone used to have no smell at all. sometimes it’d smell like fabric softener when i’d leave it in my laundry room but that’s it. i highly recommend u DO NOT get this app and just rate it one star because it obviously is out to make everyone smell bad. it’s so rude honestly. anyway steer clear and keep the musty old garage smell away.","date":"2020-07-09T17:59:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177548239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"stananon2020","title":"i was MURDERED?!???! (NOT clickbait) *very emotional*","review":"guys do NOT download this app. i opened it up and was greeted with the face of a cheeto (???) who then immediately crawled through my screen into my house like something from the ring. he told me that if i wanted to live, i had to vote for him, but there were two problems with this: 1. i’m a democrat and 2. i want to die anyway 🤪 but i did not think he was serious when he told me this so i said no i will not vote for him and instantly he waterboarded me with cheap wine. when he asked again, i still said no then he branded me with the words KEEP AMERICA GREAT i said sir, america is not great, you made it worse. that made him really mad so he stabbed me in the throat with a corkscrew. unfortunately, i was still alive and i told him it is my destiny to outlive donald trump so pulled a reverse uno and took the corkscrew out of my neck and stabbed him with it, killing him immediately. i then bled out from my wounds, my destiny fulfilled.","date":"2020-07-09T17:22:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177538074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"brandilion23","title":"stinky poopoo man 🍊💩🐱💃🏽🥙","review":"i was trying to be a nice person 💙and download this app to support cheeto man but my phone kept crashing and cats 🐱began lickin👅 my toes🦶 so i immediately suspected the app. However, when i went to delete it, my phone had grown arms, legs, and a mouth 💪🦵👁👄👁and began cartwheeling away from me at alarming rates, giggling and squealing. Only after i baited it with mozzarella cheese 🧀and bean 🧆🥙salad was i able to catch it. Its little arms and legs flailing, I picked it up and just to be nice (and shut it up because it was screaming bloody 🔪🩸murder) I tried to feed it the bean cheese and but the stupid thing bit 🦷my finger🖕. Out of rage, I practically gassed💨 my house with the most profound fart i had ever produced in my entire life, and killed 😵my entire family. Thank god for the new zombie 🧟\u200D♀️🧟🧟\u200D♂️virus that brought them back to life, because my mom said that if she was still alive next week she’d get me Lucky Charms.

(rip meya 😥😓) i expect a new golden doodle soon my parents spent hard earned $3k on that dog 🤬🤬🤬 anyway, all in all; do NOT get this god forsaken app.❤️💕💝💗","date":"2020-07-09T17:01:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177423566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Bubblesthegoldfish273","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR UNCLE TO DIE","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to learn more about what President Trump is doing for this country. As I was scrolling through the app, I heard a window break. I ran into the bathroom and locked the door. I started dialing 911, but I stopped when I heard a familiar voice. I opened the bathroom door and saw Donald Trump standing in my living room, holding a gun to my pet goldfish’s head. I begged him not to shoot. I told him to kill me and let Bubbles the Goldfish live. He told me that he would let Bubbles live if I voted for him. I told him that I was voting for Kanye, and he shot the gun. Bubbles dogged the bullet and it ended up hitting my Great Uncle instead. Trump stared at me in disbelief when I didn’t cry or run to my uncle. I was glad he finally died, since he was jealous of Bubbles and tried to murder him several times. I dialed 911, but Trump was out the door and back in Washington by the time the police arrived. RIP Uncle Seymour. You will not be missed . <3","date":"2020-07-09T16:44:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177201960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"glimglomx","title":"Absolutely the worst app!!
