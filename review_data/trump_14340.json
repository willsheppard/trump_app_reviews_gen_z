This app made me not want to eat another Cheeto Puff ever again. If you like Cheeto Puffs please DO NOT GET THIS APP. This app literally stole my car. I woke up and my car was gone 😔 it just had to be this app.. it’s the only conclusion that makes sense to me. I mean who else would steal my car. I just wanted to support this poor lost Oompa Loompa. But there’s no helping him :( he’s Evil and the worst pedo- sorry I meant president ever.

When it finally opened I found that this app has no use. Completely useless. I decided to give it a chance and the longer I had it, it would glitch my phone even worse. I went to the phone store and they said I got a bad “virus or bug” from apps like this.

And I think this is so unnecessary and we really don’t need it. This is officially my least favorite app! I’m sorry if I made you sad but I really don’t need this up and I really don’t like it sorry to the people who like it but I do not love it and it’s super horrible.

You want this Cheeto man to be your next president. I’d rather have a PIG as my president, although that wouldn’t be much of a difference, if you spray paint the pig orange it’d look the same as trump. Oh and don’t forget the toupee on its head. Would definitely give less than a one star ⭐️ if I could. 👁👄👁. Just💫don’t🍎get🚙it🐒. Unless💨you 💩want🥦to🧚🏼projectile❤️vomit 🤢. Three emojis to describe trump: 🤢🐷🤡.

I decided to keep on looking at it and the things I saw where awful I now have to go to therapy to cope with the scary awful things I had to see on this app I strongly suggest to never allow children to see this app cause they may grow up to be j as awful and inconsiderate as the bunker boy.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"ava💛💛💛","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:55:13Z"}},{"id":"6174311716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Honestly this is the worst app ever created, it took me an entire 20 hours in order to download this app, while that was happening I experienced a death in family, so I would say this app causes death. It also takes up way too much  storage space on my phone, (to the creators) have you ever thought about minimizing the app size and/or getting rid of the app all together? Just an idea.","title":"no bueno","isEdited":false,"userName":"j-cake1022","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:41:37Z"}},{"id":"6174278368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app ever!!
