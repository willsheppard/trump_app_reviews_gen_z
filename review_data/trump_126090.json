It’s hard just even talking about this. DON’T DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE RUINED😫😭😭😭😭 it took ages to  download. It only downloaded when I took a cute photo of my toilet. It then proceeds to ask for my location?!?!?!? I trust doenlad trempy so I accepted and then soon after cops arrived to my house asking for my phone. I was very confused by this and I started panicking. I ended up fainting and went to the hospital. I still had my phone when I was lying in bed so I went back on the app to put my mobile phone number 🤠🤠🤠 BUT when I did I got a message with my “ verification code” which looked odd so first I translated it on this other app and it translated to “I hope you fall to your death eheheheheheheheheheh” I knew this had to be fake because doenald trmepy would never do this to anyone so I ignored it, which I shouldn’t have. the cops came because they heard I woke up and they saw my phone and took it then I ended up in jail for a few years. When I got out this app was no longer on my phone and I realized This all happened after this stupid app was downloaded on this phone. I’m am very traumatized by this app so I decided to warn others, and by the looks of other reviews it’s not great for others as well.","userName":"mytoebroken192help","title":"HELP!!!","rating":4,"date":"2020-07-09T23:53:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178674072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app 69 days ago and it’s been loading ever since.
