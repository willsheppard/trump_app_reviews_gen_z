Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. He wants to delete TikTok because my daughter wanted to go to the rally but couldn’t because I made her take her caterpillar for a walk😤. TikTok is her life and you want to take that away? No can do, you aren’t going down without a fight. So here’s some fairy comments.\n\nYou snapped💖✨🧚\u200D♀️🌸 next time make sure it’s your neck\n\nTrump 2020🌟🤩💖🧚\u200D♀️ but on a gravestone \n\nYou should go on a cruise🌟🤩💖🧚\u200D♀️ but make sure it’s the titanic\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk😚✌️","userName":"jcas11"}}]}
