If i could give it zero stars i would but unfortunately a 1 is the lowest it goes. I am so disappointed in this app because I thought I was signing up to play Subway Surfers but in fact there was a glitch and it took me to this!!! I do not recommend this app if you are looking for some fun on a daily basis. I repeat DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS NOT SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!! 😡😡😤","userName":"Shreks 2nd kid","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6178088648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:13:06Z","review":"One of the worst apps i have ever seen! My child accidentally downloaded this app and now she’s having a stroke. Who knows what it will do to other people. Please take this off the app store. It’s the most horrendous apps i’ve ever witnessed. For my child’s safety, i have directed her to watching Obama hugging kids to help her. It seems to be working. Again, please never use this app.","userName":"TrumpsStankyCooch","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App EVER!!"}},{"id":"6178082619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:11:06Z","review":"I keep trying to look through the app and it keeps crashing every time I hit a new section. I just want to be able to use it to keep informed on trump. But with all the app crashes it’s not working. I don’t get it. Haven’t had this big of a crash issue with any other app I have downloaded","userName":"Elizadooooolitle","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Crashes 24/7"}},{"id":"6178072679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:07:54Z","review":"Hi person from tiktok.

It kept making my phone glitch and bug out. I’m jealous of all the people saying it took two weeks to download. For me it took four! Not only is this app discriminatory towards me, it is slow and awful. It sent me an email saying I could only finish the download if I voted for Trump. Ridiculous! Deleted quickly.","userName":"hetryna69liketakashi","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"seriously horrible"}},{"id":"6178070640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:07:11Z","review":"This app is horrible it ruins my phone, it has never been the same since I downloaded it because it ruins the look of the other apps on my phone. This app also gives me PTSD from my traumatic experience that happened back in November of 2016. Please delete this app it gives me nightmares and I cry myself to sleep, such a disgrace on the App Store","userName":"real sad chiak","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I cried since 2016."}},{"id":"6178024918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:52:10Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see what my man trump is up to in the election, but it asks for all of my personal information. Like I don’t want to get texts about what he is eating for breakfast, or when he goes to the toilet (sadly it takes you to pictures too😓). Overall, this app just isn’t what I was expecting and I don’t recommend it","userName":"Ahsbevdn","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Dissapointing"}},{"id":"6178013032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:48:17Z","review":"After being on this app for just a few minutes, I began to notice strange things. My phone was acting weird and I started to have racist and xenophobic thoughts. I immediately deleted it and cam to write this review so others don’t do the same!! It’s crazy that the trump app made me think those things😳😳. No correlation whatsoever I’m sure.","userName":"Sparkle all over","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Very disappointed!"}},{"id":"6178008464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:46:47Z","review":"so let’s start off on when i first opened the app i did not expect to see a big orange on my screen... it was disgusting, i started throwing up for 3 hours, i ended up passing out then i woke up and saw jessie from jessie and she sang me a song abt texas guys😍🤟 then this guy named tony took her from me which was not polite at all so i left her...then i saw gabby hanna and omg does she talk a lot, she kept talking abt high school boolies and it was annoying 🙄 then she also sang a very horrible song to me but i think 21 pilots made the song 🥰 so unless you want to see jessie and gabby hanna this app is not worth it, trust me. trump 2020 on a  ✨g r a v e s t o n e ✨","userName":"your mom 😍😹","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i am radio rebel ❤️😍🤟"}},{"id":"6178007694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:46:32Z","review":"So I downloaded the app which was ok at first but then they started telling me about different apps I have on my phone then it started telling me to vote for trump with pop up notifications which I turned off then they kept showing up.
