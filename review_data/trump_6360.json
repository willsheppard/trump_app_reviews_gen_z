This country has had voter suppression for many years. It has kids in cages. And families being torn apart. Not to mention that if you go to the wrong side of a state or town, you may get killed for the color of your skin. The incompetent president isn’t doing anything for the country. All he cares about is his himself. \n\nP.S the app took forever to download and when it did download it was tracking my every move and stole all my data!!","date":"2020-07-09T10:34:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"manemisis","title":"Worst app ever!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176042333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is honestly so terrible and bad. I highly advise for no and I mean absolutely no one to ever be able to download it again. Right away it asked for my phone number which is inappropriate and it makes zero sense as to why. This app is HORRIBLE and should be takes down immediately!! I also believe that and don’t think it’s right for this child r@pist (Trump) to even be able to have an app of his own where he will be able to release false information about everything that is going on at the moment.","date":"2020-07-09T10:15:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"3771946","title":"😽🧚✨"}},{"id":"6176003500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is by far the worst app that I have ever downloaded! It took way to long to download and by the time it finished I was already annoyed but I didn’t wait that long for nothing. I checked out the app and it was absolutely terrible! It was super hard to navigate around the app and it just overall sucked. I then realized that I didn’t have time for this trash because I had to walk my pet lamp so I deleted it! This app COULD HAVE MADE MY PET LAMP SAD because it wasted my time in the first place and I could have missed walking my pet lamp!!! 😤😡🤬","date":"2020-07-09T10:03:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"No 💔","title":"Horrible App 🤮"}},{"id":"6175761166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have many complaints the first being it took 69 hours to download and as soon as it did all my photos were deleted and replaced with pictures of trump and his wife Kim Jong Un.  After i deleted the MANY horrific porno graphic photos i recieved multiple texts requesting money.  I DIDNT EVEN PUT MY PHONE NUMBER IN!!! The messages said very explicit NSFW stuff.  They attacked all the other fruits and stating that the orange is the supreme overlord.  Im furious, i was hoping to just play imessage games with mr T but instead i was ASSAULTED by his photos and messages.  I hope the updated fixes all dis.   👺👺👺👺👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T08:42:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"buzz queen","title":"Orange porno"}},{"id":"6175673210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So I wanted to support trump, right? Ya know the NORMAL thing to do. So I downloaded it. It took DAYS upon DAYS to download but when it finally did I couldn’t get onto my phone. I was being hacked and my IP address was stolen!! The next morning I wake up with swat vans everywhere and when I stepped outside of my house I could also see helicopters. Little orange oompa loompa men started rushing out of the vehicle and circled me while half of them went and stole every last furniture item in my house! Even my dog!! I would give this a 0/5 stars if I could, very disappointed and sad.","date":"2020-07-09T08:12:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Summer 231458265","title":"AWFUL"}},{"id":"6175670041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could see daddy Donald whenever I felt like it🤤 but instead I was greeted with a big orange blob 🤢🤢🤢 i could not WITHSTAND seeing that any longer so I decided to delete it. A few days go by and I notice my refrigerator was missing🤬🤬 like what?? Who would do that. Then I remembered the. Big. Orange. BLOB!!!!

Actually I had expected for my life to become great after downloading, but after what seemed like 4 years, it just hasn’t made the change that I had expected. Glitches upon glitches. Hiccup after hiccup. So I decided that the app needed to go because there just wasn’t any other reason to keep something so useless around. I’m afraid it’s just a glitch that can never be fixed, as it’s caused a lot of issues for many others who have tried it as well.","date":"2020-07-09T07:59:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"itsnotgreat","title":"Didn’t meet my expectations"}},{"id":"6175544023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Okay, okay! First OF ALL!\nI am appalled at this app! I came here because I was told that this app will give me TREMENDOUS results! And it has not given me any, whatsoever! He didn’t make and send his BEST app in the App Store...\nCan I be sincere? I still can’t eat Cheetos either! \nIt’s been a sad day for me, I loved Cheetos.\nThat’s just my honest opinion. \nThat’s just how I feel.\nAnd! And! It didn’t give me enough Covfefe as I expected.\nSo misleading, but!! I believe it can be great.... by being deleted. Thank you 😊\n\nAnd may I add something else Mr. TeenyTiny Hands President? I think I found a way to solve your cup holding dilemma. Try using a Dinosaur Grabber! As HANDS!🦖🦕.  It will look so much cooler and take away from your tiny hands! Hope that helps! XOX 💋 \nAlso! You ain’t fooling anyone with your hair trying to fly off and disowning your head. \nEl Tio Cosa also called and wants his brother back!","date":"2020-07-09T07:25:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jobis7","title":"Make This App Great Again!"}},{"id":"6175492867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is the worst app to ever exist. It took very long to download. The app also made me very uncomfortable. What it had on it was something that shouldn’t have been seen nor heard. As a man who looks for the good in things, I couldn’t find any here. The only thing good about it was nothing. I give this app a 0 but I can’t so 1. I which I could give it for I love to see the good in everything but there is no good to see in this app. It should be removed and not allowed to be seen by the public. Thank you Apple for your time and appreciation.🤮🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-09T07:05:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"the app stink","title":"The app stink"}},{"id":"6175228529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"the moment i downloaded this app i KNEW it was a mistake. pop ups and questionares asking me for personal information bombarded me as i was confronted with grotesque images of trump without a bra or his pacifier. furthermore about an hour after i downloaded the app arby’s as well as many other local restaurants began bringing food deliveries I DIDNT ORDER to my door and forcing me to pay. if i refused payment the deliver people would regurgitate the food into my mouth like a mother bird.  this is app is sickening and i hope i one day will recover. until then WEAR A MASK.","date":"2020-07-09T05:23:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"17284949403","title":"DO NOT GET UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION LEAKED"}}]}
