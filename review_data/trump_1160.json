I was scrolling through the app reading all about everything Trump said and stuff, but my ears started ringing, and then I remember the review of a fellow brown woman who said that similar things happened to her when she got this app. I then got really worried because I realized that I was going to feel really bad and that my house would get all screwed up and I wouldn’t know what to tell my parents! I don’t have enough money to pay for renovations! But I realized I couldn’t ask Trump to pay because he’s bankrupt. I don’t know why but I kept scrolling to see if what she said was all true about blurry vision and stuff, and guess what?? It’s all true! Once I reached the blurry eyes and the racist and sexist voices in my head I immediately deleted the app out of fear of the next stage: the president’s nudes! God help me!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:07Z"}},{"id":"6177556092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"patsypie3","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND","review":"Okay so I downloaded this app to get more information about the re-election campaign, but every time I clicked on the app it kept freezing my phone and making it crash. FINALLY after clicking it for the fifth time the app opened, but what I saw was petrifying. There was a big Cheeto smiling creepily at me through my phone. What’s worse is the app crashed and froze my phone again so I was stuck looking at that Cheeto. After much too long of a period of time, my phone unfroze BUT when I scrolled through my different apps they were glitching and freezing as well. Nothing like that had happened with them before I downloaded this app. After a couple days I came to the conclusion that it was because of this app that my phone kept acting up so once I deleted it (not to my surprise) my phone worked again. If you don’t wanna go through everything I did then do not download this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:45Z"}},{"id":"6177395000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Poop...duh??","rating":1,"title":"Sad","review":"I am an upper middle class conservative generational witch and I support our lord and savior Donald John Trump, so I got this app to help me manifest some positive vibes for this country. However, I was so disappointed in the quality of the app. My phone kept glitching on it, and it wasn’t because of the demons I summoned! I was so hyped up about hearing news about my Lord. I wanted to see where he will be with his campaign plans in order to prepare hexes that I would cast on these silly liberals. Ultimately, the notifications didn’t work. This app truly is very sad. To confirm how horrible this app has been functioning, I did a tarot card reading and got the tower card. Also, I keep having dreams about Donald Trump being the antichrist?? I need to light up some incense and meditate with my crystals after all of this disappointment. Yikes. Please, do better. Maybe even delete this app because this is not a good time for Geminis (which is Lord DJ Trump’s sign)😪😪","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:36:04Z"}},{"id":"6177122428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TinyOrangeHands","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THE APP (this app harassed me😡)","review":"This app brought me and my family a lot of struggle. The app took about 52 weeks to install. Then when I finally opened the app, my Alexa started yelling at me very aggressively which I was not expecting. Then she started playing Fox News on my tv which I tried to shut off, but it didn’t work. Then we tried to get out of our house and away from the loud sound of Fox News only to bombarded by a whole bunch of Karen’s not wearing a mask. My family tried to fight them off when suddenly my skin started turning orange and my hands shrink. I ran to my bathroom mirror only to see that I had a horrible spray tan on my face which made me look like an orange raccoon.  Then I tried to delete the app but my hands got too small to delete it so I couldn’t stop the actions of my mistakes. This has affected my family greatly, again DO NOT THIS APP. I don’t want anyone to experience what I went through.😢","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:10Z"}},{"id":"6176608740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DJ_Jensen0013","rating":1,"title":"Africa by Toto","review":"I hear the drums\nEchoing tonight\nBut she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation\nShe's coming in 12: 30 flight\nThe moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards\nSalvation\nI stopped an old man along the way,\nHoping to find some long forgotten words or ancinet melodies\nHe turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, it's waiting there for\nYou\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had\nThe wild dogs cry out in the night\nAs they grow restless longing for some solitary company\nI know that I must do what's right\nAs sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serangetti\nI seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that\nI've become\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had\n{Instrumental break}\nHurry boy, she's waiting there for you\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa, I passed some rains down in\nAfrica\nI bless the rains down in Africa, I passed some rains down in\nAfrica\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:01:19Z"}},{"id":"6176000004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zoyahasanoreo","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP GAVE ME COVID","review":"I used to be like you. I, a young man, once played online with friends. I once attended a school. I once talked to my friends. I never wanted to go down this road.\n\nIt started when my brother downloaded the Devil’s game. I never let him beat me in anything, so naturally, I downloaded it too. It seemed easy at first, tap the screen to get the bird/fish/whateveryouwanttocallit through the big Mario tubes. Then I died. I tapped between the tubes and died. I laughed at first. I’m far from laughing right now.\n\nI beat my brother’s high score, but kept going. I wanted to get to 100, I’ve already created this addiction, I’ve already made it to 70, so why not? Don’t set a goal. I got 99. 99. My mother has stopped feeding me. I don’t talk to anyone. I sit here and play. I’ve wet myself countless times not wanting to go to the bathroom and ruin my game. I’ve threatened to cut the fingers of my relatives off. I’ve thrown my cat out the window. I’ve created this addiction. I need help.\n\nI locked myself in the bathroom. I’m sitting in the bathtub writing this review, warning you NOT to download it. My family doesn’t dare to enter. My brother hasn’t taken a shower in a month.\n\nI’m cutting my fingers on the sharp edges of my cracked screen, but it’s worth it. A person reading this that doesn’t download this game is a life saved. Don’t end up like me.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:02:22Z"}},{"id":"6175984580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"evieeww","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever downloaded✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","review":"This app took over a day to download then crashed repeatedly while I tried to open the app. It took me 12 different tries on numerous occasions before the app would allow me too fully launch it. Then once on the app I realized how much WiFi and data it takes to run it. My data plan is not unlimited and by the end of the day I had ran out. It’s the 8th people the 8th! While the app was downloaded on my phone I also experienced my phone begin to lag a lot despite having an iPhone XR it got increasingly slower. Until I eventually deleted the app which caused my phone to be just as fast as it had previously been. Indicating the app caused my phone to be so slow. Due to all these reasons I wholeheartedly warn you to not download this app for the safety of your phone! I do not recommend and hope no one else has to go through this trauma. Keep safe from this app!🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨👑😙🍑✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:57:22Z"}},{"id":"6175570539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tartar girl","rating":1,"title":"I hate this app.","review":"Oh the things I have to say about this app. I could only dream of giving it zero starts but alas, that does not work here. This app is absolutely disgusting. As soon as I downloaded it I got a call from the guy in the white noise himself stating that he wanted to see me. He said if he doesn’t see me right now that I’ll be kicked out of the country or some bs. I tried so hard to get rid of him but he just would not leave me alone. This man took anything he could to send me the message. I’m talking phone, text message, email, snail mail, pigeon mail, fax, telepathically, etc. He even tried to meet me in person with a disguise but it want every convincing because all he did was take his toupee off. After months of being practically chased by him he stopped bothering me after I threatened to burn his fake hair off his head. Please please, listen to this message. Do not buy this app. It will bring him right to you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:32Z"}},{"id":"6174934344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shrekscoochiehair","rating":1,"title":"VERY below average","review":"trump being the best president there is, i thought this app would add to his many achievements like being the LEAST qualified to run a country, however i was very wrong. first, the app asked me to put in my phone number which was very confusing since i thought only chinese apps stole information. next it asked me if a was part of the lgbtq+ community, and when i went to click “yes” a notification popped up on the screen saying “you better not click that yes button otherwise you’re a snowflake libtard” and i was very offended since trump is so very open to the lgbtq+ community. lastly, to put the disappointing cherry on top, the app promised me the secret to trumps beautifully done tan. turns out, it was a lie! they don’t give you any information on how to achieve his great looks, which is false advertising. i would definitely NOT recommend this app to people who care about our country😝😽✨❤️😻😎🤑🎣🧿🧿","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:46:58Z"}},{"id":"6174602047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Big Bettu","rating":1,"title":"👁👄👁","review":"So when I downloaded this app I thought I was gonna see some cute pics of zaddy trumpie🥵.
