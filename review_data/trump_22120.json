It hacks into other things on your phone and steals the passwords to everything. The app itself just glitches all the time. It hacks into your social medias and tries to hack your friends too.

First, a horrific image of lipless Biff Tannen appeared on screen which spontaneously came to life and began throwing Reese’s Pieces at me. When I politely asked it to stop, the creature called me poor and shot me in the head. Incredibly disrespectful. Will be deleting the app until a proper update has been installed.","date":"2020-07-08T23:26:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174099445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ya_gal_al_","isEdited":false,"title":"Bunker boy","review":"So I opened the app to see a man with a very uneven tan so I showed it to my dog and he ran away (we miss you Fido😔) then I realized it was our president and it got me thinking....why did we let him in office...?

Incredibly unorganized. It’s like it’s run by a 3 year old child. Also needs an age warning definitely not appropriate for minors they have scary images of an Orange monster. Overall would not use ever again.","date":"2020-07-08T23:19:46Z","rating":1}}]}
