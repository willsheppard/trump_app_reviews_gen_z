But don’t worry it gave me its name once it beat the living heck out of me. It was Donald Trump Jr. the entire time and he’ll haunt you until you say your going to vote for his Cheeto Puff father. Anyways, it’s so nice to have my life back now. Do not download this app if you want to keep your house demon and Cheeto free.","userName":"Rachiec4756","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻✨🌟this app actually ruined my life🧚🏻✨🌟"}},{"id":"6177323788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:15:24Z","rating":1,"review":"As a trump supporter.

An extremely horrible experience would not recommend this app at all. With how its stats are looking right now it seems like it’s soon going to be deleted from the App Store and no one will be able to download it... what a shame ☕️","userName":"apdjaid","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6177267864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:59:34Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and when i opened it my phone turned on and off straight for 17 minutes. Then when that stopped I got 12 death threats through the app. This app is so scary I would rather stub each of my 13 toes individually while simultaneously getting my pinky finger smashed with a hammer and also being beaten by my father. This app is as horrible as President Orange himself.","userName":"mhelsel6","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🌿🧚🌿⭐️🥴✨"}},{"id":"6177266288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:59:05Z","rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app I saw a lot of words it hurt my brain all the words I sail where like small like how is this an app and plus when u opened the app I saw words words like he wants to take down TikTok and tik tok doesn’t have so many words like I want to enjoy summer without words like words are words and words love each other","userName":"Adrian.prieto3 times","isEdited":false,"title":"Sucky.

This app is his way of connecting with the younger, more technological generation but unfortunately for him the younger generation is appalled by the immoral and unethical behavior he exhibits every day. Not to mention his ignorant policies. Gen Z was brought into a dying world and we are here to fix it. Vote Blue 2020","userName":"👁👄👁🗣","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE, No Good, Offensive"}}]}
