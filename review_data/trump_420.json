Trump 😭does😎 not 😡stand for 🙄jenius 🤩like 😍i thought 🙂it might.😚 \n\nfirst off!! if i could give 0000 stars i would, i hate it here and all i feel is pain. i opened the app and immediately started to smell cheese off in the distance as if it was coming from my neighbors annual barbecue. i would rather do anything else than open this app again, it burned my eyes immensely. i opened the app immediately to see an orange stained man looking like he was going to cry upon first glance. but alas it turns out his under eye is sweating immensely. disgusting. the amount of wrinkles almost set me astray but i kept on keeping on and ventured into the app. \ni should’ve left. \nit was awful and felt like an acid trip. it makes me wish i was born in the 1300’s, where everyone died from the plague. my heart has quite actually been broke so many times i don’t even know what to believe anymore. my mother says it’s my fault but i don’t believe her. i would rather write this review on my samsung smart fridge 50 times with my pinkie toe than ever open this app again."}},{"id":"6173861762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"_Cooooo","date":"2020-07-08T21:56:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Had to change addresses and houses because of this app","review":"First of all, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It takes all your personal information and CAN and WILL blackmail you and your family’s life with it. First when I refused to put a trump 2020 sign in my front yard like the app instructed, my phone blew up and I lost an eye!! Then once I tried deleting it, my mother “mysteriously” went missing. I reported this to the police and they simply shrugged at me! They have still yet to even start looking. THE APP HAS YOUR LOCATION EVEN IF YOU TURN OFF YOUR LOCATION FOR THAT SPECIFIC APP!!!!!! I am convinced the app was designed to brainwash us into giving in and becoming sheep like         🖕🏻Trump🖕🏻 supporters! I will not go further into detail on everything bc of my new anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, bolemia, anorexia, ptsd, seizures, dyslexia, and schizophrenia that came with this app, but basically, I have no more family, I had to move away, I am not completely blind, and the worst part is that I can no longer speak and spend most of my time in the psych ward nowadays because of my severe personality disorders this app caused. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173046621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"aijqnamskw","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨💫💋💅🏽🎀 I H A T E   T H I S    A PP✨💫🎀💅🏽💋","review":"This is the WORST app I have ever gotten first of it took 10 years to download which made me wait ( I hate waiting) when it finally downloaded an orange man popped up on my screen he looked like a Oompa Loompa anyways as I was saying the 🍊 almost made me ✨💫 V O M I T 💫✨ which is bad for my dogs.

The first thing I had noticed was that my phone was running slower. And that my battery was draining faster. For reference, I owned one of the most recent iOS models, the iPhone 11. I am used to a long-lasting battery, but when using this app, I was constantly running back to a charger. Not to mention it crashed on me more often than I would prefer. This app is labeled “Official” but it is NOTHING of the sort. It needs to be taken off the App Store IMMEDIATELY. I was not even notified of Trump’s next public rally in New Hampshire! I fear it may even spread misinformation about the campaign, but I am unable to confirm as I couldn’t even run it on my phone. I believe my battery needs replacement now. My phone is constantly overheating. I just wanted a good, easy source of news, I’m taking my phone into a shop tomorrow for repairs and if that doesn’t work, I may have to buy an entire new one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."}},{"id":"6177453870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ellie elbow","date":"2020-07-09T16:53:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed..✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️","review":"So I came here because I love our orange non racist president that definitely supports BLM, along with other forms of equality for our non-binary homies, trans homies, etc. He most definitely supports people of color and definitely doesn’t wanna build a wall because he’s just a colonizer that’s is only good at stealing other people’s land and acting like it was his in the first place.. that’s definitely not him. Nor did he tell us soldiers/any army, navy, etc homies to shoot at protesters because they were some how doing the wrong thing.. even tho it’s our first amendment but whatever that’s definitely not him. I came here with high hopes that our orange president did something right and was yet again failed when he couldn’t even have a proper app installed. We got glitches, the robbing and spying on of my address and phone number which he is cancelling tiktok for when it’s just him being a pansy. But I most definitely love our orange queen and never thought this guy should go on death row😌🦕🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨ Yet again I came here with high hopes and was yet again not pleased.."}},{"id":"6175577359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️😝🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","date":"2020-07-09T07:38:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible terrifying and threatening😳","review":"I downloaded this app so I could support our wonderful, non-racist, non-homophobic, non-sexist, over all amazing president but when I went to download it it took several days to download. And when it finally downloaded I opened the app and received a startling message from it that said “If you do not vote for Trump 2020 and you delete this app there will be consequences for you and your family. We will not hesitate to remove you from this country(or the Earth) Sincerely, The Trump Administration” and well I was terrified for my family. But I mean leaving this country doesn’t sound so bad after all but nonetheless I was scared for myself and my family. Has anyone else gotten this message on the app? If so please let me know. After the message was sent I was informed that they had my location and other private information about myself and my family and I personally do no feel safe with this app. Would not recommend. I have also changed my mind on the president and his administration because of the app and alarming message I was sent."}},{"id":"6174857569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no one was here😂🌚😂","date":"2020-07-09T03:24:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I have to go to therapy now","review":"This app was out of proportion when I downloaded this app musics started playing which caused my gramma to fall down the stairs!!! when my grandma hit the floor she got up and started summoning roaches due to the music As the music was still playing my house was filled with roaches they proceeded by injecting them self with cleaning products due to the Music that song you should inject your self with cleaning products to make America great again trump 2020 this affecting me and my whole family When the music stopped I proceeded to take my grandma to the hospital but do to President🍊 canceling Obamacare I have no one to take care of my grandma!!!🙉 with that being said I want to the App Store and tried to delete this app when I tried deleting the app president 🍊🎃 popped on my screen and and started laughing after reporting to this app about my grandma falling down the stair And that I have an Eye witness That saw this happened His name is Karen he’s one of the roaches that were hypnotized by this music due to this app that why I gave this one ⭐️ sorry about grammar I was Born in Germany✌️"}},{"id":"6174319020","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"person 10.0b","date":"2020-07-09T00:44:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I almost died🤬😭😭","review":"I wanted rate this app then I was going to pressed 1 stars then then Karen’s bust down my door chanting “ RATE 5 STARS” I said “NO, GET OUT”. They were coming closer and closer then I had to jump out my window and run for my life. I ran for weeks straight with them straight with them and MORE chasing me. I got to the hype house and bust down the door screaming “ HELP ME” tony Lopez came up to me asking what wrong I said “Karen trump supporters are trying to kill me”.

He called the sway house and they all decided to to fight the evil Karen’s then I came out of his room with ondreaz and lil huddy next to me the Karen’s are chanting “ sacrifice”. I said “TAKE LIL HUDDY” as I throw him in the the evil Karen’s. They took him and made him into a trump supporter. Everyone cheered for my quick and \nsmart thinking. Tony and ondreaz went and talked tony said “ I like her bro” ondreaz  said “ me to”. They walked back to me kissed me on the cheek and said “will you marry us”. I said “ YESSS I LOVE YOU GUYS”. Now I live in the hype house with my 2 husbands. I love them so much. STILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT I ALMOST DIED!!!🤬🤬🤬😡"}}]}
