His supporters are typically middle to old - aged, racist, homophobic, and very conservative unable to accept that this is a nation of change and progress most possible through democratic values. I myself as a strong liberal, downloaded the app in hopes to understand the opposing parties views but instead I felt as if I was being pressured into a terrorist-type of group? What group you ask? Oh the Republicans of course. Now, I may not agree with this party’s views, we are a united nation and I can at least show basic moral respect to them. However, these “Trumpards” on this app have ruined their party’s reputation and I cannot say I have met one of his supporters who’s views weren’t racist or evident of white supremacy. Lately, he was even ridiculed by teenagers of a prominent social media app named Tik Tok. These teenagers & millennials mass booked tickets to his rally online to voice their opinions in a world where they had little political freedom at their mere young ages. Their activism and dedication to the politics of this nation have instead been ignored and being targeted instead through the recent government decision to consider deleting the app. By silencing the voices of these young citizens, Trump is only revealing the kind of person he is. Hence, I have no choice but to leave a 1 star review for a man with an intelligence I would rate as a 1 star if possible. #settleforbiden2020"}},{"id":"6178333592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:39:33Z","title":"bad news","userName":"bad news mane","review":"honestly it didn’t work 🙄. and and gen z you will never win"}},{"id":"6178328831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:37:43Z","title":"Trump in a drump 2020","userName":"app that is trash","review":"He voted to eat my head I hate him now what a bad boy"}},{"id":"6178322815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:35:30Z","title":"Oopsie🙈✨","userName":"BOOTS WITH THE FUR✨","review":"Man o ugly this was gonna have some real drip but na, it had some weird fits not cool man ‼️‼️🤡🤡"}},{"id":"6178314900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:32:31Z","title":"kanye2020","userName":"TNTBOM ER IS MY TANKI NAME","review":"i downloaded this app to see what my loving president of america was doing this upcoming election but he doxed me and theres random people stalking me at night😖"}}]}
