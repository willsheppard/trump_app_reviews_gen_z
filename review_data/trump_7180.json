She than started to becoming distant and acted very weird like she was anxious all the time. When I confronted her about it she started screaming and saying they were coming and when I asked who she started rocking back and forth than just ran out of the room. Later that day I called her family asking how she was and they said that she was supposed to be with me but she wasn’t. I haven’t seen her since that day. I think ‘they’ got her.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173063764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A disgrace","userName":"nyah💜🦋","date":"2020-07-08T17:21:03Z","review":"I’ve tried multiple times to get involved or view a campaign but it won’t work I’ve downloaded and deleted it 2x but it’s still doesn’t work. It’s not my WiFi my kids have tried to the lo and they said there is NOTHING they could possibly do. Also my points keep disappearing I don’t appreciate it because I had a ton. Also I’d press to open the app and it closes it automatically and when I come back it restarts all my previous data. It so hard to maintain and is acting like an obnoxious child. I DONT RECOMMEND.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173047555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why can’t I do zero stars?","userName":"ann nnbbb","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:56Z","review":"You wanna know how long it took to download? With three full bars of WiFi thingys? No joke deadass a week. I wouldn’t lie about that. When it did work it just said false news about how a rapist should be president? Idk that’s messed up man. Anyways it showed pictures of a really R E A L L Y scary man. He was orange, fat, had the worst side profile ever, and his hair isn’t even real. I threw my phone away when I opened the app and my dog got it out of the trash and even he was scared of the man. I’d advise to refrain from putting scary orange men on the front page.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172855180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!","userName":"Mabel mand","date":"2020-07-08T16:16:39Z","review":"I as a 30 year old women, I say that this app is horrible right off the bat! Whoever’s idea it was to make this is needs mental and physical therapy! It Is disrespectful and incredibly disrespectful that trump supporters call us babies and say that most of us are childish. WE ARE NOT KIDS! Dont disrespect people who don’t like your racist president . Cause we don’t like your moms and you don’t hear us complaining about it do you ? no that’s what I thought!

One minute I’m watching television happily and the next minute BAM there’s a strange apparition standing in my doorway which is especially inconvenient since that is the only way to get to the bathroom. What am I supposed to do now? Go to my neighbors?  This app is the only thing that changed in my life so I assume it must be it. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP unless you are OK with being haunted by potential malignant entities","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172700174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Garbage.","userName":"Nick Jonas left toe nail","date":"2020-07-08T15:32:05Z","review":"Worst app i have ever downloaded. it’s full of glitches and will never work properly. not to mention ever time i open the app i am bombarded by incredibly horrid ideas on how to run this country. the app is almost like a drama page, ever article points a finger at someone. no real ideas are presented. by far the worst campaign app i have ever seen. not to mention, what kind of a president waste valuable time and resources by trying to shut down a child’s app? the kids of this country really hurt his feelings huh? maybe focus on the global pandemic.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172686353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Eric Shun is worried","userName":"woah its a reviewer","date":"2020-07-08T15:28:15Z","review":"i downloaded this app to keep myself up to date on our president, Donald Trump, during these hard times. what i have seen while in this app is absolutely horrible. \n\nfirstly the app took forever to download and my phone would crash if i clicked on any other app while the downloading was carrying on. it got so bad that i had to leave my phone in a dark corner next to my life size cardboard cut out of president Trump in hopes that he could fix it. the download lasted about 30 hours by the time it was able to be used. \n\nsecondly i was required to put my phone number in to sign up for the app. i believe the president has sold my phone number to those darn telemarketers because now all i get are advertising messages every hour that have slowed my phone down to a minimum. \n\nthank you for your help - Eric Shun","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172496383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no😘🧚🏾\u200D♂️😍✨🍃🥰❤️","userName":"no❤️😍🍃✨🥰🧚🏾\u200D♂️😘❤️","date":"2020-07-08T14:35:01Z","review":"when i opened the app,📲 i was horrified to see the big🐀, fat, round, leader of the troompa loompas🦧. it was very painful🤕. it was so painful that it caused a brain aneurysm😵. i puked🤢 up everything i ate🤮 in the last two days🌞. it told me it wanted to keep amerikkka❌ great but this 💩hole country was never great. and if anything the leader🦧 of the troompa loompas himself has only divided🙊the country by promoting racism👎, homophobia👎, transphobia👎, sexism❌, xenophobia❌, and white supremacy❌😖. he has never done anything great or even ok for this country. would not recommend him or this 😡stupid app. 🇱🇷🇱🇷TrUmP 2o02 🇱🇷🇱🇷🤪","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172471942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely horrendously terribly bad😡😡","userName":"••Grayson••","date":"2020-07-08T14:28:24Z","review":"So I downloaded the app right bc we all love our orange saggy racist president and not even 30 seconds after I opened the app my darling baby hamster drops dead.. I thought wow what a sad coincidence.. but as I walk over to her cage I see she’s lying belly to the sky and on her belly there’s the words “trump 2020 or else” I immediately threw up and the shear force of throwing up knocked me backwards and out my window and as I open my eyes the first thing I see are 3!! 3!!
