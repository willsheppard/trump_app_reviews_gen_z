I can’t believe how terrible it glitches and made my phone lag after all I just want to see all the.. justice.. and equality our president spreads.

After it finally downloaded i went into my other apps and I kept getting weird advertisements of graphic inappropriate pictures. I dont know if the Donald Trump app did this but it started happening ever since I downloaded it. Also every time I open the app it would crash and shut down my phone completely . This app will ruin your phone do not buy it.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:58:18Z","userName":"Malania <3","title":"Do not recommend","rating":1}},{"id":"6173808256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have never in my life written a review but this app has pushed me to do so. As a muslim trump supporter I believed trump wasn’t racist. but once i opened the app it started swearing at me and calling me names you wouldn’t want to know. i would usually excuse trumps racist past but it has pushed the limit. i am now on the streets homeless because the app has made me so. this is my truth and i encourage everyone else to say theirs too❤️. if i could rate it zero stars i would","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:36:14Z","userName":"barron bunker boy trump","title":"the app is racist🤬🤬","rating":1}},{"id":"6173789698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded in my whole life...and I’ve had best fiends. Took hours to download, the app always crashes, the functions were designed in the least user friendly way possible. It’s just one terrible glitchy mess. I would expect much better from the president with such a large campaigning budget. I guess he just chooses to allocate money into other worthless causes. That’s besides the point...

I downloaded it so I could DEFINITELY support the trump campaign🥵. Sadly when I opened this app it admitted a terrible frequency that ended up with my dog profusely seizing. I had to fully shut down my phone for it to stop😶😶. Then later that day my turtle 🐢 started drowning and then it threw up.😕😢.

The app glitches my phone soooo much and it took days to download 🥴 it makes me phone reek of onions and attracts all kinds of animals into my home 🥺 the amount of notifications it sends me oh my god. One time it asked me to send baby feet pics. Absolutely disgusting. Do not download. If you are smart enough leave another bad rating because it needs to be taken down!

Gave me hives and made me cry. It took almost 4 years to download and provided me with practically nothing. Can’t keep promises including, but not limited to, eliminating federal debt which is actually up, not down, hasn’t even released tax returns and we can’t forget the promise to sue “accusers” of sexual misconduct. Now those are all signs of guilt. Plus it’s ugly. Hate the way it looks on my phone. THE WORST I’d give it no stars if I could.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:30:15Z","userName":"Felonymelon","title":"Just the worst...","rating":1}}]}
