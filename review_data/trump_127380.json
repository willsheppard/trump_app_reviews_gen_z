The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","date":"2020-07-09T18:16:45Z","title":"🍤this app sucks🍤"}},{"id":"6177718537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"rafa v 213","review":"F*ck Trump","date":"2020-07-09T18:16:16Z","title":"Trump is a 🤡"}},{"id":"6177717479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"saniyahkh","review":"I just wanted to support my favorite orange clown when the app suddenly asked for my phone number. The VERY NEXT day I open the door to a huge amazon package, and guess what’s inside! It’s trump. He asked me to come with him, but I came to my senses and refused. You might wonder why, and it is because he is a rapist who allows for children to be in cages. Not only that, he is clearly racist and has said horrible things about women. He told me I would regret not coming with him, then asked his poor wife to pick him up. The day after that, my phone started displaying a orange tint... not only that my camera roll is filled with pictures of trump and Kanye. That’s not the worst part. My cat started to cry whenever I opened the app, and when I took her to the vet I was shocked. The vet explained how the app gave off “orange radiation” which was effecting my poor cat, subhan. This also explains why trump himself is so wrinkly and fat, since he is the source to this orange radiation. Unfortunately my cat passed away recently, and I’m in shock. Trump really stuck to his word and killed my cat. Also all apps matter.","date":"2020-07-09T18:15:58Z","title":"THIS APP KILLED MY CAT"}},{"id":"6177715325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jadhsond","review":"I downloaded this app and got explosive diarrhea three seconds after. I’m an intelligent person, and I truly believe this app has the power to give you think stinkiest, runniest, most repulsive poops you’ve ever had in your life. I hope before you download this app you consider my experience. I\nhad to flush THREE times before finishing because I could not handle the ferocious smell that was my poop. I wish you all good luck with your poop.","date":"2020-07-09T18:15:19Z","title":"Disappointing"}},{"id":"6177714146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Black lives matterr","review":"I got the app then a mf hot Cheeto with Elmo  was  was just standing there then my phone started playing Barney😡then I ternd my phone off and it showed a picture of ilovefirday then jojo then 8 passengers then my mom was screaming then she said her some one hacked in her card then her phone said TRUMP 2020 has now got your location😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡and now we have to move arcoss the state😡😡☁️and the worst thing is it won’t delete of my phone is says”you can only delete this app if you pay a fine of $1000000”😡😡😡😡like what and every one will think I'm a trump supporter😡","date":"2020-07-09T18:14:58Z","title":"😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6177712821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ghzx s","review":"BᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","date":"2020-07-09T18:14:34Z","title":"🧚🏻✨tiktok🧚🏻✨"}},{"id":"6177712429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"janesof","review":"Every time I tried to open this app, it just shows me pictures and videos of a former YouTube star–the annoying orange.

It made my life 1000000000000x times harder. I wanted to get a view of what’s going on in our fantastic country with our “great” presidente. Well I was WRONG. Just WRONG. It made me verify my sexuality, my race, what party I stand with, my religion. Nasty. Horrendous. Gross.
