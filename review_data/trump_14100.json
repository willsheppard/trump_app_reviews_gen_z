You would think this would be a safe app to use but I guess not. I will also like to say that it makes the phone run slower and die quicker. Some people I know couldn’t even delete the app and it automatically gave the app a five star review and it is completely rude.","date":"2020-07-09T01:13:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6174407837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kiwi2k18","review":"I was expecting to be greeted with some good content related to hating people because of their skin color, gender, sexuality, or native county/territory but no. I was met with a strange man in Steven Universe underwear who was trying to teach me basic human rights. This is an infringement of my 2nd amendment and frankly inexcusable. Honestly I wish to speak to the manager about the quality and functionality of this app. Plus it was, orange, ugly and full of glitches so...yeah.","date":"2020-07-09T01:12:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"-100 points for being awful"}},{"id":"6174390930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ᴍᴏᴄʜɪᴄʜɪ","review":"I open the app and see a cheeto holding a fist. how disrespectful!! he could hurt someone!!!! not helping he had a wig on!!! how dare he. lying the fact that he’s balding! it’s making me put my number in and what if that cheeto calls me!! i don’t wanna be there for that!!!! that is SO disrespectful. it says keep america great when it’s so trashed by him!!! the cheeto stole money from charity and over all a pedo!!!! i would never recommend this app to my kids!!!","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"very bad 😭🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6174387070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Thiccest bum","review":"I hate this app so much.

But then the app started to buffer. I got out of the app and then when I deleted it, they sent a dead rat to my door. At first I thought not much of it until I saw my security footage and an ugly Cheeto was the one that dropped it off. I tried to shrug it off but it hacked my phone and made a picture of some ugly old man spray tanning naked my lock screen. The app is horrible. Don’t download it!😾","date":"2020-07-09T01:00:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible😾"}},{"id":"6174291798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AhytyAJ","review":"I downloaded the app and immediately when I open it a large orange zombie manAppeared on my screen and I just had to go to get out it made my phone glitch in the donut took all the hours that you can imagine for a simple after work so I deleted it because I didn’t found anything special about it and decided to make my phone glitchy and terrible to use now, so yeah thanks✨","date":"2020-07-09T00:34:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"just... nope✌🏼"}},{"id":"6174279275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DaffyBetty","review":"So when I first downloaded this app this big Cheeto pops up on my screen and It almost burned the outer part of my eye and so when it burned my eyes (420 degree burns btw), when I dropped my phone my great great cat looked at my phone and DIED.

As it asked me to put my phone # in, I felt my soul begin to deteriorate.  A few minutes later, I began to projectile vomit, and developed a tremor in my left pinky toe.   I was rushed to the ER, where the doctors told me I only had days to live.  In my last dying words, I give this app a 1/5, in hopes to save others from true destruction.   May the world see brighter days","date":"2020-07-09T00:27:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My last words"}},{"id":"6174267215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"swaggygor1","review":"I opened the app and IMMEDIATELY saw a horrific image of a very orange wrinkled man. 🍊 then as I went to delete the app, a naked Cheeto puff CRAWLED OUT OF MY SCREEN and started to harass me! I was very traumatized of the images I was seeing. I was just trying to download this app because I wanted an orange glow spray tan just like the man trump himself. BUT NO! Then I told my aunts cousins sisters dogs chew toy and he said the same thing happened to him! So after that 😞THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! I demand this app to be taken off the App Store IMMEDIATELY!","date":"2020-07-09T00:26:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"MADE ME NAUSEOUS 🤧🤢!"}}]}
