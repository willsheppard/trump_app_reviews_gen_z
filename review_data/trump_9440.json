I was expecting to vote for trump but instead was greeted with horrible photo when I opened the app. That thing on my screen looked like a rat and had to rinse my eyes repeatedly for at least three hours. Even worse the opening screen said “keep America great” which is a horrible lie considering the history of this country. I will be uninstalling the app. Bernie 2020😗✌🏾","date":"2020-07-01T17:43:48Z","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145089808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"lmaotherearenonicknamesleft","review":"I wanted to get this app to support our wonderful president, and was sure the one star reviews were bogus. When I opened the app I was hoping to see rally information, merch, and President Trump! Instead what I saw was horrifying. It was an image of a GINORMOUS cheeto, molding around the edges. There was some type of cat hairball on the top and the orange color of the cheeto was too much for my eyes to handle! I went blind in one eye and can only see that disgusting cheeto orange color. Do not install this app if you want your eyesight.","date":"2020-07-01T17:25:29Z","title":"TRAUMATIZING","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6144739324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Person 112435786","review":"I got this app and let it download while I took my pet fly Fredrick to a restraint for his birthday and then went home I THEN WENT ON THE APP AND IT ATE FREDRICK so now my pet fly is dead.

The app is glitchy and lags, and for days at a time when I open the app, it just stays at a completely blank white screen. It often freezes my phone and causes me to have to let my phone DIE to close the app. It won’t even let me restart my phone when this happens! Truly an awful app, I can’t recommend it to anyone. Disappointing.","date":"2020-06-29T21:09:31Z","title":"Absolutely awful.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6135866621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"tinycellist","review":"dear trump,\nwhy would you do this to me? you have coerced me into downloading this app so i can get you elected once more, but the app has both spit on my face as soon as i opened it, and called me a do nothing democrat! i don’t know what to do anymore bro!! i love you with my whole heart! i ever nave a cardboard cutout of you that i make out with before i go to bed! this is the ultimate betrayal.
