They asked for my number, like creepy. After all the hassle, I was bombarded with notifications and calls. Coincidentally got more calls from spam companies. The worst app ever. Deleting and going to download Tiktok instead. At least Tiktok will make me happy while potentially stealing my info.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:45:32Z","title":"No likey","userName":"Lizzy Sears","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172525730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hate this app I don’t get how he is still our President he is Orange 😭😭😭this app needs to be no more.

This app hurt my eyes and took five hours to download and my\nConnection here is just great. Anyway, once he learns to respect people that can’t control their skin tone, religion, gender, and sexuality, Maybe I’ll learn to respect him. I also don’t usually have a president that looks like a snack I eat called Cheetos.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:35:08Z","title":"No❤️","userName":"Oogly.Googly","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172484889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to see what trump was about, but the app was absolutely awful. The design is crap, there isn’t enough good information, and there is a bunch of false information. If I could give this app a zero star, like I would give to trumps time in the White House, I would! It doesn’t even deserve 1 star! Period.

Sure the fake news media says he’s doing bad things but this app is nothing like Fox News. Fox News is the only place where I get my News and this app caused me to have a stroke. So no I will not be using this app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:28:50Z","title":"Trump 2020 🧚🏽\u200D♂️💅💕 Simpson’s version 🧚\u200D♀️🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨💫","userName":"karen united","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172443063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This whole app doesn’t make sense. When I first downloaded it, after 15 minutes my phone started getting super hot. And when I say super hot I mean I couldn’t even hold it in my hand, so then I deleted the app cause it was the only new thing on my phone and within 5 minutes, it was returned to normal heat. Anywho please don’t download the app it will BURN your phone.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:20:38Z","title":"Hot phone","userName":"Funny nerd loser friend","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172409629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app, the first that showed up was a picture of Donald trump naked while sucking a popsicle🤮🤮 I am writing this review on another phone because my first one completely stopped working because of all the naked Donald trump viruses. If you don’t want naked Donald trump pictures on your phone for your kids to see, than don’t download this app🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:11:32Z","title":"This app is the worst","userName":"Time Dio","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172259643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve been trying to get on the app it glitches out . I even been to the phone store paid 120 dollars to get my phone fixed turns out .. the app was the problem . All I was trying to do was try and to the next talk but I’ve changed my mind it’s disgusting that you have a app that doesn’t work so Iam no longer a trump supporter. #BOONASTYTRUMP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:30:24Z","title":"This app is horrible . 👎","userName":"eat the coronavirus","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172209009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is generally just so obnoxious, right when i got it i already started to have issues with my phone. not only that i feel very lied to.... i was told i would get freedom/justice for all but then this orange manky was elected, not only that right when i downloaded the app my dead cat ran away???? you owe me a new cat, new country, and a hour of my time back.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:16:26Z","title":"I’m disgusted!!","userName":"helen kellers left ear","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172197877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting to better understand Trump’s platform and future plans. Instead all I found was fascist propaganda that only an idiot with 3 brain cells could possibly believe. Trump is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, etc. This app was horribly put together and only spewed lies and hate. I was pushed so far left by this app that Beyoncé wouldn’t feel a need to sing irreplaceable anymore. Trump has zero chance of winning the election and I hope all of you bootlickers enjoy him while he lasts. \n\nTo my lefty besties ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🦋 def DONT give this app 1 star💕✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️\n\n#Defundthepolice\n#AbolishICE\n#ACAB\n#blacklivesmatter\n#settleforbiden\n#votebluenomatterwho","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:13:24Z","title":"💕✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️ STAN BERNIE FOR CLEAR SKIN","userName":"racist app racist app","isEdited":false}}]}
