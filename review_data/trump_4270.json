He is the first president to understand my white, privileged family, I didn’t think we could get more privileged but he proved otherwise. The app itself was very glitchy and once I put my phone number in they would not stop messaging me. Waste of storage on your phone. I could recommend upgrades to this app such as making it for barron instead. It also put a virus on my phone and now my social media’s keep getting hacked and when I was in the app p*rn kept popping up and I’m a minor so that was scary. Anywho I wouldn’t recommend.","userName":"baddie town","isEdited":false,"title":"Not good"}},{"id":"6177024193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:09Z","rating":1,"review":"I took a crap on the front porch now I have to clean it up can someone please help me this is not a joke this is not a joke why did this happen to me why me why do I have to clean up with just a paper towel one paper towel what am I gonna do with one paper towel this thing is huge like massive there's like not something you could just clean up with one paper towel I'm gonna end up having to get all the stuff on my hands and it's going to be annoying OK is this clear does anybody know what I can do could you please give me a tip so I could get this easier you know because I took a big booty big big huge massive crap thank you","userName":"Ramen is my life","isEdited":false,"title":"😡"}},{"id":"6176901598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:18:34Z","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app it genuinely took 10 days to download and I could not do anything else during that time and it glitched my whole phone and played a song and an orange screen was the only thing I could see the whole time. The music brought the worst of the worst. Most scariest things appeared at my house. The angry ants 😡🐜 they came marching one by one to the music playing and they carried away all my cows along with my family dog :( 🤠 and my phone. They carried a trump 2020 flag and they stomped all over me. The app has brought death apon my whole family and we are now grieving our cows and dog :( RIP ROSA ✊🏻 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!","userName":"AllSTarK123401","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app here, very violent"}},{"id":"6176736462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:05Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and I was super excited about it. But once I opened it, it was just a black screen.... then my power went out. I thought, well that’s weird. As I was trying to navigate my house im the dark I heard the floor creak behind me (I’m the only one home). I froze in fear. I strong sent of baby powder and Cheetos wafted into my nose. I turned around only to see Donald Trump standing behind me!! HOW WEIRD!!! I asked him what he’s doing in my house, he didn’t say anymore. He was leaning toward me, very awkwardly, I really thought he was going to fall over on me. \nAfter a bit he smiled, touched my hair and smelled my face. AND THEN HE RAN AWAY!!! WHAT IS THAT??!!

Do not recommend to people with common sense. Our president is the worst president to ever exist and my grandma’s friend’s cousin’s nephew’s fiancé’s granddaughter’s cat died from trumps disgusting STENCH. (She is a super cat and can smell things through devices, duh.. also the smell she smelled was trumps diapers that he didn’t change...)Also we know that you use self tan trump you look like a raccoon.

Worst of all after trying to delete the app it proceeded to give me 57 different are you sure messages and when that finally let up and I deleted the app after hours it SET MY PHONE ON FIRE. I urge you to take this app off the App Store so no one else has to deal with their house catching on fire due to their phone spontaneously combusting.

Next thing u know a virus was in my phone and it kept saying put in dirty water. My dumb self did it and guess what grew from it. Donald Cheeto puff dump.  He stole my pet pickle and ate it. Then he got sucked back into the phone before I could delete it. I tried but went into a world where Cheeto was. I got lost in the sweat rain area. And I found me Cheeto and I ran he tripped over his fat jelly legs and drowned in his sweat. I got out of the Cheeto dusty world and deleted the app but sadly all my items where missing so I had to call my witch maid to fly me to the North Pole to get summer. Then fly me to target to get Walmart.
