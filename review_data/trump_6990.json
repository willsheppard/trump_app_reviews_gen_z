So once my grandpa got his first cellphone i helped my grandpa get this app. A week after downloading the app he hated it! Not only did the app take days to download (mind you any other app we tried to download took a few seconds to download) but it was very glitchy. My grandpa was very disappointed with how unprofessional this app is. And i’m so upset that this gave my grandpa with high blood pressure so much stress. I really don’t like this app and i just thought i should express how i felt.","userName":"123321xyzbca","title":"horrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:11:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174758171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"everytime i opened the app, my dog would go to the store. he would say he was going to get milk but he never came back. so i kept getting new dogs, but every time i would open the app, they would go to store to “get milk”. i have lost 69 dogs due to this app. then harry styles came over and gave me a dog named carrots. then i took a chance and opened the app and THEN MY POOR CARROTS LEFT TOO. HE JUMPED IN A MICROWAVE AND THEN WENT TO GET GOAT MILK FROM ARGENTINA.

And there was a big Cheeto man that scared me and I dropped my phone then my dog saw it and threw up all over my floors. I wasn’t that surprised cause it was just that horrifying. Then I tried to delete it but there was this glitch and the cheeto man started popping up everywhere and I’m still trying to get puppy puke out of my carpets. So I left my phone out side to let it get some air and a flock of birds died because they glanced at the Cheeto. I’m still a little traumatized but I’m doing alright. Never download!!!!","userName":"panasiukart","title":"👁👄👁👎","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:36:38Z","isEdited":false}}]}
