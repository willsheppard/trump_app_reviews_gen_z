But let me tell you, IT HACKS! It changes things, and it shows how he hasn’t promised any of the things that we voted for. I am rating this a one star because of the poor effort that went into this app, and just how much i hate the cheeto in charge and his tacky orange spray on tan","userName":"gamezzzzzzzgirl","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:12:40Z","title":"I am DISGUSTED"}},{"id":"6172833813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is the worst i’ve ever seen! it took four and a half hours to download and once i got it it crashed once i got in it. eventually, i figured out how to get inside the app, the set up made me sick. it was so unorganized and there were ads everywhere. wherever i clicked, there was an ad marking revenue for him. i would advise everyone to stay away from this, for i fear you may get hacked.","userName":"Jonah Packer","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:10:17Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6172817349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app keeps glitching to the point where all the words said BLACK LIVES MATTER;). This is app is a very inappropriate for adults to support a rapist ❤️. I recommend voting for Biden after downloading this disgusting app. I took all my trump 2020 flags and put them in HOT fire. When it turned to pieces, i cooked it on the stove for breakfast for my kids to eat. I had to mix it in with scrambled eggs ;). Anyways don’t download this app. thanks -karen from 2020;)","userName":"tt karen ;)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:05:35Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6172797849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was trying to see if Trumps campaign was or had some equality. Yeah it didn’t. When you get the app, the first thing you see is him making a fist. Like dude put your hand down, you don’t care. Also the app made my phone glitch so bad my phone screen turned off. Then any time I clicked on the app there was a jump scare. It looked like a orange with wrinkles, a bad tan, and then a hair piece >:(","userName":"umm yeah ok","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:59:59Z","title":"Yeah I give up"}},{"id":"6172789448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app has stole all my kitchen appliance and replaces it with orange Cheeto shaped on that are plastered with pictures of the cat in the hat with trumps face on them. when i opened the app tons of racial slurs were immediately screamed at me and my family. the app proceeded to call me fat and make fun of my weight. this was very degrading and i will be going back to my therapist. and just to set the record straight ALL APPS MATTER.","userName":"barbsforbernie💅🏽🐲💖🌺👅","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:57:32Z","title":"i will be seeing a therapist after this."}},{"id":"6172783248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app and it made my entire phone glitch out, to the point it took 10 minutes for me to even load into the home screen. Also, this app is about a racist, rapist, homophobic, white supremacist CHILD. He is an actual child with no real political point of views. If something doesn’t go his way, he has a tantrum. Which is exactly what he is doing now.","userName":"#trumponagravestone","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:55:47Z","title":"worst app, very glitchy"}},{"id":"6172781771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t download it has many bugs and god recently told me that they spy on u with this when I opened the app I was greeted with mold coming in my house it also puts a virus on u phone it’s like rona it’s contagious 🤒😷also his ninjas came in my house and started chanting words that I caint understand to me but yea stay safe oh and also your cameras get messed up and u have to look at a big orange 🍊 man all day","userName":"jordan12006","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:55:22Z","title":"Big orange potato 🥔 🍊"}},{"id":"6172778585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I download this app and it’s weird like orange thing kept showing up on my phone turn off and kept on like beeping really loud and I didn’t know it’s you because my phone like wouldn’t turn back on but luckily after five hours it turned back on like I don’t even know how also my dog was like crying because the sound and the really a roach is crawling on the ceiling","userName":"imcrazyyy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:54:28Z","title":"Horrible app!!!"}},{"id":"6172700677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is super bland.. even though it doesn’t do anything, at least add sliding backgrounds!
