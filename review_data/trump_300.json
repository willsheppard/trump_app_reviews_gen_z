Ever since I was a wee chap I had a bump in my lap for Daddy Donald. \nI looked up to him; Trump was a leader, a businessman, father, son, and rapist. He was the man I always wanted to be 😍\nWhen he announced his candidacy for the 2016 elections, my heart pounded against my rib cage, my rock hard voluptuous eggplant emoji stood erect with bulbous veins throbbing along the shaft. And when he won, I erupted more miracle whip than Mt. Kilauea ever thought possible. I was so excited! My idol was President 🥵🤤\nBut then he actually started taking part in legislation. From that moment on I lost all feelings for Daddy Donald... now he’s just Donald Duck 😩😪 I tried to make thick in the warmth of his app, seeing his orange skin reminded me of Chester Cheeto. I’ll always remember the day Trump bust through my wall like the Orange KoolAid Man 😩🥰 That day was the best! But THIS APP RUINED IT ALL! IT IS SO BAD! IT RUINED ALL THE MEMORIES! ALL THE SOCKS I HAD DEDICATED TO MY LOVE FOR TRUMP! ALL THE WATERMELONS I IMPREGNATED WERE ALL FOR NAUGHT AS TRUMP RELEASED THIS APP! It’s hideous! It’s crowded! It supports his racism, homophobia, xenophobia and sexism. That is not okay. Because of this app, I will be voting for Ronald McDonald this year for president."}},{"id":"6174660099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t download this app if u want a good family","userName":"trash confusing app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:25:14Z","review":"Attention!!! Don’t download this app if u don’t want ur mom sleeping with ur uncle... I woke at 3 am and the sun was out so I had to walk my pet egg so I can fry it to eat, in a blank of an eye I saw my mom kissing my uncle as bad I wanted to join in it was wrong.....uncle and I can do it later without mom being there...  so I went up to my mom and slapped her then she started eating her tears because I ended spitting in her face and the reason why I did it was because she was making out with my boyfriend which I’ve know for 36 \nyears my birthday was yesterday I turned 15 at my funeral I also saw my mom licking my uncle face I ignored it because it was like 2 am and was so bright outside and I couldn’t see anything I wished my birthday was in the morning because it would’ve been more dark. And why this was happening was because I downloaded this app so I can send Donald trump my only fans account that I made for him, I guess he didn’t like it and that’s why everything bad been happening in the world, but again my mom ended up apologizing but I also slept with her dad so I guessed its a win win..."}},{"id":"6174177137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is TERRIBLE... Please read the whole thing!","userName":"winnieadelinepp","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:53:45Z","review":"This app took more then a week to download and when it finally downloaded it opened and told me i had to pay eventhough it says no in app purchases. When i pressed cancel on the payment it showed an add promoting Violence and saying that MoMo was doing good for the Gen Z’s, and on apps and stuff when there is an ad they are picked by the creator. Once the ad was over it showed a video of an orange working out 🖐🏼😳 and then it went on to say that if i see a survey asking if i approve of trump and i press no that it will leak all my information including my address, current location, and my phone number. Therefore i think this app should NOT be allowed to be on the app store or ANY platform of any sort. It is unacceptable that this is the Mind set of the “Loved” president Donald J. Trump.😒🙄 I wanted to proceed and see what the app was all about and after a while it showed the same pictures of Mr. Trump that were leaked on Twitter of him getting his spray tan. I am forever scarred and so is my 5 year old daughter that was siting right next to me on the couch. I HATE THIS APP EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVING IT A ONE STAR REVIEW!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174149778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m terrified","userName":"Emily with the Fatty","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:43:47Z","review":"When I had first opened the app, I was unwelcome with the sight of a disgusting photo of a puffed cheeto starring off in the distance probably looking at his fellow cheetos. Then, right before my very eyes, he had popped up out of the screen and booty raped my bunny. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was horrified!! Then, he continued to walk around my house until he reached the kitchen. When he finally got to the kitchen he ate all my food, and then right after he ate my cat AND my dog. I’m so disgusting that I had to experience the whole thing. And even after all of that, he STILL had more tricks up his sleeves. He proceeded to ask me for my toe nails and stated that he was collecting them. I was thinking of how much balls someone needs to have to ask something like that but then i remembered that his are severely microscopic. He said if I don’t give them to him he will bite them off!! But then… out of the blue Barron Trump came and TOOK HIM AWAY!! I can’t believe his own son had to drag him away. I hope I never have to experience anything like this ever again! This app is TERRIBLE and I will never in a million years recommend getting it!!"}},{"id":"6174101649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"What is this app?","userName":"FIREBALL070707","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:26:04Z","review":"I opened the app and the first thing I saw was a Cheeto eating a big piece of poo not to mention I wanted this for our AWESOMEN’T president and it didn’t give me any info or anything \nI would never want to buy such a dumb app I’m mortified at what I saw on the app, I would never never use this app at all I hated it honestly, the big ego that trump has and creates this dumb app it’s very very annoying that I had to deal with this like every time I tried to do something it glitchesout so randomly and it’s very annoying and I want a very good app, not one of these like what? This is so offensive to my goodwill of the president I will not never use this app not to mention my pet dinosaur nice pet dinosaur that is tried using it and it was annoying for him to use it like his hands couldn’t get to any of the buttons your racist for that also Instead of doing it’s job it just gave a chicken nug very annoying my pet burrito was hurting and every time I tried to help him the app stopped me until I voted for trump which is really mean and preposterous like I hate it also read the first letter of every word up until preposterous bye and thx"}},{"id":"6173449933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Poorly Designed :((","userName":"gretchenh22","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:53Z","review":"Let me start off by saying I am an 18 yr old registered voter who will be putting my voice to use in the 2020 election by voting for PRESIDENT TRUMP!! I am very passionate about our country’s future and I am a huge believer he can drag our economy out of the mud created by the crooked Democratic stimulus bills. I wanted to download this app so that I could be better connected to the community because many people my age will hate if you say you support President Trump. Anyway I downloaded the app and it took FOREVER and my keyboard kept glitching while it was downloading in the background and it was still glitching until i had to delete the app later. Second of all when I finally opened the app I was greeted with a very unflattering picture of the president I belive the graphics design team could have done him a little better 😬 Overall The app does not provide any useful services in my opinion, at least not enough to justify the keyboard glitches. Thankfully I am now signed up to get texts from the President!!!!! So it was worth it. However I do not recommend downloading the app which is why I am giving it 1 star."}},{"id":"6173039035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I Wouldn’t Recommend This App:","userName":"startynight30","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:14Z","review":"I tried downloading this app because I wanted to show my full support for our incredible president and receive news regarding the election process. I am sad to say that it took about 15 minutes for the app to download onto my phone, but what I am truly sad about is that I was charged $3. It was a mandatory charge that was wired directly out of my account (since my credit card and PayPal are attached to the app store). This wouldn’t have been so much of a problem for me because I am happy to contribute all I have to his campaign, if it means he will serve another four years of presidency, but I am currently very tight on money (being a single mother who can only work a poorly paying part time job). That three dollars could have bought my daughter a meal. It would be in President Donald Trump’s best interest to look into this problem because I can see that something like this could lose him an amount of supporters. I have only rated this app one star in hopes that it will get his attention, and that he will fix it as soon as possible. In my heart the app is still a five. Thank you."}},{"id":"6172089976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"horrible app, don’t recommend.","userName":"Ava the poptart","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:42:47Z","review":"when i first downloaded this app, they started coercing me to vote for Donald, saying that if i didn’t they would kick me out of the country. after a while of having it i get a knock at the door and go to answer it. before i even open the door, a swat team busts in, shooting my pet chinchilla in the stomach 14 times. they after they shot up the rest of my house, they dragged me and my mother by our hair and beat us up outside on the front yard. we are now looking for a new house. after they left i forgot to delete the app. my phone had started glitching and then it took me to my notes where i saw a new note called, “Vote for Donald Trump or we’ll come back and do it again.”   they hacked my phone and deleted all my contacts and apps, except for the Trump 2020 app. they then threatened me again saying if i voted for someone else or if i didn’t vote at all that they would kidnap and kill my whole family, and then torture me until i agreed to vote for trump. this was a horrible experience and i would never want this to happen to anyone else, so please do not download this app, or vote for trump."}}]}
