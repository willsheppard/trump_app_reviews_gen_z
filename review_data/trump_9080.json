Took 3 years to download and when I finally could open the app I was greeted with “Welcome to Trump’s 2020 campaign, if you are a minority delete my app and jump off a cliff” I was disgusted and repulsed by what the Orange Cheeto had said to me that I vomited my small intestine out. My hospital bills are unpayable because America doesn’t have universal healthcare. So it’s either I die or hide from the NRA. Easy choice. Trump is the scum of the earth and a nasty old man.","userName":"Mai E.

And the ads in this app are ridiculous, they were advertising crushed Cheetos that Donald Trump himself owned. I only downloaded it because I thought it was a game. Also, whenever I first opened the app it attracted roaches and whenever I deleted the app, rated it a one star, and gave it a review, they all went away. Be safe out there from those roaches and do what I did!!!!","userName":"Karahm2257","date":"2020-07-08T21:35:02Z","title":"Worst App EVER"}},{"id":"6173799153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i couldn’t find where to find any information on our dearest president donald. it took so long to download and everything looks so boring. why not add some color or something? you also have to enter your phone number to even use the thing. so inconvenient. what if i was using a tablet? guess he isn’t user friendly😔. because of this i have decided to not create the donald trump fan account i was planning on making. vote blue. thank you.","userName":"😍❤️💛💚💙💜💘💘","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:45Z","title":"Confusing"}},{"id":"6173772333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Very disappointed I was expecting a very good app that would give me good and up-to-date information about our president Mr. Trump but it literally just shows you ads of places to get spray tans and places to buy oranges and I don’t understand why that is happening I un downloaded it and then downloaded it again but it’s still the same thing so I don’t recommend the app because it literally does nothing about what it tells you it will do 0 to 10💔","userName":"spraytan 101","date":"2020-07-08T21:22:44Z","title":"Not a good app"}},{"id":"6173739204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to yes no yes no. But trump himself hacked my phone and proceeded to forcefully buy his merch using my credit card Information. Little did he know, he left his microphone on. Since he is so orange I couldn’t hear most of what he said, but there was one part in particular that I was able to understand. He said “th”. Using my college degree in world Language, I was able to decipher what he meant by “th”. He is a Swedish spy that is planning to transform everyone who buys his merch into the color orange.","userName":"𓂸but in french 𓂸","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:35Z","title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6173710063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"as a member of the Orange Lives Matter terrorist organization, i was severely dissapointed when i downloaded this app. i thought i would see more accurate representations of people like myself, plagued by moist orange skin, like master trump himself. i opened the app to not only find ZERO representation of the OLM, but assaulted with posts about Blue Lives Matter? I AM APPALLED!!! trump has no right to not only dismiss his entire race, but to betray us for the absolute toads that are the Blue. also too much racism, brainwashing, and homophobia on the app, 1/5🤩","userName":"republicuntttttttt","date":"2020-07-08T20:59:53Z","title":"do not download🙄"}},{"id":"6173677998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app ever when I got it I was a racist, rapist, ugly, fat orange on my screen and I got scared AND the app isn’t even good it’s slow and why do I have to put my number on it why can’t I just go on for free and fix the bug in it it doesn’t go good.

I never expected that when I downloaded this app it would just make me miss him more. Why you may ask? Because the cat he left with me, our beautiful hairless cat, hates the smell of oranges and everytime I open this app he meows in agony. I’ve been trying my best to not be reminded of the pain I put my cat through but everytime I open this app I hear the cats meowing and I know it hurts him.\n\nMy husband heard it whilst on video call last night and knew I downloaded the app and now he is filing for a divorce.\n\nI lost both my cat and my husband to the smell of oranges. Please delete this app. 😔🍊","userName":"thechroniclesofkpop","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:16Z","title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6173648174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app it’s horrible! it’s ugly and made my phone glitch SOOO much. i could smell the racism the racism of the trump administration through the screen! i would not recommend this for anyone and this should be removed from the app story ADMITTEDLY or i will speak to the manger about this. this is disgusting. i am more mad at this app than i was about trump winning in 2016. this is horrible! horrible! as americans, we deserve the best and most high quality apps! this just does not cut it!","userName":"Billeona","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:36Z","title":"horrible!! i wanna speak to the manager"}}]}
