I started the download at 8 am on a Tuesday and it didn’t finish downloading until 11 pm on Thursday!! In my opinion that’s absolutely ridiculous! I don’t even know why I stuck around for it to download, but I did. Now concerning the way the app actually runs let’s talk about how the formatting of the app is HORRIBLE. It is SO hard to use and figure out how work, I don’t even understand how it is still on the App Store. Some of the buttons don’t even work! And then others lead to random sketchy sites when you click on them! This app is horrible and needs to be taken off the App Store AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."}},{"id":"6173350519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"abt12367","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:54:24Z","review":"I downloaded this app to show support for the Cheeto puff God😇 but when I downloaded it the orange 🍊 sitting on my counter attacked me it started to pull out a 🔪 and told me u had to vote for trump. luckily I was able to fight it off using a spoon. After that roaches🦗 flooded my house I didn’t want them to attack me so I put on a roach costume to blend in. After living with the roaches for 2 weeks I met the king🤴 of the roaches and it was none other that Donald trump himself😱 he looked at me and told me that if I don’t vote for him he will kill my dog 🐕 I said NO and I took my dog and ran🏃\u200D♀️but his roaches tripped me and dragged me back to him after that I promised I would vote for him. Then he left in his gold Yatch🚤. so please DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!"}},{"id":"6173258214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"honestadam","title":"I used to be Trump 2020...","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:56Z","review":"I supported Trump in the 2016 election, but with all of his false promises I cannot support him any more. He promised to make america great again but has yet to do anything for the social justice system or the police brutality now happening in our country. This app just made me realize all of the extremely racist and unjust things I had been supporting previously. Not to mention that after deleting the app I kept getting notifications to support his campaign, which was ridiculous and annoying considering I didn’t sign up to receive notifications from the app. 1 star from me... I hope Trump realizes how many loyal supporters he has lost because of this stupid app."}},{"id":"6173237334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AshleeTup","title":"Foreigner💞😼","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:16:59Z","review":"I opened up the app to be flashed by Donald trump’s spray tan picture. I was absolutely mortified.😱 I was so mortified I actually died for 5 minutes. 💀 While I was dead, three wiseman came to talk to me. The first wiseman was Pop Smoke.💨 He told me that Donald is a HUMPING monster that was created by the devil.👹 Then Pop Smoke walked away while singing the lyrics “She like, Papi, I adore you. I’m like, Baby, I ain’t normal. Rrrrr.”😈 The second wiseman was my queen Selena. She told me that the trump had tried to kill her. But he was to weak. The last wiseman was Freddy Mercury. Freddy told me Trump was the creator of coronavirus. He said if we can have trump die from coronavirus, coronavirus will go away. Then I woke up. Generation Z will DEFEAT this humping monster in destroy his allies.💅🧚\u200D♀️✨😼"}},{"id":"6173190826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dadausudg","title":"Trump","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:01:38Z","review":"I downloaded this app in support of my president and oranges and he’s both of those things. But I was sitting down with my bunny and as soon I as opened the app he dropped dead. Keep in mind that my bunny was in great health and condition and the president and his app took away my childhood from me. I DO NOT recommend this app unless you want to kill your animals. This man is not only a racist rapist but now is an animal serial killer. This whole app is a trap to try to kill our animals. DONT USE THIS APP. I no longer support trump or anything he does and now I will be voting blue. Biden 2020 bc he didn’t kill my bunny. I can’t describe my emotional trauma from this but I can tell all the people out there to whatever you do, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS."}},{"id":"6173187577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LisaR1957","title":"They’re trying to ruin my life","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:00:36Z","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP\n\nThis app not only glitches CONSTANTLY, but since downloading it, my phone glitches too. I also believe that by downloading the app, it gave the government even easier access to my information! My identity was stolen right after donating money to Trump’s campaign. \n\nYet, it goes deeper. I deleted the app and told my husband on the phone that I was questioning Trump’s ability to lead our country, when my phone died unexpectedly, despite being on 70%. The next day, my dog went missing from my backyard, assumingly through a hole in my fenced that did not exist before. Additionally, and I may just be paranoid, but ever since I deleted the app, I’ve been having uncontrollable diarrhea. I’m starting to think that someone is drugging my food. I am starting to think the government is willing to take down anyone who stops drinking their Koolaid. I’m scared for my family’s wellbeing. I don’t drive my car anymore in fear they’ve cut the breaks. If I die of “covid,” it’s the government who killed me. \n\nLove in Christ"}},{"id":"6172741342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Letty is a nice app","title":"Gave my phone a virus ALSO BLM!!!!✊🏿✊🏿","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:43:48Z","review":"as soon as I downloaded the app my phone started to glitch out every time I tried to open any type of app such as instagram Facebook Snapchat. every app just glitched out so then I tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me delete it so then I had to contact Apple and they told me that they wouldn’t  be able to fix it because they didn’t know the reason of the virus and I told him it was because of this Trump app that caused MULTIPLE viruses I need to get this app off my phone but it won’t let me remove it therefore Apple needs to remove it from the apple store so that It can get off my phone and this virus will go away also BLM!!!! ✊🏿✊🏿"}},{"id":"6172300474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"💀🙅\u200D♀️💀","title":"Attack of the orange","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:41:50Z","review":"I download this app the support my beloved president. Only seconds after opening the app I noticed my hand was turning orange. I ignored it and stayed on the app for at few hours. Next thing I know I heard chanting ”long live the orange” ”long live the orange”. I looked down to check my skin color and I gasped in shock because I was no longer human and I was now an orange. I saw millions of oranges chanting and I rolled off my bed to join them. Then Trump walked in and started stepping on us to make orange juice to keep his perfect skin tone. I rolled away and now I don’t have hands so I am typing this with my voice 😭. Please send help!! I only want to be human again. Don't download this app if you value being human!"}}]}
