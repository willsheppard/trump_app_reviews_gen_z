He’s still in bed a day later recovering. No seizure warning or anything. When emailing the team of this app they replied sarcastically saying “with all due respect, maybe he should do more research before downloading an app.” There is NOTHING that states flashing lights, not even a warning.","rating":1,"title":"Bad App","date":"2020-07-08T15:34:49Z","userName":"nick botin"}},{"id":"6172705979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as the app loaded, I started to feel my lungs fill with mucus and hatred for my neighbor who is not the same color as me. Out of nowhere. I also suddenly felt the need to surrender my rights as a female. I flushed my birth control and immediately went to my sewing machine to make an apron (as I’ve never owned one). I’m just so glad I have relatively small feet so I am able to stand closer to the sink and stove.","rating":1,"title":"I caught Covid AND racism","date":"2020-07-08T15:33:43Z","userName":"kmbeedub"}},{"id":"6172703380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app has is not helpful at all, I was trying to give this 🍊 a chance for his money but I’ve been lied to.

This app took 4 hours to download with perfection internet, it also completely wrecked my phone, be careful when you open the app there is a scary orange man.

When I clicked to enter it just showed an ugly orange fossil of a person that almost looked racist, homophobic, and seemed stupid? He seems like the type of person to be against babies being born in the ninth month. Oh wait... Atleast he doesn’t think that the USA is a brand right? RIGHT?!?! oh my god how is this man our president.","rating":1,"title":"What a terrible app.","date":"2020-07-08T14:51:22Z","userName":"ahgtfvjfd"}},{"id":"6172517843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"as soon as i downloaded the app, i felt an ache in the lower left of my mouth (like really bad). which is really sad bc my teeth usually love donald trump. anyway, i decided that it was a weird coincidence and i was just gonna move on and continue looking at the app. but it was too painful. with every second i spent on the app, my aches got worse. as soon as i left the app, my aches got better but i still called my dentist. turns out, i literally needed a root canal even though i went to the dentist last week and they said everything was great and no cavities. now i have to get a root canal and it was this apps fault.","rating":1,"title":"i had to get a root canal after downloading","date":"2020-07-08T14:41:04Z","userName":"my teeth are rotting from this"}}]}
