Trump has RUINED the land of the free. have you seen the unemployment rate? have you SEEN the Covid cases compared to other countries? get this clown out of office NOW. he is RUINING our beautiful America. Make America Great Again? You RUINED it Trump. It will never be great as long as you’re here. Anyone with a brain wouldn’t vote for you this November.","date":"2020-07-08T19:13:55Z","userName":"Black Lives Matter🤍","title":"horrible app","rating":1}},{"id":"6173358463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I wish I couldn’t have downloaded this app. It took forever to load, and when it finally did, asked for my phone number. I was like “okay I’ll give it my phone number”, and as soon as I did, TONS of messages flooded my phones. I kept texting STOP STOP STOP because the phone vibrations were a disturbance at work, but it just kept going. I went BACK into the app to see if I could turn it off, and it WOULDN'T LET ME CHANGE IT. Plus, every-time I opened the app, it crashed. \nAside from that, the news given in this app was unreliable and not up to date. I was hoping to know some upcoming events and it shows events from 2019 asking if I want to join them?!!! TERRIBLE APP!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:57:11Z","userName":"pie_maddie","title":"I wish I didn’t download this","rating":1}},{"id":"6173236372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is disgusting and it has so many glitches I can’t open the app without it crashing or glitching me out it is a completely inappropriate app and it is a horrible app in general I hope it gets taken down because it’s just a waste of space to your iPhone and takes all of the space up I HATE THIS.

I don’t know if I can stand by some clownery like this 😰 I’m apart of LGBTQ+ community, he doesn’t support us. He doesn’t support Black Lives Matter. His priorities aren’t straight for a straight cis-male, he makes our country look like a literal joke. He tries to knock us down, and yet he wants us to download an app full of white supremest people who won’t admit to their racism or so full of themselves that’s why they support a fool like him. This app is filled with all of his ego and asks for your information.... they sold my info to telemarketers! I keep getting all these calls and texts... don’t get this app, who knows what’s next.","date":"2020-07-08T14:24:59Z","userName":"queen💫💕","title":"wow 😱","rating":1}},{"id":"6172378849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my orange 🍊 king 👑 , donald trump, and something totally weird happened! Once i opened the app, my phone went to an orange 🍊 screen. I was trying to get off of the orange screen but i couldn’t! Then, trumps servants came to my house and were terrorizing me. :( They pulled my pants 👖 down and were giving me wedgies until i gave the app 5 stars ⭐️ , but i couldn’t let that happen.  I needed to fight them off, so i did. While i was fighting them off, they drop kicked🦵 my grandma  and then they left. My grandma 👵 is okay now. But anyways, I totally wouldn’t recommend this app unless you want that to happen to you.............

For starters, when i first opened the app my phone IMMEDIATELY crashed and it took AN HOUR to reboot and as soon as it did the look was permanently changed. There is a blinding orange tint on my screen that i cant seem to get rid of and my wallpapers have been replace with a picture of the most hideous, crusty, racist, homophobic, misogynistic trash-bag i’ve ever had the pain of witnessing. Not to mention, every time i try to play one of my songs all i heat is “Grab ‘em by the p*ssy playing over and over again on repeat until the song ends.

But after a while, I started to get very interesting messages...messages such as: \n“I like what you’re wearing, bb gurl” and “dam shawty you thiccer than a bowl of oatmeal”.  At first I thought it was a glitch but as the days went by the messages got worse and more persistent. I finally deleted the app when i started to get sent nudes; nakey pictures from the president himself. I am ✨appalled✨ my eyes are now forever scarred by the image of his wrinkly, hairy, orange-ness......among other smaller than average things. in conclusion: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","date":"2020-07-09T18:29:16Z","userName":"yer mum gae","title":"dO nOt DoWnLoAd tHiS aPp","rating":1}}]}
