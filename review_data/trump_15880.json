Unfortunately, the app was very slow to load and didn’t show anything. I then proceeded to let my phone load while I took my pet rock for a walk. When I returned, there was still nothing on the screen! 0/5 would not recommend."}},{"id":"6177163958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible app!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:29:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ItsOnlyIzzy","review":"i’m not apart of the “gen z” thing on tiktok but i thought i would get this app just to see what its all about, i can safely say DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!! it left bugs on my phone, it asked for my location and that’s when i decided to delete it. this app made my phone run so slow to the point where i couldn’t even open anymore apps. get this app at your own risk and 🇺🇸Biden 2020🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6177134264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨BLM✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:21:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Maggie hunter","review":"Honestly i downloaded the app and it took SEVERAL days to download. You would think our “great america leader” could produce a good app but it’s trash like him. My phone also was glitched when i had the app on my phone it would randomly shut off until i deleted the app then it was fine. Inclusion y’all should get rid of his crappy bugged app instead of tik tok. teehee thank you for your time😘✨"}},{"id":"6177125720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app don’t download it.

This app is extremely bad and I recommend to not download it unless you want your phone erased and hacked. 1 star review"}},{"id":"6177095048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DOESNT WORK PROPERLY!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:10:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"pence 😘✌️","review":"I downloaded this app to sign up for rallies on here instead of safari, but I’ve ran into a HUGE problem instead! I found lots of propaganda, and I think this is unacceptable. If this app was to work well, I believe there shouldn’t be fake news. That, and it seems to take up WAYYY too much storage. This isn’t good. I will be moving to a different platform that works properly."}},{"id":"6177085060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Phone problem","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"djdidnsisnxisnfnc","review":"Got this app for trump and ever since I downloaded it it would crash a few times on the app but so I redownloaded it and restarted my phone it worked fine for a little after that then it started again on all of my apps and making them slower I would not recommend downloading this app unless u want ur phone to work"}},{"id":"6176912899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T14:21:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"BLM💗","review":"I was so excited to download this app to stay up to date on my favorite homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist oompa loompa but FIRST of all it took 69 hours to download. SECONDLY Trumpet asked for my number which I think is highly inappropriate as I am a minor and he is married. Although I have heard he likes them young, that life is not for me. THIRD the app gives you a VIRUS 🦠🤮. This virus is WAY worse than corona...DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP 🤮 IT NEEDS TO GO JUST LIKE OUR OOMPA LOOMPA IN OFFICE😃"}},{"id":"6176880584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T14:13:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Its the rat queen 28744663","review":"So I decided to download the app thinking this might in some way affect my vote. I try to download it and it says there’s age restrictions. Why would there be age restrictions? Overall I was going through the app and it kept closing out. It drained my battery very quick and I have a relatively new phone. It also scared me when I first opened up the app and saw the orange teletubbie. Please fix that."}},{"id":"6176808454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"don’t support bad people:(","date":"2020-07-09T13:54:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"f!ght the POWER","review":"i think the people who support trump and tell others that everyone needs to respect and support him because “he’s our president” are the same people who would tell children to not question a coach or teacher who is obviously mistreating them. is this really the message that we want to send out to youth? that just because someone is in a position of superiority we shouldn’t fight back if what they do is obviously not in the best interest of their people? gen z is a powerful generation that will not back down to injustice. no freedom till we’re equal, and no freedom till the backwards way this country is run gets fixed."}},{"id":"6176806858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This App Stole My Personal Information","date":"2020-07-09T13:53:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"danedude34","review":"I’m actually very upset with the outcome of this app. Two days after having it, I started noticing my email was completely full with spam emails from Trump and his sons asking me for monthly payments. I’ve noticed my phone slow down quite a bit and deleted the app immediately. Not sure what’s going on here but I’m incredibly upset."}}]}
