It is a joke just like our president 😤 Some reviews may say 5 stars but DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. They are... generated by trump and his minions. After I downloaded this app I started his orange face everywhere. Soon enough I started turning orange myself. I was too embarrassed to go out in public looking like this and I lost many good friends. Before long, I couldn’t help saying things like “CHYYYNA” and “my daughter is so sexy”. I even started doing this: 😗👌 Do not get this app at any cost!!!!","rating":1,"title":"🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-09T11:56:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176353911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shisbejsnska","review":"I came to this app to hear real American patriotism from our greatest president Mr. Donald J. Trump, the J being for genius of course as he stated in his glamorous speech in January. Instead I read extreme leftist liberal propaganda trying to make our beloved president look bad. If I could I would rate a zero, and to the sick demonic scum running this app should feel ashamed. Our president does not deserve this. How dare you sit there and right these heinous things about our god sent savior. 2020s election will speak for itself.","rating":1,"title":"Face News","date":"2020-07-09T11:51:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176331877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"maddyispap1","review":"Yo if a zero star was real I would touch it rn !

Trump is horrible and everything he stands for is horrible. He does not care about anyone except himself and he should not be president. The fact that actual people take this man seriously is extremely alarming and I think they have brain damage. This man has brainwashed people so bad that they can’t even see how they are being controlled. Trump needs to go. He has no business running any country.

I was so so so wrong!! The first time, it gave me a virus warning, but I ignored it because I thought it was no biggie. Then, it appeared again, and I was starting to get a little worried. For the third time it popped up, I had enough and was about to delete the app, when my phone went into complete chaos. It started shaking like crazy. Not long after, MY PHONE BLEW UP INTO A MILLION PEICES AND LEFT A WHOLE IN MY BED!! 🤯💥😡","rating":1,"title":"worst app ever!! 😡🤬","date":"2020-07-09T10:31:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176083804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LICKED ME","review":"This app is by far one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded first off it took a couple years of my life to download then on top of that once I got in the app it was sayin that I had to be a certain color just to view certain parts of the app then I tried to access it again and it typed out racial slurs then proceeded to then hack my bank account and reset my phone then broke my screen then I got robbed by trump himself and he took my virginity","rating":1,"title":"IT NOT FAIR","date":"2020-07-09T10:29:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176071927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LoLo🧚\u200D♀️🥰💕✨","review":"I accidentally downloaded this app while researching current updates on why a social media platform is being banned and it CORRUPTED my phone. I’ve seen the racist/homophobic/transphobic/etc side of the world and ohhh to see without my eyes, I was disgusted. I had to literally burn my phone afterwards to rid my life of this disgusting cult. If I could give negative reviews I would. Apple should remove this app ASAP, it is TOXIC and EMBARRASSING to the planet. Never have I seen so much ignorance.","rating":1,"title":"I HAD TO BURN MY PHONE","date":"2020-07-09T10:25:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175995505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GZ for the win!","review":"Ok, my time has been absolutely wasted and if I could give it one star I would. As a young, Latina, Bisexual, Woman, I was expecting support from our AMAZING president! However I have discovered that this app does nothing good! It immediately asked for my phone number, which I thought was inappropriate, then later, I discovered that it was wiping data from my phone! I had to backup my phone with the help of apple to get it working again! DO NOT GET THIS APP YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!1!!1!!","rating":1,"title":"WHAT THE HELL","date":"2020-07-09T10:00:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175927972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Teresa Millaway","review":"I was downloading this app to support my wonderful president Mr. Donald J. Trump and i opened the app. After i closed off five minutes goes by and my bank account is wiped. Then my houses security system was hacked. Soon after someone came into my house demanding my children for covid experiments or else we would be assassinated. I fought my hardest but they took my kid and shot my dog. Then i found out my husband was an undercover agent for Trump and he took everything and moved to washington dc. I’m now a democrat.","rating":1,"title":"NO NO NO NO","date":"2020-07-09T09:38:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175851397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reggiethearmadillo","review":"This app is absolute garbage! When I first opened the app a weird deformed Cheeto popped up on my screen and scared the actual 💩 out of me. While I was walking my bike I kept receiving notifications and I hit a mailbox, which caused me to break my back. Also the other day when I was putting gas in my skate board I found out this app was stealing ALL my information. On top of everything else this app took DAYS to download.","rating":1,"title":"Garbage, I do not recommend. Please read.","date":"2020-07-09T09:13:12Z","isEdited":false}}]}
