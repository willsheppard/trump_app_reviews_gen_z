When I downloaded it and opened it up, it tried to encourage me to vote for an authoritarian monster who is focused on taking away the rights of BIPOC, LGBT+, and every other marginalized minority group out there. Unbelievable! Then it had the nerve to ask me for money in order to support the current president‚Äôs frequent golf outings. I have never had a worse app on my phone in my life.","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","userName":"rwnbns","date":"2020-07-09T13:44:57Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176759748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i wanted to support the least racist definitely not a rapist and not misogynistic person I know to exist.

The graphics... horrible. The content... INAPPROPRIATE!!! Definitely not a family friendly platform at all!! In addition to the dramatic time it took to download it still doesn‚Äôt work properly!!!

It took several day to download and once I had downloaded it it had wiped my phone storage. I had many important emails and messages for my work on there and it will not allow me to delete the app now.

The moment I downloaded it I was told that I must say I was either a woman or man. Once I did that it said I had to show a picture to prove I was ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù either a man or woman. I was told to continue having right as a woman I had to text the number to confirm my vote within 5 minutes or I would never be allowed to vote again.

I couldn‚Äôt not recommend this app less if I tried. I wish there was a zero star option to give. Downloading this app is equivalent to setting all of your possessions on fire and then jumping in said fire. For the sake of all things please take and good in this world I beg you, do not make the mistake of getting this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Garbage","userName":"dom18927","date":"2020-07-09T13:06:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176563410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is by far the worst thing that has happened in MY LIFE. i decided to download it and it took 93 years to download and THEN i got corona and died and my entire family ran out of food.

Before I can finish any of the long droning paragraphs I fall asleep and shortly there after my phone follows suit. It is an awful glitchy app that has more issues than our government.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me and my phone narcolepsy!","userName":"rip donald you sick man","date":"2020-07-09T12:32:51Z","rating":1}}]}
