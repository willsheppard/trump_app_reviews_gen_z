I don’t. The app took 3 hours to download, and it’s very glitchy now. I have to say for an app made by the president, it’s very bad quality. I recommend changing a few things. 1. U should name it “ANYONE BUT TRUMP 2020!” 2. Change the colors to yellow and black (the manny shall not be televised.) 3. Delete it! \n\nTRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!

App has zero potential and should be taken down.","userName":"JoeBJoJ","title":"App was sexist, racist, and gave rapey vibes"}},{"id":"6177761746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:29:15Z","review":"Your a disgusting disgrace to humanity pls stop ruining children’s life I hate you you are disgusting all we did was joke around and look what you did in return you are trying to delete a children’s app for what stupid anyways have a terrible stand as our disgusting Pressident I hate you bye also alt tiktok for life ✨✨😼😾😺😻😺😾😹😺😹🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕👁👅👁❤️❤️❤️❤️😽😽😽 zero out of five.","userName":"sleikekeei","title":"👁👅👁😹😹😹"}},{"id":"6177747816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:25:02Z","review":"You’d think that a guy that made so much money would make an app that’s good... apparently not. This app is super glitchy and slowed down my phone right from the start. It also gives false information, I will see something on the news and this app twists it to make Donald Trump look better.
