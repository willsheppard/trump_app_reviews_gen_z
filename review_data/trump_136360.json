This app should be removed. To add on, there is no special information here. Instead of  using this app for news, just watch the yv or google it, this is the worst app that I’ve downloaded shame on everyone that gave it a 5 star, this is literally the worst app on the market!","userName":"CoolYoTuber","date":"2020-07-10T09:35:51Z","title":"The worst app I’ve installed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180282707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I am a conservative Christian and got this app as soon as I heard about it hoping to get more insight into the presidents plans for his next term. But the app refuses to work, constantly lagging and bugging out the few time I can even open it for more than 15 seconds. Then I saw that my location was being tracked even though all of my setting are set so that no apps are tracking it at that time. And now a few days later my phone keeps crashing at random times and lagging a bunch to the point of it barely being functional. I had to type this review out on a google doc on my laptop and then copy to my phone just to make this review. It’s a horrible app and you should avoid getting it I have to get a new phone because of this!!","userName":"Archeryhuntr","date":"2020-07-10T09:35:28Z","title":"Acts almost like malware","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180282688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"My pet caterpillar had this app and says that it’s terrible 😡","userName":"beepboop2.0","date":"2020-07-10T09:35:27Z","title":"Terrible app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180281094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i couldn’t even use the app because as soon as donald trump’s face appeared i came in my pants. would rate 0 stars if i could, made a mess 😔","userName":"Samatriaaa","date":"2020-07-10T09:34:55Z","title":"too hot to handle","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180281063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Tiktok is not being watched by China!

But i’ve been pleasantly unsurprised that he is exactly all of those things, crazy how a whole entire generation (that is larger than any other generation) is doing things that no one else that they would do or could do.\n\nGen Z (I say this as a PROUD GEN Zer) will not go down without a fight. If we can’t put all voices into laws just yet we will hit you where it hurts, that’s the thing you are trying to take from us, our social and personal platforms.\n\nJust saying this again, app was a complete bust, pointless, useless, and idiotic.","userName":"Animelover1205","date":"2020-07-10T09:34:20Z","title":"Trash","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180278015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Horrible content","userName":"degvjyryivfhk","date":"2020-07-10T09:33:48Z","title":"Delete","isEdited":false}}]}
