I could not control the absolute nausea I immediately felt. My pet chicken asked if I was okay and I showed him the app and he burst into flames. This is not the type of content that I want shown to anyone especially our feathered friends. My phone ended up flying away after glitching and morphing into my now reincarnated pet chicken. I am truly heartbroken.

I should’ve deleted the app after seeing this but I idiotically went through the app. The material I saw was absolutely atrocious and is brainwashing very gullible people into supporting that creature. And don’t get me started on the language used. It was absolutely belligerent and threatening I was scared for my life but didn’t want to alert the authorities cuz you know #acab.

There were racist comments, misogynistic comments, homophobic comments for all of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as multiple people claiming they were christians which can simply just not be true if they are spreading hate and hating others in general. I am disgusted with this app and everything about it. I encourage all to delete this app and start respecting others and spreading positivity.
