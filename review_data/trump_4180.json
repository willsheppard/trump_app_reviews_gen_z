It was ridiculous how biased and finger-pointing all of the talking points were. There was a survey pushed out that literally was just slander over and over again. If this man wants to get the votes of decent, mature adults he should consider stopping that. I know the slandering is happening on both sides by all constituents, but I have more respect for a person who doesn’t whine about every little thing, takes responsibility for past mistakes made and listens to the entire nation and their wants rather than pandering to a base that doesn’t seem to be representative of America and her supposed values.","userName":"Extremely Concerned Citizen","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:12Z"}},{"id":"6173005757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app scared me so much😱","review":"This app made my phone glitch so much! It started telling me to worship our orange god, which I already do but I thought it was strange. Then fellow MAGA people started coming to my house every hour! It was crazy! I was grateful of course because I love to meet fellow worshipers of our cult. After a few months though my phone started to only allow me to use this one app. It started telling me to use racial slurs and disrespect women. If I didn’t do it trump worshipers came to my house to force me to say such horrid things. I was so terrified. Anyway I deleted the app and all the problems went away. I am now not a trump supporter because of this experience. :(","userName":"kyleannec05","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:00Z"}},{"id":"6172972069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"trashy app🤡🍊","review":"First of all, this app took 2 months to download, and I let it slide by because i thought it would be worth it once the app started working. BUT THEN, when i opened the app, the first this i saw was a hair orange 🍊and i was DISGUSTED because I hate oranges because they’re too sour, so why the hell were they showing me my least favorite fruit? theennnn i realized that it wasn’t a hairy orange, it was actually donal trump. but that didn’t make it any better because i actually hate him more than oranges :) therefore this app should be taken down because i hate oranges and i hate the “president” a lot more... thank you for readinngggg this😄😄😄........ now take down this app😐","userName":"yessiipadro","date":"2020-07-08T16:52:43Z"}},{"id":"6172922394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"An absolutely horrifying app✨","review":"When I downloaded the app, I immediately had to get my glasses at how disgustingly terrible it looked. Soon, my eyes were burning really really bad and right now I’m heading to a medical clinic to get stronger glasses and emergency eye surgery. This dirty infection spread to my mom, dad, aunt, and my 6 cousins, and my two second cousins, as well as my grandparents... we are extremely sick and are asking for prayers for me and my family! This app is the work of the devil, and should be removed immediately before it hurts others! I had to get a new phone because of this bloody, monstrosity of an app. Truly inappropriate.

They then proceeded to grab my pet whale and they cut her open and made a circle with a star in it and they started ranting “Donald trump is a white supremacist” I obviously didn’t believe them but when they sang that song, a different song played on the screen and out of nowhere the fbi comes in and EATS THE COWS WHOLE, THEY EVEN THREW RAT FOOD TO CALL THE RATS.

You know maybe tell him that he should give EVERYONE THE SAME RIGHTS.\n\nAnyway, when I downloaded this app and opened it for the first time, I was greeted to a TERRIFIC SIGHT! It was this orange monster with blonde hair all over it. I screamed so hard, and ended up throwing my phone out my window, which landed IN THE TRASH AND IT WAS GARBAGE DAY!!! So they ended up taking my phone to the dump. So BECAUSE OF THIS APP, I HAD TO SPEND 3 WHOLE MONTHS, saving up money for a new phone.\n\nThen I downloaded the app again, and then when I opened the app it made my NEW IPHONE TURN OFF. I tried charging it for AN HOUR, but that didn’t work, I put it in rice to see if maybe water somehow got in my phone but that didn’t work ether. So I had to go to repair my phone, turns out the app gave my phone A VIRUS so that’s why it wasn’t turning on. So then my mom gave me her old phone.\n\nSO UNLESS YOU WANT A VIRUS TO BE PUT ON YOUR PHONE, then I’d recommend NOT getting this app.","userName":"Bad_Lynx","date":"2020-07-08T13:36:22Z"}}]}
