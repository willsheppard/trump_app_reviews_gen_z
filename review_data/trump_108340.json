But imagine for a moment a world in which the Russia scandal didn’t exist. Pretend that Trump didn’t fire FBI Director James Comey, or that Don Jr. never met with a Russian lawyer and a former Soviet spy promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Forget that Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort had to register retroactively as foreign agents, or even that Trump said he wouldn’t have hired Jeff Sessions if he’d known the attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\nWhat you’re left with is still a remarkable amount of other administration scandals—from the State Department’s stay at a Trump hotel to Jared Kushner’s disclosure problems—that would have been major news any other year, with any other president in the White House. Here are a few to remember.\n\nThe Emoluments Clause of the Constitution says the president cannot “without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.” This means that many of Trump’s continued business dealings—he has refused to divest from his real estate company—could very well be illegal: For one, Trump has put his name on properties all over the world—from the Philippines to Saudi Arabia—and receives foreign money from his overseas holdings constantly.\n\nThere’s also the issue of the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., which has become a popular destination for foreign diplomats. A week after the November election, about 100 foreign officials were invited to an event at the property, during which they toured the building and sipped champagne. While Trump promised before taking office that he’d donate all profits earned from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury, he doesn’t appear to have kept that pledge. So far, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have all held events at the hotel, but there’s also the trickier matter of how to account for individuals linked to foreign governments. A Trump Organization pamphlet published in May said that “putting forth a policy that asks all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand.”\n\nIn January, the nonprofit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) welcomed Trump to the White House by suing him on the grounds that he was already in violation of the Emoluments Clause. The Justice Department responded with a 70-page legal brief defending the president’s conduct and calling for the suit’s dismissal\n\n.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, 15 women claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Trump, going on the record to accuse him of groping them—in planes, offices, hotels, even golf and tennis tournaments. The then-presidential nominee vehemently denied any accounts of misconduct, and suggested the women weren’t attractive enough to merit his attention. But in January, Summer Zeryos, a former “Apprentice” contestant who had accused Trump of kissing her, grabbing her breast and thrusting his groin toward her in 2007, but whose accusation Trump had dismissed as “totally made up nonsense,” sued Trump for defamation. Zervos’ suit claims that Trump’s malicious response to her and others—he repeatedly called her and other women who came forward “liars”—resulted in “threats of violence, economic harm, and reputational damage.” In March, Trump claimed that as president, he should have immunity from Zeryos’ suit. It will serve only to “distract a president from his public duties to the detriment of not only the president and his office but also the Nation,” wrote his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, in a filing. In July, Kawowitz filed a motion for dismissal. It hasn’t yet been granted.\n\nThe first lady’s bio on the White House website, as first published in January, noted her modeling accolades and charitable causes, but also included what many sawas a blatant endorsement of her products. “Melania is also a successful entrepreneur,” the bio read. “In April 2010, Melania Trump launched her own jewelry collection, ‘Melania™ Timepieces & Jewelry,’ on QVC.” The episode was added to the growing evidence of blurred lines between business and public service in the Trump administration. Facing backlash, the White House quickly removed the QVC plug from the website\n\nWhen Nordstrom announced it would stop selling Ivanka Trump's clothing line in February, Trump took to Twitter to defend his daughter. Later that week, not even three weeks after the Melania QVC debacle, presidential aide Kellyanne Conway delivered a ringingendorsement of the brand herself from the White House briefing room, urging Americans, “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” The rules are clear on this: Executive branch employees can’t use public office for private gain, to endorse any product or for the private gain of friends. The Office of Government Ethics wrote that “there is strong reason to believe” the action had violated the Standards of Conduct, and Conway was supposedly reprimanded for the mistake by Trump himself—but no disciplinary action was taken.","title":"✨trump2020 in a grave✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"Grace Ellen Gaiters","rating":1}},{"id":"6177395119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:36:06Z","review":"0 stars","title":"this app made me heavily depressed","isEdited":false,"userName":"joperbof","rating":1}},{"id":"6177385574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:33:16Z","review":"i will now be voting for biden this election . horrible app","title":"review","isEdited":false,"userName":"anonymousforpresident0829","rating":1}},{"id":"6177363677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:26:44Z","review":"It’s trash","title":"Trash","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lyss56","rating":1}},{"id":"6177299738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:44Z","review":"This app is terrible","title":"Ughhh","isEdited":false,"userName":"@aaliyahnrios","rating":1}},{"id":"6177292278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:06:35Z","review":"just give us tiktok please","title":"i want tik tok ☺️","isEdited":false,"userName":"bryandiaz3727","rating":1}},{"id":"6177273751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:01:15Z","review":"not a good app hate the man too","title":"it was bad","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bjxnsnxjx","rating":1}},{"id":"6177262668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:58:02Z","review":"It’s genuinely not a good app","title":"Not a good app","isEdited":false,"userName":"12345678syd","rating":1}}]}
