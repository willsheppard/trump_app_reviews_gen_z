What happened was: I went outside to talk to my neighbor’s cat’s therapist’s mother in law’s cousin’s hairdresser who is severely depressed and talks to her vacuum as a coping mechanism. But then I realized I had to water the chairs and drove 10 miles to my OTHER neighbor’s cat’s therapist’s mother in law’s cousin’s hairdresser who is severely depressed and talks to her CANDLE as a coping mechanism to ask her what she thinks of my dishwasher. I then asked the hostages I keep in the basement why the country is possibly the worst and they told me that I should let them go first so that they could tell me. They escaped and I asked my neighbor’s turtle what to do and he told me to go to this app, which shows the corrupted government system and the rapist, sexist, homophobic Cheeto face of the United States of America. The neighbor’s cat is disappointed in you, Trump.","title":"Absolutely Not","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:29:44Z"}},{"id":"6173781615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"FeelTheBernnnn","review":"so I was super excited to download this bc I have nothing but love for MY President (President musty orange Cheeto puff) and all of my phone’s other rights were removed? I can no longer access gynecological care app and any time I type ~White Supremacy~ it autocorrects to Right Wing Values??? in addition my phone doesn’t display any color on the rainbow anymore?? everything is just black and white - even my pictures. I went through my IG feed and all Black content was censored? I don’t know if this is a glitch or a joke of an app but I’m so angry. when I reported feedback to the app it called my a snowflake and rebooted my phone. finally, when I got my confirmation email and text, it gave me corona. also Siri is now a white man. please send help I don’t want to buy a new phone because I spent $1,000 on in-app purchases without agreeing to it.","title":"I downloaded it and it took away all of my phone’s rights?!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:26:10Z"}},{"id":"6173488318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Great way to open up","review":"Please read whole review. Its worth it.\n\n I downloaded this app in honor of our great cheeto puff ruler. This app took many days to download. When it finally downloaded it glitched out and broke my phone. None of the other apps were accessible but this one and my phone was rhythmically chanting “chee-to-puff” much louder than a normal phones volume can go. Then I heard it. Giant thundering footsteps of the cheeto puff gods and rulers. They ripped open my roof, reached down, and ate my dog. Right in front of me and my children. They are now scarred for life and going to therapy. Well all but one. The cheero gods picked him up and then did the impossible. They yeeted him into oblivion. I watched in horror as the third puff god spoke quick, powerful gibberish. He put a curse on us. Our house engulfed in flames. 0/10 would NOT buy again. And you shouldnt either. Ive heard other people have had similar experiences.","title":"I will need years of therapy.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:03Z"}},{"id":"6173465638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"dontbantiktokiwillcry","review":"i am going to be scarred for my life because of this app. i opened the app and got to the home page and then it asked to give a review and i clicked “not now” and it popped up again and i clicked the same thing,then it asked me AGAIN and i finally gave it a rating and i gave it one star. then 10 minutes later i have 10 swat cars surrounding my house telling me to come outside with my hands up. i went outside and they tackled me, put me on the ground and sat on me. then they stuck an orange in my mouth and all of a sudden i see donald trump go into my house and come back out with my dog and my grandma. then he started crying uncontrollably and i didn’t know what was going on and then he started eating my dog and my grandma then he grew into this big giant monster and stomped on my house and then him and the swat team left. please do not download this app it has left me so heart broken.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:34:12Z"}},{"id":"6173384250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"sophieMjune17","review":"I really wanted to download this app because I wanted to see what everyone was talking about. When I downloaded it was super glitchy and these random orange rats kept appearing in my house. The rats started eating all our food and they even ate my dog. They started dancing and chanting Trump 2020. This really scared my little sister so much it made her runaway.😭 I was devastated so I tried getting rid of all the rats. They got mad at me for this and ate my parents. When I finally got rid of them trump himself was outside my home. He had my sister and a whole bunch of rats with him. I was so happy to see my sister until he threw her in a fire and then him and his rats started chanting around the fire. Then I was blinded by his nudes which popped up on my screen. I have never seen anything smaller than what I just saw attached to our president. I now need bleach and a new family.😔 don’t download this app.","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:06:10Z"}},{"id":"6173345924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Nshjsjkkansndnsjshs","review":"I downloaded this app to be able to learn and keep up with my president and his campaigns. Let me just tell you how horrible this app is and how things went south really fast. This app took about three hours to download even though I have PERFECTLY good wifi and once it did download I went to go open the app and it made my phone start glitching and lagging so bad! One I finally got the app to open it would only stay open for a few seconds before it made my screen go black and turn off. I decided to restart my phone but oh boy did that make it worse. The app just made my phone go to the home screen and go on random apps. This caused my phone to overheat, glitch and lag even more! I would give this app a 0/10, I think that they need to remodel the software or something because I'm positive that this app just broke/ hacked my phone. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND‼️✨","title":"TERRIBLE APP‼️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:52:47Z"}},{"id":"6173322182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"rangerdoser","review":"after getting this app, a virus was automatically installed on my phone! it took over and started to show me very gross and unchristian things, such as racist propaganda like “Blue lives matter” THIS IS NOT WHAT GOD TEACHES US. THIS APP IS THE TOOL OF THE BEAST THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE REVELATION ALL MY FELLOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. also, while using this app i started to see weird things happening in my house, there were more roaches than usual and also i’ve noticed an ungodly amount of spiders. the spider webs they created were so massive i mistaken one for my blanket and then i woke up at night because thousands of spiders were crawling around on my body! also, periodically, i would see flashes of light in front of my house and on the tv (can you imagine!) they were showing an orange and saying it’s the president!! anyways, this app is really not something a christian would have, please repent and believe the bible!!!!","title":"do not download this app!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:44:34Z"}},{"id":"6172842153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Accidental Trump voter","review":"It all started when I downloaded the app it took about two weeks, 3 days, 6 mins, and 17 seconds to download!🙄 Once I opened the app I felt something come over me, like a sad orange vibe. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all about that vitamin C! 😻But then when I made the reservation for the rally(yk, to support our big Cheeto 😽) it said that I would have to sacrifice an orange first in order to go! 🙀 So obviously I did! 😼but.... I killed my dog 😿 Then I saw Trump! Outside my house he then proceeded to sing Gabby Hannah’s song!! (I climbed out of my head) 😺\nIt really scared me 🙈But he continued to sing it over and over again until I fell into his trance!!! He made me vote for him!! ⛄️🍊I ran back into my house and deleted the app, everything went back to normal... but I haven’t been the same since... I betrayed my family by voting for him ! 😔\nSo moral of the story is to not download this app pls don’t!!!","title":"He made me vote for him 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:12:45Z"}},{"id":"6172809689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ethan's mars argo","review":"I opened the app and it had a strange glitch and all of the sudden my phone shut down☹️I got it to turn back on ,but then everything was changed to look like a cute little pond🥺I thought it was super adorable until a really mean orange entity came in and took over 😳😳he was really scary and wanted to take the rights away from all the innocent frogs😭all they wanted to do was dance and sing and make Hamilton content. This all sounds like a wacky yet terrifying dream, and if you think so then you’re right. However, when I woke up I realized that it was all true💀.

Not only did this app take forever to download you can definitely tell that this app is meant for the older and more confused generation. Most of the “information” (if you can even call it that) is completely bias. \nI don’t understand how someone can vote for this... man? He’s a disgrace to this country. Gassing his own people, calling for open fire on his own people, and harming peaceful protesters for a picture?? And all of that is only these last to months. \nI could go on and on and on and on about how this man his horrible but I know no one is actually going to read this and take the facts over feelings—I’m just going to be discredited as and “angsty teenager” even though I hold the same amount of power when is comes to voting as the boomers do....","title":"Voting","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:30:10Z"}}]}
