My phone electrocuted me which caused me to fall, roll down my basement stairs and crack my head against the concrete and break all my bones in my body. I was rushed to the ER only to find out that they have a ban on anyone who has ever downloaded this app. I was forced to go to a shady doctor who lived at the bottom of a dark, rocky ravine, and the experience scarred me so much that I went into psychologic shock. My phone then wouldn’t allow me to delete the app. I discovered that it had caused my phone to be overrun with 73 viruses and ALL MY OTHER APPS ON MY PHONE TURNED INTO THE OFFICIAL TRUMP APP. My phone suddenly grew arms and legs and roundhouse kicked me into China, where I am now residing, and I think the toxic fumes of the factory I landed in are going to kill me."}},{"id":"6174461736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:28:49Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i was deceived 😪","userName":"cheetolover6969","review":"I downloaded this app after my grandpa told me it would help feed my hot Cheeto addiction (in more ways that one), but he failed to tell me that this app only provides normal Cheetos. Who would want that?? Despite the fact that it’s my grandpa’s fault for giving me wrong information, I was still a little excited for any type of Cheeto content. Sadly, it only gave me below average Cheeto content. Quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered! I’m disappointed that I couldn’t find any coupons or discounts, but I guess since they already advertise terrible knock offs rather that quality Cheetos that I couldn’t expect much. I strongly do not recommend !! Do NOT waste your time or storage on this terrible app because we all know how valuable iPhone storage is !!! 😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6174449302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:25:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"worst app ever","userName":"tiktok is soooo good","review":"right when i opened the app i saw this disgusting looking (maybe even rotten) cheeto. i was so scared i pooped my pants. 😔then i saw this HORRIFYING picture of a cheeto getting a spray tan which made me pee my pants and i was like I JUST THROUGH OUT POOPY PANTS. so i was like i’m done this app. but then i continued AND saw this terrifying thing say how he would DATE his daughter and threw up in my mouth. but i couldn’t let all of it stay in so, i threw up in a bag and sent it to the white house for the terrifying cheeto. i took another look at the app and then all my furniture 🪑 started levitating. i was so scared. my furniture flew all the way to the cheeto house BACK and my furniture beat him up so bad some say he is still coughing cheeto dust. finally all my furniture came back 😌🖐🏽. after that i was done with the app FOR GOOD."}},{"id":"6174439339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible and Terrifying😨🤢","userName":"ykm._shae","review":"When I first opened this I app I puked is was so terrific that when I saw the picture of the Cheeto I threw up multiple time and got dehydrated and had to go to the hospital.

Then, as if that wasn’t bad enough I began getting harassed and cyber bullied by trump and his team. They were threatening me and my family. If this information isn’t enough for someone to TAKE DOWN THIS APP there’s more... shortly after I downloaded it my phone started glitching uncontrollably and I can barely use it now. Just typing this review is a struggle but something HAS to be said. I can see many people are struggling with some of the same problems I faced and worse! I don’t understand why this app can still be allowed in the app shore. Something needs to be done. Apple get your sh**t together and delete this app 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6174000919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:48:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","userName":"Chad🖕🧢🏈🧑🏻\u200D🦰🕶🔫","review":"This app is a no from me🤚🏻. This app stole from me. I don’t know how it got my information but for some reason it really just stole my money. Then I was looking and I saw a horrifying video of gabbie Hannah talking about her high school booliez. I mean this app is just a disgrace. It was so bad that it took my grandma off of life support and threw my dog in the ocean. Then I saw a video of a frog. It was the weirdest experience and I really don’t know how it got there. But I kind liked it 😏. Anyways enough about me and my experiences but this app is just so horrible I mean even the government came to my house and stole my pet pizza. Like what the heck guys c’mon I know it smelled a little but that is no excuse to steal my pet pizza. When Ariana grande said just keep breathing I don’t think it was meant for you trump 🥰💕💅🧜🏻\u200D♀️❤️🧚\u200D♀️🤪👼🏼🧚🏻\u200D♂️💃🏻"}},{"id":"6173968093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:36:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"BAD BAD BAD 🍊🟠🤢🤮🥴","userName":"Ardiee 😁","review":"Throughout the time that I had this app my house developed an awful stank as if someone didn’t take the rotting orange out of the White House. In addition, the application featured inappropriate photographs of naked dancing Cheetos. I do believe that this is the reason my hula hoop became quite frustrated with my mother. If these events aren’t bad enough, everyone on this app was kissing trash! I find this very unsanitary so I went to get a face mask 😷 to protect me from the germs 🦠 but theses psychos have “had enough of masks” \nSO, in conclusion, the app stank, was filled with moldy Cheetos, trash kissers, aggravated my PRECIOUS HULA HOOP, was inappropriate and a bad influence on the youth of today (who have obviously been influenced by this DESPICABLE app) WELL NO WONDER IT HAS AN INCREDIBLY LOW REVIEWS! I have successfully seen enough of orange 🍊 on white CHILDREN PLEASE TAKE OUT THE TRASH 🗑"}},{"id":"6173940359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:25:41Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"AMERICAN PATRIOTS READ THIS!!!!!","userName":"Awesome Girl1234","review":"i downloaded this app because i love this country. the first thing you see is a screen with mr. president and words that say “join to help keep american great”. well, i did just that. and guess what? the cops who murdered breonna taylor and elijah mcclain are still free, women are being abused and murdered on military bases, people are being lynched and having their death ruled as sxicides, and there are *still* children in cages. i’m horrified. every night i lay and bed hoping and praying that i will wake up to america being great again. except that’s all a lie, because trump is a narcissistic, racist, homophobic, white supremacist poopy head. n e way vote him out in november, to Make America Great (for the first time because it’s built off of years of systematic oppression and has never been great for all its citizens)."}}]}
