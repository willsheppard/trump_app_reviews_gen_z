It has so many viruses so now I am going to call my phone Peaches. When ever I received a message the ringer would be Melania Trump saying “hello”. I literally thought someone was in my house! But someone was! 😳😤😭😢🤬😱 IT WAS PEACHES!!!! She said that trump sent her out to get me!!! So I ran. But she got into her batmoble and chased me. She hit me with the batmoble and then I flew and passed out. Once I woke up I saw trump and peaches making out. I screamed and cried in terror. Then trump grabbed a pickle and smacked me with it. But then peaches had to sneeze and that caused an earthquake. I was able to free myself and run away. I immediately deleted the app and went on with life. Currently in therapy.

I thought i was supposed to see trump. anyways, after that i went to go take a dump. 💩 After i came back, my camera app would pop up. I was so confused. So i thought my phone was glitching and so i started using my mac. BUT THEN the green light next to my camera was ON. 😟😱 i then got death threats through texts. when i replied they said they were the FBI, and they placed a virus in my laptop. I was scared 😭😭. I thought they only meant a laptop virus, but it was also a REAL virus. My eyes started burning and i started having hallucinations. there were orange cheetos ALL around me. 😭 They were thic, ugly and smell cheetos. i went to the ER, and the doc gave me medication and i felt better. when i went back home, MY FRIDGE WAS GONE. i think someone else also had the same problem too. please pay for my fridge and the other fridges that we’re stolen. i hope the next update will fix these problems 😡.","isEdited":false,"userName":"64829462","title":"FBI SPYING","date":"2020-07-09T00:41:19Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174010077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After I downloaded this app, a virus downloaded onto my phone and practically broke it! Whenever I opened an app, the text read \"TRUMP 2020 AND FOREVER, THE CHEETO WILL ALWAYS WIN,\" and the background was an image of a very flobbery shirtless picture of Trump and Barney figure skating together. Deeply disturbed, I looked up how to fix this issue, and I found out many people have also encountered this problem. And the worst part is that IT BROKE THEIR PHONES!!! I, a sopheware engineer, tried to fix it myself, but everything I did, it just got worse. It accessed my PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION and sent my most voluptuous and scandalous secrets to my work and family, even my 9 year old son, Phillip. It then emptied my bank account and put it in the Trump campaign. Enraged, I called customer service, but I was put on hold listening to tiktok songs. After 1.5 hours, they HUNG UP ON ME!!! I never ever getting my live earnings back, and I could not pay for when my wife DIVORCED ME BECAUSE OF THIS APP'S DOINGS!!! If you have any personal information on your phone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP!! IT IS A TRAP!!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"boba.oreo","title":"This app HUMILIATED ME","date":"2020-07-08T22:52:05Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172735188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am absolutely disgusted with the quality of this app. You would think that for a PRESIDENT he would be able to afford the latest technology. I downloaded it because my mother wanted to monitor Trump. Personally I am not a Trump supporter but I don’t hate the man. This app has changed that. First of all, the app kept glitching out, I don’t know if it’s because of all of the recent downloads or what. Then the app took AGES to let me sign up. It’s absolutely insane! As Americans, and by far one of the most technologically evolved powers, we should do better than this. ESPECIALLY IF IT’S THE PRESIDENT! THE MAN WHO REPRESENTS US. If he can not keep up to date with the world then I don’t believe he should be in charge of our country, plain and simple. And for all of those conservative extremists in the reviews talking about “children shouldn’t be writing reviews if they can’t vote” IT’S CALLED THE FIRST AMENDMENT! Which still applies to the citizens of America who may be underage. Start upholding our constitutional values you bigots!  And get this stupid app fixed or take it off the APP STORE!","isEdited":false,"userName":"DEBBY RYAN CHARLES KRUPNICK","title":"I AM APPALLED😡","date":"2020-07-08T15:42:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177502056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the fuss was about since the 2020 elections are coming up soon. First of all the app took forever to download! It felt as if i was waiting at the DMV to get my license all over again. Second as soon as the app opened it would crash. I could barely make it into the app but once I did the layout was so confusing that i had no idea what to even look at! Eventually with all the crashing my phone just couldn’t take it anymore and turned off completely. I spent so much time trying to figure out why i couldn’t turn my phone back on. I plugged it in just in case my battery was dead but that didn’t work either. I ended up having to get a new phone. (keep in mind that my phone was relatively new before downloading the app)  I would never recommend this app to anyone I know. even my enemies. I wouldn’t want them to endure the same pain that I went through trying to use this app. I am greatly disappointed and hope that it gets removed.","isEdited":false,"userName":"RayRay891","title":"This app broke my phone","date":"2020-07-09T17:07:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177492270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to my surprise whenever I opened it, it showed a scary crusty ratty orange and had me suffer from a heart attack. I went to the hospital and had to stay there for 1 week!! The image I had a heart attack on was very offensive. The image contained a fat smelly orange crying because he wanted to make me to but in my private information so he can hack me. I have the cops invoked in this and wish to get rid of this app because seriously no likes it. Every time I look at the picture, it makes me uncomfortable. Also, I thought of this app being a trump my little pony’s princess castle simulator game but to find out it was a campaign. I don't have time to be filling my private information into this sketchy website but I do really want this to be banned bc it is offensive and disgusting. Also, keep in mind I don't like the app either because of how racist, homophobic, and toxic the community it and trump himself. If u don't wanna ban it then might as well make it to trump my little pony’s game because honestly, that would be entertaining","isEdited":false,"userName":"Baxster2010","title":"Terrible 😬🙄","date":"2020-07-09T17:04:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177447840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Well I have been a supporter of President trump since he was elected in 2016, and I think he has been doing an amazing job making America great again. So, for this election I wanted to be totally up to date on his campaign and help where I could, so my son showed me this app. He helped me download it onto my phone, but when I went to use it it wouldn’t work! I tried to get it to work for hours and asked my son about it eventually. He said his was doing the same thing that mine was. It kept exiting out of the app and making my phone freeze after only a few minutes of using it. I asked my daughter to try to fix it because she is more savvy than me but she couldn’t figure it out either! She tried turning it off and on again and deleting and putting it back on my phone. I wish I could give a better review for my president, but I don’t want others to go through what I went through. I think I’ll just have to stick to the news and internet to keep up with my president. Either way, TRUMP 2020!🇺🇸","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sharleen Woods","title":"I tried","date":"2020-07-09T16:51:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176934092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok so I downloaded this app so I could really truly support our AMAZING president but this app \n                   ✨𝑟𝑢𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑚𝑦 𝑙𝑖𝐼𝑖𝐼𝑓𝑒.✨\nFirst of all this app took weeks to download and the moment it did it wiped all the data off my phone except for the app. When i restarted my phone, my lockscreen was a picture of the orange himself, and this app was installed at least 100 times. When i open the app, I was immediatley hypnotized into supporting trump until I closed the app. The moment I closed it five of my ribs cracked and I lost half of my blood, and I was rushed to the ER. When the doctors asked me what happened, they told me that over the last two weeks, FIVE HUNDRED people came in to the hospital with similar injuries. MY five ribs will never heal, and it was because of the 💕trump app.💕 Thanks to this app, I will never leave the hospital again. \nAnyway, I hope this story will help you rethink your decision to download this app because it truly is not worth the risk. This app ruined my life, and unless you was to ruin yours, don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"--1-1-2","title":"✨terrible✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:27:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176908554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I got this app to be able to support my wonderful president but I open the app and I see our presidents nudes 😱 I could not believe my eyes so I proceeded to close the app and tell myself that it was probably a glitch in the system and that I’d try again tomorrow 😓 the next day I opened the app and everything was normal for 5 seconds at most and then a video of the president working out and sweating like some dirty pig popped up and I screamed so loudly that I broke my vocal cords 😭 I took my boyfriends credit card and bought 3 “Trump 2020” flags for me and my kids and when they came in the mail I decided to put one in my daughters room and one in my soon to be stepsons room for when they came back from their stay at a very nice hotel 🤪 they came back and walked into their rooms and saw the flags and started to call me racist names like  “Karen”, “unseasoned”, and even “cracker” I was so horrified that I began to cry and lock myself in my room 😤 i just want to be able to live, love, laugh with my kids 😝","isEdited":false,"userName":"eskeetitpeep","title":"Horrifying, will need to take 18 years of therapy ☹️","date":"2020-07-09T14:20:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176890708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app a while back. It was nothing bad at first until I began to enjoy it too much, you know... I became obsessed. I was on here every day admiring orange man and preparing for the day I gave myself to him. My wife, Karen, hated my obsession. She said I yelled too much. She said I threw things too much. My own children were scared of me... She sent me to rehab, and it worked! I felt like a new man! Everything was great until the app… it came back... it seemed it lurked in my dreams. There was no escape, I couldn’t help myself. It was worse than ever, I devoted hours and hours out of my day to gaze upon the app, feelings it’s brainwashing tendencies and feeling... an intense love for my device.  Constantly I was using this app, everything I did was about this app, all I did was use this app. I was past the point of return. Karen, if you see this, please come back, and at least let me see my kids on Christmas, I promise I will no longer strike upon them when they interrupt me... Please save yourself from this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Questfurpeace","title":"this app ruined my life and marriage","date":"2020-07-09T14:15:43Z","rating":1}}]}
