But it took a ridiculously long time to download, which doesn’t make sense because I made sure to delete all my other apps just so I could dedicate myself to this one. Yeah, you could say I’m loyal🙈🤪But once I downloaded the app it asked for my phone number. I thought it was a little sketch but I gave them the number in hopes that Barron would text me. But he didn’t “😞Heart been broke 💔 so many times ⏱ I don’t know 🤷\u200D♀️ what to believe👎” anyways some funky stuff started happening after I submitted my number. My camera turned green and someone started shouting at me through the phone in a hick accent (and my Siri has an Australian one so it obviously wasn’t her). What was the hick man shouting at me you ask? He was telling me to kill my pet rock to show my commitment to the Trump Cult. My pet rock Steve means EVERYTHING TO ME, and they thought I was just going to EXECUTE him for the TRUMP CULT???? I 🙅\u200D♀️DONT🙅\u200D♀️THINK🙅\u200D♀️SO. Of course I immediately deleted the app and microwaved my phone just to make sure they didn’t have any of my information. Of course this ended up with my mom having to buy me a new phone and a new microwave. Making me grounded for LIFE. All thanks to this AWFUL app👎👎👎","userName":"mariahlnorton"}},{"id":"6179443854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Froze my phone","date":"2020-07-10T04:32:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The app keeps freezing up my phone when I try to open it.
