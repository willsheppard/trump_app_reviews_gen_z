It began on a tuesday morning, right after I downloaded the app mind you, when a began to develop an irritable rash on my left thumb that gradually began to spread across the rest of my body, thus giving me a rather revolting orange tint. Furthermore, upon downloading this app I have somehow acquired large tufts of what I assume to be hair protruding from my cheeto-resembling scalp. To make matters worse I have lost all forms of coherent speech patterns and comprehensibility, allowing me to presume that my cranium has drastically shrunken in size. I have contacted a copious number of people trying to fix this problem but no one seems to be addressing the issue. DO NOT I repeat DO NOT download this app unless you wish to acquire the symptoms that I have listed above ✨✨✨","userName":"falafel520","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:30:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"very disappointed,,,"}},{"id":"6179261408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to stay informed but ever since I downloaded it my phone keeps rebooting . Not sure what’s going on. I was able to briefly get on the app but was met to have to put in my phone number. I don’t mind email address but not phone number I don’t want my number to be sold. Disappointed and wasted so much time.","userName":"Jenn0201","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:30:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t do it"}},{"id":"6179261287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first clicked the download button for this app 2 months ago, and guess what? It took until today to finish all its downloads. Why in tarnation would you want an app that literally ✨𝓞𝓫𝓵𝓲𝓽𝓮𝓻𝓪𝓽𝓮𝓼✨ your phone storage? Im not even going to lie, I only downloaded this ✨lovely✨ app because I heard that a free kj apa appears in your house. That was so not the case though. As soon as my downloads were finished today, my fish yeeted out of its fish tank and died on the floor while suffering from ear rape. That’s right! Ear rape! My phone blasted a huge tornado warning sound. Thanks to you donald, MY FISH IS DEAD! I can’t believe I supported you before🤢 Also, I expected to be able to reach Barron trump through this app, because let’s not lie donald, you are basically holding him hostage😒 YOUR OWN SON!! I was looking forward to being able to reach him and come save him! But our lovely president, who ruins everything for us, including our beloved tiktok, prevented me from helping someone in need. In conclusion, Donald, you should be scared of us (gen z). We don’t stop until we get what we want🤪.  Barron will be saved and you will be ✨demolished✨💋 xoxo gossip girl","userName":"AwesomeReA","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:30:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨𝓐𝓫𝓼𝓸𝓵𝓾𝓽𝓮𝓵𝔂 𝓷𝓸𝓽✨"}},{"id":"6179261291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This thing is horrible I started downloading its year ago!
