After I downloaded this on my iPhone my phone started to restart 5 times and then I got a virus that wouldn’t let me go to any apps or even make any emergency calls. Please don’t download it.

The content it provides is also super biased and unworthy. Remove this from the App Store. Remove the Cheeto from the office as well.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176571459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"don’t download","isEdited":false,"userName":"kikii21","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:11Z","review":"this took 12 years to download. and then when it did it asked for my phone number which i think is highly inappropriate especially when our president has his wife AND his daughter. unacceptable","rating":1}},{"id":"6176531601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hands too big","isEdited":false,"userName":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕🧚🏼\u200D♀️🤙🏼","date":"2020-07-09T12:40:16Z","review":"This app is made for small handed people. The person who made this app did not think hard enough about the people that would want to use this app. Very disappointing and dissatisfactory.
