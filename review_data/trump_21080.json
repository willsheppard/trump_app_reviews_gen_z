When I tell you there was nothing, there was NOTHING. The app glitches out reflecting on his sporadic and unreliable behavior. The app was poorly designed  just like trump. Not to worry though Iâ€™ll see that this app is poorly rated and Trump in 6 years. \n\n;)"}},{"id":"6172919164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THE RATS ARE EVERYWHERE","date":"2020-07-08T16:36:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"GEOMETRY DASH STINKS","review":"I originally downloaded this app for our great president trump, but to my dismay, once you OPEN the app it emits a frequency that attracts RATS. I just thought it was a coincidence when one showed up in my home, then another one showed up, and then another, and by the time it got to 12 hours later and there were THOUSANDS of rats on my property. Trump I hope you're happy!!!!"}},{"id":"6172869629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"UGH","date":"2020-07-08T16:21:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Itzz.cailin","review":"This app is absolutely horrible it took DAYS to download and even after it downloaded it just kept on glitching and showing some Cheeto puffs faceðŸŸ  Then it would play all sorts of weird music which then brought dozens of cats to my house!
