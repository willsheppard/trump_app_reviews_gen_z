Alas it was incredibly slow I’m pretty sure it was implanting a tracker but I followed through. When it finally finish early this month and I had my Torino’s pizza rolls I tried to open the app but it wouldn’t open. Dropping my phone in the toilet and setting it in rice seemed to do the trick and the app opened. Then, having it open it asked me for very personal information like what my phone number and next menstrual cycle was. After answering the questions and giving my credit card information and social security number I got a call from an unknown number asking if I wanted to play a game. I said no and hung up and when I went to sleep I woke up in a room with a dead man whose leg was cut off chained to a bathtub and I was missing my liver. After escaping I tried to go home only to find my house burned to the ground with the lingering smell of McDonalds and depression. 0/10 would probably jump out of a moving vehicle on the highway again.","date":"2020-07-09T13:55:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BunniOtomia"}},{"id":"6177379875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My Review","review":"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎\n\n....Also the app was glitchy and my phone crashed so uh....y’all might wanna fix that","date":"2020-07-09T16:31:33Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"169350475047"}},{"id":"6177741074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"left me orange","review":"a  few weeks ago i decided it was time to download the app of our president, mr donald not racist trump. it was all going just peachy🍑 i was scrolling through the app before bed. i went to bed feeling wonderful knowing our country is in the hands of an idiot! i woke up the next morning, wondering what sexist thing our president was going to do today, when i see that my hands have mysteriously turned ORANGE! now, i have been using self tanning lotion, as the beaches are opening up in the middle of a pandemic and i wanted to look tan. but the rest of my body was its normal, fake tan look. my hands on the other hand were a bright orange! they looked exactly the skin tone of mr presidents very own complexion! i decided to shower and not worry, as my president ✨always✨ knows the right answer. as always, i scrolled through the app before bed. and my face was orange the next morning! i decided to give it some time. but every morning after, a new body part turned orange. i looked like a female version of mr president himself! i called my dear republican friend and she said the same thing had happened to her! the only thing she could do was delete the app of our dear president. so i had to do it. i deleted the app and all is well.

But when I opened the app I was scared. When I opened this I saw him rubbing an orange all over his body saying “you like that don’t you, and Obama could neva.”  Then I heard a strange voice outside whispering “make America great again.” Later that night when I was about to fall asleep my window opens and a bunch of people who looked like they belonged in the exorcist came in. Obviously I was scared! They said that a man was here to take me away. At first I thought it could be Peter Pan but I was very wrong. The man was a deep shade of orange. Then I thought of my lord and savior President Turnip or whatever his name is. So he took me and said “Luke I am your father...” I was like who is Luke. Me thinking he got the wrong person said “ hey I’m not Luke but good luck finding him.” But he insisted it was me... now I’m being held against my will in an underground place with little food and water because I will not admit I am Luke. They don’t know I have my phone I snuck it in but don’t ask how or where I put it. Be safe and DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This can happen to you too...\n                                                    Love,\n                                                    Not Luke","date":"2020-07-09T09:20:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"👁👄👁🗿"}},{"id":"6175864914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY DOG!","review":"Firstly, this app deserves NO stars AT ALL! I wanted to get more information about when the next rally would be, but it took 90 days to download! So today I decided to take a walk and when it finally downloaded I open it to find a horrifying picture of this Cheeto looking man! A different picture would have been more pleasant for the first thing to see on this app! Then I tried to look more into it and it starts to glitch A LOT! Then my phone got really hot, so I get a tub of ice and I put my phone in it. But when I went to go get my phone, it was even more hot then it was before! I began to think I had no idea but then I realized it was the Trump App! I scurried to the kitchen as fast as I could...but it was too late. The app took over my phone and hacked \nEVERYTHING! I had no idea what to do! Then something came shooting out of my phone! None other than a trump flag! It’s my dogs favorite flag in the world (being the great trump supporter he is) but I went to go over to it and I slipped and fell! Then this Cheeto looking man hops out of my phone and STEELS my dog!!! When my dog forced his way out he was overwhelmed and overworked with trauma! He couldn’t take it and he said “I love you” and passed! I am so angry and I don’t advise ANYONE to get this app!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T09:17:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🌼💯✨🧚\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6176924819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","review":"I downloaded this app as an 18 year old finally old enough to vote. I wanted to see all the sides to the situation and hopefully make an informed vote once i get to the polling booth. Immediately as i opened the app i felt a terrible sensation inside, through this i knew the app was evil. I continued to slowly use it, but that was when the bad luck started. From monday night when i added it to wednesday all types of evil started happening in my life. First i was automatically subscribed to many political affiliation organizations. As an independent i was very offended to be grouped into one group. Then, people started showing up to my house to “confirm” my vote for trump through weird activities that are not appropriate enough to repeat. From this moment I knew i had to share, this is an app made by a president trying to control his people. This man is trying to track me and possibly have me killed. Due to this fact unfortunately i will not be voting for Donald Trump in the 2020 election and i hope all readers can follow my direction. This is a truly evil app and i hope you can stay away even though i didn’t. If i die i hope this message is here to explain to everyone why and how it happened. Donald Trump his app and his family are truly EVIL people!","date":"2020-07-09T14:24:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"nostreels"}},{"id":"6177475172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oompa Loompa’s do come kill you...","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to get more educated about politics and what our president has in store for our futures. However, I should have read the reviews first and I will never make this mistake again. After downloading the app I started receiving threats on my bedroom window in the form of a sticky note. The notes said stuff along the lines of “vote for trump 2020 or you will regret it!” As a young women living in the USA, I left a sticky note for my fellow stalker stating, “I was under the impression this was a free country and I have the right to vote for who I want to.” My stalker responded with, “you are a women... you don’t have rights!” And “girl’s opinions don’t matter.” I responded via sticky note with, “I will be voting for Kanye West this year, although I believe votes should stay private. Have a nice day!” The next thing I knew I got a knock at my door and to my surprise it was a flock of Oompa Loompa’s. They then forced me to “take myself out” Hanna Baker style, by saying they would hurt my family. I am indeed writing this from heaven (have no idea why I got put here) and wish everyone a early merry Christmas (if you make it that far) To sign off I’d just like to say ALL OF THE REVIEWS ARE FACTS AND YOU SHOULD NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU WANT OOMPA LOOMPAS TO KILL YOU TOO!!!","date":"2020-07-09T16:59:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Anna Hone"}},{"id":"6176830105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Broke my Oven and Brought Back Voldemort.","review":"I downloaded this app for some quality baking recipes. It DID NOT have any recipes, in fact, and worse than that, it gave my oven a virus. Now, every time I open my oven the oven door starts closing and clapping really loud to the beat of various Imagine Dragons songs. When I try to set the timer or the temperature, it just rick-rolls me. I tapped on the app to delete it, in case it would save my oven, but instead it brought me to an old graveyard, along with my dog, who I was petting at the time. We looked around, trying to figure out where we were, but then a whispery voice yelled “kill the spare” and my dog is dead now, thanks a lot. Then, the man in the hood walked towards me, and it turns out it was Donald trump. He carried baby Voldemort in his arms, dropped him in my own crockpot that he stole from my house, and cut off his hand into my very nice crockpot. He then performed a weird ritual and lots of men in black cloaks and hoods showed up once Voldemort was fully grown again. He used the cruciatus curse on me and made me duel him, but then a bunch of ghosts came out of his wand and I escaped, but Donald trump helped bring Voldemort back, ruined my crockpot, broke my oven, killed my dog, and used the app as a port key. Not pleased, would NOT download again.","date":"2020-07-09T13:59:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mcbobert"}},{"id":"6176403012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"I downloaded this app to help our little trumsy wumsy but WHAT do I find instead! An app all about supporting LGBTQ+, the Black Lives Matter Movement, and the Environment! I am utterly disgusted and devastated, when I saw this I screamed so loud I broke a window and a bird fell OUT of the sky! I was so shocked to see all these horrible good things and called the president right after, he didn’t pick up at first but then he did and he said “THAT IS VERY MUCH NOT TRUE MY APP IS AMAZING, MY APP IS THE BEST THING WE’VE SEEN IN YEARS!” However that is not the end! For my phone started getting a ridiculous amount of spam and then it started teaching me about CULTURES and other LANGUAGES! I feel so disrespected and hurt by these actions. After this I left and went for a walk to cool off but as I was walking through the street there was a window cleaner fairly high up cleaning a window and my app connect to his Bluetooth headphones WITHOUT ME EVEN TURNING THE BLUETOOTH ON! It started spamming his ears with amazing music that talked about the problems of this country and he got so scared that his safety equipment broke and he fell! HE LANDED ON ME. So there I was bbq sauce on my tindies looking at this horrid app with a corpse on my broken body and a single tear rolling down my face. For your own sake do. not. get. this. app.","date":"2020-07-09T12:04:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"pleasejustkillmenow"}}]}
