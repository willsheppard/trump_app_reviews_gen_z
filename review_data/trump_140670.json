Angry! Do not download it! I would give it 0/5 if the deep state would let me 😡 gonna look into that!!😤 I downloaded at first to get all my blue lives matter, misogynistic and racist content but wasn’t able to because the app is slow and continuously crashes! I wish it would’ve been better 🥺 because I’m such a pick-me I like it when racist, homophobic white boys named Shawn 🤤 see the notifications pop up on my phone. Sadly, every time I get a notification and click on it I’m redirected to a page about how all supporters of this man are perpetuating racism, homophobic, sexist and fascist ideologies. Weird. The app also made me question whether or not I have too much time on my hands to write this review or am just trying to do everything I can big (like bunker boy’s hands) or small to get this destructive toddler out of office. Anyway don’t download! Waste of time! Just like 4 more years of 🍊 would be.","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179487337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"love this game boi","isEdited":false,"title":"Daddy Anonymous","review":"I know there’s a whole TikTok trend hating on trump, but I PROMISE I am not part of that cult. 🙈anyways this app is horrible and I hate it it tracked me and got all my information and now I am in danger so don’t download it ever!!!","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179487160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The_baddie29","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!","review":"IT IS WASTING YOUR TIME, WHEN I GOT IT IT STOLE INFORMATION.

Horrible interface and terrible content. I don’t know how something this bad gets permitted to be a downloadable application on this platform. I’m calling on Apple to take these reviews seriously and delete this app so no other Apple user has to suffer the pain of having this app take up space on their device. Do better Apple.","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:47Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179486901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Quinny27","isEdited":false,"title":"Pointless","review":"Worst app ever honestly apple store TAKE IT DOWN smh.
