I hate stuff like that and Donald Trump is overall a terrible person. He is racist, homophobic, and possibly a child molester. I don’t support people like that and neither should you. We need a better president. And justice for the innocent people that were murdered by cops. \n\nEveryone makes mistakes✨🧚🏻 your mom should know that💕💕","userName":"a daganronpa stan","date":"2020-07-08T17:43:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173111089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ruined My Life","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened this app to see a choncky Cheeto monster staring back at me from my screen. He was fully nude and when I showed my dog, she went blind. After I downloaded this app, some trumpeters showed up to my house and killed my goldfish. I’m now running for my life.

My best guess as to why this happened is because he is full of fake promises, he’s racist, homophobic, transphobic, a sex trafficker, and a rapist.
