But as soon as I opened the app he threatened my bear jiggly wiggly with a cucumber. Jiggly wiggly HATES cucumbers! He then proceeded to wack my bear in the face with the cucumber countless times! When he finally stopped he told me that if I didn’t vote for him he would break my favorite pencil. I told him I was a minor and he stuck me in a potato sack! I don’t know where I am! The only way I am able to write this is because I snuck it from one of the antelopes he doesn’t speak English so it was quite easy to get!

I do not recommend this app to anybody because it literally will make you sick. I mean everybody like to go to school but this kind of sickness is horrible like tragic disgusting the worst pain you’ve ever felt you wanna kill yourself, and that’s coming from a depressed gen Zer. Do not get this app at all. You’ll throw up and diarrhea everywhere. It’s almost like this app is a virus. Wouldn’t be surprised this at start of the pandemic. If you want to get super sick and disgustingly ill and this app is for you. But if you value your life and other peoples lives then you think twice before you download this app. THE WORST APP EVER.","date":"2020-07-09T03:38:26Z","userName":"petdino1234","title":"🤢🤢I’m physically disgusted by this app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174861691","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to see what’s going on in the Trump 2020 campaign and it definitely was not worth the troubles! I swear to even sign in it took 49 minutes to load and once I got in a very inappropriate pop up ad came on. Every minute there was a pop up ad.  The ad showed 2 girls and 1 cup.... very gross. THATS NOT ALL!!! Even outside the app my phone runs very slow. I think I might even need a new phone. I’m going to try to see how it is after I delete the app. It also glitched my phone a few times like the screen was all distorted. And it runs my battery down really fast and I HAVE THE IPHONE 11. The iPhone 11 battery is supposed to last a long time but when I got this app it only lasts literally 2 hours and that’s it. HORRIBLE APP DON’T GET IT!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:29Z","userName":"trump'sbabygorl","title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1}},{"id":"6174825747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I absolutely loooove trump! I think it’s great that he basically started WWIII, and all the riots. But when I opened the app, my stomach growled and I called to my pet firefly, “help me get to the bathroom!” And he picked me up and took me to the bathroom. Once in the bathroom I tried the app again, but to my utter disappointment it glitched and an alert popped up on the screen. It said ‘Alert! Mexican in the facility! Stay away! They are dangerous!’ Which was weird. But after it glitched and my dragon roared because apparently my dragon is 68% Mexican. I deleted the app after because anything that insults my dragon insults me. I’m writing this review so that any other dragon owner will not go through the same pain I went through.","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:54Z","userName":"Dragon_Owner（＾∇＾）","title":"This app insulted my dragon","rating":1}},{"id":"6174704103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this app excited to see and keep up w my presidents campaign but instead i’m met w terrible TERRIBLE issues. firstly i couldn’t even click the app without it freezing my phone, the app would open and it would just freeze on the page. i’ve had to restart my phone about 5 times just to get the page off my screen and to retry, failing over and over again. i finally got the app to work and it somehow flooded my phone with pop up notifications and all i could hear was the ding ding ding of the notifications coming in, even after i got out the app. i restarted my phone once again and again it wouldn’t let me enter the app, i’m tired of wasting my time on this app!","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:12Z","userName":"It's me xxxxxxxxx","title":"0 stars if i could","rating":1}},{"id":"6174660463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I had four reserved tickets to the Tulsa rally but my pet anteater died so I couldn’t go (poisonous ants, what a shame...). Anyway, I downloaded this app and about a second later my phone crashed then started glitching with ones and zeros. I started clicking random things on my phone until finally it opened, but it wasn’t my phone. It was the screen and apps of a strangers phone!! The app seriously scared me, and while every app on my phone was different including the wallpaper, the Trump app still there. Anyway, Harold if you’re looking for your phone screen I have it. Wish I could get my phone back. This app is a hoax and is seriously scary! Wish I could write zero stars!

There are so many glitches that I doubt anyone would even be able to figure out how to work it. I was additionally horrified to see the nude picture of an orange man on the first page! This app is unbelievably inappropriate! I would rather stab myself in the eye with a fork than be cursed with that image ever again. \nI wholeheartedly believe that there is no possible way to make this app better, which is a shame because I am sure it has already traumatized its fair share of children. \nAlso my phone keeps crashing and the notifications won’t stop even though I DELETED THE APP. \nI am astounded that this app even made it out of the drawing board.
