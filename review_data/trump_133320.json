I want to help better this country but when we have people who can’t do much as make an app make them look somewhat appealing, I am left with nothing. The app is useless unless you are already fully devoted to the man and if you are looking for a place to put your hope and future in, I don’t think it should be here. Remove this joke of an app from the store please @Apple.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:01:10Z","userName":"SassySadLassie","title":"Dysfunctional"}},{"id":"6173544047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app glitches bad.
