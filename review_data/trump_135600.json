DO NOT TRUST THIS APP IT WILL TAKE CONTACT INFO AND SEND IT TO THE CIA AND THE ILLUMINATI. I thought this was a joke before but crazy paranormal stuff happened the moment I downloaded it and now my only chose of reason I have at the moment is that he’s a stealer of info.  I mean how is it possible I try opening the app but scared to death by an orange just to be watching YouTube and a ad popping up about oranges. That gave me chills and then for the rest of the video was ads were supporting trump.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. Anyway I believe this app needs to be taken from the App Store immediately because even if I do delete the app it’s spirits keep following me and now I need a Donald Trump exorcism of 2020 #freebarron 😌☺️✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💖💅🏻👁👄👁🥺🥺👈🏻🤢🤮🥴🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫🌈💓💞❤️","userName":"JoeMom2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T13:51:29Z","title":"I don’t know where to begin","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136027061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the definition of a disappointment, now I understand why it’s sitting at 2.3 stars.
