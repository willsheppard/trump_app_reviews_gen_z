For my first complaint. They impersonated the president and replaced him with an orange Cheeto and corn hair The disrespect. Not to mention he has already died and they are still hiding the fact that he died from hydroxychloroquine overdose. For them to use his name for money is absolutely unnerving, I’m sure Donald Trump is rolling in his grave.","date":"2020-07-10T01:38:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"gebduch","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6178913055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first off i’d like to say that this is a complete scam!! you CANT actually read the news for free, but had a 20 dollar monthly subscription to continue.

It also took a depressingly amount of time to download and I was quite frustrated when I opened the app and all I was met was ads demanding my information. No hospitality at all.
