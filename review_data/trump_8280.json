I ended up having to take it to the Apple store where they said over FIFTY other people brought their phones in with the same problem just to that ONE STORE. ALL OF OUR PHONES WERE FRIED !! not to mention I started getting random charges on my card that were donations to trumps campaign. Beyond MAD  if you can’t run an app how do you expect to run a country ?!?! If you value your phone DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP.","userName":"FUCKTUMPPPPPP","rating":1}},{"id":"6173205896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:06:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"why","review":"I downloaded the app to maybe find a reason to vote for our racist president again, and was just let down by Bunker Boy once again. I can't believe we are letting him run a country when he can't even get someone to make a good up. It was constantly glitching while I tried to use it. At one point, I was so confused and frustrated with the app I needed to put it down and make food before I could try again. I can't believe some people can use this app or even support the Orange.","userName":"steeveyeye","rating":1}},{"id":"6173154315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:49:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Cancer","review":"I downloaded this app to help support the only president of the United States, but after 3 months waiting for it to download I was able to open the app. Needless to say, the app gave me cancer. As I was looking at all of the features I suddenly felt pain throughout my whole body. When my 3 year old drove me to the hospital I found out I have cancer. I deleted the app, and suddenly the cancerous cells started to die off. I don’t know if the app is some sort of Pandora’s box but it is not a safe app at all. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","userName":"Super Soaker Daddy 42069","rating":1}},{"id":"6173124787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:40:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"God no","review":"Once I downloaded this app it immediately asked for access to my camera and mic, I couldn’t deny it unless I didn’t want to use this app. So I accepted, as the day had gone on I had a bunch of weird pictures and videos in my camera roll that I didn’t take. I only had this app for about 8 hours before realizing this and quickly deleted it. Trump must be desperate if he has to use an app to hack into our phones, like he’s assuming China will do with one of the biggest apps we have now.🤷🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"Meowsalot17","rating":1}},{"id":"6173023699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Takes forever to download, then doesnt even work","review":"As lots of other reviews said, it took weeks to download, and i could barely do anything else without my whole phone crashing. once it finally did, it wouldn't even work. it kept glitching out so i couldn't use it. also the amount of storage it takes up is unreal, i had to delete everything except for a few necessary apps to download it in the first place. 0/10, would not recommend.","userName":"cheese273974464683","rating":1}},{"id":"6173020355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:07:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"To Hate On Cheeto Puff","review":"Ok this app took extremely long to download. I have amazing WiFi. This took at least 5 hour to get and I have the newest phone so it’s definitely not my phone. When I went on the app it kept crashing. It had turned my phone off everytime I tried to open the app. I strongly suggest that DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I just downloaded this app cause I saw a TikTok to come and hate on this app so that’s what I’ll do, but please don’t download my phone is glitched out now and I have to buy a new one.

It was the most annoying thing ever and kept sending me random notifications to download random app to “support” our president. Tell me how will downloading candy crush support our president. As soon as it was deleted the viruses began to attack. I had to wipe my phone and by a new one. Basically I just paid $1,000 to get a app that I now no longer want.","userName":"taylor 🧚","rating":1}},{"id":"6172878531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:23:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no thanks","review":"this app is so terrible, it does not functioning correctly and often the app crashes, kicking me out of the app.  it's also truly very frightening. the scariest part is there is this orange caveman looking thing in the background and I don't know how to escape him. this app will also steal your information that you use for your login. such as age, phone number, name, etc.  I knew someone who got their information stolen and people from China started hacking her. please do not download this app it's terrible","userName":"ant.menek","rating":1}},{"id":"6172855926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:16:53Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Help he took my wife 😿😿😿","review":"It all started the app 😿 I wanted to hear about our amazing president but as soon as I got the app my lights when out. 😭😭 I looked around for the switch but when I turned it on, it was the orange man himself waddling over. 🙈🙈🙈 I started to cry because why is his skin so orange???
