He’s using your information and giving it to the nazis so they can feed they’re t-Rex with our TikToks saved on our phones. When doing this, he saw that Gen-Z was becoming too powerful, therefore he is trying to delete TikTok, because he is scared of us. That tiny brain of his is probably just angry that we wuined his wittle wally.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:38:41Z"}},{"id":"6178325231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Froggy ( ^ω^ )","rating":1,"title":"Just horrible","review":"this is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded. i got this app to view news about president trump. the app took a WHOLE day to download and even made my phone lag. when i was finally able to open the app an error occurred and i got viruses on my phone. it was so bad to the point where i had to get my phone professionally fixed and it cost me $50!! do NOT download this","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:36:20Z"}},{"id":"6178291409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Poptropicalover101","rating":1,"title":"Spare yourself. It’s TRAGIC!","review":"This app could not be more horrible. Not only are the visuals migraine-inducing, but this app also TOTALLY drains my battery. I’ve had to download and delete it several times in order to try and get it to work but sometimes it literally collapses and I can’t get back on it for hours. Don’t waste your time with this app. Not even a total update could save it from how bad it is.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:23:57Z"}},{"id":"6178286449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🥝💫🌸🧚🥒","rating":1,"title":"You have to make an account 🙄😒","review":"First I open up the app and see that I have to make my own account, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO! Then I thought about deleting it because I don’t feel like making an account cuz then I have to remember my phone number and think of a password and stuff, like no. That is way too much work and that’s saying a lot considering I have nothing else to do","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:22:09Z"}},{"id":"6178195323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Robynpockets","rating":1,"title":"Constant","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with how we can keep America great. It asks for your phone number to sign in and you must opt in to getting phone calls and text messages. I get sooo many text messages from it. It’s far too many and annoying. Almost makes me want to vote for the other party if this is how it’ll harass it’s supporters. Plus it crashes all the time!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:49:15Z"}},{"id":"6178147339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lauralee555768901","rating":1,"title":"Useless","review":"I downloaded this app and it was the most useless app ever. Nothing worked right, and I couldn’t figure out how to navigate the stupid thing. I kept looking for his plans and what was going on but found nothing! No plans, no logical narratives, nothing! I wish I could say I was surprised but it seems like everything that comes out of this administration is disappointing and useless.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:32:45Z"}},{"id":"6178146587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rheas acts","rating":1,"title":"🍊Terrible🍊","review":"I first downloaded this app to vote for our lovely Cheeto but then when it had FINALLY finished downloading, weird stuff started happening. I opened the app and I saw a very disturbing photo (tw: Cheeto) of TRUMP GETTING A SPRAY TAN! It was horrifying and I wish I could pour bleach into my eyes! I also noticed other things, such as my bed started flying out of the house and now I have to sleep on the floor! This app is terrible! Would not download again.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:32:30Z"}},{"id":"6178112189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Baron Trump's pinkie","rating":1,"title":"I am appalled😭","review":"I gave my phone to my little cousin and somehow she made her way to this horrid app. A few minutes after letting her play on my phone, she started to scream and cry. She proceeded to ✨throw✨ my phone onto the bed and scream “scary man”. When I eventually got her to calm down, i went to see what she was talking about and saw that a slideshow was playing of our ✨orange man’s nudes.✨For this reason i will not be entering this app anymore.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:20:55Z"}},{"id":"6178069208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"middle finger 🖕🏻","rating":1,"title":"If I could do 0 I would....","review":"Very dissatisfied. I cannot believe the utter clutter and chaos this app is. But really what more could I expect from the 45 th president. Although I hoped that something in this app would bring me joy, it did not put out. Basically this app is a burning dumpster full of trash and poopoo. 10/10 would not recommend, and anyone that comes across is should also write a similarly written review.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:06:43Z"}},{"id":"6178060201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gwyncan2","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"This app took FOREVER to download I was so surprised! When it finally downloaded my phone kept glitching and it wasn’t working for 2 days my phone would start playing music at 3 in the morning. And my phone would do this weird thing it would get very hot out of no where when I downloaded this app. Please don’t get it.. it will make your phone work horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:03:47Z"}}]}
