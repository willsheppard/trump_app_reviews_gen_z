It was a waste of my time and space. I opened the app to see a orange talking I was scared😳. I got the app to show respect but I was mortified about what I saw later on I saw a Cheeto talking on stage I’m so upset about this app. I also saw a naked Cheeto man with a butt looking thing at the bottom of his chin 🤮on my screen while me and my family were scrolling through it . I went to sleep that night to see the orange himself looking at me through my window😱I got my bat and defended myself by scaring him off and he got hit by a car 🚗","userName":"leo puertas","rating":1,"title":"Very gross and nudity"}},{"id":"6178197755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:50:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","userName":"corgi🥳💕🐕","rating":2,"title":"horrible ap✨"}},{"id":"6178196099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:49:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.
