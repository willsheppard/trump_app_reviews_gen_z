The moment i opened this app my ceiling fan fell off and started a fire in my house, i am currently outside with the fire department watching my house go up in flames, thanks trump.","date":"2020-07-08T22:49:07Z","title":"cesspool of oppression","rating":1,"userName":"Octavia Collinski"}},{"id":"6173997512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I don‚Äôt see the point of this app even being a thing, plus nobody even likes trump he just destroying are planet one step at a time, he is the worst president ever to exist and this app is even worse I was greeted with weird pictures and there‚Äôs no point of getting this, if I could rate this 0 stars I WOULD","date":"2020-07-08T22:47:20Z","title":"This app is garbage","rating":1,"userName":"all the other name s ar taken"}},{"id":"6173981597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"It‚Äôs honestly a very scary app it‚Äôs been a few months now since I opened the app due to me opening the app and getting scared and then shattering my phone.

If you were considering getting this app, well don‚Äôt. It is a waste of your useful storage. All it does is glitch. If you‚Äôre gonna make an app make sure it works correctly.
