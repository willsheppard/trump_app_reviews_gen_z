This is the app equivalent of “graphic design is my passion.” 🐸 It’s so ugly my goldfish died while I was taking him out for a walk one morning because I accidentally dropped my phone on the sidewalk and caused him a horrible death.

And I have my pet T. rex read everything for me. But there wasn’t a T. rex language option so I have no idea what this app said. In my opinion they are discriminating against t rex’s. Like I’m sorry they look scary but they are actually very soft creatures. Shame on u. And before you say how did you type this if ur blind? It’s called using the mic on ur phone sweetie.","rating":1,"title":"Garbage"}}]}
