Utter waste of space... anyways I love WD40. I could literally down an entire can of WD40. Nothing can possibly compare to the smooth feel of WD40 rushing down your throat. I remember when I had enough money to quench my thirst for that sweet, sweet nectar. When I lost my job, I had to put money towards other things, leaving me to be separate from the gushing flow of WD40 constantly pouring into my mouth. I remember being on my last can, just hoping whatever God is out there could spare me yet another drop. The day I could no longer buy WD40 was the day I lost hope. For the 3 months I spent looking for a job, I also spent in a severe state of depression. This depression even led me to lose motivation to find a job. I wanted nothing but to down literally any WD40 i could find. And let me tell you, finding a new job and getting that first paycheck was a moment of pure joy. My flame  reignited as I went to purchase what would be the sweetest, most savory can of WD40 I had ever laid my lips upon. It was empty nearly minutes after I had opened it up to start. I just couldn’t wait for another. I lost all control and spent every last penny from that week of work on WD40. In fact, in the days ahead, I had spent every moment drinking what I could of the liquid. I had a routine, and even rationed my cans  through the days so I couldn’t run out. I pushed through tax evasion, nearly lost my job due to the consumption of oil on the job, and had to deal with house eviction. But I took my time and came out of the miserable spot I was once in. Now I am here, today, enjoying my life to the fullest. As long as I have a can of WD40 in reach, nothing is wrong. Downing WD40>suicide>downloading this garbage app."}},{"id":"6174020631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:56:01Z","title":"Worst app ever!!!!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😭😛😭😍😡","review":"This app really deserves zero stars but I’ll let it slide and give it one star"}},{"id":"6174018552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:55:12Z","title":"they say never give up on your dreams 💕 ✨ but in this case you should 💞 🧚🏻\u200D♀️ ✨ 💅","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ADDICTEDWERIDO","review":"🤡ɴᴏᴡ ᴘʟᴀʏɪɴɢ: Clown Song (Feat: Trump) ───────────⚪────── ◄◄⠀▐▐ ⠀►►0:𝟷𝟾 / 71:𝟻𝟼 ⠀ ───○ 🔊⠀ ᴴᴰ ⚙️"}},{"id":"6174017228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:54:45Z","title":"Cheeto","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"abjacas","review":"I opened the app and saw this Cheetos and he was telling people to drink bleach and was trying to delete tiktok🍤🤏🏻"}},{"id":"6174015243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:54:00Z","title":"Help us bully trump!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Harrydog07","review":"Rate this one star so we can get it off the App Store!"}},{"id":"6174012058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:52:49Z","title":"Baby garbage man","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sehdowuehfuosdfiwdfiwbd,","review":"Why would anyone want this, it’s cults propaganda for a child who holds power....😳"}},{"id":"6174004402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:49:55Z","title":"TikTok lives matter❤️🖤💙","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"extbhajshsiems","review":"I just came from a TikTok and did a 1 star rating"}},{"id":"6173998967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:47:53Z","title":"Terrible app!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Krish Neel","review":"It’s very offensive and doesn’t support America at all."}}]}
