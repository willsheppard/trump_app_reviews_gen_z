Sadly, seems just like a veiled attempt to collect more data on the citizens of THESE UNITED STATES. If I wanted my data to be collected, I would’ve just gone on Facebook or apparently TikTok... but somehow TikTok will be outlawed soon so maybe I will need to relay on bunker boys app for my data to be taken from me. Alas, 1 star to this app of garbage.","title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6172458320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:24:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Amyboo74","review":"I tried to use this app but it keeps crashing???

It didn’t fit the size of my phone (11) and kept kicking me out every time i tried to go in. I’m astounded by the lack of effort placed into creating this app and expect more in the future. Absolutely horrible!!","title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6172439747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:19:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Pbuth","review":"Ugggh! I downloaded this app to keep up with political views and such. It was fabulous the first day! However, it started logging me out of my phone the next day!! And then, my other apps started to glitch. And it’s all from this one app! I wish I could rate one star. Terrible.","title":"Bugs, Glitches, and Lag!!"}},{"id":"6172431991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:17:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen Smith 😛","review":"The app was super glitchy and kept crashing. It was super unreliable and not user friendly. This should be taken off the app store. It is poorly made and deserves no 5 star reviews. I cannot believe how unsuccessful this app turned out to be. This should be taken off the app store. ❤️","title":"Don’t Get This"}},{"id":"6172409557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:11:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"katey🥳","review":"I downloaded this app to be informed on how amazing trump is but once I opened the app all i saw was a scheduling tool for a tanning bed appointment. Of course I said to myself, how could this be true. I closed the app and proceeded to open, again. To my surprise a Cheeto was dancing on a stripping pole! Is this a joke my beloved president!! I am disgusted!","title":"Sadly going to delete this app"}},{"id":"6172363032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:59:07Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BobRoss9","review":"I wanted this app to make me feel more patriotic and proud to be American. But seeing our president get worse and worse. Showing wh really doesn’t care about Americans. Maybe only if they have the following characteristics (White, straight, male). He starting to cause more harm than good, he’s making me not proud to be American 🥺.","title":"Biden 2020"}},{"id":"6172354525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:56:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"daddy-gang-6969","review":"I downloaded this app to get fitness advice for our toughest strongest president, but now I get dozens of ads per day for burger king whoppers and orange spray tan.  I think the app sold my personal information too, because I get calls every day from Russia asking me to tell them about Hunter Biden :/  0/10 recommend.","title":"It’s a no from me"}},{"id":"6172337150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:52:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Shifting yo bun","review":"after i heard the news about trump being dead, i wanted to get this app to see what it was like and boy, was that a mistake. this app is awful in every way shape and form and is now burned into my memory. this waste of space took valuable time from me that i will never be able to get back.
