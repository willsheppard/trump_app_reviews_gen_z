I can’t quite put my finger on it but every time you open the app some tune in between “blind ignorance for racism systems of operation” and “misogynistic foreplay” screeches from the speakers and LURES white men with histories of sexual assault and irresponsible gun ownership TO MY DOORSTEP. The number of times I’ve had to pull out my white, cisgender, straight male fake ID and matching Halloween Costume (it has an ‘I pretend my privilege doesn’t exist when I willingly and regularly use it to rip opportunities from those with greater expertise and drive just because I can ;)’ bumper sticker to match with the hat) is ridiculous. This app is so ambitiously unorganized and badly coded for that every morning I catch the family ghost, affectionately named Roy, attempting to materialize onto the Earthly plane just to destroy my phone in its entirety. However, because of this, him and I now do Pilates in the morning and I’ve taught him the values of equitable feminism and justice and support for impoverished  communities. Roy, too, is beginning to wonder how a crumbled piece of Nature Valley bar that was dropped between the seats of your Conservative great-aunt’s nasty mini van became POTUS. I don’t have the heart to tell him that even though he died over 200 years ago, the electoral college is still in use. Roy sends his deepest love and support, give the guy a good afterlife and delete this piece of trash app forever.","userName":"_eatmoresoup_","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:28Z","title":"So Bad It Make My Relationship with the Family Ghost Better.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173792421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"disgusting took forever to download n all these trump supporters looking like sum clowns🤡🤡&& this app should be deleted immediately 😐","userName":"whattttt is not taken","date":"2020-07-08T21:30:13Z","title":"worst app in the world","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173788530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"yup^","userName":"lilyroseisnice","date":"2020-07-08T21:28:48Z","title":"Ugly literally the worst thing I’ve seen","isEdited":false}}]}
