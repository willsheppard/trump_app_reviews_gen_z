After it finished downloading it took forever to load😤😤. When it finished loading and I managed to get to the sign up it asked me questions that I wasn’t comfortable answering like my social security number and other questions that I didn’t feel like was necessary. While I was doing the sign up my phone started to vibrate uncontrollably and anytime I would exit the app the vibrating would stop. After waiting three hours to download the app I wasn’t going to wait another three hours💩💩. So after I finished with the sign up and I got to the actually app all I saw were dancing monkeys which was confusing because I thought this app for Trump. I decided to try again with the app later. I was in the line for chick fil a and I thought to try to app again. When I opened the app my car starting playing the Big Green Tractor song so long that my car was shaking. After that I deleted the app. I don’t recommend this app at all.
