Also this app glitches, hacks your phone, and gives it viruses (i’m getting a new one later today) not what i expected from my president, SO UNPROFESSIONAL. as soon as i deleted it my house started shaking and there were plates being thrown around and a tree fell on my car.... i was speechless. as soon as i re downloaded everything stopped and the tree went back up and i didn’t owe anything to the insurance company...this app is CURSED do not buy"}},{"id":"6172449924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:22:30Z","userName":"Skepwle,c","rating":1,"title":"This app stole my innocence","review":"Growing up in a Cristian family had its downsides, but I was always incredibly devoted to our father Cheeto and president, Donald J. Trump. My mom told me that if I studied my bible well, prayed every forty five minutes, and burned down the atheist’s farm next door I could get the app. Finally I got it! But it wasn’t what I thought it would be. The app was very plain, boring, and had some bugs to fix. Then I saw what it was trying to hide. It was trying to steal my innocence. It was as if Donny himself was in the phone trying to rip me off my Cristian identity. Horrible app, DELETE IMMEDIATELY, now I’m going to pray for don to go away."}},{"id":"6172444369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:21:00Z","userName":"overhim","rating":1,"title":"Broken heart🤧🤧","review":"I wanted to see the progress of my president and try to convince people to vote for him but he didn't even build the wall he promised!! The one he built was weak and lame and we had to pay got it! WHAT ABOUT THE MEXIACANS!! They were supposed to pay for it😔😔. And I learned he gave the Mexicans who are in cages video games and food😭😭😭. They broke the law why do they get to live better than our people. Someone of us don't have food to eat or even running water and or electricity. He let them live good😭😭 which makes me feel like he’s secretly for the Mexicans😡😡😡. Disgusting! He just lost my vote!😤😤"}},{"id":"6172426210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:16:05Z","userName":"mvkiya","rating":1,"title":"trash 🗿(my underwear is crunchy btw)","review":"this is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded. It is laggy, crashes every three seconds, and is not kept up to date. I was using the app earlier today and a big orange hairy cheeto kept popping up on my screen. I thought it was just the app that was broken but turns out the app has given my phone a virus... (but not the corona kind) Anyways the hairy cheeto was blocking my whole screen and preventing me from educating myself on our white supremacist president. 🧚💅🏽✨ I have decided i will delete the app because it’s trash, barely works and is probably russian spyware."}},{"id":"6172398815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:08:37Z","userName":"JBelair","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","review":"It wouldn’t open. I tried to download it to make an educated decision about voting since you can never trust the news but it kept freezing on the loading screen and just wouldn’t start. \nAlso it doesn’t help that this app supported a bigoted white supremacist that has hurt our country in more ways than one over the course of the last five years and did not complete any of what he promised in his 2016 election. \nAlso I doubt a man who claims he can change a Supreme Court ruling is competent enough to fix this app so I can learn more of his champagne. It’s a real shame."}},{"id":"6172366707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:00:07Z","userName":"B.L.M..","rating":1,"title":"Broken (like our country)","review":"The app lacks user friendly qualities. Its a glitchy app with little to no information. It either kicks you off the app or sends you to an error screen. If you get lucky enough to get past that WALL (haha pun intended) then you're on another screen where if you tap log out it send you straight to “Merch and Store!” and when you tap “no notifications” it selects “send notifications”. Its almost rigged! And i know lots about apps. I think, i might know more about apps than anyone in the app market. \nVery unimpressed! Not much of a surprise though."}},{"id":"6172298741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:41:20Z","userName":"lil orange bunker boy","rating":1,"title":"orange bunker boy","review":"wow. words can’t explain how awful this app was. it took me about 69 hours to download! And that’s  not even all. Not only did it take a decade to download, when i downloaded it- it said i couldn’t even join the app all because orange man didn’t want me to! who does this orange man think he is making my phone glitch all the time now. every time i would open the app his face was plastered over the app like a cult! This app nearly gave me a heart attack. i highly suggest that he (orange man) be put in a nursing home! i’m astonished at how poorly the work ethic that was put into the app is."}},{"id":"6172280763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:36:12Z","userName":"dinhlizzie","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"i downloaded this app to support my pedo- i mean ✨🧚\u200D♀️fabulous🧚\u200D♀️✨president or for some mistake as a carrot, a cheeto puff, and the most often an orange. Anyways once you open this app it changes EVERYTHING all my apps are orange. My screen and lock screen are now pictures of an orange with blond hair flying off of it? I’m VErRy confused. I WAS MORTIFIED to see as when you open the app itself again after the whole 🍊 episode i was greeted by a picture very small pea taped on to my fabulous privates. oh- now that i come to think of it. is it even in yet?👁👄👁 anyhow did NOT get this app!🎃🥕🍊🩳👘🥻🦊🐱🦁🔥💥🍊🍊🏵🎇🌅🌇🌆🌄📙🧡🉑☢️☣️📴📳🈶🈚️🈸🈺🈷️✴️🆚🚼🟠🔸🔶🟧"}},{"id":"6165919490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-06T23:47:00Z","userName":"shsvsdhs","rating":1,"title":"🧚\u200D♂️ fbi is coming to my house for a play date later 🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I got this app to support the ✨ lovely orange peel that we consider as oUr PrEsIdEnT✨but then the app asked for my social security number so I pressed cancel but then it started threatening me that the fbi was going to come to my house if I didn’t put in my social security so I tried deleting the app but it was spazzing out so I just found out that my dogs aunts cousins sisters cats dead great grandmas brothers step moms house just got invaded by the fbi and she told me the same thing happened to her.

I never knew that there could be so many shades of orange.🧡And so bright too. Is that pumpkin orange?🎃 Orange citrus?🍊Perhaps tiger orange?🐯 No. Wait. I’ve got it. That is president orange. 🤮That is racist orange.🤢That is homophobic, transphobic, sexist orange. I have to say, this shade of orange is one that I do not like. It is one that I find disgusting, really. It’s blinding, petrifying. It makes me want to gouge out my eyes and rip off someone’s beloved kneecaps. One day I hope this shade of orange 🚼💩will disappear and never return. I hope it will fall of the face of the earth. I hope it will be shoved into an abyss and left to rot.🧚✨\n#blacklivesmatter\n#orangelivesdonot"}}]}
