I didn’t know how to react to I chucked my phone across the room and hit my dog😱. He slowly started turning orange🟠and on his head was a blonde wig🤭. I thought our lord and savior Daddy Trump🥵 was my dog. “Trump dog...is that you?”🤔 I asked while I ate a small Cheeto😈. He seemed to be very offended by my Cheeto consumption😡 and proceeded to eat my fingers off😵. But that’s not the worst part!! I broke my phone when I chucked it 😔 anyways don’t download for the sake of your eyes and your dog. 😌🟠✌🏼✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6172072470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"One of the worst apps.","date":"2020-07-08T12:37:41Z","userName":"Bmmbfuj","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I thought this app would be helpful... It isn’t.  It’s complete trash.  Coming from a POTUS I’d expect more.  Seems like he’s running this app like he’s running our country, to the ground. 0/10 I do not recommend.  This app took up too much space on my phone juts to deliver horrible service.  I am completely appalled by what his team has done here.  All of that money and they still couldn’t manage to put together a good app.  A 4 year old can do better than this.  Take this app down now!"}},{"id":"6164940680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🖤","date":"2020-07-06T17:23:45Z","userName":"What do they drop","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because i wanted to have more news of our best and most beautiful orange president ❤️ this was the most terrible experience ever 😢 not only did the app glitch several times, but it called me on my mobile phone only to insult me 🤧😪 i have never in my life been so disrespected and after it insulted me, it proceeded to tell me that trump is a pedo, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, and overall terrible person 😰😳🤧🤧 so this is why this app gets one star... not that disagree with that was said 💕"}},{"id":"6146271010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Had a lot of hope for this app but was let down","date":"2020-07-02T00:49:12Z","userName":"Billy bob joe bob billy2435761","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app seemed like an amazing alternative to getting text messages from the Trump administration but boy was I wrong!! As soon as I downloaded the app and clicked on it, it crashed. It took me 20 minutes (and the help of my granddaughter) to finally get it started. But that wasn’t even the worst part! The fact that most trump supporters are older folks like myself who are not too savvy on technology, it should’ve been easier to use. Not cool Trump! ☹️"}},{"id":"6146250434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":":0 you would not believe this","date":"2020-07-02T00:40:17Z","userName":"J40513","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It’s really buggy! When I first got it I went in the app and it crashed, I tried again and it crashed once again. Then I got in finally and the message said to go back to where I came from 😔 if someone knows how to fix this? Or is anyone else having the same problem? I asked my friend, she’s 12% black and 2% milk, and she said hers was working just fine so there must not be a problem at all but it still won’t work for me ):"}},{"id":"6141350318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Im upset","date":"2020-06-30T20:34:38Z","userName":"Ms_StarDonut","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Being apart of the GenZ community has opened my eyes. Even though they’ve be open forever. I am happy to announce on behalf of GenZ that we will be the generation to get a president out of office through social media. Filling post of his with 🧚🏾💕fairy comments💕🧚🏾 and making him mad to the point where he’ll want to resign. Most of us can’t even vote but were as much of a part of this country as everyone. Now about the app. They put a literal CHEETO PUFF on the front page i mean can you believe the audacity.🙄 Have a nice day toodles!!"}},{"id":"6140491880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍊💩","date":"2020-06-30T15:48:35Z","userName":"Trump is 🍊💩","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Well I got this app cause my friends said it was 💩I did not believe them so I got the app myself well they were not wrong the first thing I saw was out beloved president covered in 🍊💩wait scratch that he was 🍊💩I was so surprised that I ran and got into my car then I started it then I drove off but then I accidentally ran into 🍊💩and I was so scared that I hit our beloved president I started to call 911 but then I realized it was just ordinary 🍊💩so this is way you should not get the app and if you do you have small dick game"}},{"id":"6138327736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"REVOLTING!!!","date":"2020-06-30T03:53:14Z","userName":"smallbepsie","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because, as many fellow fascist americans, i love trump! but as soon as i opened it, bugs began to crawl from the charger port of my phone! i tried to squish them as fast as i could, faster than police squishing black lives, but they kept pouring out! i was disgusted and exited the app immediately. as soon as i did, the bugs crawled back into the phone, but not before one whispered to me “this is all trumps fault”  as he crawled back into my phone! overall a bad experience. would not recommend."}},{"id":"6137637791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m disappointed😓","date":"2020-06-29T23:26:58Z","userName":"😳🤡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app because I thought I was gonna see news about Barron trump❤️turns out it was Donald trump.....once I opened the app it asked for my number(I thought it was so Barron can get my number) so I put it in.
