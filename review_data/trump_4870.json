The first thing I saw when I opened it was a naked Cheeto orange. 🍑I went blind for a couple 🔑of minutes when I saw this horrific image. Anyways I brushed the previous 🍊moment off and decided to go down for a cup of coffee. When I went down everything was orange. Then the naked 💆\u200D♂️Cheeto man appeared. It was SCARY. He then started chanting in some strange language and then PARTS 🌝of his body began to explode (you know what I mean by parts). I am now 🦩scared for life. Do not download app. Not recommended 🧤for anyone especially 📒young children. There are no games on the app too so not worth it.

Eventually it stopped and then it started showing me graphic images of people vomiting and having really bad diarrhea while it was blasting 400 songs all at once. I went to close the app and it completely shut down my phone. Immediately after I had to get a new phone and a new identity because apparently the app had my personal information and was planning to use it in a war. 😭😭 I do not recommend this app at allll😞😞","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nicole Ellie Kelli"}},{"id":"6173869014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful✋🏼😾","review":"I downloaded this app so I could see what my favorite bunker boy😼❤️ was up too but right when I opened the app😱 a message popped up saying that the FBI has my location and were coming for me.😿... all because I downloaded the app🙀!!!

Thankfully Joe Biden and his ninjas help me take down those evil doers. All of the sudden the 🍑 himself came in an ordered joe Biden to vote for him. Biden would not comply and Trump brutally murdered him. However, Biden came back as a ghost and haunted Donald Trump until he couldn’t tolerate it anymore. He went insane and started brutally murdering everyone that wasn’t loyal to him. Under the mist of all of this trumps family and millions of other anti-Trump supporters escaped the villainous peach and went into exile on the far away land of Pluto. I don’t recommend it.","date":"2020-07-08T20:46:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jackbacky009"}}]}
