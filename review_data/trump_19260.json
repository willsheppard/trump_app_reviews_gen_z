An annoying orange kept popping up on my screen and would not get off. I had so many nightmares from it. I don’t think I will be able to ever recover😪. I can’t even look at hot Cheetos the same.

They started speaking to me in Russian screaming how much they love America and proceeded to squirt orange juice in their eyes. My family didn’t make it, so I avenged them by slowly killing the oranges with a hammer. I got orange juice, but this app is literally the worst. Would not recommend! 🙈🙉","title":"🥰killed my family, would not recommend😇😘💋","date":"2020-07-10T00:15:33Z","userName":"🍊orangejuicer🍊","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178613938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Let’s start here, first of all it took 10 hours to download and also made my phone glitch out and made it SO SLOW!

Why download the app if I am just going to get texts??? The layout was okay, but my app would often glitch and close when i was in it.
