This app took forever to download. THREE DAYS TO BE SPECIFIC. I am extremely disappointed and I want to speak to the manager immediately this is absolutely ridiculous. To start I wash washing my gold fish and and taking out the dishes all of a sudden I realized that it was  Christmas in may of 2009. Not only that tows and fingers fell off. Not to mention my leftover pizza came back to life and tried to eat me. YOU KIDDING THE SLICE OF PIZZA TRIED TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF ME.  I vacuumed my bed and washed the carpet. Ran with the trash.  Heated up the microwave cause it was cold. Eventually I had to give the shower a bath and the bath a shower. That‚Äôs was exhausting. All of these things happen in one hour I come back and check the app hasn‚Äôt even made progres so who‚Äôs fault is it? I seriously want to speak to a manger or your super advisor because this is absolutely not what I wanted. This is a \n disgrace to this country with everything we stand for.

Once it finished they left in a rush, probably to go torture another family, and we were heartbroken because when the SWAT team entered our home, they brought in rats and cockroaches with them! Then once I finally opened the app it started to make this weird sound and we later found out it was a whistle sound that was slowly but surely killing our dog. THEN if it hadn‚Äôt done enough to us, when I tried to delete this app that was trying to inform me about our üü† president, as i presses the delete button a grande was thrown into our house with a note at ed to it that read, ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020‚Äù.

YOU TOOK AWAY THEIR YOUTH TRUMO. you lost my vote. not only that but this app also made my phone really laggy and now it calls people on its own. this is a brand new phone (only 4 months old) so it cannot be my phone. and the only thing ‚Äúnew‚Äù that i have downloaded or done to this phone is download this app ü§¨üò°ü•µüò†üò§üò≠","userName":"Nina Dols","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:58Z","title":"omg trump ily am why did u do this","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172845132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I decided to download the app in order to get a better representation of what the country would look like if it was run by the Annoying Orange. Unfortunately after the almost six week long download and nine day long update I was met with a strange amount of people with the snowflake emoji as there profile picture. I believe that the president could be starting a secret club where all of his members are called the snowflakes. \n\nAll in all it seems like a basic book club. If you are reading this Mr. Trump (which I highly doubt since you are hard at work on the golf course) I recommend reading Trevor Noah‚Äôs biography Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood. It is a classic coming of age story by one of Americas most adorned men. He is able to mix comedy into a story that mamy Americans can easily understand. EVEN YOU!! :) \n\nAnyways, I hope this helped anyone who has still not Made A decision aNd is lookiNg for a new social media platform as well as an opportunitY to join a new club.","userName":"Glor.Ma","date":"2020-07-08T16:13:37Z","title":"Too many snowflakes","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172838046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Trump has used many racist phrases such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs the kung-flu‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs the Chinese virus‚Äù I mean is it that hard to call it the corona virus, but I mean his brain is the size of a pea so it‚Äôs probably not in his vocabulary he has also passed a law that allows adoption agencies to turn away lgbtq+ members simply for being a part of the lgbtq+ community, he is a homophobic racist. He also made up excuses as to why we can not convert to wind energy in order to help the environment he said ‚Äúwindmills are very expensive‚Äù no they‚Äôre not, he also said ‚Äúalmost none are made in the U.S. which is also wrong 42,000 windmills have been made in the U.S., he also says global warming isn‚Äôt real, he also passed a law that makes it to where if someone is stopped at the border they are automatically separated from their family and then the children are locked in cages and pepper sprayed, so he obviously has the brain of a 4 year old and does not deserve to be our leader.

Maybe your just heated because were not old and wrinkled like you but we can still see with our own eyes that Trump is a disgusting person and he represents one part of our country. And its the racist, sexist, white, people who live in trailers. Or maybe you were too busy drooling over your master Trumpy boy an accidentally put the tampon in the wrong hole. :((( We have all of these resources at our hands showing us that a rich orange racist rapist is sitting in our country's oval office. We think it‚Äôs wrong. We think we need better. We‚Äôre going to help make change. Also tiktok getting deleted? Trump=canceled.
