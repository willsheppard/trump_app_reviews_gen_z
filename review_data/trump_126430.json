I would rather repeat high school 37 times than use this app again. The people who genuinely use this app are part of a psychotic cult. They view daddy trump as their almighty lord and savior who can do no wrong. They excuse racism, pedophilia, transphobia, homophobia, and xenophobia just because the Oompa Loompa tells them what they want to hear and is a “business man”. The App Store needs to delete this app before anyone else can get tainted by this disgusting man and his atrocious ideals. Donald trump is a white suprematist. If you vote for him, you’re a white suprematist.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app in existence","date":"2020-07-09T21:36:28Z","userName":"🧚🏼\u200D♂️f^cktr^mp🧚🏼\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6178323957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and went to the shop for men’s to look at all the hot dudes and I carted a lot of them but how was I supposed to know it would all add up to $8,258.50 and that they expected me to actually buy everything disgusting let me let me eye shop in piece.please anyone who will listen to me don’t download this app and also give it a bad review please so much trash on here and also #defund the police#ACAB#blacklivesmatter#mexicanlivesmatter#indigenouslivesmatter#poclivesmatter#abolishice#everyoneagainsttrumplivesmatter have a great day you organize Cheeto🖕🏿🖕🏾🖕🏽🖕🏼🖕🏻🖕","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Cheater","date":"2020-07-09T21:35:51Z","userName":"yyewe"}},{"id":"6178323393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this W O N D E R F U L L app to support our W O N D E R F U L L president! When I opened the app I saw a deceased mole rat that was starting to rot! “Ew!” Is what I initially thought, until I took a second glance and saw it was just our W O N D E R F U L L president! Silly me! It was not in-fact a deceased mole rat that was starting to rot, but was rather our W O N D E R F U L L president that does not know how to do his job! TeeHEE! To support our W O N D E R F U L L president I put a banner of him in my front yard! It was such a W O N D E R F U L L banner! I had kept the banner up for several days until one of my neighbors had saw it and asked my why I had a banner of a deceased mole rat that was starting to rot in my front yard. I told them they should give it a second glance because it was not a banner of a deceased mole rat that was starting to rot and in-fact it was a picture of our W O N D E R F U L L president! They told me to give it a second glance because apparently it was what I had originally thought our president was! I looked it up and down before realizing, they were right! Silly me! I had accidentally bought a banner of a deceased mole rat that was starting to rot and not our W O N D E R F U L president! They had thought I was trying to mock our president, so they burnt down my house because no one that supports trump can handle and other opinions!

Throughout the day he has been sticking random decals on the walls of my house, and doing the box challenge when he thinks I’m not looking.Ofc like any functioning person, I thought nothing of it other than the dog race becoming more advanced. All up until 12:32 am last night where he came in standing like a human and told me “delete the app”. I was so confused, what app? And so I tore through my phone trying to find the app that was making both him (and possibly me) delirious. Thankfully this is the first app I deleted and everything went back the the second before I was going to download it. I got the chance to reconsider, but sadly the rewind in hours didn’t take away the mess that he made. While I’m cleaning this up I would j like to say I can’t believe the App Store would let something this unruly be easily accessible. Plz ban it, I would hate for anyone to go through what I just went through","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t do it girl 🤠👿","date":"2020-07-09T21:34:38Z","userName":"One Truthful B ;)"}},{"id":"6178319678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"IT DOESNT WORK. \nI was here to support an orange🥵.
