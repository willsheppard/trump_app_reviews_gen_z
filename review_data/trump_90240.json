And so, I downloaded the trump 2020 app. i continued walking along my path and then, as soon as the download completed a car came SPEEDING around the corner. is was a mustang. the car STOPPED right in front of me. and out came, DADDY DONALD HIMSELF 🤩. He didn’t even turn off the engine when he got out. what a polluter! his body guards then came out of the back seat. trump then pulled out a microphone out of his back left pocket and he started singing to a karaoke track of the Rachel Berry Classic, Don't Rain On My Parade. as mr. man sang his heart out, the four body guards surrounded me, picked up my chihuahua and then threw it back down onto the pavement in a burst of rage. then seeing my dog in pain gave me a new realization, I KNEW ALL THE WORDS TO DONT RAIN ON MY PARADE! trump them spawned a brand new microphone for me to sing a duet with him. i was trying my best to sing along with him, but, he just kept overpowering my voice with his gross one💅🏻. and then the body guards were still continuously slamming my chihuahua onto the pavement with no mercy. i didn’t enjoy donald’s voice that much and so i took his microphone away from him, i grabbed it, i snatched it, and i started to beat him with it and i feel this sense of awe wash over me. and i think to myself, my chihuahua would have never been beaten horribly if i never downloaded the app and I wouldn’t be having a battle of the bands with trump himself with the song DONT RAIN ON MY PARADE from funny girl if i had never downloaded the app. i then pulled out my phone, deleted the app, and trump and his bodyguards vanished in thin air like thanos snapped his fingies leaving ME and my chihuahua, Gabbie Hanna with a brand new 2020 mustang. Even though i got a brand new 2020 mustang that i named, Big Booty Jooty, trump still let me down. this app is horrible never download! do not reccoment🐷🤱🏼😽🐞💅🏻","userName":"Big Booty Jooty💅🏻🧚🤩✨❤️","title":"Trump Has Disappointed Me Once Again...🧚","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174889288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:33:28Z","review":"It stole my caterpillar and hairbrush I would never ever download again ✨ѕнαωту'ѕ ℓιкє α мєℓσ∂у ιи му нєα∂✨","userName":"Clown Nation","title":"HORRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
