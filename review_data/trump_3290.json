The second I opened this app, it completely malfunctioned and crashed. I said okay, this is probably a one time thing and tried to open it again. The same thing happened so I said fine I’ll wait an hour. During this time, I noticed that ALL of my photos were deleted! I didn’t even know it was possible for an app to delete all my photos!! I lost a BUNCH of contacts too. Thankfully I store my photos separately but unfortunately many of my contacts are non recoverable. Please do not get this app because you will lose so much data! I’m truly scared that this app has affected other aspects of my phone and that I will find out later. SO PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"smurfs are the only blue lives"}},{"id":"6173686794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app has caused me so much pain.","review":"It took 2 weeks to fully download, during which time I was unable to do anything except wait. I almost died from dehydration. Once I had returned from my hospital stay regarding that matter, I was overjoyed to begin using this delightful app for its God-intended, minority-oppressing purposes. As soon as I opened it, I could feel my Hispanic neighbors begin to contemplate moving out. However, when I went downstairs to inform my loved ones of my good Christian accomplishments, I discovered this app had murdered my entire family. If this glitch isn’t fixed in the next update, I’ll consider uninstalling. I expect better from this app, it will may tarnish our president’s shining reputation.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"1938272883california"}},{"id":"6173671062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this is a trash app take it down. and don’t come to the trê🌲 😽","review":"this is the worst app i have EVER seen in my life i would rather be in my coffin dead right now then have this app installed in my phone. it is horrible and has no good intentions and i think everyone can agree on it! pls get this off the app store FAST i don’t want anyone wasting time on this app ugh.. 😾 pls take this away from my sight don’t make me sue 🤬🤬 i’m not joking ur app is straight booty and should be gone from the universe and out of everyone’s sight because it’s trash no good anything in it or about it and i mean that from the bottom of my heart ❤️ SO TAKE IT DOWN RN because it will cause pain to someone or something 😿 it’s a bad app. did i get my point across.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:45:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumps drug dealer"}},{"id":"6173643906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely terrible","review":"this app killed my pet. i have (or at least USED TO HAVE) a pet cockroach. his name was donald after our king and wonderful president mr orange trump. i decided to download the app to support while atvthe same time playing with donald. right as it downloaded my beloved cockroach donald DIED in my arms. this is absolutely disgraceful and he deserved so much better. this is absolutely the apps fault and to avenge donald, i will definitely be contacting my lawyers to sue. he was the love of my life, and this app killed him. if you think this is coincidence just think about the fact that maybe the government is mind controlling you to think that. once again, except to hear from my lawyers. i vow to get a pretty penny out of tou for what you did.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:36:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"FireFox1121"}},{"id":"6173607466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not responsive","review":"I recently have been seeing people RAGE about this app, they said it was the best app ever created and that it was supporting the black lives matter movement. And of course as a TRUMP supporter I couldn’t believe that they actually would allow this. Tsk tsk tsk I tried to download the app but it took exactly 4 months to download... and as soon as I go to launch the app to catch up on some exciting news about how the minorities will no longer be having rights, the app crashed. I have tried launching the app approximately 666,666 times. Absolutely no response from the app. This app has been poorly made and should seek immediate deportation, go back to your country stupid “illegal” app. 👋🏽✌🏽🏳️\u200D🌈👁👄👁\n\nSincerely, A brainwashed citizen. 📉","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:23:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tylertheailff"}},{"id":"6173496103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app turned me into an orange 🍊😵","review":"I downloaded this app in order to join the fight to re-elect my king, Donald John Trump, as president of the United States And keep America great because he definitely made it great again. When I opened the app, it directed me to turn on notifications. Upon doing so, I was immediately bombarded with notifications to go to the orange juice factory by my house. Confused but faithful in my leader, I complied. Upon arriving, I met a hundred scary people in masks that looked like president trump’s face, and they threw me into an orange juice machine!!! 🍊🥤⚙️ I am now an orange and can no longer enjoy the benefits of being a human person. At least I could delete this app, and I hope you all take caution before downloading such an evil application. 😬😬😬🥵","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Fil Swift"}},{"id":"6173302867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download this app!!","review":"I got this app because I wanted to see what all the hype was about because the boomers said it was a good app. The boomers were wrong again. Let’s start with the first problem, the app took 7hours to download. My WiFi where I live is and was perfectly fine. Next problem the app when I tried to you open it, it would start to glitch something orange and then proceed to log me out of the app. It did that every time I tried to open it. Also when I open the app it played a horrible song it scared my dogs they started to bark and jumped everywhere. There’s about 35 more things that happened to me while using this app but it would take me 3 hours to write it all.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:38:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"000555339921859365710;$-\",$;"}},{"id":"6173201525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Listen up🤪😺READ THIS REVIEW","review":"SOOOOO I am 45 and I downloaded this app because I love Donald Trump🏳️\u200D🌈👍😌🥰but it took 4 days to download.

Imagine supporting someone who is a rapist, racist, homophobe, and who only cares about the white males in America. This hot Cheeto should have never been president. Even a psychologist wrote about how he has a mental disorder. She literally specializes in this. Chile anyway, this is the worst app that has ever been developed and no one should ever download it unless it’s so you can delete it again so you can right a review on it. There is no reason we should have a Cheeto for president. Wit his lil ugly ahh 🤢🤢🤢 I downloaded this app to see if there was any reason to vote for him and there wasn’t any!! This app also made my phone glitch when I tried opening it.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:50:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trump is a cheeto"}}]}
