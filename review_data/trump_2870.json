He went to go take a shower and I heard his phone ding so I told him he had a text message; he asked if I could respond back saying he was busy and would talk to the person later. I unlocked his phone (we shared our passwords with each other, so I never thought he would betray me like this), and that’s when I saw the truth. He had this Donald Trump app downloaded on his phone!!!!!!! I proceeded to confront him and we had the biggest argument of our entire relationship. I found out he was an avid Trump supporter, and my heart literally shattered. I would’ve rather him cheated than this.\nThis app forced me to break up with the love of my life...AND I’D DO IT AGAIN!

And i’m not here for this Apple please get this off the App Store, and as a paying customer for new devices every year I would like this app off the App Store immediately this orange face man scared the crap out of me when I open up the app and it took two weeks to download and I have Xfinity fast speed. Plus this orange face man that we have as a president and that we’re all ashamed of having him as our president we all know he’s clearly cheated in the election.

First, it took days to download I couldn’t wait to write this review and say how bad this app is! Second, I tried to get tickets to his rally so I couldn’t go but it’s said it was unavailable to give me a ticket!! Third, it keeps glitching and returning me to my home screen, unacceptable. Fourth, I do not support Trump but I really wanted to see why he is a good president for our country, I couldn’t seem to find any good reasons. Fifth, the app kept bugging me every two seconds I was on the app, it kept saying, “vote for Trump” and every time I said “never ask me again” it kept popping up. I am extremely disappointed in this app and I hope it gets kicked off the App Store smh.\n\nOh yeah, Tiktok. That’s all I’m gonna say"}},{"id":"6173035215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The horrible things this orange has done to me.","rating":1,"userName":"SAVE BARRON 279498187849929274","date":"2020-07-08T17:12:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This man. Our so called “president?” Has done horrible things to my family and my dog. So i will now get into it. I saw him in person in Washington DC and he was a very horrible person. First of all, i brought my dog with me.. and he ate my dog. He also picked up my little brother and threw him into a wall. He also stubbed my big toe and called my mother an orangutang. My mother is not in fact an orangutang. He sicked the military dogs on me after i called him a cheeto with string cheese on him head. Also he never even said sorry for eating my dog.
