I called my grandma dude on my boyfriends phone and told her that my phone was being stupid.Then it turned it out that my grandma was at the gym getting that grind and I was like oh yes grandma get in to it!!!! And then she told me that she had to go beat up someone cause they didn’t want her tamales and I was like ah ok yeah I understand.But never the less I got rid of the app and my phone went back to normal.So I advise to anybody else to 1.Take ur grandma to the gym so she can get ripped and be able to fight off the bully’s and 2. Don’t get this app or else ur phone will trip no matter what model it is","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174265124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:25:43Z","rating":1,"title":"Offensive🚫❗️","userName":"amskfkfkdjsks","review":"This app promotes
