I could clearly see his disguise poor thing he needs to go home in the jungle but we’re polluting the earth. Anyway his neck flab’s were showing and it just offended me.

When I finally got the app to download it \nasked for all types of information which I am not comfortable giving out I came on this app to educate myself.
