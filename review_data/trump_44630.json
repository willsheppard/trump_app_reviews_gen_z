If the entire population is not tested, numbers and curves are simply speculative. If we are only testing the sickest citizens, the death rate becomes disproportionally inflated because we don’t record mild cases that will recover - this also gives a recovery rate that is disproportionately low. Because we are only testing citizens with a high likelihood of having the virus, the “curve” will be unintentionally manipulated into an artificial rise. It is not a true statistic when all citizens are not counted. You don’t have to test to determine recovery, you test to ensure the the virus is no longer being shed. Recovery in most cases would be an absence of symptoms for a specific period of time. Again, you have to test the entire population to have truly accurate data. It would be far more effective for both the economy and citizens to quarantine those who are at great risk - elderly, immunocompromised, and citizens with diseases that have shown to be strong comorbidities like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and asthma. Those who are at less risk should have the option to work to provide for their families and keep the supply chain strong. The only real solution is eventual herd immunity as the vaccine is likely 12-18 months away from production; the economy will not survive an 18 month halt on production. Caution and hygiene are extremely important; education and increased sanitation measures will aid in reducing not only COVID-19, but a myriad of other illnesses. It’s important to look at the whole picture and realize that the situation is multifaceted. Every decision has a consequence that we must recover from somehow. Serologic testing should have a positive effect as harvested antibodies are currently being used for treatment under compassionate guidelines. We can definitely isolate the most at-risk citizens to protect them from society, but we can’t shutter everyone or we will never survive the economic downfall. Opening in Phases will be the only real way to gain herd immunity while still staying under the threshold of hospital capacity. The only way for Americans to maintain their economy, Constitution, and way of life is to vote for President Trump in November.","title":"TRUMP 2020!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179208452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nstrange20","rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T03:12:05Z","review":"It’s a great app I really want that hat that’s signed by him.","title":"App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179202523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Analisa Johnson","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:09:59Z","review":"I downloaded this app and then got a horrible virus on my phone.
