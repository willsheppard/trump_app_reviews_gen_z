A BACK ALLEY - DAY\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of PETER PARKER, a seventeen year \nold boy. High school must not be any fun for Peter, he's one \nhundred percent nerd- skinny, zitty, glasses. His face is just \nfrozen there, a cringing expression on it, which strikes us odd \nuntil we realize the image is freeze framed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER (V.O.)\n\t\tLook, I'm going to warn you right\n\t\tup front. If somebody told you\n\t\tthis was a happy story, if\n\t\tsomebody said I was just your\n\t\taverage, ordinary seventeen year\n\t\told, not a care in the world...\n\nThe image un-freezes. A FIST, at the end of a right hook, comes \ninto frame and punches poor Peter. His head snaps back and bounces \nforward, his eyes roll.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER (V.O.) (cont'd)\n\t\t...somebody lied.\n\nThe image freezes again, Peter's glasses dangling from one ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER (V.O.) (cont'd)\n\t\tThat's me. Peter Parker. A.K.A.\n\t\tSpider-Man, but not yet. Gotta go\n\t\tthrough some ritual humiliation\n\t\tfirst. All right, I didn't want\n\t\tyou to see me like this, but we\n\t\tmight as well get it over with.\n\nThe image unfreezes again, another fist comes into frame, this one \na left cross. It CRUNCHES into Peter's nose and he crumples to the \npavement in this alley in the city.\n\nTHREE HIGH SCHOOL PUNKS commence pounding the crap out of him. \nFLASH THOMPSON is the leader, he's seventeen, good-looking, body \nof a twenty-eight year old.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLASH\n\t\tYou do NOT talk to her! How many\n\t\ttimes I gotta tell you that? Do you\n\t\tlisten when I talk? Hey! I asked\n\t\tyou a question! Do you LISTEN when\n\t\tI'm talking to you?!\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tHuh? Sorry, I wasn't listening.\n\nThis enrages Flash; he punches Peter in the ribs. Peter groans in \npain.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLASH\n\t\tNext time you're gonna pay, puny\n\t\tParker, you are gonna pay.","userName":"🧑🏽\u200D🦯🧑🏽\u200D🦯🤟🏼🧑🏽\u200D🦯","date":"2020-07-09T01:24:11Z"}},{"id":"6174428424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Trash","review":"Unneeded app","userName":"gary from tiktok","date":"2020-07-09T01:18:43Z"}},{"id":"6174396670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"what a yucky man","review":"i always hated cheetos.","userName":"fuehfeheif","date":"2020-07-09T01:09:09Z"}},{"id":"6174389108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Tiktok","review":"Yup shutting down tiktok shutting down yo app no kizzy🤦🏽\u200D♀️💯","userName":"yourloyalhater","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:52Z"}}]}
