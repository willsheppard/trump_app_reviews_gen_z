I have never been more insulted or gaslighted. My family is a beautiful group of aryans who just happen to have a spray-tanning addiction. As well as what they call “Sweet Home Alabama Syndrome.”\nThis app kept telling me to take pictures of myself for my “profile” but it had weird requests like “show only your bare feet” and “make sure your gluteals are in full view”. It also asked me if I was legal. I hope you know, pre-marital hand-holding is against the law and in the eyes of God, you are a sinner. Unfortunately, according to my niece, “if you don’t sin, Jesus died for nothing.” \nWhen I tried sending our glorious president a message of support, the app told me it couldn’t submit, because I didn’t, “use the required amount of ethnic and homophobic slurs.” Which is strange, considering my message had almost 40 of them. And whenever I tried to upload my Blood Drop Cross for a profile picture, it kept editing it into a police badge. I understand the reasoning obviously, but I thought this app was supposed to be a safe space.\nI hope the developers consider fixing the bugs and rereleasing the app. Or it’s a pathetic insult to Amerikkka, the great nation we live in.","userName":"mytaxespayyoursalary","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:13Z","title":"Probably the biggest waste of storage on my phone"}},{"id":"6179375560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app wasn’t it… I would explain to you why this up wasn’t it but it would be faster to tell you what did like to get this over with.

As soon as it finished loading, a warning popped up telling me all the money had been drained from my bank account and it thanked me for donating to the Trump campaign. Now I would gladly donate to the campaign of the greatest president this country has ever seen, but they took everything. I can’t even afford to feed my kids. Needless to say I was a little panicky, so I called my bank and they said I had nothing left and that they couldn’t help me because I had “willingly” turned over all my money. I can’t believe the people on Trump’s campaign team would do this to the very fine people that support him.","userName":"Mo girly","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:07Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD ⭕️❌"}},{"id":"6179375322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":":( this app was so difficult to use and gave my phone a virus","userName":"ava.cado.sparkles","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:07Z","title":"Orange stank"}},{"id":"6179375194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"👁👄👁","userName":"pamscountrycrock","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:04Z","title":"gross"}}]}
