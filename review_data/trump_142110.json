It asked me for my race and when I put down Latino it locked me out. I was furious because it didn’t so if I was born here or not and now it will shut down the app before it even loads. Every once in a while the so will send an alert saying, “ Go back to your home!” I WAS BORN HERE!!! For everyone who downloads this, know that this man hates Latinos no matter how much we love this country.

I opened it and my eyes🇺🇸 we’re blessed at the sight of a cheesy Cheeto. A few weeks went by and everything was just GREAT👍🤩I was ready to hop on over to the tree but then I heard I rumble inside my house while I was browsing🇺🇸 threw Facebook (TikTok) and my fluffy dorken shmirt started to scream 💕four💕in💕her💕four💕in💕her💕I almost dropped my croissant 🥐 . All of a sudden my roof started to fly away and do the ✨renegade✨and on it it said TRUMP 2020. i did NOT write that. So I checked the app where 🇺🇸 I last saw this Oompa🇺🇸 Loompa and it started crashing and writing all over my iPhone 5 ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️TRUMP 2020❤️✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️✨✨. These words matched with the font on my roof. (It kinda looked like a fairy comment) Then I was blasted to Pluto where I rejoiced at the sight of my best friend, her pet dorken shmirt. Cheese huddlson, the girl he cheated on and Addison ranaenae(guess I figured out why she disappeared). They had the same ✨EXACT✨experience🇺🇸 as me so we connected the ⚪️dots⚪️ and realized \n👁👄👁this was all 🧚🏻\u200D♀️HIS🧚🏻\u200D♀️ fault. OUR ✨OOMPA LOOMPA✨ PRESIDENT.
