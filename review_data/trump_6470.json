The doo doo 💩 got into my great grandma’s mouth and it started to accumulated in her mouth then she started choking on the doo doo 💩 and then she died. Absolutely unacceptable. And now we have to go to her funeral while my great grandma smells like diarrhea and hard doo doo 💩.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177052029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"If I could give this 0 stars I would😔","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:44Z","userName":"free. barron. 2020","review":"I opened this app and I got a pop up asking my gender so I was like ok and I put in female. Alll of the sudden my phone shut down and my tv turned on and it was a screen of the app I was so confused so I grabbed my remote to turn it off and it just wouldn’t turn off. Then I picked my phone back up but it was like flaming hot and burned my palm. Then I turned back to the tv which now just had a black screen with the words “all lives matter” on it. I passed out from fear and was brought to a hospital near by.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177048841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App doesn’t work","date":"2020-07-09T14:57:52Z","userName":"LoveCookies77","review":"I got off of work today and tried something new, so I decided to see what the “Orange2020🍊” app had in stored. After the picture of orange popped up, it started to glitch, and the devil himself started to appear on my screen, but orange’s face was the devils face, so I ended up resetting the app because I had high hopes. It kept glitching and so I tried another app and the same thing happened. Somehow his picture just transferred. And then my whole phone shut off. This is my third phone trying to download the app, DONT FALL FOR IT. ITS A SCAM. ✨Orange2020✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177037553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"‼️They Took My Hands‼️","date":"2020-07-09T14:54:48Z","userName":"🌚Carl Wheezer🌝","review":"When I realized how absolutely 🌸🧚\u200D♀️✨racist,✨🍄🍃✨homophobic,✨🦋🌺✨islamaphobic,✨🌻🍁✨and fascist✨🐌💖 President Donald Trump was, I couldn’t help but download the Trump app! A few minutes after I had downloaded the app, a mini Donald Trump snuck up from under the bed and said, “I need bigger hands. Hands! HANDS!” The tiny Trump continued to attempt to get up on my bed, but he was too 🍄🍃✨weak✨🧚\u200D♀️🍁and🦋🌸✨stupid✨🌻💗 to climb that high. He eventually got on my bed where I was sitting. The Trump Troll attacked me while saying how juicy my hands looked 👁👄👁. I now have no hands and, I’m typing this with a Slim Jim.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176834698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Truly the worst app I ever downloaded","date":"2020-07-09T14:01:00Z","userName":"shabatshablam","review":"I’ve never had a worse experience with an app. Once I downloaded and opened it it immediately called me ugly and told me to lose 10 pounds. Completely uncalled for. Then, it reminded me that for-profit prisons are a thing in this country and that mass incarceration is basically just modern day slave labor. It then suggested that I tweet al* l*ves m*tter. It also encouraged white supremacists to feel validated, and flashed me a picture of the confederate flag, the symbol of a FAILED rebellion. Anyway. Pretty disgusted. 0/10 would not recommend. Apple should take this app down.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176899557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I felt caged","date":"2020-07-09T14:18:01Z","userName":"arrowedheart","review":"This app is honestly terrible. The layout, the fonts, and the big Cheeto man all triggered my adhd and left me feeling sick and claustrophobic. Although I have the iPhone 11 I felt as if this app wasnt big enough to hold the ego of the child it was made for. We should set it free (delete it) so others won’t suffer through the same health risks.","rating":5,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176679686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚✨♥️","date":"2020-07-09T13:20:08Z","userName":"Erudite1560","review":"I originally downloaded this app to pass time whilst waiting for the silly Olive Garden server to fetch his manager for me. I should’ve asked for this app’s manager! this app took 69 days to download. Do you know how many managers I see in 69 days?!? Utterly unhelpful in passing time. Regardless, the media of the app was simply sub par. I found it hard to navigate and tiring. Overall, it provided no clear purpose in informing me. It often crashes at soul cycle.... unfortunate!! I would expect much more from our non racist, non homophobic president. Overall, this app gets 1 out of 5 Karens....","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176587875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👎","date":"2020-07-09T12:55:37Z","userName":"cathrine06978","review":"I think apple should give people the ability to give out 0 star reviews because this app is 100% deserving of one. The moment I open the app it asks for my phone number, I thought it was no big deal so I put it in. I was IMMEDIATELY spammed with texts and calls and now my phone is glitching. The screen keeps going black, pictures of mine are randomly deleting, my background has changed, and all other apps on my phone aside from the Donald Trump app have disappeared for some reason 10/10 do not recommend✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176235066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T11:16:09Z","userName":"Iisan620","review":"This app is such an outrage to me that I barely have any words to even comprehend my hatred for this app. Let me start off that my name is Karen and I am vegan, I downloaded this app expecting to find vegan friendly meals but what I found were pictures of a walking orange man. It was traumatizing!!! There wasn’t even a place to read the Bible 😡😡😡. Overall this app is a scam and I’m pretty sure is a virus because I keep on getting these pop ups that are demanding me to sign in to the “iCloud”. I will not take part in this shady black market and demand to see the manager of this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
