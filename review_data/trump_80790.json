When I looked at the window I saw an orange Cheeto looking at me! At that point I started to run to my front door but I couldn‚Äôt find the keys, before I realized, they had turned into a orange Cheeto! I tried to break open the door but It was too late! I heard glass shatter and foot steps coming my way so I realized the best option was to break a window and run as far as I could! I found a vase and threw it to the window! I climbed out and ran too the abandoned house next door. I entered the house and there was no sign of the big Cheeto, but I knew it was best to hide and called the police. I found a a closet in one of the rooms but before I closed the door I saw the whole room turn into a Cheeto except the closet. I shut the doors and started looking for the calling app but something was off about it, the app picture turned into a Cheeto and before I knew it most of my apps turned into a Cheeto except for tiktok and the App Store. When I was about to click on tiktok i felt my leg turned into a Cheeto, so I got an idea ‚Äúwhat if I delete the app‚Äù I thought it was a great idea so I did. When I deleted nothing happened. I tried again and again but it didn‚Äôt work. Now, I only have one arm and my head I‚Äôve been watching tiktok cause I knew that nothing would work. I took these last few mins to tell the person reading this to not download the app unless you want to turn like me.","isEdited":false,"userName":"hjghid"}},{"id":"6173929356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:21:38Z","rating":1,"title":"disgusting","review":"when i opened the app i saw the most disturbing thing ever. not going to go into details because of how horrific it was. i never will recommend this app to someone ever .","isEdited":false,"userName":"cambbg"}}]}
