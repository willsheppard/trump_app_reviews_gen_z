This app has my phone hanging, and I really do not understand why an app made because of a peach president should make my phone hang. First of all do you know how much my phone is !? Excuse me Sir/Madam but if this app isn’t taking down within the next minute or two you would honestly have your ancestors to blame! Now get off my review. The next person probably has a better bad review!","userName":"marcelidaewor","date":"2020-07-08T14:17:57Z","title":"This app is the worst"}},{"id":"6172410159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This man has made out lives worse in 2020 and then he thinks it’s okay to take down one of the biggest apps for gen Z. This app is actually used by all ages and you don’t see a lot of people hating it. He is just mad he is getting beat even by people who can’t vote and he wants to make sure we are as miserable as possible by making sure the app that makes billions happy is gone.","userName":"Annette Elizabeth Oberhauser","date":"2020-07-08T14:11:40Z","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6172246932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I would rate it 0 stars if possible. This app makes my phone glitch out so bad, when I go in to the app it kicks me out right away. Also, when I got in the first and only time, I put my phone number in and keep getting constant calls and texts 24 hours a day. This app is almost as horrible as the president himself, and that’s saying something. Do not download.r","userName":"dissapointed in t","date":"2020-07-08T13:26:53Z","title":"This app is terrible"}},{"id":"6172238569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded This app I was expecting to be enlightened by this cheeto sitting in the White House and all of his loyal supporters but now that I think about it I don’t wanna be in lightened I would rather die then support this man. The fact \n   that t people actually can trust him and think he’s not a racist, rapist and just a horrible man in general is absolutely astounding to me just please do the smart thing and do not revote him","userName":"cool_person91","date":"2020-07-08T13:24:36Z","title":"Pls do the smart thing"}},{"id":"6172031157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I used to support Trump but seeing what he’s done to me and my fellow working class. His own lgbt and minority supporters is absolutely DISGUSTING to me! The plan he has put into place only helps people with money when not a lot of us have it! He’s tried to take away our freedom of speech on the internet. And even going so far as to try and BAN an app for a seemingly HARMLESS prank done by TEENAGERS?!?! He’s acting like a child and I will NOT vote for a child.","userName":"Isaiqh Jqmes","date":"2020-07-08T12:25:48Z","title":"I have lost faith"}},{"id":"6171906659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I just got the app and it suddenly glitched our everything, honestly without me using the app it still was glitchy, I couldn’t tell if it was the app or my phone, so I had no choice but to delete (I was gonna do it anyways) and after, everything was completely fine, this is definitely the work of the 🟠 man and him trying to corrupt my phone with huskies and Cheeto like structure","userName":"lalalairyn","date":"2020-07-08T11:48:53Z","title":"🟠bad"}},{"id":"6171664248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app I’ve ever had! Waste of time and didn’t do anything it was supposed to do! This app made me regret every moment of my life that led up to me downloading it and I will be deleting immediately!!! So disappointed and even have it the benefit of the doubt to prove it was better than what the reviews said but it is just as bad as everyone says!! Hate this app with a burning passion! Don’t waste your time!","userName":"Qdev11","date":"2020-07-08T10:28:58Z","title":"Absolute garbage!!!!"}},{"id":"6170122893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app horrible things started happening to me! I stubbed my toe, fell off of a tree and I lost my favorite shirt :( trump is very bad luck and this just proves that he’s a terrible president! When I opened the app all the plants in my house started wilting and died! Also I bought his merch and it’s very bad quality I hate it.

He was very rude and didn’t introduce himself. I later found out that he was a ghost 🤭😱(rest in pain Donald 😔). He started harassing me by asking me by asking if I had any SUS JUICE?!!! He then proceeded to THROW MY BABY ACROSS THE ROOM???!!!!!!! anyway so yeah this cheeto puff has been following me ever since and I would not recommend this app if you have a baby or brain❤️","userName":"jungkookshoe👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-07T03:45:03Z","title":"very bad. would not recommend."}},{"id":"6161277544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"While I may not be able to vote yet, I can still do whatever I can to share my opinion. And to all the people that are so upset about this, how does it feel to be threatened by a bunch of teenagers? Imagine being that insecure about yourself that you start trashing a bunch of kids. Well guess what? Gen Z have nothing to fear and we're just getting started. RACISM AND SUPPORTING TRUMP IS small dick energy.
