After it downloaded my phone got hacked and I started finding Donald Trumps nudes in my camera roll!!! To top it all off he tracked down my location from the app, then showed up at my door naked and threw a dead rat at me! I ABSOLUTELY do not recommend this app!!!!!!🤬😡👅","date":"2020-07-09T10:54:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176062904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst president —I mean app ever..","userName":"Nkcme5","review":"Once downloaded, the entire phone turned orange, it even got on my hands.  Then hot air kept spewing from the speaker.  Every time I used voice text, the app would change all my texts to lies.  Deleting and hope it never comes back...BLM ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿\nNative Americans need their land back and LHBTQ+ rule ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜","date":"2020-07-09T10:22:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175955157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible 🤢🤮","userName":"Gaggedfagged","review":"I downloaded this app and then I got a message saying where I live... then I got creeped out and couldn’t undownload it then I came to write this review I think someone is tracking me.

After using the app for about five minutes, it completely went blank and stole my Apple Pay information! 😡","date":"2020-07-09T09:36:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175894871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"EXTREMELY BAD","userName":"complicated password change","review":"This app is beyond the worst app I have ever downloaded. I WILL NOT be downloading it again any time soon. I can NOT believe this. This app took too much of my storage up and took extremely to long to download. My battery was at 100% when I started the download and was at 25% by the time it was done. UNACCEPTABLE.","date":"2020-07-09T09:27:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175893798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Oh boy :((","userName":"T 🥳🙂","review":"I went to download this app to support the president but it took up ALL 64 gb of storage and then Dr. Phil came into my house and told me the Peppa pig will come to my room in an hour. So of course I was excited but scared... Confused! Well an hour later the amoeba sisters came in with a plate of bacon... And yes, I did eat it but the app completely wiped out my phone 😡😤","date":"2020-07-09T09:27:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175869632","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No ❤️","userName":"Chelsea1323hg","review":"This app took hours to download and goes soooo slow. Honestly it’s taking the same amount of time that it’s taken to arrest the murderers of Breonna Taylor. Also everything on the app is so constricted, very similar to how George Floyd’s airway was constricted when his neck was kneeled on by a police officer. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone ✨ever✨","date":"2020-07-09T09:19:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175831760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just a little confused","userName":"cassiedazoomer","review":"Idk about you all but this app just doesn’t make any sense. Like I can not understand anything it’s trying to say, and honestly just seems like it is constantly running for no reason. Thank god it finally crashed so I could just delete this nuisance.","date":"2020-07-09T09:06:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175725466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Literally trash","userName":"Shatteredmoon","review":"I got this app to help support our lovely trumpkin and then the app started playing sweet home Alabama on repeat and even when I closed the app it didn’t stop I eventually deleted it cause it was a waste of space and cause that song was causing me to eat every left sock in my room.","date":"2020-07-09T08:30:31Z","isEdited":false}}]}
