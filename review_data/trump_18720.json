I tried registering and it just kept glitching and sending me back to the initial register page. Eventually I got in and the app is BORING and I almost wanted the wacky glitches BACK to have some sort of CONTENT to stare at. The app is so useless you might as well just delete it off the app store🙄"}},{"id":"6174943191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:49:40Z","title":"😏","userName":"hi roblox🤡","review":"this is the most horrible app anyone can get! it legit broke my phone.

The app is so poorly made and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for REAL news. This app made me furious!!! I want it removed from the app store! No update can fix what it’s done to me.

But now! My phone is Dory from Finding Nemo! And let me TELL YOU she isn’t finding ANYONE ANYTIME soon. I can only let my phone swim a little bit now and I can’t even chop down trees with her. She lacks in the usual alien technology that she used to have and her data is messing up the vibes. Hate it! Don’t get this app!"}},{"id":"6174874099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:29:06Z","title":"never get this app. very dangerous.","userName":"captin_caveman","review":"this app RUINED MY LIFE. it kept showing me nightmarish images and phrases, kept me up all night tossing and turning. After having this app for a few days it began glitching SEVERELY. I strongly suggest that this app be deleted completely. It’s full of incredibly dangerous things, and from the way it was glitching, I get nervous about the safety of my information."}},{"id":"6174855656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:23:40Z","title":"Horrible","userName":"emmie nem <433","review":"Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings\nBut I'm only going to get this one chance\nSomething's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)\nJust a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what\nIf that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,\nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\nYou were just what the doctor ordered\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot"}},{"id":"6174853819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:23:08Z","title":"Absolutely Worst App","userName":"Gtole","review":"Horrible app whenever I open it I see this pedo- *president*. My phones been doing that ever since I downloaded it 😤. All I want to do is show supports for Donald Trump 🧚🏻🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧝🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧞🧞\u200D♂️(it’s been auto correcting to that too😤😤) but it keeps closing after 88 seconds of having it open.

The gag worthy sight of the man in a suit claiming to be our president has now caused me emotional distress and loss of sight in one eye. The word Trump 2020 is now a trigger word that makes me break into cold sweats and see stars that can lead to a dizzy spell and have given me heart palpitations. The content on this app is incorrect and completely bias."}}]}
