When it finally got done, i went to open the app and it immediately crashed. this was very frustrating. I closed out of all my apps because this crash froze my phone. I proceeded to go to other apps like messages, social media etc. and my phone was still bugging out. This only started happening after downloading the app? Weird. I wanted to support pedophilic, narcissistic, and racist Donny Trump. He’s gone above and beyond for the United States and definitely did not make America 100000x worse.\n Since the app was failing, I was still determined to support him. I called the customer service # and I was disgusted by how rude they were to me. That 🍊 should get his employees under control because the way I was treated was unacceptable. \n\nDespite all the trouble, I was able to reserve tickets to go to the upcoming rally’s that are near me but I was so excited that he was going to be in the area, that I forgot I have to take my goldfish to the vet those days :( so devastated that I won’t be making it. 🍊 I really hope you understand but I’m all booked up. Nemo has to go get his shots. After that him and I are going to be watching keeping up with the obamas. Can’t wait and I also am making tamales and pozole. Anyways, that’s besides the point, Gen Z and so forth will be taking over from now on. This app has terrible quality don’t waste your time.","title":"do not download!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173113207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:36:59Z","userName":"f****** trump","isEdited":false,"review":"Trump got a a🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍐🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍐🍊🍐🍐🍐🍐🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊","title":"No Trump","rating":1}}]}
