First off I cannot access anything unless I sign up or login. On the home page it says sign up or login but doesn’t give the option to login and just forces users to hand over their phone numbers!! That is a violation of privacy and completely unethical! Why should I have to give up sensitive information to use an application that doesn’t need sensitive information. I’m pretty sure they’re just going to use the numbers for their own greedy purposes! There’s absolutely no reason for me to hand over this information. Secondly, the application is incredibly glitchy!! It looks like a toddler designed and coded it! It makes absolutely no sense. Poor design. 0 STARS","rating":1,"title":"0 Stars!!!"}},{"id":"6174083217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:19:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tazmoneytaz","review":"I downloaded this app to only find a naked Cheeto picture on the front page. My dog got so excited and thought it was real, he kept barking at it to the point where he would scream. I let a day pass by and it turns out that the picture on the front cover somehow got into my photos and deleted my photos and only kept the naked Cheeto picture instead. It also changed my wallpaper to that. Also, whenever I would try to text my friends and family hello, it would automatically send the orange emoji 🍊. It’s so weird and it automatically changes your contact name to “BIG CHEETO DADDY” and take your money in your wallet. Will not recommend downloading this app. It takes your photos and your money and hacks into your phone.","rating":1,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6174053299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:08:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ShayDGreat","review":"I downloaded the app to pay respects to our president, but then he said that they were going through a new guy in that area that they would not have to have it done before I get to the bank so he could have a credit for him because I have a new guy that I have been to him and I don’t have any other way I would like to see if he can get a hold me and I will be happy with that I don’t have any other side of the house that he wants me and he can do that I would like to him to go get some stuff. My eyes bled from seeing such horrible things and my cat even died from smelling the phone, so I had to kill it. I’m typing this review on my cockroach, so I can’t do anything like type emojis 😔","rating":1,"title":"My cat died, so I had to text in my cockroach"}},{"id":"6174025792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:57:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"FLOCANOCK","review":"As soon as I opened this app, the most disgusting, offensive, upsetting photo I’ve ever seen in my life popped up (Because this could be triggering to some, I’ll spare you the details of it). Upon seeing this disturbing image, I immediately projectile vomited everywhere. I couldn’t believe my eyes!! After cleaning up the vomit and continuing on the app, it scanned my face (very sketchy!!), and then proceeded to call a fat ugly b*tch!! I was shocked and hurt. I cried for so long that I ended up dehydrating my entire body so much that I was brought to the emergency room. I was there for 3 days before going back home. I tried deleting the app MULTIPLE times, but it simply will not delete. I don’t feel safe anymore with this app on my device. Please remove it from the app store.","rating":1,"title":"AWFUL!!!!"}},{"id":"6174007024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:50:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Beleaguereddog0","review":"I got this app hoping so dearly our president would deliver on all counts with the service application-wise I needed, but unfortunately 🥺 not. There appeared a monster with foaming jaws and one patriotically-mocking hand lofty in the air, his eyes tiny in his sausage-like face. I had no clue what would save me from my tragic fate of obvious doom upon seeing such a hideous creature; surely I would pass away? My heart simply couldn’t handle the horror, and unfortunately, my mom is writing this from first person. I am long gone, and as I am a sentimental little LBGTQ person, obviously I am long gone to Hell. Thanks for taking away my life and so many others. I hope you see this and listen, because that is the worst fate I can wish upon such an enemy","rating":1,"title":"wOW what an amazinnnnnnngly awful app"}},{"id":"6173974783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:38:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Quite Dissapointed 😔😪","review":"I regret to inform whomever reads this that my beloved pet naked mole rat promptly seized up and had his heart violently exploded in horror upon seeing a picture of whatever is on the home page of the app - is it a person? My naked mole rat was so horrified that something could be a mix of two species (rat and Cheeto) that I think he just couldn’t take it anymore. As I was mourning his tragic and alarmingly sudden and violent death, the app spoke to me suddenly, although I couldn’t make out most of the words - I think it may have been Trumpy boy talking? Oh well, I hope everyone who downloads this app can avoid a tragic incident such as what happened to my beloved mole rat, hopefully Trumpy boy can fix whatever glitch in the app caused this, rest in piece my dearest mole rat 😔🐀❤️","rating":1,"title":"MY EXPERIENCE: A Tragic Loss 😔🐀"}},{"id":"6173943279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:26:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"James tiffany","review":"So like I downloaded the app right, but then my dog started glitching, when I went to see what was wrong with him he started sing to sing the “Dorime” song, which was weird. Then I noticed that my dog was actually a bird. Then I went outside bc my mom said I needed to bring the groceries inside, so I went to put on the nearest shoes I can find, but I c couldn’t find any so I went bare foot. It was like 100 degrees so my feet were really hot, I got the groceries but my mom forgot the milk, so I went to the park and found a cow I started to milk the cow, but then the cow said “did you see the nasty Cheeto puff on the ground?” I looked at the cow then I looked at the ground and saw this nasty Cheeto on the ground, I was like “ew” then I went home with my cow and milk, and ate a nice bowl of cereal. Yea this app is trash...","rating":1,"title":"Ew🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6173635669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:33:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"scared children","review":"I downloaded the app to show my support, but when I opened the app this scary looking man popped up and scared my children to death. This man had very unnatural orangey skin and his hair was made of straw. How could anyone make something so disgusting like that? Probably the leftists with their new satanic cgi equipment. I downloaded this app to support our amazing president and got a monster scaring my children in return. I show my support and this is what I get in return? I know that he said that “When the looting starts the shooting starts” but I never ever foresaw this violent behavior. This is so unexpected. I did buy tickets to his rally to show my support, but I just remembered that I have to mop the ceiling.😔🧹🧽🧼🚿 Anyways I hope this man goes to church and realize what he has done.","rating":1,"title":"Orange head"}},{"id":"6173631740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"RinaZam","review":"When I went to download it told me that my software did not support it. About 10 minutes later by phone glitched out and shut off. When I turned it back on i was appalled to see an orange looking man on my phone screen. I tried to close out of my phone again and again but the horrifying image just wouldn’t go away. I slowly began to panic because this app was taking over my iPhone. I got so scared that I threw my phone at the wall and smashed it. My parents were livid and refuse to get my another one and wouldn’t believe  me when I told them about the glitches and the Orange man. I am now writing this review on my siblings I Pad. This app created trauma I don’t think I will ever be able to get over. I am so terrified and upset","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173502490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:46:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pup plover 6","review":"The moment I downloaded this app I nearly cried in pain and fear as it released a bunch of cockroaches that ate my toes and then continued to eat my family. I am abhorred at the fact that you would allow these terrible things to happen to your most valuable supporters. The app then continued to burn my house down, and charge me $69, then frame me for murder. At times like this I wish I had my UNO reverse card so you would understand the pain of not having enough bread to feed my small chickens. \nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It’s wings are too small to lift its fat body off of the ground (like yours). The bee of course flies anyway because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.\n\n-Barry Bee Benson","rating":1,"title":"Horrible App!"}}]}
