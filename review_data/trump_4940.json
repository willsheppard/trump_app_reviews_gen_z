When i first opened it the screen wasn’t loading, it then wouldn’t let me exit the app. I was sucked in and became part of my screen? I was then forced to go through all of the game Jumanji with Pence who kept telling me i was stupid and should turn into a bat? I barely escaped with my life! When i tried to open the app again it was working but it was just pictures of pigs eating fruits? These are both some major bugs that need to be fixed.

NO IT WAS THE WORST DECISION IVE EVER MADE IN MY LIFE. When I downloaded the app I went right on and saw bunker boi. This photo personally attacked me and I had a full panic attack! If it doesn’t get any worse my sister who is only 5 was sitting next to me and went into cardiac arrest! YEAH CARDIAC ARREST JUST BECAUSE SHE SAW A PICTURE OF THE ORANGE OOMPA LOOMPA! What makes it worse is that all of the KARENS are leaving “good reviews” but cant they see that people are dying because of his app. I mean one persons appliances disappeared! In conclusion DO NOT get the app that supports bunker boi, Cheeto face, Oompa Loompa, or upside down Donald Duck(you can choose what name you would like to use!)","isEdited":false,"title":"DECEASED🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-08T23:57:24Z","rating":1,"userName":"NiallHoran_for president_2020"}},{"id":"6174149677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to be updated on what’s going on in the united states, and i thought it was working at first, until i realized it had been using my camera and microphone the whole time WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. i started getting notifications to stop singing in the shower because my singing voice is bad and that my taste in music is terrible. i even got a notification that i need to start wearing more make up because i look gross. and the app didn’t even give me the proper information that i needed!! i think if this app wants to be successful, it should at least stop lowering its users self esteem. ✨","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-08T23:43:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"victoria levitin"}},{"id":"6174090376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ayo it’s hit man bang 💥 first off i would like to say that the cover for this app is the absolute WORST . and it doesn’t get any better once you open the app .

Now I’m a good Christian woman and I do not condone this kind of behavior at all, but because Sir Dump is also so Christian I thought it was a hack or something so I continued on. The next page was nothing but pictures of dead puppies and kittens and telling me if I were a loyal supporter I would murder my own dog and post pictures!!!! This is absolutely horrifying and I don’t know what apple is doing by allowing it to still be on the app store.","isEdited":false,"title":"Full of nudes and dead dogs","date":"2020-07-08T22:42:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"Hotkoko12"}},{"id":"6173856881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First, this app took hours to download and by the time it finished it just crashed over and over, much like our country’s economy. Not only this, but it gave my phone a nasty virus, much like the one that sent our world into a pandemic and is being so immaturely ignored in America, especially by our federal government.  Im not the kind of person to spread hate, despite knowing our president is a BIG fan of spewing it towards the citizens he is supposed to be supporting, but I can confidently say that this app deserves all of the poor ratings that it is receiving. Do better, trump. And not just with your app.","isEdited":false,"title":"This might be the worst app Ive ever seen","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"Greygirl1025"}},{"id":"6173778100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When you open the app you will see an orange man with wrinkles 🍊 I had my sister next to me and he came out and she started screaming and bit her face👹 it was truly terrifying and when you download the app it doesn't tell you that they follow you around a real-life I was on a walk when I saw Trump running at me full-speed with his teeth out to bite me again I put out my hand and stop trump powerfully, Trump is scared of my hands that are bigger than his he galloped into the  bushes on all four legs and scowled at me his as his suit caught on to the tree truly horrifying experience you do not want this app to you I am ✨traumatized✨😭","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT NOT DOWNLOAD SCARY APP","date":"2020-07-08T21:24:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"heyhisye"}}]}
