The worst. WORST. I am very smart and educated on cellular phones and these apps. Very smart. Maybe a genius. But I can for sure tell you that this app is bad. I have other very smart people telling me that it is bad also. Smart people. Maybe the smartest in the world. They hate it too. All good Christian Americans hate this app too. China loves it - and you know we canâ€™t trust anything that CHIIIINA thinks is good. They are all just commies trying to destroy the country, and they love this cell phone app. Donâ€™t download it. One download is a vote for commies and China.","date":"2020-07-10T04:30:03Z","rating":1,"userName":"marandakr","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179436797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Yerrrrr","review":"Banned TikTok bet you wonâ€™t you a scared little orange ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡","date":"2020-07-10T04:30:03Z","rating":1,"userName":"trumps grass","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179436744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my life","review":"This app not only took 8 years to download but once it did I opened it to a haunting photo of some âœ¨rotten orangeâœ¨staring at me... I started to cry and tried to run away but I ran into the street and got hit by a smart car (the car exploded upon impact so luckily I had to damage). When I came back to look at my phone again the app had taken all my information and had donated all my money to North Korea. I then got a call saying if I needed to vote trump 2020 (Iâ€™m 7 i canâ€™t vote) or else the sniper on the roof outside was going to kill me (Iâ€™m genZ though so thatâ€™s chill).","date":"2020-07-10T04:30:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"fight me cheeto","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179436775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Lags","review":"Lags too much","date":"2020-07-10T04:30:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"islwkne 6788&","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179436622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Pure trash","review":"Just like our president.

If I could guess, it took about 4-5 days to download. It stole all of my information and data about me. Second of all, it completely destroyed my phone, and deleted all of my emails and messages. If I could rate this lower than 1 star, then I would.","date":"2020-07-10T04:29:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"AnaBee4","isEdited":false}}]}
