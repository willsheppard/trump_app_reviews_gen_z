It took 3 weeks and 5 days to download. when I opened it and tried to log in it said my email was already taken when it wasn't, and said my username was invalid everytime i tried to enter one. It glitched at 2 in the morning and started playing random music. The app has a lot of bugs and viruses and completely shut down my phone when I was trying to ex out of it to make a phone call. I do NOT reccomend this app to anyone who wants to keep up with the President.","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173739662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is poop, because it made me do so","userName":"Jsjdjxyxyshshhshdxjixjxhhhhx0","review":"This app made me poop my pants.
