Instead, once I downloaded the app, Donald Trump jumped out of my phone and started peeing all over my face!! 😡😡 I was so terrified I didn’t know what to do or act!!! Not only did he pee on my face, but he took a huge dump on my couch, and farted on my bed to top it all off. Once it was all over, he made his way back to my phone and jumped it. Literally one of the WORST experiences I’ve encountered when downloading an app! 110% DO NOT recommend!!!!","title":"The other 1 star descriptions are true💔","userName":"yumicp","date":"2020-07-10T05:17:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179579337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app keeps lagging and making my phone frozen, don’t get it, not worth the storage","title":"Read it, it’s worth the time","userName":"reviewer💗","date":"2020-07-10T05:17:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179579275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My brain is poisoned\nAnd I’m searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream “oh, no you don’t!”\nWoah","title":"Bing bong bing bong","userName":"bfisvcos fco","date":"2020-07-10T05:17:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179579283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is a horrible app and would not tell anyone to download it. this is not worth it and has no use to take up storage space on your phone. if you have this app delete it at once there is no reason for it. worst app EVER. don’t know why anyone would even want this. so many glitches as well. not out together very well. i also heard it takes your information off your phone 😳😳😳😱😱😱\ndelete this app!!!! worst app!!!!","title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"isabella23457008521168","date":"2020-07-10T05:17:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179579084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Look, I’m all for keeping up with “presidential candidates”...but this app is awful. First of all it’s super buggy and second of all like every five seconds wants me to make in-app purchases. Also it’s not supposed to take up much space but my iPhone kept telling me storage was full?? And it takes forever to load and kicks me out back to the home screen every time. That’s with my SECOND phone - my first phone legit broke. I was on the app and a pop up to give money cane up - not that he needs more money - and it wouldn’t let me reject the offer and then I tried to close the app and couldn’t then eventually it ran out of battery and hasn’t turned on since! Plus the app is designed terribly and the graphics and it’s NOT USER FRIENDLY. \nAlso I kept looking for pics of the president but I just kept seeing some old dude looking like 🍊and 🤡 mixed together with the brain of 🍊 and the social skills of 🤡 and the general...\n\nSo basically this app is trash.\n\nAnd the candidate is trash. 💕","title":"BROKE MY PHONE","userName":"Ekstuffies","date":"2020-07-10T05:17:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
