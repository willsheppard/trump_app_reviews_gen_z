Racism, prejudice, oppression, hatred, and inequality, white people in america have brought upon minorities. From the second we kidnapped the first African American to this second you’re reading this racism has been present. It’s gotten better but not nearly, in my opinion, close enough to be proud of. From mass incarceration to blatantly racist actions and words, America is as racist as it was 40 years ago we’ve just gotten better at hiding and or justifying it. There is a difference between being not racist and anti-racist. If you are with the president of the United stares you are against  the people of the United States. Not one time has Donald trump, not ONE time, has he been an ally to Black people in our community or even said black lives matter. And Donald trump whether you take away our platforms, like banning tik tok, hide in bunkers, use our police and military to abuse us, we will call you out. We will shout from our rooftops with words that come from the deepest part of our hearts. BlacK. lives. MATTER. I will say it for the old white men in the back. Black. Lives. MATTER. And one more time for the person who is supppsed to lead us but doesn't support us president Donald J. Trump, BLACK. LIVES. MATTER. please go watch the move 13th on Netflix. And say it with me BLACK LIVES MATTER!","rating":1,"userName":"clemtay","isEdited":false,"title":"0/10 do not recommend"}},{"id":"6177837977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:52:00Z","review":"Awful person awful app","rating":1,"userName":"drooly bug","isEdited":false,"title":"Lol"}},{"id":"6177835616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:51:19Z","review":"Is trying to remove our app so we’ll remove theirrrrsssssssssss periodt💅","rating":1,"userName":"vfnch","isEdited":false,"title":"Not good🤪🤪🤪🤪🤩🥳😏🤩🥳🥳"}}]}
