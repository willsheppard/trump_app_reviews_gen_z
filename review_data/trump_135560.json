The app contained age restricted material, which i assumed was just to keep children out of it, but i opened it and was IMMEDIATELY greeted with images that i DID NOT WANT TO SEE. it started spamming my phone and the moment i complained verbally about it, my amazon alexa turned off and SOME GUY TURNED UP AT MY DOOR! i’m a minority and trump is my bias, but one of the trump stans showed up at my door wearing a confederate flag ONLY and demanded I leave the country because my skin is not pure white! i said “if the president can be orange, why can’t i be brown?!” he said “if you don’t like it here then leave! go back to your country!” i’m very patriotic and i’m 100% born and raised in america, hence why i am so in love with the president. But this man at my door was yelling racial slurs at me and telling me to go back home because the president didn’t want me here! I said “this is MY house and MY country!” he said “DONT TALK BACK TO ME!!!” and then picked me up and threw me onto my driveway. he was punching me while i was on the ground saying that i brought the chinese virus here so he doesn’t want to be near me! i was wearing a mask and he said i was a wimp for doing so and that the government is trying to control us! and then he said that since the president doesn’t wear a mask he doesn’t have to either! i’m writing this review in the hospital with a concussion and a cracked skull, and when i tried to open the app with my phone plugged in, it turned off the entire hospital’s electricity and froze my phone by spamming it with stupid messages. DONT GET THIS APP!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136623241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:50:04Z","rating":1,"title":"It’s true.","userName":"Person Number Seventy-Two","review":"I didn’t believe it when I read the review that this app was cursed, but when I downloaded the app my cat collapsed in a furry heap and started twitching uncontrollably. He vomited blood everywhere and died a few minutes later.\n\n Mr. Scruffles was too young to die. He had nine whole lives ahead of him.\n\nOf course, I wasn’t one to just assume the app did this, so I started typing in my phone number to get the verification code or whatever. A second later, someone crashed their car right outside my house. I went outside to see if they were okay but their car was totaled. Luckily the person in the crash survived but after two unfortunate accidents happing together within two minutes, I got suspicious. \n\nThen while I was trying to create my account, I got a call from my dad saying my mom died. I am devastated. My mom was my hero. \n\nDO NOT GET THIS APP.\n\nIt will ruin your life. Everyone you know and love will die for mysterious reasons. You might even hurt some poor stranger who did nothing wrong. THE CURSE IS REAL.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136607800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:45:05Z","rating":1,"title":"donald jenius trump 😍","userName":"jjjuullliiiaaa","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSource: LyricFind\nSongwriters: Kisean Anderson / Jonathan Rotem / Jason Desrouleaux / Keidran Jones / Timothy Theron / Thomas Theron\nReplay lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Universal Music Publishing Group, Round Hill Music Big Loud Songs, BMG Rights Management","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136602344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:43:22Z","rating":1,"title":"quite horrid","userName":"Minecraft👁👄👁","review":"i downloaded and opened the app and whew it was cursed. everything in my room started floating upside down and my toilet started spraying poop everywhere😳 i dont recommend this app in the slightest tis quite scary😌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136597370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:41:45Z","rating":1,"title":"worst app ever!!","userName":"🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗","review":"this app is absolutely the worst i’ve ever had in my life. do not download this app! wow. it crashed so many times and made my dad absolutely horrible. worst day ever! all because of this app. do NOT recommend at all -2727388/10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136590251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:39:27Z","rating":1,"title":"🤮","userName":"+=^~_","review":"This app is ass","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136566190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:31:46Z","rating":1,"title":"🧚🏾very✨racist🦋and☁️disgusting😘","userName":"missjayla","review":"This💕app🧚🏾was✨created💍by🦋a💖white✨supremacist✨homophobic🏳️\u200D🌈xenophobic✊🏽pedophile😘\n✨✨✨Trump, gen z will always and forever hate you✨✨✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136558914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:29:29Z","rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!
