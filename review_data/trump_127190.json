But I KNEW I should have listened to all those reviews and warnings about how I shouldn’t download the app because of all the weird phone crashes and on some cases infects you with unintelligent, ignorant, and dense thoughts about how racism is okay and to support rapists and basically that equal rights is just a conspiracy theory that only applys to arrogant and opinionated airheads.This app was completely dissatisfying, hard to navigate, very cluttered, and overall just a huge mess. Some wiz tech who has there right mind put on would put up a fire wall that would separate us from those dim witted thoughts and opinions. Okay thank you for your time I hope I helped someone by warning them 😊✌️","title":"✨🧚\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏽\u200D♂️🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏿\u200D♂️✨🌈💫"}},{"id":"6177887793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:07:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hsjabshzkappapqpqppq","rating":1,"review":"I experienced a flying rat while loading the app!

OK so first off this app took 15 hours to download what app takes 15 hours to download! That is absolutely unbelievable and then weird stuff started happening after I downloaded it my phone screen turnedBright orange! I couldn’t get it back to normal color and then these Oompa Loompa’s busted in my house by breaking down my door and they just started yelling “vote for Trump or else!” They were keeping me and my family captive! One of the scariest moments of my life by far I was kidnapped by Oompa Loompa’s for 15 days I was honestly scared for my life I didn’t think I was gonna make it out. But crazy stuff has been happening to me ever since I deleted the app and escape the blue bus the other day my poop started turning orange!I know disgusting right and then my toes then my knee caps in my entire legs! And then my hair fell off like a to pay and it turned white! I tried to stick it back on but no matter what I did when I went outside it just flapped in the wind I couldn’t even open the windows in my car without being embarrassed or my hair unnecessarily flying off my head! And then a few days later it affected my hearing all everybody was ever saying was “Trump 2020”\n “make America even worse” and my eyes even go tinted 🍊Orange🍊so everything I looked at was orange! I deleted the app and everything finally went back to normal thank goodness \n                   0/10 would not recommend scariest week of my life would not recommend!","title":"Unbelievable!"}},{"id":"6177885004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:06:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"smd:(((","rating":1,"review":"Give me back my TikTok you big orange headass🤬m","title":"Smd:)"}},{"id":"6177882671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nickynicole27","rating":1,"review":"absolutely horrible, i opened the app and i threw up. -100000000/10. who developed this? like are they okay? do they need \n✨t h e r a p y✨??","title":"ew❤️"}},{"id":"6177881404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lily Iversen the FIRST","rating":1,"review":"Ok so I got this app and then got a bug and trump haked in to my phone and deleted so much like tiktok and YouTube all of that so this app gets a one star never agin","title":"Bad"}},{"id":"6177881190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bobberto the cheeto","rating":1,"review":"this app ruined my phone!
