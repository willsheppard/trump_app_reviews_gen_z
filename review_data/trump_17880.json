It’s even crazier how this Kanye west thing is happening just so trump wins. All these people who support him are just crazy and obviously haven’t seen how much he has affected this country in the past 4 years. Sad just sad! It’s like voting for a child, a stubborn, crazy, cheating child smh","userName":"101dalmationw","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:47:58Z","title":"Tik tok sent me ❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172910669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app I’ve ever used. Right when I opened it, the front page had millions of spiders crawling all over it. The spiders then escaped out of the screen and started attacking me. I am now covered in millions of spider bites. Luckily they weren’t poisonous. Five minutes after that my phone started playing the song Psycho on repeat for 18 hours. I do not recommend this app.","userName":"sarah8898","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:33:34Z","title":"Terrible app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172889490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was really hoping that this app would outweigh all the bad trump has done and turn it into something good but this app has done nothing but make me realize that trump is the worst president and is doing nothing to help this country. besides trump, let’s move on to the app itself. this app too 4 hours to download and is glitching me out like crazy. my wifi is great but this app is definitely not. i see that many others are having the same problem with the app glitching and it is truly not okay considering this is an app that is supposed to educate us on our president. worst app yet no one should get this. thank you.","userName":"give me the best apps","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:27:00Z","title":"worst app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172888545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off this application took hours to download and when I mean hours I mean at least five hours. Second of all the apples and even working properly, the app kept glitching and crashing and I had perfect Wi-Fi to I had all bars and it still didn’t work out. Horrible app do not download if you don’t want to waste time out of your day.","userName":"FrizBoi","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:26:43Z","title":"Horrible app 🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172877871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the WORST! I tried logging in but it wouldn’t let me. After deleting the app and reinstalling it I finally got in after trying for 20 minutes! After I went out of the app my phone started glitching, GLITCHING so know I have to get a WHOLE new phone just because of this STUPID app. I advise EVERYONE to not install this app if you don’t want your phone to be glitching. APPLE JUST TAKE THIS WHOLE APP OFF APPLE STORE.

Once I opened the app it took me to porn hub so I got a virus on my phone🦠. So then I deleted the app and downloaded it again. Well it just kept showing me a Cheeto puff and I got scared. I had to go buy a new phone because of this stupid app📱☠️. It’s made me also lose all my money for this phone so now I am homeless.","userName":"hohihlgcpyf","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:14:44Z","title":"Got me homeless🦠📱🐸","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172788005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This orange man with hair like a troll doll really thinks that all of the United States population is dumb. He constantly tweets or says things that are not ok in anyway and then either acts like it never happened or says that he didn’t mean it in that way and we are taking it the wrong way. \nIts ok everyone makes mistakes 💞🥺🧚✨but in this case you are the mistake ⚡️💞🥺🥺.","userName":"dest...","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:57:08Z","title":"Low expectations yet reality didn’t even meet them","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172756117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Well I downloaded it sure...but I wanted to see what our “president has done for us the past 3 years. If anything we’ve gone down, losing jobs, increasing debt, possibly not allowing trans and medical help or having lgbtq+ couples to have kids but that’s their dream for most. Our president is a scum bag.
