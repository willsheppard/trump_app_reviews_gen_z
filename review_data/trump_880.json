Who has enough money to pay $50,000 for some 🍊. When downloading the app for our beloved president 🤡, I signed a petition with some “heartwarming” quotes. Then the CIA showed up to my house with a box of human teeth. 🦷 They forced me to eat the teeth, as my little brother watched. Then they picked my brother up by his underwear and swung ✨ my brother around like a little rag doll. He was so traumatized he sat in the corner rocking back and forth while urinating on himself. Then they left and came back the next day to deliver a 📦. When I opened the 📦 there was a body part of a mutated penis, with a 📝 saying “say hello to your father.” Which I questioned because I have never seen my father👻. Little did I know he was a white🧍🏼\u200D♂️ man, he took forever to bring back that 🥛. Again do not download this app or mutated penis’ 🍆 will be delivered to you in a box. I will be voting Harambe 🦧 for President for 2020 ✨💅🏽."}},{"id":"6171779339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"EL CHAPO 2020","userName":"big booty pelusa","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:07:33Z","review":"I was trying to support this big deformed standing orange man and I can’t even download the app it says something about that I’m not welcome here and if I don’t like here then leave but before I leave I decide to tell u guys my experience with this app i tried to download this app so I can get them ugly christmas  sweaters even tho it June but I’m trying to have them before because they take so long to deliver my package because they are too busy trying to help this tilted tower of a man hide in a bunker 🐓 because of Gen Z even tho I’m very proud of  Gen Z for making him think 1 million people were gonna here this corn hair of a man rant on how he wants to make America great again but I don’t see that happening 🛀⛓🧚🏼\u200D♀️⛓🌲🥨🥒⏳🛌🚬🧻🐓🥔❤️❤️🍷🔫🧻🤍🥨❤️❤️🐓🤤⛓🚬⛓⛓🚬🚬😉😉🥬🔫🦶🏽🔫🚬🥨   EL CHAPO 2020 🥒🥦🥔😭🥨🦶🏽❤️🚬🥨😭🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥨🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥨😭🥔🥔🥦🥖✌🏻🥬🐓🐓🛀❤️😉🎩🛌🌲😕 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️❤️❤️❤️💀🥬🍷🛀🛀⏳ i hope your run out of food in your bunker 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🐓💀💀❤️❤️❤️💀💀 much love now I’m go pull a Hannah baker ✌🏻🛀"}},{"id":"6177847703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨trumps app is so bad✨","userName":"dont@me_","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:54:55Z","review":"right when i opened up the app believe it or not...i saw an orange😔this app is so bad it’s truly disappointing but i’m not surprised. i can’t believe people vote for such a racist person. anyways as i was looking through the app i saw the saying “make america great again” REPEATEDLY. i would just like to ask trump and his cult when was america EVER great, america has went through 400+ years of slavery, multiple genocides, racism.. THAT STILL EXISTS IN 2020 and much more. it’s scary that his cult KNOWS that he is racist but will still continue to advocate for him😍. he has thousands of kids in cages, believes that black people that are in poverty put themselves in that situation because they are ✨lazy✨, claims that the corona virus is a chinese virus, and says mexicans are all rapists, murderers, take away jobs which doesn’t even make sense but are u surprised?? because i’m not 😀.anyways anyone but trump 2020. and since you’re reading this go stream nicki minaj and support the black lives movement💅🏽."}},{"id":"6177742576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It was horrible","userName":"Alexandria Young","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:23:28Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I’m a Trump supporter, and wanted to keep up with Trump. However, I’m giving this app a one star because when I downloaded this app (which took 3 hours to download), it said to give them my Apple ID and password, and all of my personal information. I did not know why I did it. Now, my phone is hacked and I cannot use any of the apps that I downloaded, except the Trump 2020 app. Also, I saw information on here that goes against what I believe in, like how it was saying that we should not support the LGBTQA community and how Black people should not have rights. It also has information about making raping legal. I cannot believe that this whole time, I was supporting a racist rapist. Last but not least, it also somehow hacked inside my bank account and credit cards, so now I have no money and I am homeless. This app ruined my life. I am using the last of my money to type this review. I am no longer a Trump supporter."}},{"id":"6177717899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"You bout dumb as a box of rocks luv 🤡🤡","userName":"CharleneN9890","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:16:06Z","review":"I wanted to download this app so that I could further support our Cheeto dust covered president. But when I opened the app I was met by a mortifying picture of an orange goblin. I had to buy myself a new set of eyes after seeing that image and I’m now in  therapy due to it. But anyways when I opened the app, after I saw that crusty picture, the app asked for my number!?! Hun, let me remind you that I have a man and this was not it. To think that I would cheat on my boo thang with some unseasoned carrot is a fat NO from me. Moving on, a couple days after I downloaded the app my phone started continuously playing the national anthem??? Like wth?? I tried to dispose of my phone because it was starting to get too loud but before I did so my home screen turned  showed a picture of our very racist and homophobic president nude..yes you heard that right nude. I am just flabbergasted and I highly do not recommend this app to anybody unless you want aids.

The app is crashing constantly, and won’t let me open it long enough to check event details. That brings a huge pointlessness to having it. Not only that, but it started crashing my other apps, too. I deleted various apps I enjoyed to get this app. My iPhone was working perfectly fine before download, and now it’s suddenly just breaking. So, I tried to power my phone off and on, and it was working for ten minutes, but it crashed again. I started trying to open the app, but it’d close immediately. I couldn’t open any apps due to how bad it broke. I had to delete the app, reset my phone MULTIPLE TIMES, and reset some of my settings to just simply open the App Store to write a review. I am highly disappointed in the outcome of trying to SUPPORT MY PRESIDENT. This app with make you grow grey hairs, and put your phone to waste. 🙄🙄"}},{"id":"6176082385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Desgostang","userName":"trumpbegone2020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:28:50Z","review":"What I think🤔 people👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧 who are not🚫 in Trump 2020🟣 need to understand✔ is that being 🤸\u200D♀️ racist🟥 isn't just something we do.

There was false news everywhere in the app and it’s just a big scam 🤡🧚\u200D♀️🚫\nWe don’t want a president who lies their way in and out of everything, an orange person who hides in his bunker instead of facing their problems.\nHere are just a few horrible things Trump has done: Withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear deal.\nWithdrawing from the Paris Accord and rolling back climate protections.\n\nDecimating our Departments of State, Interior, Education and fostering a brain drain of scientists from the NIH, EPA and Interior.\n\nPutting more children in cages and separating them from their parents and not keeping records of their whereabouts.\n\nDoing nothing about gun reform and the mass shootings; still in bed with the NRA.\n\nSpreading more hate with his rhetoric of hatred and insults to folks such as John McCain, the Kahn family and other patriots of our country.\n\nTurning a blind eye to the suffering people of Puerto Rico.\n\nProposing legislation to gut the ACA and eliminate pre-existing conditions.\n\nBlowing up the deficit to the point where our children and grandchildren will be paying the price for decades to come.\n\nAsking the leader of Ukraine to dig up dirt on an opponent in order to be re-elected this year, by holding up monies that Congress authorized.\n\nIt is absolutely embarrassing for me to say that Trump is currently the president of this country. \n\nCongratulations Trump!!! You’re the worst!!🚫🇱🇷"}}]}
