Sounding alarms saying I’d be cursed if looking further upon this wicked app🤯😱!! I couldn’t 🐻 but watch for a few seconds till the monster under my bed told me to cut it out, he was trying to sleep... so I immediately clicked out and never looked back... until today to write this awful review ☹️. Think better. Do better.

It took two days to download but i get why bunker boy is slow at lots of things 😜 but i wanted to see what this terrible app our racist present made.😃And as i thought, it sucked everything moved slow. It made my phone glitch out. So i don’t recommend anyone getting this app. I mean it’s a waste of time to even look anything trump does. 😌🥰","title":"worst app!!","userName":"racist ass","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173035439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i really wish i read the reviews beforehand. this app is so hard to use and so confusing. they leaked my address and now i’m receiving clown noses in the mail everyday. i was distraught when i opened up the app and it revealed absolutely horrifying and inappropriate photos of the president; my toddler caught a glimpse of the screen as i opened it and was so traumatized i am now enrolling her into therapy. DO NOT RECOMMEND.","title":"flabbergasted at how awful this app is","userName":"Erma Esmer","date":"2020-07-08T17:12:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172984459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if i could give this less than one star, i would. trump’s app has to be the cheapest, glitchiest app on earth. now my phone is cursed. i will not be voting for trump in the coming election because he has absolutely ruined my phone. WHAT in the HELL is wrong with him anyways? i think it’s the tanning. maybe it’s the fake hair. or maybe it’s the bubble gut. or the small hands. or the fact that he’s incapable of accepting criticism. who knows?","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"jfndnfd","date":"2020-07-08T16:56:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172983022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"horrible app!!!! For starters, the app took a whole month to download, then when I opened it, it showed me a picture of trump naked!! I was petrified. Then they threaten to drown my goldfish if I didn’t vote for trump but I can’t vote 😖 five seconds later my fish drowned from the horrid pictures I saw! horrible app, horrible pictures, I mean have you’ll seen them, it’s tiny tiny. Anywho I’m getting off of topic, would not recommend this app!!","title":"woah✨✨✨","userName":"Gems hater","date":"2020-07-08T16:56:06Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172919328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to help our presidents campaign and I’m almost positive it downloaded a virus to my phone. My phone started overheating and crashed and deleted all of my photos right after I downloaded it. I’m really disappointed in this app and hope this gets fixed ASAP. It asked for my private info too which is infringing on my liberty and rights!!","title":"Clunky app. Gave my phone a virus.

Also I tried to find reasons why to vote Trump in that app, and I wasn’t successful. Trump wants to open the schools in fall while there is a DEADLY VIRUS going around like what is going on in his head smh. Online school is better for the children’s safety and the teachers. Also he is racist and by not building the wall he decreased the economy. That’s clown sh 🤡🤡🤡","title":"Do NOT Download","userName":"Kit:DLol","date":"2020-07-08T16:32:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172905753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It made my phone glitch multiple times a day and hardly worked when I opened the app It needs and update or something and I would get so many notifications I had to shut it off bc my phone would die faster bc of all the notifications It needs to be fixed and it would send random notifications through out the day","title":"Don’t download","userName":"josie moody","date":"2020-07-08T16:32:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172893764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i wanted to get this app to support our president, but was very disappointed with the quality. the organization is so poor it makes me not want to open the app at all, and when i did, it would ALWAYS glitch after just a few minutes and then shut down altogether. quite literally the worst app i’ve ever used and would not recommend to ANYBODY","title":"very disappointed","userName":"epicgamerviolet","date":"2020-07-08T16:28:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
