I resisted for days but eventually... I just couldn’t resist any longer. Once I had gotten the app it took a whole m o n t h to download which is already ridiculous, but then it changed all of my wallpapers to MAGA and Trump 2020.... Suddenly, the oranges in my fridge rolled out with diapers and blonde toupees telling me to vote for Trump and trying to convince me to racist, homophobic, and sexist things. I was there on my couch wondering what to do when it hit me. Step on them. So I spent a full 24 hours stepping on these oranges that wouldn’t stop coming until, there was none left. I sustained many injuries from this experience that I will probably sue President Orange for but besides that, I’m okay. I’ve deleted the app but my wallpapers will now not go back to normal and I will have to go for therapy for this because of how traumatizing it was. Take it from me, do. not. get. this. app. and remove all oranges from your home. For you see, the 🍊oranges🍊 work for the 🤯government🤯.","date":"2020-07-09T17:38:14Z","rating":1,"title":"The🍊oranges🍊 work for the 🤯goverment🤯!","isEdited":false,"userName":"KawaiiRoseCat8"}},{"id":"6177582099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app thinking I’d keep tabs on my favorite little orange shrimp handed fellow. What I was expecting was to see plans for a misogynist and xenophobic agenda.(my favorite) but instead I was greeted by something similar to an old British dog (if you spray painted the dog orange) which I was not expecting- why would anyone put a shaggy dog like that in presidential office? Idk. Ask Russia. But anyways I scoffed at the unprofessional title page. I was so offended by the sight that I decided to delete the app in an attempt to spare my sanity.  Just when I thought my misery was over, I heard a knock on my door. I opened it to see 15 oompah loompahs on my doorstep. He had sent his goons after me!!! I shut the door and screamed and just when I thought I was safe, they began crawling through the fireplace, and shattering the windows. They were holding something. What were they holding? Needles and...... Clorox and Lysol. “This will cure corona virus” they said. I tried to explain that I don’t even have it but they wouldn’t listen. \n\nAnd that is the story of how the trump app landed me at poison control.","date":"2020-07-09T17:33:05Z","rating":1,"title":"🧚🏻🌙🌸chair✌🏻✨but make it electric👏🏻😘🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"sarah549"}},{"id":"6177570598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I 👁LITERALLY✨ just like🔥 got this app📲or whatever🤷\u200D♀️ and I saw 👀a big 👤orange🚼 thingy🚮 on my screen📺 so I thought🤔💭 “oh ‼️😯cute😱🤗 they added ➕a little🤏 orange 🟠wearing a suit🕴.” And then🧍\u200D♀️ I realized😨🤯 it was actually😢 that disgusting🤢thing 🤮behind🎚a desk⚰️ and i👁just wanted to🤗pull🦾my eyes👀 out, but um🗣anyways,🧠apart👥 from the horrific🙀👹 views, this app📲 gave such bad❌🙄services 🧳like for ❗️example, I 👁was putting 🤗in my phone📱number📟and🤞then 👈I started getting spam📸📸📸\nMessages 💾📥📨about TrUmP🍊 2020🔆like.... no❌‼️msmamagworl🤦\u200D♀️, Ariana💃👯\u200D♀️ grande💁\u200D♀️ 2020🤗💕 piariat Pootums👁💆\u200D♀️but Um😐 anyways back🙅\u200D♀️🧚to the story📖📜.

Instead I got a message from bunker boy calling me a “poor little british girl shaped like his left deformed shrimp ball”. I’m not even British! This caught me by surprise, but nonetheless trump is a pedo so I wouldn’t be surprised if he was checking me out through the camera on my phone. Anyways.. Several days later I found out he was reaching out to my granny! He called her a “spicy crumpet mami” and had the secret service come push her down the stairs while they played horrible trumpet songs and did fortnite dances, mocking and taunting my grandma as she was dying on the basement floor. Trump then proceeded to come flying through the door unannounced with a shotgun and clout goggles. He shot me 26 times and threw it back over my cold dead body. Barron (his very, very tall son) tried to save me, but he was just too late. Donald then filmed a tiktok of my death and threw my grandma into a pit of lava and called it a day. That is why I wrote this review from my grave and plan to haunt those fugly men who killed me, and plan to get this horrible app deleted forever. 😻","date":"2020-07-09T09:57:35Z","rating":1,"title":"This orange cheeto tried it","isEdited":false,"userName":"Yoyo juice 44"}},{"id":"6175838187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if you are reading this, keep reading it sweetheart. I gotta lot to say. FIRST, why would you people want a racist, homophobic SEX OFFENDER run our country. NO, NOT OUR country. This leads me to me second point. SECONDLY, this isn’t “his country.” He’s kicking out all the great people holding this country above sea level. If all races were here and if were only whites and the cheetos, we would probably end in disaster. THIRD, he IS a homophobic idiot. How could you hate someone for loving the same gender?! I know this is a corny saying by now but LOVE IS LOVE. THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG. Taking away people’s right to be emancipated from the life they are living? Not be able to receive medical help? Please tell me this is a joke. Lastly but NOT LEAST, he is a MAJOR sex offender. There has been many videos that have showed Trump talking about sexually assaulting women, INCLUDING HIS OWN DAUGHTER. Yes, you trump supporters may hate Obama, and everyone else but Trump, but you can deny or say anything was taken out of context. At least Obama had the decency to respect his people, especially women, for who they are. \n\n~ signing off, me.","date":"2020-07-09T09:08:51Z","rating":1,"title":"no no no NO DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT","isEdited":false,"userName":"rip kobe and gianna :("}},{"id":"6175452772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He is so idiotic you are a sycophant liar you are crazy for saying you are trying to make America greater the only thing you are doing is making this country and this community miserable the only people you care about is the white people and we see right threw you , you almost sent this country to ww3 and yet you don’t care you don’t care about the Hispanic people mixed people neither do you care about black you discuss me how could you make the government separate innocent kids away from their parents at the border of Mexico and try to take away the rights of people and put up a border who do you think you are you are a worthless fat slob whith no intensional to make this country better the only reason you want to be is make your self have a name in this world you are not true this world at all then you have the nerve to try and delete TikTok how do you even go to sleep at night from the way that you treat and it’s sad that little innocent kids know that you do this stuff to the world and I am sick of you !!!!!!!!!!!!!🤮🤮🤮🤮👹💩👎👎👎👎⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪❌❌❌❌🚮🚮🚮🎦","date":"2020-07-09T06:50:03Z","rating":1,"title":"He is so stupid 😔😡😡😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"shrimppea"}},{"id":"6174911633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This App Stole my chicken nuggets from McDonald’s from the refrigerator because I was going to go get them and then it was just gone you know and then I had nothing to eat that day until the next day I bought some new chicken nuggets and I was like yeah I’m going to go eat them and so then I came back downstairs so I went to my fridge raider and it was gone because he just saw my first unit gets him so if you like this is the worst app ever not to mention it’s glitching all over the place and it’s so annoying like he gets me so frustrated because I have to spend that day knowing that this one store my chicken nuggets and it’s so bad because I want to eat my chicken nuggets if I can’t eat my chicken nuggets I’m going to be so mad because those chicken nuggets make me not hungry because I am always so angry so this is the worst app ever because it’s store my chicken nuggets and I am never hungry but now I’m hungry so and it keeps glitching so that’s a bonus actually so this is the worst app ever don’t use it it’s whatever you do and make sure this gets deleted because I want to get deleted so bad","date":"2020-07-09T03:40:05Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"bri.brianna3"}},{"id":"6174613706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"There are so many things wrong with this! ✋🏼👎🏼there was a short orange thing kinda looked like an orangutan 🦧 staring right at me!🤢I then swiped down to see what was next because I thought 💭 that maybe there was a glitch of some sort.
