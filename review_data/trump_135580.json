The app is so easy to navigate, and I had so much fun supporting President Trump! I love supporting him. That was until after something terrible happened. After about five minutes on the app, my mom came into my room, clutching her stomach, saying she had a TERRIBLE stomachache. We brought her to the hospital since she couldn't poop it out. Anyways, during our hospital stay, I was on this app again to support my President Trump. Again after five minutes, my little brother came to me, crying about losing his phone! Can y'all believe that?! We searched everywhere in the hospital ward, but no luck. My dad said that he'd buy a new phone for him. We went back into my mom's hospital room, and I sat down on the chair, going on this app again. Another five minutes have passed, and my dad sat down next to me, suddenly passing out. He passed out for a good hour, and when we woke up, we learned that he had an INFECTION IN HIS LOWER REGION! There is a pattern. Everytime I go onto this app, and after about five minutes or so, something terrible happens. Please do not get this app for your safety. Thank you all.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"yoonbunni","title":"Mistake","date":"2020-06-29T15:45:01Z"}},{"id":"6136405369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"it smells horrible 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦟🦟🦟","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"joesbsgsjs","title":"🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗","date":"2020-06-29T15:39:56Z"}},{"id":"6136382731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do NOT get this app ugh it’s so horrible, i tried to ask mr.Trump a question and he threw me to the ground ugh if i could rate 0 stars i would 😠","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"trumpscoochlice","title":"Worst App EVER!!!!","date":"2020-06-29T15:32:52Z"}},{"id":"6136367724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️horrible🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ncjfhsuhdhfudbjdhd","title":"Awful","date":"2020-06-29T15:28:14Z"}},{"id":"6136354055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I woke up just head over heels over the Trump family, I decided to get the app. Anyways Mr. Trump can you please let Baron know I said hi!!!!!!??

I had always believed that the radical leftists were only envious of our power. I wasn’t surprised to hear that they hid in a bunker and shut down all electricity and communication! There they were, accusing our president of pedophilia, racism, homophobia, and other hateful crimes. I downloaded this app as a way to assist me in the voting process. As soon as I opened the app, hundreds of images of our president with underage girls and boys flashed before my eyes! I immediately assumed the program had been hacked and excused the occurrence. As I clicked to supposedly obtain more helpful information, a list of federal laws President Jenius Trump committed showed up on my screen! Ironically, this app had opened my eyes to the cruelty of our so called president. I took it upon myself to do some research and found horrid things. Our president has accused many people of disgusting actions yet he has done far worse. The “radical leftists” are completely innocent and undoubtedly correct and honest. Please take action to remove this app forever as it is utterly inappropriate. The citizens of this country deserve to learn the correct way! This is not what America is about!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"IHonestlyReviewApps","title":"Indescribably disappointing","date":"2020-06-29T15:00:11Z"}},{"id":"6136271210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was really hoping for this app to be wonderful because my great president runs it! But no!!! As soon as I download it my phone glitched and kept turning off and I was terrified.So,I tried using my old phone (iPhone 8+) to call Sprint but that too starting glitching. Next, my 5yr old daughter started running around the house saying the numbers “666”. Now I have the devil in my household. Then from that point on I passed out then woke up in a hospital bed! Now at this point, I’m taking my very last breaths. President Trump, what do u have to say for yourself, you let me down... you let your people down. I really believed in you. You had the chance to empower us and strengthen us, but no... you  decided to weaken us in EVERY... WAY.. POSSIBLE... But like on the bright side I’m like every other cocky and ignorant trump supporter out their and you know what we all say when Trump makes mIStAkeS , “ it’s just a big miss understanding, Trump didn’t really mean it!” Sooo yeah! VOTE FOR TRUMP! Happy late birthday! \n\nSincerely - Karen AKA genz in disguise","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"fun and Amazing-Savannah","title":"I’m disappointed","date":"2020-06-29T14:59:06Z"}},{"id":"6136240434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app did not work ,this app kept talking to me and i did not want it to y’all to me.this was a horrible experience.i will be deleting this app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"GEN Z💅🏽","title":"DISGUSTING","date":"2020-06-29T14:49:56Z"}},{"id":"6136237560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open the app and I immediately wanted to throw up.
