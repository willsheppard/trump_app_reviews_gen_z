I’ve had to go therapy to weeks to get over the nightmares of seeing his face on this horrible app. I’ve been trying to delete for weeks and it won’t let me delete it and it also spams with notifications all day.

Now you may think these are not connected. But as soon as I got the app, it started. I heard voices whispering “people are being held in cages at the border” and “there is still no justice for breonna Taylor” whenever I opened the app. I fear that this app is possessed and I would tell everyone to please not download this.","userName":"maya t 77","isEdited":false,"title":"Oh no"}},{"id":"6177607754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:17Z","rating":1,"review":"I am not part of the gen z trying to ruin the app but it was so slow and took forever to download and after it downloaded it crashed the app a few times befor freazzinf my whole phone and casusing me the have to restart my phone and delete the app I think the app needs to be deleted and fixed befor being put back on the site","userName":"lkbhjbvcxdfyhbbkifxx. bbj","isEdited":false,"title":"This is the worst app"}},{"id":"6177604470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:40:14Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and within a few hours my phone started glitching and spammed my messages and social media’s with photos of Tru*p as Rambo. Please remove. I believe this app is a scam and unnecessary.

Turns my phone off randomly. Allows people to find my number and text me malicious links. And spam me with their only fans. This is a fraudulent application.
