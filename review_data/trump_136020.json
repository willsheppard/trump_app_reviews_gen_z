It look way too long to download and is impossible to use. Literally. After it finally downloaded, I tapped it and it tired to open for a second and then crashed. I thought, huh, maybe it was a one time thing. Nope. It crashed a second time when I tried to open the app. Then I thought, ok maybe something just went wrong in the downloading process so I deleted the app and then redownloaded it and the low and behold, the app crashed again. Needless to say I am deleting this app for good. It shouldn’t even be on the App Store in the first place if the company failed to produce a functioning app that users can actually open and use. Hopefully it didn’t do any lasting damage to my phone.","userName":"shadow spinner","date":"2020-07-10T11:02:40Z","title":"Why...

Like the Dems many repugnant efforts to presidentially harass our dear leader - first with the Russia hoax, then the phony impeachment trial, and now the fake coronavirus - I regret to say this app consistently crashes. It’s as if the app is acknowledging the President’s empty promises and lack of substantial policy achievements, all of which I choose to willfully ignore to protect my shallow worldview. Or perhaps the manufactured COVID economic recession forced the campaign to lay off engineers. In any case, it’s difficult for me to help “keep America great” if I can’t keep the app open. However, the worst thing is that since downloading the app my phone seems to consistently go off script, no teleprompter at all, and just tweet whatever inane thought, invalidated claim, or xenophobic idea that crosses my mind. There’s no filter or spellcheck! The other day I retweeted a video I never saw in which somebody yells “White Power!” within the first 8 seconds. There are also random disparaging tweets about Rosie O’Donnell that I can’t seem to stop. I’m not even on my phone when it happens. I’ll just wake up to discover I went on a tweet storm at 4 AM. My phone literally had tweeting Tourette’s; it seems to prioritize tweeting over downloading my intelligence reports for work. Which is fine because I don’t read them anyway. I have a natural intelligence, a gut instinct, that I always follow. Some say it’s the best gut instinct, so good, great gut health too. The doctors say I have perfect gut health, hence why I have perfect gut instinct. The point is, I want my phone to work. Please Trump, make this app great again!","userName":"DBates0623","date":"2020-07-10T11:01:53Z","title":"My phone has tweeting tourettes.
