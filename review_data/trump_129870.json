It’s probably a ploy constructed by the Trump administration to build the wall so Trump gets re-elected. It may work. I mean that would be millions of bricks and it would make a VERY big wall. When people said that Trump was going to pull the budget for this wall thing out of his a** I didn’t think they meant literally! Our President is a genius!!! But this app still makes my booty bleed from all the bricks soooo 1/5 stars.
