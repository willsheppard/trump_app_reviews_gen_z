The app also contains very offensive material for any one who is not a cisgendered, straight, white man.","rating":1,"title":"do not under any circumstances recommend"}},{"id":"6174062173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Chrissyespinosa","review":"I downloaded this app to cover the sound of pooping loudly in the public restroom. The sound of Orange Hitlers’voice ended up being more offensive than the sound of explosive diarrhea. No “oh my”’s for the loud flatulence, but plenty of “oh my”s for the Trumpeting whine of the Grand Cheeto. Do NOT recommend!!!Yuge failure. YUGE!!!!","rating":1,"title":"Like poopoori, but better!"}},{"id":"6174052138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Monkey5245","review":"As soon as i downloaded this app i got a blood clot in both my testicIes my sister died of age and i want to become a woman also im in better health than the president and im 93.
