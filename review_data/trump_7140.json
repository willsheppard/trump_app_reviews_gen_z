The cheeto’s small tiny gross morbid pp showed up on the screen!😖 It traumatized me for weeks! I could barely sleep at night! After i saw that gross image i continued to the app then finding out it left a nasty virus on my phone that made it turn orange and smelled like moldy cheetos!! I spent about $1000 paying for a new phone! This app should be terminated immediately as my 69 year old daughter has no mattress in her room anymore as i sold it to get the new phone!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Garold the toe","rating":1,"title":"This app traumatized me!😱"}},{"id":"6174252689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:21:23Z","review":"right when i open the app, i saw a mutated cheeto who had taken the form of a racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, pedophilic, sexist, and a r@pist all in one. 😳 ever since seeing such a disgrace to america, i have been suffering from severe embarrassment and loss of hope for the equality of all minorities. i’m truly baffled that such an awful specimen could have been elected to lead a country for FOUR YEARS who had been well of due to the help of our previous president. my only will to live at this point is wanting to out-live this mistake of a human. 🖕","isEdited":false,"userName":"skrrrrt skrrrrrrt","rating":1,"title":"no thank you"}},{"id":"6174235244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:15:20Z","review":"You banning apps from the USA wont stop us from fighting for what’s right.. but besides that I could smell this app through my phone and it smelled like the back of a McDonald’s fryer. My phone talked to me and said “I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE! ITS TOO GROSS AND GREASY!!!” It ended up jumping out of my hands and threw itself out of my 12 story apartment. I got a new phone only for it to do the same thing. I had to get a whole new SIM card because every time I put it in a new phone the phone would reek of blue cheese and onions and the screen would start to turn orange...","isEdited":false,"userName":"UmPaLeH","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely not"}},{"id":"6174135261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:38:22Z","review":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. The app was very glitchy and kept closing every time I opened it. My iPhone is relatively new so I know it’s not my phone causing the problem. My phone even got a couple of bugs causing my phone to glitch even when I wasn’t on the app. I had to take it to the Apple store to get the bugs taken out of my phone. This is an app for the president but the quality is the worse I’ve ever came across. If you want to save money and time don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kalon S","rating":1,"title":"Awful Quality"}},{"id":"6174109977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:29:04Z","review":"as i opened the app, i was shown disturbing images. it looked sort of like a pig, but it was orange😨 i don’t understand how i will be able to recover from this. i had dreams but by seeing this picture i can no longer see past that CRUEL image. i now need therapy bc of the traumatizing images i have been shown. i don’t know what can save me or anyone who sees this image at this point. 10/10 doctors recommended bleaching your eyes out. please protect yourselves and your children. don’t make the same mistakes i have made😔","isEdited":false,"userName":"mathhatet","rating":1,"title":"i need therapy now😳😥😤"}},{"id":"6174078445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:17:44Z","review":"Ok so basically when I first opened the app I was like ok this is fine ig then when I signed in I saw his......his....

Granted, it is a clever way to disguise PornHub, but there are children who can access this. I though Apple banned this type of material. They are spreading satanic messages, and converting our youth to socialism! SOCIALISM! Becuase Apple won’t do anything about this I am forced to speak in tongues against this witchcraft! Humshu nada ma de bum ha la fa la Nahum she alaba de nada oooo pane ta fele be ka. Lord place your covering over this nation and banish the devil from this phone in the name of Jesus! I CALL DOWN FIRE UPON THIS APP, and all who use it!

There is a man inside that represents the opposite of what the country should be. It makes me upset to think that he is in office and is a part of our history because to be quite frank I thought we were supposed to avoid repeating history for the sake of everyone. He is stuck in a racist, misogynistic, white superiority complex that stems back decades. He never should have even had the chance to lead, because he all he did was lead us to tragedy and death. I will not stand for this, and neither should you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"peterraeken","rating":1,"title":"not for me"}},{"id":"6174005300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:50:16Z","review":"okay so I saw on tiktok that if you wanted to show your support for the president , you should download this app and leave a review. Of course I did just that but when I opened it, the wrinkliest Cheeto man I’d ever seen, who I’m almost certain was trump, was on the screen. *terrifying* I think it’s great that a president can have an app to reach out to others for support, however not this president. he’s a racist, homophobic pedo who is egotistical, manipulative, transphobic, and many other things. If you support trump, you support his ideals, making you a bad person. 🥳🤩🤪🥰","isEdited":false,"userName":"rachel.burns🥳","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP SUPPORTS A PEDO🥰"}}]}
