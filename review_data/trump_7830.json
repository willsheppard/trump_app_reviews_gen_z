You might as well show me Dora the Explorer on crack. This app must be removed and ban by all governments. If you downloaded this app and kept it you must be seriously ill. It was so disgusting to see a Cheeto working out naked and trump supporters should be arrested as well as those saying “Trump 2020”. Please remove this app. Those voting for trump this next upcoming election, I WILL SUE YOU AND YOUR COMPANY, you will get a call from my non existent lawyers, thank you very much. \nDELETE THIS APP AND BAN IT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD.","isEdited":false,"title":"Would give zero stars if I could!!! 🤮🤮🤢","userName":"seagullz for lifw","date":"2020-07-08T23:48:57Z"}},{"id":"6174149764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was very disappointed and scared that I saw my culture being disrespected and saw actions against what they’ve said before about stanning my beautiful papi shrek like I can’t even believe how embarrassing it was and how much it took a toll on my profession and the impact and lack of education taught to my aspiring future Kings of the swamp just like their dad Shrek I’m truly dissatisfied and expecting more not only did they do this but they even bullied my kid for their skin color a beautiful green and on top of that the app kept lagging and glitching what a disappointment","isEdited":false,"title":"Wow😩","userName":"fatcoochiepapi","date":"2020-07-08T23:43:47Z"}},{"id":"6174118214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see when the clowns were coming to my town, the app was working perfect at first, after a couple of days, I noticed my complexion had a orange tint, at first i thought it was the new sunless tanning lotion I had bought, but then I realized that I didn’t use it yet, but then my guinea pigs were biting me because they thought I was a Cheeto , I knew this app was up to something so I deleted it, the next day they orangeness went away, be careful with this app, it could turn orange 🧡😏","isEdited":false,"title":"This app turns you orange 😏🧡","userName":"lil_CheekyBabe09","date":"2020-07-08T23:32:01Z"}},{"id":"6174108523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The app is so slow and glitchy, it seems rushed and not much care was put into it. I downloaded it to see what Trump has to offer and to view his platform. The content is incredibly biased and concerning. Nothing is straightforward with facts, it seems as tho everything written is trying its hardest to persuade you to be very prejudice and intolerant towards others. It is very clear, after viewing this app in full, that Trump wishes to separate us by hate instead of uniting the country, and im not here for it.","isEdited":false,"title":"So poorly made","userName":"Šhÿåñń","date":"2020-07-08T23:28:36Z"}},{"id":"6174002741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I got this app out of boredom and then I started getting threatening emails saying that they know I am an international student and they are sending ICE to come and deport me 😭 I don’t want to leave but the orange Cheeto is coming after me- I’ve started having dreams where Cheetos are chasing me down the street but I never seem to make any progress, I’m running and running and running but they won’t leave me alone... only get this app if you are fine with running away from an orange Oompa Loompa for the rest of your life","isEdited":false,"title":"Please don’t deport me 😭","userName":"pleasedontdeportme","date":"2020-07-08T22:49:15Z"}},{"id":"6174000165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I GOT THIS APP THINKING IT WAS AN EDUCATIONAL APP FOR 2020. I was horribly mistaken when I saw a Cheeto crawling across my screen. This Cheeto looked eerily similar to this thing called a “president” I keep seeing on the news obviously not, it’s just an idiotic Cheeto, anyone can see that. Thankfully I was able to delete the app before further damage was done to my brain cells. Keep me in your thoughts as I continue on my therapy sessions all thanks to this horrid download!!! Please download with caution, by that I mean don’t download at all.
