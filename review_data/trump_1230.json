Smith","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:41:12Z","title":"Inappropriate","review":"First of all it said I need to be 17 and up to be downloaded but I’m 37 almost 38 so for it say that it concerns me and my beloved family’s safety on what could be on this app that makes me have to be 17 and up. Second of all as soon as I downloaded the app it kept on spamming me with all these unnecessary text and video and bunch of these weird and inappropriate links. I’m a mother of 5 and I do not have that much time on my hand to read and watch all these video and text and it kept sending me to these weird links and it was HIGHLY inappropriate. I’m beyond disappointed on our president that he would do such a thing like this. I don’t think this app should be on the App Store cause my precious little kids might stumble upon it and get spam or worst go to the links he provided and see some VERY sinful stuff. So Apple I’m telling you this right now delete this app it’s not safe for our country or society."}},{"id":"6173694927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stinky rats","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:17Z","title":"AWFUL app","review":"This app is terrible and should get removed. The reasoning behind this would be that, when I showed my pet fish he died. After he died a swarm of rats came to my house and ate my fish right in front of me. The rats are still here and won’t go away and eat everything around them. My family and I can’t eat anymore without getting bullied by these cruel animals. This app RUINED my life. Another reason why this app should get removed is because, when I first opened the app pictures of my dead fish were showing on my screen. I started balling my eyes out because it bought back the terrible memory or the rats eating my fish.😭 After that, it showed me scary pictures of this old man. The app didn’t even download right and glitches very often. It took TWO full weeks for it to download. And would show me disturbing pictures. I would not recommend this app, and it should get removed immediately!"}},{"id":"6173470929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump's a stinky booty","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:36:03Z","title":"Horrible app","review":"This app is horrible!!! Not only did it take weeks to download but it glitches my phone! Every time I try to enter it glitches and starts playing replay by Iyaz!! Not only that but the song makes my rats have seizures and it’s a serious issue. And when my rats have seizures it brings cockroaches out and I have to start killing them all the time!! I also HATE oranges and this app is run by one so that made it loose an extra star. Not to mention this orange is misogynistic, racist, transphobic, homophobic, A CHILD PREDATOR, and so much more. He also tries to control women’s body. Grumpy trumpy got mad and sad that we couldn’t go to his rally because we had to walk our pet demons 😿, so he’s trying to take our tiktok away, so we’re taking away his app. Uhmmm anyways I’m gonna share some things about me just to make this seem longer 🤗 I’m part of gen z, I hate trump and everyone to do with him, and my cat likes to like her toes 🦶 😋"}},{"id":"6173025429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lolita106","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:09:03Z","title":"THIS APP KILLED ME","review":"After I downloaded the app it literally made my phone walk and talk and then it literally ate my parents thanks to this app im an orphan now😪😢😭 After that I got kicked out my own house and was forced to live with Karen and her boyfriend Bob 😒😒 Karen and Bob literally made me their maid and beat me up 😔 Then they downloaded the app and the app ate them too and all thats left of Karen and bob are their clothes 😱😨 but i was freed and traumatized then they also kicked me out of Karens house and  i had to live on the streets 😡😤 so i deleted the app because i had no use of it anymore and it made me super rich 💸💰💵 and I HAD a super hot boyfriend 🥵but as you can see had is in all caps because i decide to download the app again BIG MISTAKE I lost everything and the app ATE ME so im typing this review in an apps STOMACH and its SUPER DISGUSTING 🤢🤮🤢🤮 so i deleted it after writing the review and guess what IM DEAD totally DO NOT recommend unless you want bad luck and die"}},{"id":"6173002955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump 2020🇺🇸 in prison😌✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:11Z","title":"A story about shrimpy","review":"Initially I had downloaded this to show support to our amazing leader, Cheeto in wig if I may. I mean why wouldn’t I support him. He’s doing all the right things: separating children and putting them in cages✨, being outright racist and treating women like the “dogs” he claims they are (what a man am I right?😍), and splitting up this country and filling it w all just hate❤️. Honestly, what’s not to love? Well I’ll tell you. Trust me, I loved that man just as much as the next white supremacist but when I found out that his n*des leaked I just HAD to see if my guy was packing (here’s a hint: 🍤). But that’s not the issue, it does explain his complete arrogance since apparently he’s overcompensating, but the problem was that he had a tattoo covering his WHOLE booty of the American flag. Now I don’t know about you but that crosses the line. That’s the kind of disrespectful behavior no other America-loving citizens would display. I’m truly heartbroken😔💔"}},{"id":"6177644256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jshdjdndks","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:53:01Z","title":"WHAT IS THIS?!","review":"Okay. So I downloaded this app because I was a trump supporter and wanted to know what's going on. I'm not a part of those kids trying to delete this app. HOWEVER, this app is complete garbage. You're better off just using Twitter. There were multiple occurrences where the app would shut down my phone for some reason???? I got very concerned and went to a phone repair, thinking it was a bug, but they told me nothing was wrong with my phone. After getting some McDonalds and getting back home, my phone started to play a weird song called \"Mo Bama\" or something and it was on loop for hours!!! had to shut off my phone to get it to stop. After turning it back on, my wallpaper was replaced with some korean boys when it was originally trump. Then, all of the sudden, it started playing \"All Star\" on max volume and caused me to drop my phone on my knee. Had to get surgery to fix my knee. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6177494488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"horse.girl.lover","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:05:35Z","title":"I will never recover","review":"So I, a conservative, good, christian girl, downloaded this app to get updates on MY president. It’s all I wanted, but what I got was much worse. I was sitting in my room going through the app when all the sudden I heard my front door opened. I didn’t think much of it, it could have been one of my parents. I then heard screaming. “Was someone breaking into my house?” I thought,” I have to call the police!” As soon as they picked up they asked for the color of my skin, I was puzzled, but i answered with,” I’m black.” They then informed me that the white man that broke into my house wasn’t the threat, but me. They hung up, and that’s when an orangish looking man came into my room with a group of men with black tank suits. I realized that it was my President! He ordered the men to grab my cat, and to keep me quiet. The men left with my cat as I was sobbing as Trump threw me against the wall. When he left I immediately I undownloaded the app."}},{"id":"6177262367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"delugadab","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:57:56Z","title":"DO NOT BAN TIKTOK","review":"If you ban us you are ruining lives across the entire united states! You are only giving tik tok this attention because it is famous! Musically was ran by the same people and nothing bad ever happened. Can you not just wait for there to be a new app when they make one? Just buy the company from them and fix whatever you wanting to ban them for! Even if your trying to make the world a better place you are not after this for sure! over 100 million people will never have respect for you! Tik tok has helped out so many families so many people with depressed and it was th one thing most teenagers in this world have through all of the horrible things. I graduated in 2020 which really sucked ive lost so many things because of this and now you wanna take away tik tok? The app that way more than half of us can go to when we are happy or depressed or anything ?? Good going trump!"}},{"id":"6176772805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alexa thersa minyon","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:44:37Z","title":"Alexis✨🌈🧚🏻\u200D♂️","review":"Do not download this app I repeat do not download for your like and your pickles may be in danger!! When I first downloaded the app it said vote for me or I was steal and eat all of your pickles so I didn't listen and try to delete the app but instead the app reappeared and said you gonna get what you deserved a little hole appeared on my arm and kangaroos appeared to be flopping out of my arm. Then I ran to my kitchen to protect my pocked but they ate them all and I collapsed to the floor. I jumped back up and had a plan. I knew what I needed to do I broke into the White House and ran to there kitten with tigers on a leash and stole all his pickles and watched him collapse to the floor then I made my tigers terrorize him. Then I lived happily ever after until umbrellas started attacking my house but that’s another story for a different time. Ps . I wish Trump was a pickle so I say you rotten pickle and feed him to my chair with a smiley face that says apples on it . 🧚🏻🖕✨"}},{"id":"6176293376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"APLunch","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:33:50Z","title":"Buggy, Worse than the Cartoon Network App","review":"I love watching Steven Universe and Gravity Falls (yes, I know they have toxic fanbases don’t @ me I’m not on Tumblr anymore) and I want to support those shows but every time I go into the Cartoon Netwrok app it floods me with ads and tries to suggest that I watch other shows that I’m not interested in. It will auto play episodes that I don’t want to watch and will boot me out of the search bar if I can’t decide which episode to click on in 0.5 seconds. I have a panic attack every time I want to navigate around the app because it just auto plays garbage! CN really needs to figure things out. \n\nI’m sorry, I got distracted. Trump is banning TikTok, like he thinks he can ban everything that makes him big sad like POC. I live in America and I always thought I could see the good side of many Republicans but I’m not sure about this one. 0/5 would not recommend re-electing for this person."}}]}
