She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go. \n\nShe closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. \n\nAnd then... her eyes snap open. \n\nShe raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood.
