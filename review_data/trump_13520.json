I was reading manga as usual and then tried to check the app while trying to read some quality manga. When I read the next chapter, my favorite character died! This is HIS fault because when I check the app before, it mentioned something about death! Truly unforgivable. We will never forget Genya dying and making me and many others sob BECAUSE of this app. Shame on you."}},{"id":"6178777139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"R_Cortez 😐","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-10T00:32:29Z","review":"Absolutely horrible app. I just wanted to root for #45, but his app has been making my phone crash nonstop. Im getting visual glitches now and got a message saying my phone has been hijacked. Extremely disappointed that I can’t admire our presidents extremely HIGH IQ and unbiased statements on police brutality and black lives matter. If I could rate this app 0/10 I would. I guess I’ll just have to go back to Faux news."}},{"id":"6178619820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mitty-k","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump tried, I’ll give him that","date":"2020-07-09T23:31:32Z","review":"You know, to support our president, I wanted to download this wonderful app. Boy was I wrong. It took literal hours to download, and every time I try to open it my phone crashes!! Is this some sort of sick game??? Was it the liberals who made the app??? Are they trying to discourage our pride in our country??? Who knows, but we should take down this app for being such an inconvenience to us all."}},{"id":"6178593038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vrhdbdbf","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is dangerous!!!","date":"2020-07-09T23:20:52Z","review":"After a few second of downloading this app my phone stared turning orange and Cheetos would appear in my screen. It also indeed gave my phone a virus not one but 4. I am so angry and flabbergasted but the quality of this app! Never have I ever experienced something like this. I’m beyond disappointed!! If I could leave a 0 star review I would. Please me be safe and never get this app !! Donald why have you done 😔"}},{"id":"6178547690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The_dancing_lines_lover","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app","date":"2020-07-09T23:03:09Z","review":"This is an absolutely horrible app I’ve tried many times to download only for it to not even let me go in the app and immediately kick me out. After about hours of trying I finally got in to THE WORST quality ever. It was extremely glitchy I would have to slide out of the app screen every time I wanted click or slide on something. Honestly very disappointed in this app 😒"}},{"id":"6178516560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LylaMircale","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Waste of storage","date":"2020-07-09T22:50:44Z","review":"I got this app and my phone instantly started to crash I took it to get fixed and there was nothing I could do so I got a new phone and tried it again and this time I got over 200 phone calls in under a minute this app for some reason wouldn’t allow me to delete and now I am stuck with it and there’s nothing I can do do now waste your storage with this app DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6178505475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lizzynorton","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App EVER!!","date":"2020-07-09T22:46:19Z","review":"I was very excited to support TRUMP2020 by downloading this app and loading my shopping cart with merchandise, but unfortunately I will be deleting this app IMMEDIATE. The app is slow, hard to navigate and I started getting those Russian bot calls as soon as I entered my phone number on the opening screen- SAD! Why do I get Russian calls after downloading app? Nonsense!!! I am not Russia- I am AMERICAN! Land of the FREE AND HOME OF THE BRAVE! Very disappointed in this app and the Russian spied!"}},{"id":"6178490358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Renam2124","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Lots of glitches","date":"2020-07-09T22:40:15Z","review":"I’m so disappointed in this app. Ever since I downloaded it and made an account, my phone has been glitching a lot. The app spammed me with a lot of notifications even after I clicked “no” when it asked me “would you like Trump 2020 to send you notifications?”. My phone is ruined now. The battery health is poor because of that app. It’s like downloading a virus. Please don’t install this app!"}},{"id":"6178338080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RarelyMarilyn","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I had to go to the hospital for this 😭😱","date":"2020-07-09T21:41:13Z","review":"So I downloaded the app because I was curious, right? WELL IT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA. I usually have panic attacks whenever I see oranges and guess what. There was a freaking orange on my screen and yes, I fainted. THANKS. My family was really worried when I woke up in the hospital after. I do not recommend this app it makes you throw up, have corona, have trauma for the rest of your life, AND DIE!!!! Do not get the app if you want to die. Worst app EVER 🤢🤢"}},{"id":"6178311039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"anonymous🥰😁🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Take away this app","date":"2020-07-09T21:31:06Z","review":"Tik tok is the best app on this planet and is this generations escape from social anxiety, the harsh reality of the world, and depressing times. And Trumps first priority is to take this away from us? Not to help end the worldwide deathly pandemic or help with the many other economic issues in our country? You’re telling me his hobbies are golfing and taking away happiness from children? Take this app away and take this president away. We don’t want him🧚\u200D♀️"}}]}
