Once it finally downloaded after 69 weeks, my phone completely froze. It was stuck, the screen was not touch accesible and I thought my phone was broken. I started to have a breakdown because I thought I would have to obtain a new phone and I’ve already been through 3. After a minute goes by, my room gets dark.. there’s a breeze that was getting stronger and stronger.. everything on my shelves fall off.. the house starts rumbling.. all of the sudden a huge, nauseating figure that had an aggressive orange tone to it bulged out from my screen... yes, OUT! It stood before my tear-filled eyes. I was sitting in the corner of my room pinching myself to see if this was a nightmare, but it sadly was not. I wanted to scream but nothing came out. I was trembling in fear.. I thought my father was scary but this topped it. Before I could say a word, he grabbed a golf club out of his anus and started to attack me with it. I knew I had to fight back. My eyes were scavenging around my room for an object within reach to defend myself with. Then I saw it. With all my strength I threw the Mexican flag at him. He was horrified, but it didn’t completely knock him down to his little knees. What I did next, I had no idea if it was going to work or not. But as they say, “you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take”. I screamed, “HEY SIRI PLAY REGGAETON”. Yes.. yes.. it was working! The orange beast was withering away!! He was clenching his ears while screaming, he couldn’t take it. Since it took a while for his ginormous body to degrade I went and made some popcorn. When I came back he was almost gone, and as his last seconds of being a racist were in light, he squealed, “GRAB EM BY THE P*SSY”... he was now gone. I had defeated him.","title":"Horrid","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🌚bootyboo"}},{"id":"6177685795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:06:20Z","review":"TERRIBLE APP so many glitches and don’t u dare delete tiktok","title":"terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"tikky105"}},{"id":"6177677141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:03:38Z","review":"Terrible app terrible person","title":"Garbage","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Xman2k"}},{"id":"6177654874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:56:25Z","review":"kept making my phone crash, it is ruining my device","title":"horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cheetos <3"}},{"id":"6177651432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:18Z","review":"The app kinda has a weird smell to it, not to mention a very pungent after taste...","title":"TikTok 😹😹🙈🙈","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hannah sofia m."}}]}
