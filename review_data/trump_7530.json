The app even explained to me that every time someone downloads it a peach man puts the US in another trillion dollars of debt. Not to mention it took 219 hours to download this app on my brand new iPhone 11. Which is about 9 days. I wish the app would download as fast as this man fires people. Maybe just stick to your little hotel. If that even works out like the wall did. It just shows that business people can’t run an app or a country.","userName":"Rorie_","title":"Awful App","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:07:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176603548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the most difficult thing I’ve ever worked. My phone has stopped working and I cannot turn it on. I just want to know why the App Store would allow this app on the market when it ruins phones! As a Karen I KNOW that I deserve the best apps on my phone. I demand to speak to the manager of the App Store. This is ridiculous! How can a president have an app that doesn’t work and target people. I think this app is stealing my data and I need this taken off the App Store for mine and everyone’s security. Praise be.","userName":"Karen Rules 2020","title":"Trump 2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:59:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176588229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app broke my phone. 🤢It deleted everything on it too. Im pretty sure it gave me a virus. Not to mention it took over a week to install completely. I dont know how someone could make such a bad app🥺. After i got my phone to work I deleted it. Everything repaired magically. I went through out my day and when i tried to leave my house the FBI showed up threatening to kill the world if i didn’t install it again. Of i didn't because we all gonna die anyway from 2020.😏","userName":"9002156","title":"A disappointment","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176518187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Where to even start. This app made me PAY to download and said if I didn’t download it, they would send Jonathan Galindo to my house to play the whale challenge with me. So of course for me and my family’s safety I downloaded it. After I got the app and opened it. it filled with very inappropriate adds. my kids use my phone and if they open that and they cannot see that type of stuff. This app took my personal information and my credit card number and made me very poor. I don’t recommend.","userName":"🍷⛓🚬🕸🔪","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:36:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176512981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i usually don’t like to write reviews but i felt i needed to share my story. as soon as i downloaded this app, my phone started to break down. trump hacked my phone and stole all of my data. the only way i could fix my phone, he said, was to vote for him! 🤬 i could never!!! he also replaced all credible. news source apps on my phone with fox news, and replaced all photos in my camera roll with the same picture of him naked getting a spray tan 🤮🤮🤮 please beware and do not download this horrible app!!!","userName":"Nick blute","title":"BEWARE OF THIS APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:35:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176421134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Once I installed this app my phone INSTANTLY started to crash and glitch out. U have had multiple phones over the years and I have never seen anything like this. Once I downloaded this my phone started to over heat and the screen started to flash black and white. I was surprised to see my screen turn black considering how much trump hated black people but then again if this is his plan to ruin a young person of colors phone then congratulations because you sir HAVE succeeded.","userName":"Alex🤭💖✌🏾","title":"This destroyed my phone","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:09:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176321800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was not what I expected it to be😳as soon as I downloaded this app my phone blacked out & when I turned it back on Igor several strange calls,and text. So I decided to answer a call and it said vote trump 2020 you dirty negro!and that was very rude In my opinion,and that’s not where it stops! The next day the police showed up to my house and threatened to take my parents away if they didn’t vote for trump! I just think that if your a person of color or you don’t support trump to not download this app.🙈","userName":"hstcg","title":"Foreigner💕","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:42:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175942956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I honestly dont like this app it took forever to download then when it did 3 months later when i would go somewhere people would throw orange things at me and like he i a very bad influence and like this app is hanted at soon as the app loaded in it wiped out my stuff and gave me a bunch of viruses and i could not use my phone no more i had to buy a new one and i feel like this orange cheeto puff should no be in our presence the sinsons havent failed us yet and it showed me his lil wewe i cant see no more bc i cryed my eyes out😭","userName":"azia valdez","title":"Ahhhh help","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:43:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175866602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is absolute garbage. Do not download this app it will cause your phone to overheat with stupidity. Your phone will constantly fall behind the couch or your bed and you won’t be able to reach it. If you download this app your phone will fall when you get out of the car and shatter the screen. It’s not worth it. I never thought supporting our president would be so destructive and create a hostile environment with just one app. Please spare yourself and your phone and make better choices. Thank you!!","userName":"friesz5","title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:18:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175764773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a fortnight, two weeks or 14 days, to download. When I opened it, I couldn’t believe that an app like this was FREE. THE app should not be free, because it does so much, but all of it poorly. If done right it could be an INTERNATIONAL success. The fact that it is not is CRIMINAL. I hope this app will COURT success in the future. This app is nowhere near at the END of its development and we should wait for it to be done before getting it. I hope one day THE app will be good but it is not. Let us not put SANCTIONS on its success, but encourage it.","userName":"Study Stync","title":"Terrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:43:51Z","isEdited":false}}]}
