After opening, the app deleted all the data off my phone, started glitching out, my lights flickered on and off, and my cat got run over by a car. I don’t think this is a coincidence. There is some sort of ghost attached to this app so please DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want to be haunted for the rest of your life. \n-a concerned trump supporter","userName":"Ujala15","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T19:17:24Z"}},{"id":"6177735532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to see the wonders of a man who only cares about himself.  However, after downloading it, the app possessed my phone! I am very disappointed with this turn of events as I just wanted to see a man complain about other people being treated equally! DO NOT download this app, it will give your phone a virus. What is that virus you may ask? Stupidity.","userName":"Marie884927","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed 😪","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:20Z"}},{"id":"6177708008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all this app made my phone crash, second, and much more importantly, upon opening the app there was this disgusting looking  orange oompa lomos who popped up right away. Unfortunately my little sister was looking at my phone when this happened, and she has had nightmares about this hideous monster for a week straight. Wish I could give zero stars.","userName":"dope1243","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is awful :(","date":"2020-07-09T18:13:06Z"}},{"id":"6177695185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i opened this app, excited to see our amazing president and help him with his journey into 2024, and was shocked to find a racist homophobic xenophobic idiotic cheeto in the place of our dear president obama. do not download this app unless you want to spend thousands on therapy and reconstructive surgery not only for the state of the republic, but for your eyes as well, after being forced to see the grotesquely orange walking blob of diabetes that is somehow our president.","userName":"anyone but cheeto 2020","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISGOSTANG","date":"2020-07-09T18:09:14Z"}},{"id":"6177664465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had high hopes for this app, but I am extremely disappointed by it. But what do you expect it is run by trump, everything he is in control of is ✨garbage✨. I was told that when you first open the app Matthew Gray Gubler would appear on your screen and show you around the app. Well that didn’t happen. Also, the app was so unorganized and cluttered and eww. 0/10 this app is the worst.","userName":"perioddddddddddd","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T17:59:34Z"}},{"id":"6177627941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app I completely got scared! This Orange Cheeto in a human male form popped up and scared me and my dog half to death! It was the ugliest thing my eyes have ever seen! After losing my sight for a couple minutes and giving my dog CPR, the app started glitching like crazy. Glitch glitch glitch. Just like that!This app is trash just like that nasty Orange Cheeto!

Ever since I got the app my phone has been acting odd in general. I believe this app but a bug on my phone and now the government can listen and see what I do on my phone. What kind of business man has such a horrible app? I’ll be voting blue in November. Very disappointed.","userName":"bdudhfhehd","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP!!!

I tried to get it fixed at the Apple store when I couldn’t fix it. When i got to the store all the employees said there was only one man for the job but employee was a old man in a Trump 2020 hat and he took my phone and threw it at the wall and called my a dirty liberal. - 10/10","userName":"lily😋😜","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not swag money","date":"2020-07-09T17:26:59Z"}},{"id":"6177561788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My whole phone crashed after using the app and I had to get a new one.
