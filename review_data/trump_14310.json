They took my ramen noodles, my anime body pillow, and worst of all they took FRANCIS. Francis is my pet rock, whom I loved dearly. I can’t believe that they would use Francis to destroy my computer then throw him out the window. Francis fell into the highway and was pummeled by government officials’ cars. Please, take down this app. Justice for Francis!!!!!!!","userName":"IBANDWKES","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:30:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175355470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MY WHOLE FAMILY NOW HAS CHLAMYDIA","review":"I downloaded this app to feed my inner racism and misogyny and it very much helped. But then my phone contracted the West Nile virus and gave it to my dog. So I put the my phone to my no no square and had a great time (which all trump supporters do) and then I contracted CHLAMYDIA. This really put a damper on the fun my sister and cousin were going to have later tonight (which all Trump supporters do on a regular basis) so this app TOTALLY BLOWS.\n                                        - Barbz For Bernie","userName":"AveryBeck","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:12:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175332243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"luv from genZ🦋✨","review":"okayokay sooo this app is sooo terrible it keeps running slow or every time i try to open it...it always logs me out of my account or this app is very frustrating and annoying idk if it needs a update or something but it was this one time it glitch out and started showing me naked pictures of CHILDREN!!!! please please from the bottom of my cold heart don’t download this anyways have a good day :)))✨💕💕✨💕💕","userName":"magnolia<3","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:03:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175245827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wow","review":"U know trump u look like a mosquito 🦟🦗yo wrinkly built self looking like somebody wood flooring  wit that fake hair piece u got and yo wife don’t like u cuz when she wit u she never smiles but when she gone she happy and she going to leave yo hot dog looking self oh and u wanna band TikTok cuz u get the most hate there ok watch that’s why MY president mr Obama going to be President and u going to be a regular person so there for someone can come up to u and be like bop bop up side the head \n\nThank you for ur time🦟","userName":"kallidream","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:29:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175225507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app on any App Store","review":"This app is extremely slow, it doesn’t like to work at all..... it kicks me off every time that I go onto it. Since I’ve gotten the app my phone hasn’t been working right. Sometimes I can turn on my phone at all it’s really annoying. I don’t recommend getting this app if you don’t want to buy a entire new phone.
