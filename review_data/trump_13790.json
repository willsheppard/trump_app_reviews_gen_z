Don’t get me wrong, I love this app, however that night when I was sleeping our dear president came into my house and KIDNAPPED me. When I woke up I had a mind control device on my head and was being forced to say “Trump is love, Trump is life” over and over while being forcefed Cheeto Puffs. Long story short, I’m now braindead and haven’t seen my family in 15 years.","title":"Good app, however I was kidnapped.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trump's a fascist 🤩"}},{"id":"6177731704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:20:13Z","review":"DISGUSTING \nIf I could do no stars I would.\nI 𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐞 this app. I was just trying to educate myself and then BAM I’m appalled by what I saw! \nWhy do I have to put my phone number in????\nThat makes no sense and is an invasion of my privacy!

Trump will be doing in the so called “future” of this country, sadly I could not have seen that information because of how clustered the app was and very hard to navigate. As the so called “future” maybe try making to app a little better so I can see if we even have one while your running it.

It’s been playing for 10 days straight now and the sound is now attracting cats to my house. I have about 67 cats in my front yard and it’s all because of this horrible app. Oh and the app promotes racism because our ✨cheeto president✨is a white supremacist. He’s also trying to silence Gen Z which will never happen. We will not stop.","title":"the worst app ever 👁👄👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Bernie Minaj"}}]}
