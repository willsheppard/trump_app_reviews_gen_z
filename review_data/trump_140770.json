The app started slowing my phone down greatly; and I didn’t even open it. Every time I try to delete the app, it takes me back to when I first downloaded it. I’m stuck in this endless loop. I don’t even know if my review will be seen. If you are reading this, DO 👏🏽 NOT 👏🏽 DOWNLOAD 👏🏽 THIS 👏🏽 APP!!! Proceed with caution if you choose to download it! I don’t know how long I’ve been repeating the same day! It’s scaring me! It feels like Groundhog’s Day but worse.
