I was perfectly healthy before I was born last month until my mother downloaded this terrible app. It was so toxic it lead to several congenital defects. I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs and every night I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep. And president tr*mp claims to be pro life😔.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6141523194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-30T21:43:52Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE CURSED","userName":"adoptmykid","review":"Once I opened this app I immediately felt kicking in my stomach I CAN NOT be pregnant so I took a test and I was!😡 I didn’t know who the dad was I just gave up!

This excitement turned to true despair after I downloaded it. As soon as the download completed, my entire phone started to glitch. Soon, instant combustion!
