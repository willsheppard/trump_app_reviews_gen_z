You can’t find a bigger fan then me. This app is very concerning though. BE CAREFUL!! It violates your privacy on every level. I started receiving disturbing messages from the app claiming to be our wonderful saint of a president as well. He was telling me to send him naughty pictures and I would just never. I don’t know who created this horrible app but I’m sure it’s a fake. Donald would never do such a thing. \n\nDownload at your own risk!!!!","title":"For Bunker Boi"}},{"id":"6088563659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"generation Z 😘","date":"2020-06-17T19:40:59Z","review":"I accidentally clicked download on this app when an add popped up, that was strike one. Then when it finished downloading I thought I might as well check it out, and you will not believe what I saw when I got there! It was an orange man with corn hair on his head (strike 2), and something about how he’s our president 🤮(strike 3). I’m sorry but a president that allows people to be kept in cages, looses 3,000 children, and has them tear gassed every 30 minutes, is not my president! 😕","title":"Horrendous App!"}},{"id":"6075483032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Shameful!!!","date":"2020-06-14T17:10:07Z","review":"At first I was so excited to see a colorful app with the most beautiful graphics and symbols of our great country.  Then I downloaded it and was immediately asked for all of my personal data and for money!  Is this just a way for the campaign to get money???  I don’t appreciate that.  I thought it was to show support and get engaged but I was wrong.  Don’t bother getting the app u less you’re looking for a way to donate.  😟","title":"From elated to disappointed"}},{"id":"6177805721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"take.the.app.down.","date":"2020-07-09T18:42:31Z","review":"I give it a one star review because I am apart of gen-z Community and tik tok has the rights to not be banned just cause of trump we all have rights of freedom so do animals and apps on the play store and apple store this is a very bad app I do not suggest to use it it’s the worst app ever it should be deleted because all of our reviews most people’s reviews are 1 star and this app has the worst reviews then any other app help us bring tik tok back and shut down this app!","title":"Tik tok review"}},{"id":"6177623270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ijessielove","date":"2020-07-09T17:46:15Z","review":"Oh, we're not gonna take it\nNo, we ain't gonna take it\nOh, we're not gonna take it anymore\nWe've got the right to choose it\nThere ain't no way we'll lose it\nThis is our life, this is our song\nWe'll fight the powers that be, just\nDon't pick our destiny 'cause\nYou don't know us, you don't belong\nOh, we're not gonna take it\nNo, we ain't gonna take it\nOh, we're not gonna take it anymore\nOh, you're so condescending\nYour gall is never ending\nWe don't want nothin', not a thing from you\nYour life is trite and jaded\nBoring and confiscated\nIf that's your best, your best won't do\nWhoa, oh oh\nWhoa, oh oh\nWe're right (yeah)\nWe're free (yeah)\nWe'll fight (yeah)\nYou'll see (yeah)\nWhoa, whoa, we're not gonna take it\nNo, we ain't gonna take it\nOh, we're not gonna take it anymore…","title":"Horrible!!!"}},{"id":"6177605924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bclyde","date":"2020-07-09T17:40:42Z","review":"First thing I saw when I opened the app was my sleep paralysis demon!

The interface makes no sense and I could not find anything the way I should be able to. Would not reccomend this app and am honestly starting to rethink who to support in the upcoming election.","title":"Terrible app to navigate!!"}},{"id":"6177575809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"gracierubes","date":"2020-07-09T17:31:04Z","review":"hey, barb here. I don’t hate because I love all, unless you’re homophobic, racist, prolife, misogynistic, xenophobic, a straight white male, etc. but this app is HORRIBLE!! I died because of it! I was just taking my fish for a walk then I fell off the Eiffel Tower!! Thanks to this trump app! It’s killing us! My soul is hurting because of the damages I received when I died! I hate it here. Plz remove this app, it’s gross. It’s not even worthy of 1 star.

It’s literally stupid. But, this app is making my phone delete some apps and stuff, even my photos. Some photos were from my grandpa, who passed away a couple weeks ago. Those pictures were special. And I don’t have them anymore. I literally hate this app now. I was gonna help with the election, but it’s not letting me press the stupid buttons.","title":"Why did it delete al my data?"}}]}
