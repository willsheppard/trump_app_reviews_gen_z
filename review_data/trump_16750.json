But let’s talk about the downloading proses, every time I downloaded it, it totally shut off my phone and the app was not there. I did this for a while and then just let it be, when I came back the app was there. I would never buy this app unless it’s to rate it with a 1 star.

This app bogged my phone with irrelevant ads, useless notifications, and frankly fake news. Nothing about this app could ever represent America or its citizens in the positive and informative fashion that TikTok does. The Trump 2020 app only displays inaccuracies solely benefiting ignorant narcissists and the unfortunate victims caught in their web of lies.","title":"The Go-to App for Ignorant Narcissists","isEdited":false,"userName":"MichelleK42702","rating":1}},{"id":"6177140683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:23:12Z","review":"I downloaded this app it took so much time do download but it finally did so while it was downloading I took my pets bat and fish for a walk then when I opened the app I saw a oompah loompah that looked like a Cheeto I got so scared that i closed the app and a green dragon was looking at me trough the window so I deleted the app and now the dragon is my pet his name is Donald in name of our non racist, rapist president so DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.🧚🏿\u200D♀️💜🧜🏿\u200D♀️❤️💅🏿💕","title":"Don’t download this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Me 🧚🏿\u200D♀️💅🏿","rating":1}},{"id":"6177120624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:17:40Z","review":"I recently downloaded this application to try and understand the psychopath running for office, but after I downloaded it and logged in, I got multiple notifications that my ssn and credit card numbers were all stolen and used immediately oversees.

It kicked me out of the app multiple times, it killed my phone battery, it also installed a virus onto my phone.
