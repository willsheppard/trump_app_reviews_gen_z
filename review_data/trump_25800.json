It may be so bad because it is associated with Donald trump. My suggestion is to elect a new president preferably smarter, maturer, a better leader, and one that is not sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. I predict we can “make America great again” without an orange as our president.","userName":"🚫donald orange 2020🚫"}},{"id":"6177966433","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😾","date":"2020-07-09T19:33:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚\u200D♀️crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️but i☺️can’t🙄get through😍the door✨because my🏡bootis😍 too 😢 big👌\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don' t✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆\n\nhave🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄\n\nPeople love ❤️ that I hate myself 😡i👣climbed out of my head and watched👁myself implode💥a thought🌧without a🖤body👤oughta be the shot my brain🧠 is poisoned💉 and I’m searching🧐 for the antidote🤕 but every time⏰ i find💅🏼 it my defenses🥊 scream😱 oh no❌ you don’t😰 woah😳\n\n✨anonymous 2020✨","userName":"veryreallygoodfun"}},{"id":"6177962430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP DOES NOT WORK","date":"2020-07-09T19:31:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I tried to open this app to see if Tr*mp actually had redeeming qualities it crashed and crashed and crashed again which really reflects on the character of this person I can't believe anyone would actually download this app and comfortably use it","userName":"Sydnicus"}},{"id":"6177882888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨Crashes✨","date":"2020-07-09T19:05:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to see the oranges agenda but as soon as I tried to open the app, it crashed.
