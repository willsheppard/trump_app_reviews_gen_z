Does too much signed up stuff and the worst part ever is that in every thing I click on- I have to see the ugliest person ever which is a pig (Donald trump *winkwink*) his face scares me every-time. One time it made me throw up on how disgusting he is. But that is all I got to say thank you! but just delete this app, it doesn’t even have 5 stars come on now.","userName":"tiktok's lives matter."}},{"id":"6177622621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:03Z","title":"This app is disgusting!","rating":1,"review":"This app is SO bad! It’s the worst app I have ever seen. It took like two hours to download, and then i went into the app and it crashed! I hated it. I tired going into it for about 5 times, and when I finally got in it, it crashed completely. This app should also be removed because when I opened it completely, it showed ads for pornography. This app should be removed!","userName":"kanye west 🤡"}},{"id":"6177615043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:43:36Z","title":"god is dead 🧚🏼✨🤩","rating":1,"review":"got this app and it finished downloading after 2 weeks, 5 days and 14 hours! complete waste of time 🧚🏼✨ in the oval office. i opened the app and was greeted by this picture of a horrible human being, who happens to be a doppelgänger of a cheeto puff. As a vegan, i found this extremely upsetting and unnerving. i then proceeded to dye my hair blue, get sorted into the hufflepuff house thereby fully entering in my ✨snowflake✨ identity. i deleted the app and now i can breathe again. acab","userName":"Jazmine Alcott"}},{"id":"6177580453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:32:34Z","title":"THIS APP TORE MY LIFE APART 😞","rating":1,"review":"I was a girl in the village doin alright, then I became a princess overnight.

Like who would actually want it. Anyways. I was joking with my brothers but then the app triggered something in me. The layout of the app was so frustrating and triggered me have super bad ocd. Not only that but everything that’s on this app is so stupid. I almost had a seizure trying to figure out anything slightly important or worthwhile on here. If I could I would do 0/5. This app is trash","userName":"door gift"}},{"id":"6177570422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:17Z","title":"It’s So Broken!","rating":1,"review":"So when i first downloaded the app i could already tell it was gonna be a disaster. The app randomly closes. There are numerous bugs that need fixing. It freezes every single time i enter the app. They want your phone number to send you stupid and off topic messages, one of the worst apps i have ever used. I’ve seen DS games work better than this garbage. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!. Don’t waste your time.","userName":"user148234"}},{"id":"6177473337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:13Z","title":"I want to cry","rating":1,"review":"This app worsened my depression and from now on I am so scarred and traumatized. I hate it here. Also my phone will also be traumatized from downloading this app. My poor thing. And trump is so ugly it hurts just whenever I look at him a wave of sadness appears. Save Barron though he seems like a sweet kid. And maybe Melania I guess but idk abt her. Not Ivanka though her style is so ugly and she reminds me of Tomi Lahren and whenever I see her I feel like tying a noose and dying.","userName":"i am barron trump"}},{"id":"6177472563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:00Z","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"review":"This app took FOREVER to download. After it taking so long so I thought oh it must be packed full of information, WRONG. And no I’m not a part of this whole gen z thing I’m only just now seeing that that’s a thing while reading reviews. I’m just genuinely trying to gather all information I can before the election this November. Would not recommend this app I couldn’t even figure out how to navigate it.","userName":"Kmckibbs"}},{"id":"6177360834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:25:54Z","title":"It was a nightmare!","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to see how our president’s campaign was going. But for some reason it kept crashing! Every time I go on the app my phone glitches and then turns completely black. I can’t even turn on my phone for another few minutes and when I finally can my battery dropped ten percent. I know it’s not my phone because it’s not happening with any other app. DO NOT GET THIS APP","userName":"musicgirl.love"}}]}
