Whenever I try to unlock my phone it powers off I have about a 3 second window to unlock my phone or it restarts. I better get a new phone out of this or I am suing. That’s right I’m taking the Karen approach I want to talk to your manager trump. This app took the longest time to download and when it finally did I was horrified by everything on their. It’s so disorganized and only helps one person our president the Oompa Loompa with corn fuzz for hair. He doesn’t think about any of us so for that reason I am out.","title":"DO NOT GET","date":"2020-07-09T16:56:00Z"}},{"id":"6177449043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"paidun","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"WORST QUEER DATING APP EVER. I was hopeful that this was gonna actually work When I first got the app it would not let me open it. Then after restarting my phone it finally would, then it asked for my credit card info, I’m not sure why it was relevant, after reading some fine print, the information would be for if you wanted to donate money, I didn’t plan on that because I am not in a financially safe place and need to save up my money. I looked for an option to opt out, but alas there was none. This is borderline thievery. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I want to rate it 0 stars, but I felt the need to inform people.","title":"I was hopeful","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:01Z"}},{"id":"6177366389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"finding donuts","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this so that I could get quicker updates on the campaign, I put in my information and the next thing you know I get about 20 text messages from these random businesses. Some of them were completely inappropriate. I donated to the charity and now I want a refund, who knows where that money went, probably a p?!n house for the president. I completely not really support the president and the last thing I want in my messages is a democratic text to vote.","title":"Completely crashed my phone, took 6 minutes just to load the first page, app is just terrible","date":"2020-07-09T16:27:32Z"}},{"id":"6177241204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"❤️ Itchin and Burnin ❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"We love our wonderful president so I decided to download this app , our 💋 Orange 💋 president did not handle coronavirus very well.. with that being said if we had a better president with common sense , we wouldn’t be in this ✨ G L A M O U R S ✨ situation , also he’s racist I don’t support him myself I’m BLACK AND PROUD .

My name is Karen and I want my review to be taken seriously. I downloaded this app in order to receive information about our incredible president but when i downloaded this onto my phone, it suddenly got very hot and about 10 minutes later, steam started coming out of the bottom. In my efforts to cool it down, i poured boiling water on top of this and then, my phone transformed into a robot form of Donald Trump and launched straight into my child’s head. It was so scary but thankfully my daughter is fine. I am very disappointed. I expect a response immediately.","title":"Terrible disgusting app🥺😩💔","date":"2020-07-09T15:40:49Z"}},{"id":"6177200093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Large tiger","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app was probably the worst thing I’ve ever witnessed in my life! Immediately when I opened it, I was graced with a whole bunch of porn😱 What self respecting orange looking president puts porn on their official campaign app? I find it highly embarrassing to myself and to say I live in the bEsT cOuNtRy iN tHe wOrLD: The a United States of America. This issue needs to be dealt with immediately. I feel like I have to jump inside a volcano to cleanse myself of the vile filth I witnessed from the presidents app. If I could give a -5 stars I would. I would also like to speak of the manager of the app!!! The porn needs to go! The porn needs to go!","title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:39:55Z"}},{"id":"6176643640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zoe86310","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is not only an infringement on our god given American right to privacy, but just an all around horrible app. It took days to download, slowing down my phone in the process. Once I opened it, it glitched my entire phone put and everything shut down!!! Once I was finally able to start it back up, EVERYTHING on my phone was weird - the notes were jumbled, my text messages had different characters, it was SO weird. I think this app was made to steal all of our information and it will be used against us in the future.
