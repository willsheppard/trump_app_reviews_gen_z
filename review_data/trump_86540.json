DO NOT GET IT!!! When I was peacefully reading articles in the lovely McDonald’s, a random bat grabbed the phone out of my hand and dropped it on the ground. I picked it up and the screen was SHATTERED. I had then logged back onto the app and noticed that there was a ‘bat option’ toggled on. I turned it off, and turned it back on again just to see what it was. ANOTHER bat came  and grabbed my phone, dropped it, and my phone was completely broken and I had to get a new one. Also, there was an option to call the police so I did because I felt oppressed, and the police said that they were too busy killing innocent black people to handle this situation. So you’re telling me this ugly, stinky, orangutang of a president can create an app that hurts us? Not on my watch. and THATS NOT IT. There was also a cockroach option. I toggled it because I wanted to see what it was. Nothing happened and I was thankful. When I got home from McDonald’s, there were tens of thousands of cockroaches in my house, covering my walls and floors. I tried to turn off the cockroach option but they wouldn’t go away. My whole family was in the house when this happened. They all have a deathly fear of cockroaches. When they saw them, they fainted and the cockroaches ate them. Literally ate them. Now I’m sitting here, writing this review while the cockroaches are munching on their bones. Also, Trump is a masochist, look it up. DOMT EVER GET THIS APP IF YOU DONT WANT YOUR FAMILY TO DIE AND YOUR PHONE TO GET BROKEN!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173669096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"hate the orange🤮🍊","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:58Z","title":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍊most terrible app made by the worst looking orange 🍊🧚🏻\u200D♂️🤮","review":"the most disgusting app i’ve seen yet the app alone with the person who made it makes me want to throw up🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6173667504","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"𝙳𝚞𝚖𝚙 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:25Z","title":"demons arrived when i downloaded 🤬🤬","review":"𝖽𝗈 𝗇𝗈𝗍 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝗈𝖺𝖽!!!
