Then I caught pneumonia and three STDs. I've been had my faced rubbed into peaches vagina so now I have uncurable disease rash on my face. Next thing that happened is going to shiver your timbers. Then the orange Chido man with the blonde hair pulled up on me right in front of the neighborhood Walmart, to ask me if I was willing to sell my children for his personal pleasure.

Absolutely ducking awful. My grandmother, a trump supporter, downloaded this app and immediately had a heart attack, causing her to drop a match and burn down an entire forest. Literally destroyed lives. Tried to sign up and create an account and immediately got herpes. My cat got warts and lost all of her fur after seeing the face of this app. I don’t think my pp will ever get hard again after opening this app. Would give it 0 stars if I could.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174030793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t install it, it’s horrible.","date":"2020-07-08T22:59:49Z","userName":"emika w.","review":"First of all when I opened the app it started crashing and it was showing me random stuff. So I uninstalled it and installed it again but the same thing happened! So then I finally got it to work and when I did it wouldn’t let me type, so I reset my phone and did it again, it seemed like it was working well at first, but then it started glitching again! And I have a iPhone XR, so I will not blame it on my phone, so please fix the app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173993724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrific","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:55Z","userName":"And I'm Jennifer","review":"I simply got this app because it was #1 in news. Once I opened this app, I was HORRIFIED to see this Cheeto (no offense to Cheetos) yelling or whatever. After I finish this review, I will delete this app in hopes to make sure no one else has to experience what I and others, who have downloaded this, had to see. Yes, I understand each review is different. However, we all have been frightened in our own ways. Anyways, thank you for taking your time to listen to my review and please NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173984234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Rats have invaded","date":"2020-07-08T22:42:13Z","userName":"~♡´･ᴗ･`♡~","review":"Honestly to think we would get anywhere with this rat we call our president was one of the worst mistakes America has ever made. 6 months into 2020 and what has he done. Nothing but talk about windmills and making racist comments about the global pandemic that he has failed to contain. What he did not fail though was immediately jump into fixing a meat shortage problem. This joke that we call our president deserves to choke on a rat because that is exactly what he is.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173972306","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GAVE ME PTSD NOOOO🤢","date":"2020-07-08T22:37:42Z","userName":"Mjkjlk","review":"Out of respect to my president I decided to download this app only to discover that there would be a big ugly photo of him right on the loading page. As if a time machine took me back to the early 2000s, I started to experience very strong and violent flashbacks of the Chester the Cheeto commercials and the the koolaid man commercials. Those two delicacies just don’t hit the same anymore. This app was such a trigger to me and many of my friends. I request that it is taken down as soon as possible😤","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173938855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Big boy Nono 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:25:07Z","userName":"big tiddy goth girlfriend","review":"I got the app and the first thing I saw when I open it up was a orange cheeto cooking a baby, that orange Cheeto then ate the baby of camera, then later on I found out that this app also steals your goldfish, rip goldfish 2021. And guess what happened after, my pet flying human came to me and told me and I quote “there’s a orange Cheeto at our house and he has a big boy hammer” so yes, if you get this app a orange Cheeto will come and try to attack you. so pro-tip, if you see a orange Cheeto, delete the app and watch the orange Cheeto run away. 👁👄👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
