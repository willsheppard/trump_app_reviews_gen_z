But the moment I opened the app, It released a weird chemical. All of a sudden, I felt the urge to go make fun of a disabled person, I felt the urge to date my daughter, I felt the urge to go put children in cages and I felt the urge to go dehumanize all minorities. I then realized that this app wasn’t in support of President Dump, it was turning me into President Dump. Do not download, this app will turn you into a horrible, worthless, waste of air."}},{"id":"6173521486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:53:23Z","title":"I SHOULD SUE🤬✨🗣🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊","userName":"datchik76","review":"As soon as I open the app my phone started to glitch, overheat, then shut down. 🤬🤬🤬My phone has never done this before and I blame Trump!Not to mention there were so many roaches and other bugs and I’m afraid of bugs.

Using this app as a news source is dangerous not only for this reason, but also because I have seen  false statements and facts being produced by this app as well. If you do support trump I advise you to not download this app saying that the apps main intention is not to inform the public about trumps and his administrations work and ask for support, but to instead manipulate and lie to people for votes."}},{"id":"6173486256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:41:19Z","title":"disgusting","userName":"I hate it so much!!!","review":"do NOT download this app! it loads tons of viruses onto your phone in order to monitor and control what you do! i used to be the biggest fan of trump!

Probably one of the worst apps in history, and trust me I know apps better than anyone else in the world. No, I will not elaborate on my app knowledge, my app knowledge is very personal to me. The WORST part is, when I went to close the app while using it, it grabbed me by the 😳 I won’t say it. Anyways this has no business being on the App Store."}},{"id":"6173438561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:24:59Z","title":"TERRIBLE APP!","userName":"Imrighthaha","review":"I went to open the app and it shut my phone down 10 times. It uses SO MUCH Data when it rarely works, and glitches every few seconds. What’s wrong with this administration??? Can you not make a decent app? My father tried to download it as well to see if it was just my phone glitching and it took DAYS to download using up all of our familys data and costing us money! Do not download this app it is a VIRUS. If I could give zero stars I would 👎🏻"}},{"id":"6173427332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:21:17Z","title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"Cheeken Nuoogets","review":"This app is horrible!!!! It took FOREVER to download and the controls are WACK AS HELL. I don’t even know how to give Trump fairy comments on it. Other than that, if I could give this app negative reviews, I would. Not only did it take forever to download, IT TAKES UP SOOOO MUCH SPACE. Also, the fact it has Trump’s name on it is DISGUSTING GET THAT OUT. Listen, nobody likes Trump and you’re gonna have to try harder than that. You know, the bible app is free and by supporting Trump, you’re committing the biggest sin ever. :) ❤️💖🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏻✨✨"}},{"id":"6173379761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:34Z","title":"security issues","userName":"ninilovejuju","review":"when i downloaded this app, it was fine at first then a couple days later i noticed that its had access to my personal information (credit card info, location,camera roll) which i didn’t consent to, i clicked no when the app had asked to use my location and camera roll , yet it still had access. I am very scared to use this app now . I wouldn’t recommend this app for privacy reasons"}}]}
