Now that I was blind I couldn’t see what our orange 🍊 ( president) posted so I told my daughter to read it to me ( btw her name is Hannah, Hannah Baker) and apperantly she saw trumps face and his side profile and she committed suicide. And she wrote recorded herself before she committed suicide and this is what she said.( Hey ITS HANNAH , HANNAH BAKER LIVE AND IN STEREO AND IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS , YOU PROBABLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY SUICIDE.)  And she left a note that said FOR :TRUMP.\n So in conclusion this is a terrible app and definitely not safe to download.✨✨✨✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176942055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I threw up","date":"2020-07-09T14:29:06Z","userName":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️he is disgusting😚🤢","review":"\"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.

As soon as you open the app it asks for your location and social security number. You can skip so that’s what I did, it somehow accessed those anyway and hacked into my bank, stole 2,729 dollars exact. As soon as I tried to delete it it asked me if I was sure and when I said yes it didn’t delete so I shut down my phone. When I opened it up everything was gone and I had to get it fixed at a store! Disgraceful and horrible !","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176058398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"twump","date":"2020-07-09T10:21:04Z","userName":"Fijigoya","review":"i honestly have never had a worse experience with an app. it got to the point where i had to restart my phone every time i opened it. it then stole all my data and blackmailed me into publicly shading MY 2020 candidate, barry bee benson. he is an innovator when it comes to politics, and an activist for bee rights. i support benson. after that, the app told me that i look bad in the sweater that my great great grandma made me before she died. i now can no longer wear it because this app rewired siri to say sexist things whenever i do and then ppl think it was me. overall, i hate this app and WOULD NOT recommend.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176033795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible App 🧚","date":"2020-07-09T10:13:13Z","userName":"whatever_shane","review":"I downloaded this app intended to see the positive polices the Trump Administration was projecting but as I instantly downloaded it and got on it began malfunctioning. It needs a software update or something it kept bugging out and kicking me out. It didn’t even let me inside the entirety of the app. I barely do reviews for apps but this app was just disappointing. I had all the right intentions to use this app but it wasn’t worth my time if it continues to lag and kick me out. I don’t recommend other people unless you guys want to be leave frustrated after using the app. 1/10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175793848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Donald trump is trying to kill me!

When I first opened the app I was met with a prompt that said “Donald Trump would like to know your location” I clicked “no” but another prompt said “Donald Trump is angry 😡👹” I gasped in shock and pressed the “no” button again but then was met with ANOTHER PROMPT that said “Donald trump is outside your house 🔫😈” I screamed at my phone and am now writing the review under my blanket. I heard knocking acouple minutes ago, HES HERE. I am scared for my life!

But once I opened it the creepy orange man was standing outside my window and a tornado in my house had occurred I had to take action! I had a feeling it was the app, finally I had went outside to confront the orange man when he out of no where says “I’m going to take your dog and your house too” When I tell you I ran so fast away from the orange bell pepper man I ran as fast as I could! He had finally caught up to me I got so scared I deleted the app then everything went away. 10/10 do not recommend! I do not want the orange man doing this to you too.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175704225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Please don’t download this :(","date":"2020-07-09T08:23:13Z","userName":"heartbenbrokesomanytimez","review":"I wanted to download this app and as soon as I did, my boyfriend came into the room. He was going to ask my for a favor but he glanced at my phone and saw the app. We got into a heated argument until ultimately he left me and joined a Korean entertainment company, where he eventually joined a seven-man group that sung and dance for audiences around the world, topping charts and making history including holding #1 on the Billboard Social 50 Chart for three years and becoming the solo artist with the most #1s on iTunes breaking Adele’s record. I miss him so much, and it’s all because of this stupid app 😢😢","isEdited":false}}]}
