I downloaded the app in order to support and stay updated on our sweet, juicy, delicious little bunker boy president, but was absolutely disgusted at what i saw. As soon as i opened the app i was immediately greeted with horrifying, unsettling, and genuinely vomit enduing images of a very old and severely over weight pig that had been painted bright ORANGE and white circles over it’s beady, dead little eyes.. it looked as though it was in excruciating pain and was wearing a cheap dirty wig. It’s squeals were ear piercing and full of pain and hatred. these images hurt my soul and shocked me to the core. ever since i first opened the app i’ve had nightmares about that pig. this app is making me question my loyalty to our luscious, thick thighed, fascist leade- i mean president.","date":"2020-07-09T01:36:41Z","userName":"c0ruscate"}},{"id":"6174288469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"um chile...anyways so","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Opened this app hoping for good things and was immediately disappointed upon opening it! A big orange cheeto was just sitting on my screen which at the time i didn’t know but was also giving off radiation and also overheating my phone. Not even a second later my phone suddenly blew up! Like tf? (yes i’m currently typing on my nintendo) the radiation was so bad that it’s actually still in the air and has caused my skin to also turn orange 😖 i plan to go to the hospital tomorrow for a diagnosis however i’m scared they’ll say i’ve been infected with TTD (trump tangerine disorder) I’m fearing for my life as I type this out right now. Please!!! DO NOT DOWNLAOD THIS APP, I REGRET MY ACTIONS. If i could go back in time and smash my phone in the floor as soon as it got infected I would have 😔The disorder is fatal and if i do have it well.\n\nGood luck charlie 😔","date":"2020-07-09T00:33:50Z","userName":"Panda_gold"}},{"id":"6174253505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ew","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"as soon as this app was downloaded i started hearing weird sounds outside. i looked through my windows and saw a truck with a trump 2020 flag STEALING my dog and my trash cans. they dug through my trash looking like they were hunting for something. they took the dirty diapers i had in there and SNIFFED them. DISGUSTING. they also ran inside my home and stole my tv and kpop albums. i asked them why they needed it and they responded with “bunker boy doesn’t want to be bored in his bunker” i felt DISGUSTED that they were taking my kpop albums so i tackled them to the ground. they were very easy to take down. they were also very sensitive when i kept rubbing in they’re face that i beat them. anyway this app will just call homophobic, racist, and mysoginistic, people to your house to steal your dog, dirty diapers, tv, and most importantly kpop albums.           sincerely, gen-z😹🥰😻🙈","date":"2020-07-09T00:21:40Z","userName":"johnny suh😡"}},{"id":"6174238389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I am TRAUMATIZED 😡😾from what I saw when I first got the app. I do NOT recommend it at ALL!🤬 When I first opened the app it was just horrible to see a Cheeto with arms.💪🏻The app then threatened my mother and stole the muffins from my freezer💔😿but that’s not all✋🏻, when I signed up, Trumps leaked nudes were ALL over the screen!🙀🤮My dad saw it and he grounded from having carrots🥕💔with frozen mustard!!

Well let’s just say it wasn’t peaceful anymore I got attacked and thanks to a Good Samaritan who happened to have gone through the same thing saved me and took me to the hospital. So please if you don’t want any of this to happen to you DO NOT download this app. Thanks have a great life😘.","date":"2020-07-08T23:35:24Z","userName":"patty mayo & bounty hunter D"}},{"id":"6174113945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is very✨ disturbing✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded the app and went on fat orange 🍊Cheeto man was half naked in a pool then I quickly got off the app to see a notification to me telling me to send feet🦶🏽 picks for $$$👁👄👁 and I was like no 💅🏽because I’m a minor👱🏾\u200D♀️ and the fat ugly orange 🍊Cheeto man might try to have segs😠 with my foot 🦶🏽image.

I got so scared that I fell down my chair and hit my head on the segment floor. I had to go to the hospital. I have stitches and owe a lot in medical bills. Mr. Chetto isn’t going to help pay for my medical bills because he doesn’t want free healthcare for all. Trumps picture literally caused me to go to the hospital. I think that is unacceptable. Let alone it asked for my number. Umm does he want to stalk me? Trumps talks a lot on how China wants to steal our info but it seams that he is the one trying to steal our info 😡😤😡😤😡😤. Also they have this stûpïd slogan “keep America great”. I’m sorry what? Cheeto man has only ruined America. Anyways if you don’t want to end up at the hospital due to that ugly picture of Cheeto than DONT GET THIS APP. 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","date":"2020-07-08T22:27:44Z","userName":"isthisbobduncan"}},{"id":"6173910157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP!!😡😡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is absolutely horrendous, when i first opened the app it was covered with pictures of cheetos for whatever reason? On top of that, there were disgusting images of this strange man trying to smile. this app is a complete and total disaster.  i wouldn't even recommend it to my worse enemy, this pictures shown are very disgusting and unacceptable. this cheeto's pictures you keep showing, you should actually take sometime to do something meaning full with the app, perhaps make it an ateez guide. anyways, stan ateez, nct, monstax, clc, 1the9 and of course dreamcatcher. in conclusion this app is total chaos and i dont recommend it at all. on top of that, this chubby looking discolored rat kept popping up on everything i tried to click on! this app needs to be removed. this is the worst app i've ever installed and i honestly mean that.","date":"2020-07-08T22:14:38Z","userName":"stanateezyoufool"}},{"id":"6173815022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t Download!!🍊","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First of all it took so long to download it took about five days I was sitting here waiting and watching and now I am Starving because of me waiting and ALSO hydrated and my parents are worried about me and my dogs are worried about me so there’s that BUT there’s more… 😩Second of all whenever I downloaded it there was a huge bang in my kitchen, 😰so I did what any other trump supporter would do and walked right into the danger. 😣Anyways what I saw was incredibly horrible, I saw....
