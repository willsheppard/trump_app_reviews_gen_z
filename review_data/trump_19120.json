This show is about fixers in Washington, D.C. who happen to have a close relationship with the president, Fitzgerald Grant. I hate Fitzgerald Grant. With a passion. But you know what? I hate this app more. It made me love Fitzgerald Grant. So following that logic, this app OBVIOUSLY isn’t for me and I’m guessing it not for anyone else either!

Also with this, I got a notification from the app calling me a dirty c***s*cker who “belongs to the streets.” While my child was using the app, it malfunctioned and opened up an add for an adult website. This app is unsafe and disgusts me.","isEdited":false,"userName":"lizdel1116","date":"2020-07-09T01:00:47Z"}},{"id":"6174348260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1,"review":"The moment I opened the app I was greeted with an Ompaa Lompaa trying to force feed me a cookie!🍪 I tried uninstalling the app but the all of a sudden random cookie monsters kept popping up all over my screen! 😱 I even bought a whole NEW phone 📱 but the SAME problem kept accruing?! 🤯 Since this event I have had to change my ENTRIE identify to stop 🛑 it from continuing!","isEdited":false,"userName":"HeyGoogGirlHey","date":"2020-07-09T00:53:54Z"}},{"id":"6174338207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TRAUMATIZED🙈😳🤬😡","rating":1,"review":"So I got this app to pay respects to my beloved 😇𝒸𝒽ℯℯ𝓉ℴ𝒽 𝓂𝒶𝓃😇 i was expecting glorious photos of the immaculate man himself!
