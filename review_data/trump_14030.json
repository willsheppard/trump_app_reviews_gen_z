I had no intention of downloading this because unlike some others I’m not a moron who supports trump. This app immediately crashed my iPhone. It was terrifying. Not the crashing part, the part where I had a picture of trump closer to me than 60 feet. I 100% do not recommend this app. I am disappointed. Also #BLM.","userName":"uwvrtuhwecfbefyrcu"}},{"id":"6177175411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:32:56Z","rating":1,"title":"✨yikes✨","review":"I had gotten this app so I could support our great ✨orange✨ but it took days for it to download. But when I eventually got it, it was all weird and glitchy. Oompa loompa’s were shooting out of my phone speaker while they screamed “trump 2020” to the tune of the Augustus Gloop song. Even AFTER I deleted the app, the oompa loompa’s wouldn’t go away. So now thanks to this app I’m stuck with some stupid trump supporting oompa loompa’s running all around my house.  \n😡😡","userName":"cosmicripley"}},{"id":"6177128667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:19:53Z","rating":1,"title":"That Spinning T (Swastica) Though 👀","review":"I was appalled to open this app and see such an incompetent man still running for public office. You would think by now he would have realized how much of America disapprove of him. I joined this app to get the latest information regarding his resignation. I was very disappointed to find that this app is meant to glorify him. I would not recommend this app to anyone. It’s a terrible app. Not helpful or applicable AT ALL. \n-Karen","userName":"Steven Beverly"}},{"id":"6177073100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:04:32Z","rating":1,"title":"it made me feel bad😞🥺☹️😭👉🏾👈🏾","review":"They keep telling me I’m like awful👎 for not supporting them and giving money 💰 💵 when I’m literally broke, like they dont even care.🤧😓 Plus, the graphics 📈 are scary👹👹, theres a dude who has a melted upper lip👄👁👄 and his cheeks look like they’re dripping down his face and he’s like if the cheeto cheetah and an oompa loompa had a love child👶🧡 just standing there with his fist up.✊ I felt V E R Y A T T A C K E D.😡👊💢 Not a good experience. 20/12 do not recommend. 🚫🚫","userName":"Charles Henessey"}},{"id":"6177043134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:56:19Z","rating":1,"title":"So slow and constantly crashes","review":"This app doesn’t even work. It constantly crashes and is soooo slow. Any time you click something or try to go to another page it just automatically exits. Deleting it because I think it’s also just making my phone so slow and what’s the point if you can’t even use it or get further than the homepage.","userName":"Kyra P Anderson"}},{"id":"6177038717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:55:07Z","rating":1,"title":"no honey","review":"i reaaaalllly wanted to get this app so that I could hear updates from bunker boy but then i decided to download it like actually and see if the app itself worked and i kid you not it kept crashing every single time i logged on and i couldn’t even open the app for 10 seconds without it crashing and me having to start over again. like it was too good to be true 😂😂","userName":"kennedyyyyyy?"}},{"id":"6176992932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:42:48Z","rating":1,"title":"genz do ur thing😌🧚✨","review":"When i opened the app it had a orange Cheeto puff in the middle of the screen and then my phone started to glitch. I tried to get the out of the app but the Cheeto started talking to me talking about stuff and then gave my phone📱a virus!🤬🤯😡😠😤. I don’t even know how some people gave this app a 5 star rating. If Trump can’t even successfully make an app what makes him think he’s doing a good job running a country.","userName":"judyjudybubooty"}},{"id":"6176911197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:04Z","rating":1,"title":"ehh formatting is wack","review":"Really had high hopes for this app b/c my government class taught me to be open minded and I wanted to see other perspectives! However, it absolutely sucked. This is THE worst app on the App Store. Besides the propaganda, it made my iPhone SHUT DOWN!!! Whatever you do - DON’T DOWNLOAD! I think it has a really insane virus. I’m leaving this review with the last drop of charge I have in my phone forever because this app killed my phone’s wiring.","userName":"GEN Z BABYYYYYYYY"}},{"id":"6176876333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:11:54Z","rating":1,"title":"The president is a Cheeto","review":"I don’t even know where to start this app disgusts me not only does it have trump in the name but it says trump 2020. After I used this app for one day to try to find something so I could bash him hehe that night a had nightmares of a small orange Cheeto elf running at me with a bunch of tiny dudes in suits I was so scared but it turns out he was just running to his bunker cause he’s not man enough to talk to the people about a serious topic.
