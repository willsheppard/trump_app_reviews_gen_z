The therapist has since talked to me and I have learned that my phone will never recover from the trauma I put it through. Such an awful app, not only is it run by a walking cheeto but now it’s taken the life of my beautiful new iphone 11 and things will never be the same. My poor phone will never be the same again. I blame this app and it’s stupid cheeto. I will NEVER forgive you for what you all have done.","date":"2020-07-10T04:40:14Z"}},{"id":"6179467418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"meshellism","title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Only works with tiny hands.","date":"2020-07-10T04:40:13Z"}}]}
