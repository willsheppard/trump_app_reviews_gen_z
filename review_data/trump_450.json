Do you wanna know why? I think you know why, so I’m not going to bother even explaining. My thumbs literally burned opening up this app because all I can’t face to face with is an afghan hound who can’t even tell which shoe is his left and which is his right. Yeah, Donald Trump. You know what? I apologize, that was an insult to the afghan hound. At least I can look at the dog breed and not automatically have the urge to tear my eyes to shreds. I saw a bug chilling on my blanket and immediately eliminated it. I was able to gather up the courage to do it because I imagined it was the orange that sat out in the sun for far too long. Oops sorry, let me get back to talking about the app. After opening and getting over the shock that I downloading the stupid thing, the app wouldn’t even open correctly. It crashed within a few seconds, which is severely disappointing. I wanted a little bit more time to make fun of it. Anyways, just do us all of a favor and get rid of this app. It doesn’t even work"}},{"id":"6174285408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alexkskksksksndbdbdhdud","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:32:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m disappointed 😿","review":"I downloaded this app so that I could see the big Cheeto man and praise him for the hard work he has done for this country but when I opened it I saw and IMPOSTER it was a very scary and wrinkly orange and it looked like it had been rotting for days I was DISGUSTED but that’s not all when I tried to play subway surfers it had a terrible glitch! My phone started acting weird and there was a picture of a naked Cheeto on my screen and I couldn’t get it off! I tried to reset my phone but the flying monkeys didn’t let me! I sat and cried because my Dino nuggets were burnt because of the monkeys and then I went into the Apple store to get a new phone but the Cheeto man was there and he was NUDE I tried to run away but he came running towards me singing this Chinese song it went something like”nae ****** nae” and I was TERRIFIED but then a lovely boy who looked like a skeleton cake and saved me his name was BaRroN and he said that the app was created to make you lose you pinky toe! I think this app is inappropriate and shouldn’t be downloaded my child was about to download it but I’m glad he didn’t 😥"}},{"id":"6174098230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cOwFiSh27","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:24:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m now in hiding 👁👄👁","review":"So I opened the app and like *dramatic pause with screeching* 🤢 ew. The first thing I saw was this big orange thing 🙀. And it kinda scarred me not gonna lie. But then it wanted my phone number and I was like nah. And it was like yah. And I was like nah. And it was like yah. And this went on for like 34 million weeks 😦. But then it started glitching and I was like oh here we go again. So I preformed our sacred activity oh to see without my eyes but I had to keep and eye out for selener 👁👄➖. So the app hacked my phone 🙀. And then I got a text saying that trump wanted to date me. And I ain’t pulling no Melania. So I was like no beach. And then the secret service pulled up and killed my family. But I jumped out the window before they could get me. And I left me phone there. (I’m writing on a landline which I didn’t know was possible) but anyway I’m now hiding from Trump and all his other peoples. Ugh life is so hard when you president is a Cheeto who called a person who eats food like the rest of us a pig even though he weighs like 400 pounds more then her. Anyway byyyyeeee. I’m gonna go salsa dance with the rats."}},{"id":"6173658270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Chewbecca9514","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:41:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i was attacked don’t download","review":"once i downloaded the app, it took like 4 days and it stole my money from my venmo app. i still thought that i needed to support our amazing bunker boy 🧡 because of how much 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 he has done for this country. the app FORCED me to give all of my information (ss, credit card, passport information, etc.). and after all or that trauma, they threatened to kidnap me and keep me hostage with barton trump. i was kinda excited because barron is bae✨ but i was still scared. i decided to call the police because i am a white person and i am privileged but when they arrived they said that only people that were the color of trump were allowed to be saved. so they took me. but the worst part is that barron isn’t even here. they are making me eat carrots until my skin is orange and then after that they will decide if i am worthy or not. i am trying to hide that i am part of the lgbtq+ community, but i don’t know how long that is gonna last because the longer i am here, the more that my dyed hair glows. whatever you do, DO NOT download this app. and also pray for me please."}},{"id":"6172981008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"123628462893","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Couldn’t keep my eye out for Selener","review":"I downloaded the app because I noticed there were a lot of white supremaci- oops, I mean trump supporters recommending it. When I first opened the app a hand reached through the screen and grabbed one of my eyes. I think this was an attempt for me to become one with the Angry creamsicle, which I didn’t mind because I love it when bunker boi does things without permission or consent. Anyways, I only had one eye left, which I had to keep out for selener, but there was a hypnotizing spinning image on the screen and the one eye I had left got stuck. Then I started hearing the Wizard of Waverly Place theme song behind me and it happened to be selener. I didn’t know if she would help or harm me so I panicked. But then she yanked my phone from me and threw it across the room which broke my trance. I’ve always looked at selener as the enemy, but we connected thanks to orange juice’s app. I would rate this 5 stars since I met Selener, but I’m still missing an eye so it’s a no from me. And it also might have to do with that fact that I don’t support racist, homophobic, sexist, pedophiles."}},{"id":"6172826829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"S.T.L.LiX","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:08:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"MY REPUBLICANS SELF ALMOST DIED","review":"I downloaded this app to support our loved president Donald J. Trump. I knew this was gonna be my favorite app. Unfortunately, it took 6 months to download??? I was devastated, my republican self almost died because of impatience and love for my trumpy 😻✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️. When it finalIy downloaded, I filled my personal information, phone number, email etc. Suddenly, photos of James Charles pupped up, it wouldn’t let me use the app! The screen was all James Charles! I couldn’t support our president!! IF I CANT SUPPORT MY PRESIDENT THEN WHAT WOULD I DO WITH MY LIFE???!! I told my parents about it, it seem they had the same  problem. ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️😔Our Republicans trumpets self, almost died!✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️ My mother had a heart attack and hit her head, because of the technical problems there were in the app. We had to go to the hospital and everything! So long-story short, we got hacked. Our personal information got leaked and now my phone screen is all about James Charles, sm6band dancing and papi Anonymous edits (which that part isn’t that bad). So for your life’s sake, don’t download this app, and if you do, you’ll get hacked❤️."}},{"id":"6177704547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Emster54321","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:12:03Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Bruh","review":"This app took several days to download and when it finally did my whole entire phone shut off and wouldn’t turn back on and then even tho it was turned off I heard it start to ring and when I answered it was the fat Cheeto himself telling me that he had kidnapped my dog and if I wanted her to live that I had to vote for him so I used my super ultra high tech computer, called the gangstatron 5000, and tracked his IP address to a dollar general in Roswell, New Mexico and then I started my long journey to get to him all the way from my home town and once I had got there the epic battle for my pretty girl had started and I used all of my wwe and my karate skills on this big ol tangerine and knocked his crusty toupee off of his head and the nasty look off of his face and once he had been stunned long enough the voice from mortal combat said “finish him!” And so I stood over the Garfield look alike and was about to finish him off when I took pity on him and only knocked him unconscious with the baseball bat I had in my pocket and took my precious puppy and ran all the way back home😋💅🏻😽😼🤜"}},{"id":"6177618326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧟\u200D♀️🦶🏽✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:44:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"make america great again! ✨w out an orange✨","review":"i was sooo excited to finally support the racist, homophobic, & etc..orange🤭🍊🧚🏼in the white house until i downloaded this app.i am so so sorry to the people who support✨‘TrUMp’✨this app is sooo bad i felt sick to my stomach👁👄🧚🏼✨i couldn’t even live w the pain.. so i recently passed away all of my friends were so sad they cried for me🧑🏽\u200D🦼✨🧟\u200D♀️i was sent to an insititution due to the things i saw & felt. i never felt that bad in my lifeeee. 🍊🥺🦶🏽my cousin from harvard yale & yk ucla & stanford told me it stole all of my information. if you think tik tok is bad this one sends information to the atlantic ocean & antartica now the penguins know abt my secret bf ****🤫😔✨💞😛my apple pay money was gone & now my sugar daddy is soo mad at me bc he has to pay me twice as much👁👄👁 i just hope that this app doesn’t come into the hands of anyone else bc it’s just taking everything from me & not just my information but my life🏊\u200D♂️😖🦋💞🦶🏽.my dog started crying when she saw the ugly orange thing on the app & she’s ✨BLIND✨😔i will never support anything w the name ✨tRumP✨🥰🦵🏾👄👅🧟\u200D♀️🧚🏼💘✨✨"}},{"id":"6177311445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tabitha_brown2020🇺🇸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:12:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible","review":"when i first downloaded the app i saw this orange  🍊 . at first i was like “ew!” 🤮 🤢 but i didn’t think too much of it so i downloaded the app for literally no reason. (because we’re in quarantine and i’m bored) 😑  after HOURS of waiting for the app to be downloaded and hours of boredom i opened the app. and once again i saw the orange 🍊! it was kind of a mix between a orange 🍊 and blob fish 🐠 . this.. THING was so weird and ugly-looking that i actually threw up 🤮 ! i had a horrible stomach ache all night & kept rushing to the bathroom 🚽 to vomit 🤮 . the weird thing is this happened in the morning ☀️ and i actually didn’t have breakfast 🥞 🍳  yet (so i didn’t have anything in my stomach that would make me feel nauseous). the next day i still had a horrible stomach ache. fortunately, no vomiting 🤮 . this app made me sick 😷 all because they wanted to put a mysterious CREATURE on my phone 📱. horrible! why couldn’t they had put a superior person like Barack Obama 🇺🇸 on it? so thanks a lot for making me sick app developers 🙄. ONE STAR ⭐️ RATING!!!! (because you cannot put zero.)"}}]}
