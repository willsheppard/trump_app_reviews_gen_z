Inappropriate and terrifying images began to flash across the screen and an ear piercing noise began to play. I am overall shocked and horrified.

Trump stands for JENIUS. But after seeing it obviously this is not the real Donald Duck despite the similarity in appearance AND whoever this trump guy is, is NOT a jenius thoroughly disappointing. Wish I could give zero stars, the J must actually stand for joke.
