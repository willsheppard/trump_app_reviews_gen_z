First I took forever to download, it took about 69 years and 420 days. 😢 Then when it finally download I was disappointed 😔 to see that I had to enter my birthday 🎂for trump 🍊to see the ages of his supporters. Now as an immortal goddess I have no recollection of when I was born, and I stopped counting how old I was, I had to enter a completely random date and because I am a goddess I am not allowed to lie, so my god (The Gen Z Lord) rose 🌹 from hell itself and had to have a talk with me, she said,\n“Remember our modo, say no to socialize, and say yes to torturing the Cheeto himself, serial killers, Fox News, etc. online!” \nAnd I said,\n“But my lord, I was lying to the Cheeto online!.”\nTo that she said,\n“Oh ok. Peace ✌🏼out homi.” And she left.\n I was overjoyed 😄 that I was not going to be killed! \nWhen I got onto the app I was disappointed 😞 at the color choice. Don’t get me wrong I love our country’s colors (even tho  every country has the same four colors) but only red, white, and blue! I mean he could have used The Rainbow 🌈 but no he stuck to the yéyé colors. Next what happened was shocking 😧 I left the app and a notification popped up saying that I didn’t go on it would take all my rights and TikTok away 🤭 now I couldn’t have this so I set my phone 📱 on fire 🔥 and get this.........it blew up 💥 and then it killed every trump supporter on the planet!. Now I wasn’t to sad because who needs the nasty 🤢 right hating white supremacists anyway am I right. 😂 So to anyone who gets this malfunction just set your phone on fire and see what happens! Maybe it’ll kill all the pedos next!\n\nWell i must get back to binging tiktok for the rest of eternity!\nRemember gen z\nEat your tide pods and drink your bleach!\nGoodnight 💤🌙 \n18467381993646722876567299182746467382891993747473","userName":"stand up to be tall"}},{"id":"6179194698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-10T03:07:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Worst app ever.
