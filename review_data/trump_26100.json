Consistent adds are being displayed pertaining to donations for Donald Trump which ultimately makes the app unusable. Will uninstall. Trump himself is also a vicious fraud, and a rapist to women of which he has paid off large sums to. Utterly disgusting nonetheless.","userName":"decreeson","date":"2020-07-08T20:21:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The Worst App I‚Äôve Downloaded On AppStore","rating":1}},{"id":"6173579893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Liar liar pants on fire.
