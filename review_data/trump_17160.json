As soon as the app downloaded I opened it to see an obese abnormally large Cheeto man, naked singing the national anthem. It was horrific. \nI would never recommend this app to anyone let alone my children, I can’t believe they allow such things on the App Store. I never want anyone seeing this terrifying looking man baby, it should be taken down immediately.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173910857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:14:53Z","title":"WORST APP!

He preaches of making America great again. But the fact is it hasn’t really been great ever. If we want to make this country better going forward we need better leaders. And with this upcoming generation full of new ideas and mindsets we need more open minded leaders to match. And he is definitely not the president to do it.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173878050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:02:56Z","title":"almost died","isEdited":false,"userName":"harrystylesvibrator","review":"i downloaded this app to of course, support my child rapist president ! 💗💗upon seeing the ‘trump2020’ sign, i started hyperventilating and sweating profusely. my hair started falling out and parts of my beloved phone exploded, the parts hitting me right in my 🐱. i had to be rushed to the ER for an emergency surgery or else my 🐱 would’ve been destroyed. don’t download this app if you care about your private parts, women.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173849994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:52:26Z","title":"REGRET PLS HELP","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pgaytangonzalez😁","review":"i downloaded this app bc it’s the #1 app for news, i’ve seen so many GREAT reviews i had to get it but ngl i immediately got bad vibes✨THIS i regret i was hoping to get what i deserved. and nothing can turn around😔this app has false information and needs to be fixed😿i can’t get my news.

Which in my case seemed a little fishy and very discouraging. My phone kept lagging and glitching to the point that I had to get a new phone and also change my credit card info. This app is a scam and your president is a big orange dummy who needs to go back into his bunker. Hugs and kisses. Xoxo gossip girl.","rating":1}}]}
