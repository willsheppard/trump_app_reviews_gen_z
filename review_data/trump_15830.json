I downloaded this app of gold ‚ù§Ô∏è then all of the sudden, a scary orange blonde monster appeared and said his name was Trump. I was so scared, his zombie wife Melinsomnia came out and started looking pale and smirked at me. I was so nervous because then this disgusting flag came up, it had the colors of Satan!

We have bad apps here in America, more than any other country, I‚Äôve seen the data, we have the worst apps. But this app is the worst app of all the apps. I would know, I‚Äôm an expert on apps. This app Tr**ps all other apps for the worst app. Trust me, it‚Äôs a bad app. If we stop making apps like this, there will be fewer negative reviews. It‚Äôs science, I know. Trust me.
