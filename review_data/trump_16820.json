I get on the app and the first thing I see is is the freaking Lorax with a wig on. It was really looking weird then it tried to take me to bad websites that would not be appropriate for kids or adults. Apparently it says if u get the app then u have to be able to name 5 WNBA players so I jus deleted it.
