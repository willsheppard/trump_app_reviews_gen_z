Let’s start from the beginning. Hi, my name is Obunga (weird name, I know right? It’s actually Indian) and I am 37 years old. Roughly about two years ago, I was a heavy trump supporter. I loved him to the point I would die for him, therefore I tried to several times. I’ve tried to stick a fork in my toaster multiple times, when that didn’t work I threw my toaster into my bathtub full of water and jumped in after it. Nothing would work, so when I went to actually meet Donald trump in order to tell him what I would do for him, and when he didn’t even come out of the White House, I started crying. The securities out front had to escort me to the local police station, but as I am a white man, I did not get arrested, just a warning. I cried myself to sleep that night on the plane back to my home state, hugging my giant Donald Trump body pillow. The pillow took up the 2 seats next to me, which I was grateful for. The rona is very serious and I don’t want it. That was when it clicked in my head. “I should jump out of this plane!” was what I had come up with in the span of 3 seconds. It was decided. I would jump out of the plane, because of my love for Donald Trump. I don’t what it is. The way his wrinkles smoothly wrap around his face. His pouty lips, so chapped but kissable. When he said ‘make America great again’ in 2015? Never forgot it, in fact it’s my motto. It was never great to begin with though, it became the sexiest country alive after that big fat orange man took charge. He’s 70 years old, which is a shame. What was I saying? Oh yeah, bungee jumping off a plane without the bungee. There I was, standing in front of the emergency door. Naturally, everyone was screaming in panic while I took off my clothes and enjoyed the breeze. I threw open the door and everything immediately got sucked out and crushed under the pressure of the atmosphere. Except for me. I was still alive. But I didn’t want to be. Maybe I am still in love with Donald Trump. I wish to meet him one day, but I have epilepsy and I’m afraid his neon orange skin with blind me, and cause me to have a seizure. I can’t help it, he’s so sexy. I shed thousands of tears writing this, and I hope you will too. Thank you for reading my story.","userName":"FatTorta101","title":"App almost made me kill myself (not clickbait)","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:42Z"}},{"id":"6173490893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Constant crashes freazes constantly  and promotes faciam","userName":"eiwheuajhh","title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T19:42:57Z"}},{"id":"6173480501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app keeps making me restart my phone and gave me a possible virus please don’t download this app 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 and if you do go ahead and leave bad review😡😡😠😠😠","userName":"toomadray","title":"wow... no words for this app","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:19Z"}},{"id":"6173472356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is trash tried to setup but failed","userName":"nikk gur","title":"I hate trump","date":"2020-07-08T19:36:32Z"}},{"id":"6173452112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The worst thing I have ever seen","userName":"xhulk on youtube","title":"This is the trash of the earth","date":"2020-07-08T19:29:39Z"}},{"id":"6173447650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, as well as strong regimentation of society and of the economy","userName":"ireallydontwanttoputdownaname","title":"Orange man bad😡","date":"2020-07-08T19:28:05Z"}},{"id":"6173423418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This apps is horrible I was my worst nightmare.","userName":"Lupeavila1206","title":"Do not download","date":"2020-07-08T19:19:57Z"}}]}
