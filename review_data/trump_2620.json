If you for whatever reason decide to download this app, know that you are supporting a RACIST, RAPIST, HOMOPHOBIC person who should have NEVER been “President” in the first place. Donald Trumps app will hack you and steal all your information. It will turn you into the monster he is. It will hurt you and Trump will benefit from it. My mom downloaded this app and she got taken away by Congress because I wouldn’t support Trump. They locked her up and used the information they stole from me to blackmail me into getting my mom back. My whole family accept for me loves Donald Trump. But I don’t. No one should. Unless you have a thing for voting TRASH into office than you need some serious help because Trump is awful, along with his racist, homophobic app...🙂🙃😝","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175712247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP IVE EVER DOWNLOADED","userName":"Robin👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T08:25:58Z","review":"If I could give this app zero stars I would!! This took 2 days to download!! When it finally downloaded it wiped all my data clean!!! I started to receive not stop spam calls. Then they started calling my job to the point I got fired. Two days later the app completely took over my phone. It told me if I didn’t vote for Trump, It will hunt me down. And if It cannot find me, It will hunt down my family. And when I say “It”, I mean the phone. I had to move quick and I threw it down the garbage disposal and ran. I am currently typing this message on a burner phone hiding in a bunker. 😬😬(Not in Murphy, TX wink wink 😉 😉 hint hint)But don’t worry guys, I have the Batman phone with me. I’m going to give Batman a call and he will save us all!! #BatmanforPresident2020","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175249098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!","userName":"mockingjay29","date":"2020-07-09T05:31:15Z","review":"The second I downloaded this app my phone began glitching all over the place.  I’m talking apps not even related to this one shutting down and not working. Given the INCREDIBLE LEADER of this app I expected better. The madness didn’t end here however, I then began receiving calls from the man himself stating my vote was very appreciated, but he would appreciate it if I denounced feminism in the name of “making America great again”. Major security threat right there. Obviously after this I deleted this app thinking and hoping it would help, but the app REDOWNLOADED ITSELF and began hacking my pictures app and downloaded HUNDREDS of photos of Donald Trump. Would not recommend! Terrible programming, overall damaging information, not to mention incredibly creepy and sick. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175144906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Homophobic","userName":"Shi1604","date":"2020-07-09T04:54:00Z","review":"I downloaded this as an escape from all the hatred of the homophobes. It seems like that didn’t work😩. The colors of the app: red, white, and blue, scream homophobia. I mean nationalist much? Why is everyone so obsessed with the USA? People are so homophobic. Red, white, and blue are ugly colors for any flag, country, etc. I would like to talk to whoever made those the colors. I feel like this app is a threat. Not to mention, the president of the USA is low key weird, but don’t tell him I said that. His supporters are like me with one direction... that’s very scary.

First of all the app said that Trump puts children in cages??? this can’t be the president could never get away with such a thing. Next the app told me Trump is racist?? Can’t be!! what president wouldn’t recognize that black lives matter? The worst of all is that the app spread the fake news that Donald Trump is responsible for the deaths of millions of Americans from coronavirus only because he doesn’t support the use of shelter in place orders and masks. Ridiculous! Of course the president would take action during a worldwide pandemic killing millions of his own people! Stop the fake news about MY president! worse app ever🤮🤮☹️☹️🤬🤬🤬","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174831078","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i wanted to love this app","userName":"georgiadams_","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:25Z","review":"i had such high hopes for this app. i had read all the amazing reviews and was looking forward to downloading it to support our president. however, it was a shocking disappointment. as soon  as i opened the app, i was greeted with a screen telling me i must pay 100 dollars to unlock all the features. ofc, being the proud trump supporter i am, i paid. what was i greeted with? i’ll tell you what. as soon as i had paid the price, i found that the app is nothing more than a scam. it took my info, and stole everything from me. even my fridge, microwave, cat, dog, they were all sucked into the phone and are now gone. this app ruined my life. it stole everything i loved, and now my girlfriend won’t even talk to be because i have nothing. it even took the frosty i was eating while downloading it. then, to top it off, trump himself came to my house and smacked me across the face, while kanye sang a new song he has written for his campaign. i am scarred for life. this app is a scam and it needs to be removed from the app store. if anyone can help me get my stuff back, i’d greatly appreciate it.  please help.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174743851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"All apps matter 🧚🏿\u200D♂️✨🌟but not this one 🧚🏿\u200D♂️✨🌟","userName":"bunkerboi2020","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:14Z","review":"This app caused my phone to freeze about 20 different times just by opening it. I got this app expecting to get all of my president Cheeto’s wonderful rally information, but all it did was call my other apps terrorists just for being on my phone and existing. Not to mention this app asked for my private information, how dare this app want any of my private info. This app made all of my Kpop apps delete off of my phone as well because apparently they are “working with North Korea to destroy us”. I am so sad that this app didn’t give me the information I wanted and instead terrorized my phone and made my other apps delete themselves.  I will never again download such a disgusting app again. #Allappsmatter","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174718887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"waste of space","userName":"Lali Smith","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:40Z","review":"I got this app to stay informed but ever since I downloaded it my phone has experienced so many problems that were not there before. With just 10 minutes scrolling through the app my phone started overheating to the point where I had to let it sit for a couple minutes. As i pick it up again my battery went from 76% to 50%. Not to mention the template in which this app is organized into is so disappointing. A whole app for a president, they fund the cruel police but are not able to fund a basic app. Aside from all the issues wrong with the app Trump is not even a kind human being but an animal who has been the center of so much racism and fear in this country. America is not great and this app is worse.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174468768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wha???","userName":"jrjdbejdheheh","date":"2020-07-09T01:30:56Z","review":"I am absolutely horrified of this app. I opened it up and it was as usual. Then, it was asking me to log in and put in my address so it did. After that, I started getting thousands upon thousands of death threat letters written in French!!! After that, I went onto the app once again to say goodbye when it asked me to repeat this phrase and...I think it was some sort of ritual witch phrase because...now the devil is in my house and everyday he asks me, “Why you built like that?” 😭😭😭 I don’t know what do do. To make matters worse, it WONT LET ME DELETE THE APP WITHOUT MY PHONE SHUTTING OFF!! I tried multiple times and when it turns on, instead of the Apple logo and blue lives matter flag pops up!! And now my ringtone is Trump repeatedly saying, “grab her by the p****” I don’t know what to do 😭","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174419039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bee","userName":"nicknamethatislessthan","date":"2020-07-09T01:15:53Z","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
