Trump would never post any of these things. He is most definitely not a hateful nor racist person. He would NEVER lie it is kk- oh my bad I mean American supporters. He loves alllivesmatte- I mean he loves everyone and wants what is best for this country. I’m still waiting for him to build the wall even though I thought we’d raised the money but I’m not sure anymore because the app doesn’t even talk about the walll. I don’t know anymore it’s all just broken promises at this point. I don’t even know who I am at this point. See this isn’t a good at it’s making me question my existence. Why did “we” vote for him again? Wasn’t he supposed to make America great again? Because.... chiiilllldddd it looks like it’s crumbling 😗. Anyways y’all don’t download this app it made my phone freeze like solid ice and now my phone is broken and I have to get it checked later at the store where I’ll probably have to wear a mask. 😂","userName":"not DJT's fan","date":"2020-07-09T12:33:34Z","title":"Awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175275353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was trying to download this app because of my LoVE FoR THe pREsIDenT💋🍊but it took almost 24 hours to download and while it was downloading it played “deepthroat” by cupcake and now my 4 year old child know the whole song lyric from lyric that was very upsetting because she had a show and tale in her class on zoom and she sing the whole song for them she has now been expelled from that school But when I did finally open the app and DEMON CAME OUT OF MY IPHONE 6+ ROSE GOLD😿 that demon sacrificed my hairless cat to the god of cat litter,while the demon was drinking the blood of my hairless cat I walked into the kitchen to see my husband eating a 12 pack of hotdogs I would have never thought that my own husband that I’ve been married for 20 years with is a glizzy goblin,a glizzy gladiator,a glizzy destroyer,a glizzy muncher,a glizzy demolisher,a glizzy assassin,a glizzy emperor,a glizzy ninja,a glizzy phenom,and even a glizzy captan he was in that kitchen having a frank feast😿right in front of our child then my home was set an on fire by a Cyclops and I entered the gulag😾","userName":"bandoelyse","date":"2020-07-09T05:41:29Z","title":"Do not ever download this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175168599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I tried to open it and my phone shut down🤬 I tried again and my fridge teleported into my bed room! It took 8 hours to get it back into to kitchen. Every time I got a notification my phone would die, like 0%. I had to get a new microwave cause when I opened the app it went falling out the window, luckily my window was open. This is just straight trash🤮🤮. What type of president makes an app you can’t open without your tub turning on! How does that even happen?! This is disgusting! Karen you lied to me, you said this app was good what kind of phone you got? The flip phone? I can’t believe it makes my car go off when I swipe away a notification. Like what kind of app makes your phone fly out your hand. This one🤢🤮. Don’t get this app unless you want your fish to try and grow legs. It’s absolutely trash and just all in all a bad app. The graphics were soooooo terrible. It’s like reading an old video game. The app really said 👾! Like what?!  Don’t get it! My cat tried to eat itself! Don’t get it! It’s horrible!🤬","userName":"trash🤬app","date":"2020-07-09T05:02:07Z","title":"WORST APP EVER😤🤬🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174749738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"First off I’d like to say the over all aesthetic of this app is absolutely Awful 🤢. Upon opening the app, I was shocked to see the ugly patterns of red white and blue everywhere, I actually ended up dry heaving!!!! This must be changed at once, the harsh hateful colors hurt your eyes and make you feel threatened 😬😥. Second of all a picture of a horrific monster was plastered all over the app!! It was so fat and orange with small slits for eyes 😖😖 I was so scared!!! My whole family went running away every time I tried to show them it, and believe me I’m a big horror film fan but this....was even too much for me to handle 😡😡😡. Last but definitely NOT least, the followers of this “app” are part of some cult 😖😬. They were plastering hate speech and propaganda everywhere I looked! Something about how “all lives matter” like duh! Of course they do!! Idiots!! The wore these deep red hats, the color of blood 🩸 ahh! No wonder, they want the blood of children for their sacrifices!!! So I’m giving this a 1 star rating, wish I could give it 0 tbh 😖😔😥","userName":"mylefttiddyhurts","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:01Z","title":"Ah!!! Help!!

I was so scared and have never experienced anything like this when waiting for an app to load which took 3 hours just for it to install??I threw my phone across the room and my phone turned on and off when the app was open the whole entire time and my cat brought out the bible and threw it right on top of my phone and we both blacked out. I woke up the next day and immediately erased the app. I still can’t accept the fact that this happened over an app made for people like why does this even exist it destroyed my innocence😔anyways stream yikes🙄💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽💕💕💕💕😝😝🦶🏼🦶🏼🦶🏼🦶🏼👁👅👁👁👅👁🔥👄🔥","userName":"sinjin minaj","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:55Z","title":"traumatized and now I have to go to see a therapist","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173922160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I got this app to try and support my president as we all should, however I was shocked when I realized the real purpose of this app. When signing up for the app they asked for a lot of information about my family like their heights weight and any special talents they had. At first I was confused but I got over it because this is Trump we’re talking about he’s obviously going to use this information for good. I finished signing up and went to sleep only to be woken up in the middle of the night to 3 clowns and a tightrope walker pulling my family into the back of a clown car. I begged them to stop and all they did was sing a song about how grateful Trump was for my contributions to his cause. I’ve been quite upset for a few days but in the end I am serving my country by giving up my family and I stand with this administration no matter what. The only reason I gave this a one star review was because the navy blue text looks black to me and we all know how we feel about black on Trumps side of the internet.

Now I am feeling the urge to call police on any minority I see?!🤯😰 I don’t know what is happening to me!! I mean I’m a woman so I know trump should be able to control my body but this is crazy!! My mom voted for Bernie and I’m now getting the urge to set her house on fire?!😳😨 I’m deleting this app now to stop me from my actions even tho all trump supporters are above the law, I don’t want to kill anyone!! Why do cops enjoy it so much? NOT FUN!! It’s ok I can still praise our savior lord orangiepants in church without a mask because that’s against the constitution!!!

First of all, I can’t even open the app without having it crash within only a few minutes of use. How am I supposed to be getting up to date information about our president when his app won’t even function properly! You would think that being as rich as he is, he would have the financial means to fix this issue, but all it does it reflect on the fact that he is too busy and doesn’t care enough to keep his loyal supporters informed. If that wasn’t enough, ever since I downloaded the app I have been getting 20 spam calls a day from random numbers all over the country. I answer them and it’s just young children prank calling me! I feel severely disrespected and am hurt that our president would be promoting an app that would cause so much chaos in the life of the people he is supposed to be in charge of taking care of. Don’t make the mistake I made and NEVER download this horrible piece of junk!","userName":"Charrassic Park","date":"2020-07-08T21:20:56Z","title":"DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173725237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"As I downloaded the app I was expecting to see some professionalism, but instead I saw a dictator and rapist?! I was thoroughly confused and disgusted. Then the app required me to GIVE OUT MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?! There is no way I would give that out to anyone, but my family. I am deeply offended and hurt. No way am I gonna let the government track me and know where I live. My social security number is for me and only me. How dare they ask me to for that type of information! As for the quality of the app, they must’ve had a flawed designer because the app is so slow and constantly crashing. It’s so annoying and just not well set up. The layout and formatting is confusing and hard to read. I have 20/20 vision and still, I couldn’t read some things! That’s unacceptable to me. One last thing, as soon as I downloaded the app my phone kept ringing with alerts that were saying I had a virus planted in it. This app crashed my phone and I had to wait at apple support to restore my phone. Do not I REPEAT do not download this app.","userName":"Karen L.
