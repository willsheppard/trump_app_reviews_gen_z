So i naturally called the police but they were trump CLONES. they took me away and PUT ME in a COP car. so then i used my witchcraft to break free and saw that trump clones his face and put them on gen z. and then i set them free which meant trump was rid of his power. he almost killed me.","date":"2020-07-09T06:32:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"xhjdjrjfje","rating":1,"title":"bad app"}},{"id":"6174472511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app out of curiosity. however, once i downloaded this app strange things started to happen. at night when i would get ready for bed my phone would begin blaring chants “vote trump!” as if it was an alarm. this seemed to me a mating call for other trump supporters because they began to swarm the window outside my bedroom like moths to a flame. i got zero sleep. this went on for weeks. when the day would start, i would begin to vividly hallucinate an orange, cheeto-looking bunker boi every where i went. it was terrifying. this app also possessed my phone, showing only trump related media and images. siri became a racist, sexist, homophobic, and misogynistic voice, taking in the characteristics of our dear president. my screensavers changed to the trump flag and would not go away. I tried to delete the app but it began to yell curses and slurs at me. i ultimately had to burn my phone and through it into the grand canyon. i am writing this from my ipad! i would appreciate it if you never download this app unless you enjoy racist, sexist, misogynistic, and homophobic propaganda! demon possession also seems to follow the downloading of this app!","date":"2020-07-09T01:32:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"sophkate","rating":1,"title":"curiosity killed the cat ❌🐱🪓🥰"}},{"id":"6173219123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I have ever used in my life. It has been downloading for the last SEVEN YEARS. Throughout the last seven years the app has treated me terribly. Every time I look in the direction of the app to see the time left to download it somehow knew. Then it says an array of disgusting and racist insults at me. It has brought down my confidence. In order to raise my self esteem I tried to go to therapy. Unfortunately the therapist office was destroyed by a tsunami minutes before I arrived. The app knew. I tried to go to other buildings and they would burst into flames or completely dissolve. Then to make it worse the app would laugh at me and mock me for trying. After seven years of insults the app downloaded and I thought things would be better, I was wrong. The police showed up at my door and accused my hamster of MURDER. I was shocked because I don’t have a hamster. They accused it of running of and changing its identity and I was blamed. Later they admitted it was because they were racist 😔and trump supported their racism. I’m writing this from a contraband phone in prison. If you see this PLEASE don’t download this app. I spent 50 years in jail to learn my lesson.","date":"2020-07-08T18:10:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mercy West 💕💅🏽🧚\u200D♂️","rating":1,"title":"I HATE THIS APP"}},{"id":"6177802186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i cannot believe this app exists. i first try to download the app to get more information about america because...you know as an american citizen i should be educated on what's going on. i first open the app to see this horrible...wrinkly man. he looks like he calls people slurs for a living. also his horrible looking hair like...it looks like a dirty mop was placed on his head & called it a day. don't even get me started on his skin. you can tell he does not shower. LOOK AT HIS SKIN. IT'S CALLING FOR SUNSCREEN. the amount of damage in the skin is horrific. it left me traumatized. he is a perfect example of what not to be as a human being. also don't even get me started on the delusional things he says. the app tries to tell you all the inhumaine things that the president wants to do. the app does not know that covid-19 is something that should be taken seriously. i cannot believe people believe what this app says. in fact...i am pretty sure this app has viruses. if i could give this app zero stars...i would. WASTE OF TIME & NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT TOOK UP SO MUCH SPACE ON MY PHONE FOR NO REASON. I CAN GET A BETTER APPLICATION THAN THIS ONE. do not use ever...anyways black lives matter & happy pride month😗","date":"2020-07-09T18:41:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Itss_jenny01","rating":1,"title":"trauma"}},{"id":"6177723059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So i downloaded this app because i am a 🇱🇷true american🇱🇷 but as soon as i did, all the lights in my house went out and then i heard all the cheeto bags in my house start to shake. they fused together, and made what appears to be our president. i was so scared and ran out of my house. The app wanted to give me notifications which of course i said yes to despite the scare, and then it asked for my location which i found terrifying. why would it need to know where i am, especially since i think it already knows. then the door bursts open and i see him, and all his 🍊ness. i fall on my knees and the only words i know how to say are “Trump 2020.” suddenly the only food i crave is cheetos and all my opinions have turned racist and sexist. Because of this app my phone lagged so bad it powered off multiple times, just like my brain after seeing this cheeto’s app. i woke up in my bathtub the next morning, with my chest stitched up. apparently he took my heart out, because if he didn’t, i would be able to have enough sense to know that he is a horrible leader! this app will leave you heartless and terrified with a laggy phone.

I was thoroughly disappointed. Instead I saw a sad excuse for a picture book in digital format. A kid was yelling some nonsense at some other kids he didn’t like. This is like a setup for a children’s book right? There’s the bully who through some sus parent or teacher’s actions ends up learning the power of friendship yea? I didn’t even need to read till the end of the story to figure out that wasn’t going to happen. What kinda children’s book is this? Where are the MORALS? The VALUES? Where does the bully LEARN? To be fair, the pictures were all very detailed, but the plot was lacking. This is absolutely something no child should ever read. The characters in children’s books are meant to be looked up to! Understood! They are meant to see change so our kids can understand what they could be! I would never read this to my 4 year old. Poorly written and executed. Oh, but if this were the politics app I thought I was getting, it would probably be fine. After all the American president is the big kid bully on the playground, right?","date":"2020-07-09T09:59:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mickle el Pickle","rating":1,"title":"I wanted politics, not a crappy children’s book"}},{"id":"6175044829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I download this app to keep up with the news trusting that our astound president🤡 will keep me up to date with current news. 💁What i got in return was HORRENDOUS🧟\u200D♂️. I am guessing there was a glitch 🧿but when i first opened the app the image 📸of the 44th presidents pp 🍤was there as he was getting an orange 🍊spray tan. My dog 🐶saw is & told the neighbors cat 🐱which lead to the mailman’s chicken 🐔to hear & the thought of orange 🍊shrimp 🍤was too much. He had a fatal stroke👁👄👁 that lead him to be paralyzed from the waist down. He is now unable to produce egg 🐣& his wife unicorn🦄 depended on this income. 📉💸Now they have 3 baby donkeys with no chance of a future🔮 & my refrigerator 🧮is running away. I think my fridge went to canada 🇨🇦 since it’s a way better country 💯& their money smells like maple 🍁syrup. But in conclusion Donald J Trump👹🤡 is a racist dirt bad 💩that has been allowed into office despite much evidence of child 👶 fetishes & clear dementia health 😷issues. This cheeto puff 🎃need to be renounced & if the younger generation 👩\u200D🎓🧑\u200D🎓👨\u200D🎓has to bully him out then we’ll take on the responsibility. cause we’re 🧚\u200D♀️ 𝓼𝓾𝓹𝓮𝓻𝓲𝓸𝓻 🧚\u200D♀️. thank you & feel the bern 🥵🤩","date":"2020-07-09T04:21:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"𝓰𝓮𝓷 𝔃 𝓻𝓮𝓹 🙈🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"title":"My worse mistake was download this app"}},{"id":"6174870688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yesterday I decided to download the app of our racist Cheeto president and not only did it take 2 days to download it deleted all my apps including the best one yet tiktok which btw is amazing and better than this one. I downloaded all my apps again and the rest of my day went on like normal, finally on my second day of download the app the second it finished a crinkly octopus started floating around my house  out of control and through ink all over the place. I was obviously startled and blew on it, it weirdly disappeared then a bigger version of it eat my meal so that really got me angry and I smacked it out of existence. Not even 10 minutes after that a floating Cheeto man glitched on my phone talking about deleting an amazing app and making America white again, that’s when I realized that it was the app so I somehow was able to delete the app and everything went away! It’s been a week since it happened and since I deleted the app these absurd things stopped happening. Waring installing this app not may but WILL cause paranormal situation and a talking Cheeto man gitching on your mobile device to not recommend, not even to my worse enemy.","date":"2020-07-09T03:28:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"herrrrrrroooooooo","rating":1,"title":"Crinkly octopus"}}]}
