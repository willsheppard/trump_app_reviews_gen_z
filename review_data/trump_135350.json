Oikawa has a door for a butt. Why? Because it just makes sense. Imagine Bokuto having a small butt.YOU CAN’T. Oikawa with a big butt looks weird. But Bokuto makes it work. In more ways than one. Anyways I give this app a one star because it said that Boku No Pico was the best anime. We all know that Hunter Haikyuu Club no Toilet is the best anime.","title":"Why Bokuto having a big butt makes sense","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"NotChloe5"}},{"id":"6146051957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T23:18:33Z","review":"Okay now that I have your attention, get me to 1k on TikTok @bartukb_01 🤩🤩🤩","title":"Too many glitches.

I would notice random things in my redneck ohio home moved around from where I had left them!! I have a specific cup filled with my cats pee that I keep next to my bed and IT GOT MOVED INTO MY KITCHEN RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I KEEP MY LOADED BAZOOKA (keep in mind the only person that I live with is my mother that has alzheimer’s , the only thing that can trigger her memory is the song replay by iyaz ❤️❤️). So i decided to place a camera in my house to see why this disgraceful stuff was happening to me!! Last night while I was sound asleep in my bed dreaming about coleslaw and ice tea I got an alert that my camera had captured someone! I jumped out of bed to see the footage. Only to see THAT TRUMPIE WAS INSIDE OF MY HOUSE!!!!! On the camera it showed that he had entered through the window and was hiding in the cabinets under my kitchen sink !!!! I quickly grabbed my bazooka and cocked it back. I opened my cabinets and found TRUMP EATING RAT POOP... I DRAGGED HIM OUT AT GUNPOINT AND ROUNDHOUSE KICKED HIM OUT OF MY DOOR. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP KEEP YOUR FAMILY AND CAT PEE SAFE !!!!!!!","title":"TRUMPET HARASSED ME","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Catpeelover99"}}]}
