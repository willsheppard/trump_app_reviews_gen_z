That is an outrageous amount of time to be desperately 🥵🥵🥵waiting.  I’m sorry but I had to take my mattress a shower. This app has already been a big burden on me. However, this didn’t stop. Once it was downloaded, the rats in the walls started barking at me, “orange man 🍊squirts 💧💦💦on children👶.” Gurrlll, I froze with fear. All I can remember is my child hood trauma of being forced to eat watered 🥫🍝 down spaghetti o’s  IN the floor. That’s not it. The app also installed a virus 🦠 into my phone that CRAKED MY SCREEN and showed me Chinese communist propaganda. Now I have to go and buy a new phone ☎️ but the app also spawned a corn 🌽 head man that sukked up all my monies 💸through his butwhole 🤧🤧. I recommend that you do not THINK 💭 about downloading this app. This app should be ashamed to be on the Apple 🍎 store. If anything, you should be able to rate this app ZERO 0000000 STARS🌟. Because I downloaded this app, my rights have been taken away and I have been disrespected. Please save yourself the tourture. -urs truly 💋 XOXO","isEdited":false,"userName":"QuackQuackQK"}},{"id":"6179108424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:35:05Z","rating":1,"title":"-739379277493739297418/10","review":"honestly worst and most embarrassing decision in my life. mind you i’ve made many embarrassing decisions in my life. wouldn’t recommend, the layout is 🤢 in general it’s just nasty. i even asked my dog to rate it he said the same thing as he was running away to cry. the app even made my dog cry and that’s not cool 😾😿.","isEdited":false,"userName":"NO❤️😺"}},{"id":"6179107792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:34:51Z","rating":1,"title":"This App Is The Real Pandemic","review":"We're no strangers to love\nYou know the rules and so do I\nA full commitment's what I'm thinking of\nYou wouldn't get this from any other guy\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nAnd if you ask me how I'm feeling\nDon't tell me you're too blind to see\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\n(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\n\nEXCEPT HE HAS LET US DOWN\nHE HAS MADE US CRY\nHE HAS RUN AROUND AND DESERTED US\nHE HAS TOLD LIES TO HURT US\nTIME TO SAY GOODBYE\n\n-Sincerely Disenfranchised","isEdited":false,"userName":"GreatScotyP"}},{"id":"6179107561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:34:46Z","rating":1,"title":"This app is soo horrible","review":"I am experiencing random app pop ups that interrupt what i am doin on my phone and they are hard to close out. Most of the time its an ad for a game and other times its an add for insurance. Some pop ups make noise some dont.  Its  irritating when I am listening to music on YouTube it totally stops the song all together and after that the ad just stays on and it does not resume the music. I have disabled and deleted apps that I have recently uploaded thinking that may be the cause however it is not fixed the pop ups. When I minimize the screen I can see sometimes it shows that it's Google one time it was talk-to-text in another time it was my green. And each time I minimize it's a different who is the screenshot of an ad that popped up as I was  writing out this message .","isEdited":false,"userName":"jsns dj s"}},{"id":"6179106063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:34:15Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"Hdjdfnf","isEdited":false,"userName":"paoirnkl18364"}},{"id":"6179104515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:33:39Z","rating":1,"title":"Poop!??!?","review":"I opened the app and the first thing I saw was a screen full of poop emojis like what the hell","isEdited":false,"userName":".-%..-"}},{"id":"6179103314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:33:10Z","rating":1,"title":"This is the worst app ever!","review":"Like I have placed in my phone number so many times and they just never sent the verification code. I tried but it never worked! I might even think that they are tracking us like why would you even need my phone number. What does my phone number have to do with the app. The Notification might even blow up my phone anyways like this is just too much for me.I will tell all of my friends and family about this terrible app because just having this app was too much for me.
