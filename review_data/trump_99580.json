As soon as I opened the app, I felt a massive surge of an unsettling feeling. A few seconds later my doorbell rang. And it rang again. And again. And again. It rang nine times in total. I opened the door to see why my doorbell was constantly ringing 👀. And I will never unsee what I saw on my front porch. It was a gargantuas pile of Cheetos that was barreling towards me. I was slammed against my kitchen floor and my house immediately started to fill up with the tsunami of every kind of Cheeto. I’m talking Crunchy, Flamin’ Hot, Crunchy Cheddar Jalapeño, and even that Munchies Snack Mix. As the flooding of my house continued, an odd aroma started to fill the house. It smelled like Sargento Colby Jack Cheese, hotdog water, and a Dollar General bathroom after Memorial Day. The fumes made my nose burn and was added to the unbearable aching pain of the thousands of Cheeto bags slowly crushing the air out of my lungs. I am writing this as all of this is occurring. This is a warning to all Daddy Trump stans. This app is endangering me my life and dignity, but it doesn’t have to risk yours. And I’d you must download this wretched app, put in your swimming goggles because you will be swimming for your life.\n                                             Sincerely, Bob Duncan","title":"🌈💅🌺 Daddy Donny is QUAKING 🥰✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6075301478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"This is literally JB","date":"2020-06-14T16:11:16Z","review":"Hi this app is trash, just like our president","title":"Garbage"}},{"id":"6074808990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"relgoany","date":"2020-06-14T13:48:52Z","review":"The creators of this need to be fired!
