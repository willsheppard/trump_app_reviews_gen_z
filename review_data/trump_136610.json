As a proud Gen Z, I should not have to deal with this crap!! ✨🧚\nIma list many incredible reasons why you should not get this stupid app!! 😡😡😡\n\nńümbęr 1: Very Racist!!! I believe that the man who runs this app is very rude and racist!! He is always being very offensive when ever he speaks, or even just looks at anything. All the spam messages I received were very rude!! They were all very racist!!! 😩✨🧚🐀\n\nñùmbêr 2: Very homophobic!!! When reading the spam messages and listening to the spam calls, it was very rude to anyone who is LGBTQ+ or who supports them!!! I feel personally attacked, and quite frankly I feel like I am worth less by being bisexual. 🥵🐀🥰✨🧚\n\nSo basically I am getting tired of typing and I want to go watch some Tik Tok, BUT please don’t download. Very rude app! If there was a 0 star option, I would pick it!"}},{"id":"6180165814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"scary 🌝🌝","title":"Awesome","date":"2020-07-10T08:53:38Z","review":"Trump 2020"}},{"id":"6180165475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"POTATOTRIBEFORLIFE","title":"TRASHHHH","date":"2020-07-10T08:53:30Z","review":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!
