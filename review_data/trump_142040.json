Doing my laundry\n2. Painting my toenails\n3. Nurturing my dog\n\nI have found that I do not have a single piece of clean clothing, my toenails barely have any polish on them because the last time they where painted was when that guy on the bus said that he would paint them for me, and my dog is humping my cat. \n\nI definitely do not recommend getting this app, it didn’t do anything it said it would. I had to delete subway surfers in order to make space on my phone and when I downloaded subway surfers again,I realized that I forgot my password and I lost my coins that I had been saving up since 2011 to get the legendary rocket board 2000.
