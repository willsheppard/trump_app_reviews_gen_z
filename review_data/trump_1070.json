Not only that, it started making my phone glitch when I wasn’t even using the app! Now I randomly receive calls from China and Russia about voting for Trump and I didn’t even give them my information! I didn’t start receiving these calls until after I downloaded the app...I’m pretty sure they were able to hack my account and steal all of my personal information! (Not to mention, I keep getting notifications constantly from the app trying to convince me that Trump isn’t a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, misogynistic, transphobic, ableist manipulator who thrives off of making others feel worthless and receiving praise from people who only watch FoxNews and believe that masks are a form of mind control created by liberal snowflakes!) I would not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T03:41:57Z"}},{"id":"6174841334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"awfulness!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"SEEBY DEEBY DOO","review":"awfulness. positivity the worst app out here. my pet Caterpillar ate my phone and threw up the singular app. it needed to be rushed to the hospital but then it died, and i blame this app. i am filled with sadness and grief. i cannot believe that my only pet and caterpillar is truly gone. it feels like yesterday when we first meet and i asked my caterpillar to be my forever pet and best friend. i will truly miss this it and i will forever hold onto the memories we have shared over the years of being best friends together. i remember watching movies and singing song together. i am full of fury as i was tormented by watching my bestfriend and forever pet die. i blame this app sincerely but since i am not a cruel and evil person, and i am willing to honor my dead caterpillar wish of not being mean so i will be leaving a one star review. please send prayers for my caterpillar. btw people say they are having glitches or whateva so might want to consider that in your app download.","date":"2020-07-09T03:19:27Z"}},{"id":"6174766510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"liz_lmao","review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.","date":"2020-07-09T02:57:07Z"}},{"id":"6174430428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"tHiS iS oNLY fOR mATuRE aDULTs","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"breadcheese","review":"By opening this app, I instantly threw up. Do not recommend I lost a good meal because of this awful, horrible, disgusting, disturbing, bad, inappropriate, poor, second class, faulty, awful, disgraceful, worthless, laughable, 𝓲𝓷𝓪𝓭𝓮𝓰𝓾𝓪𝓽𝓮, sorry excuse for an app and for a president (don’t get me started.)Don’t download it. Just don’t. \n\nAlso to all those people saying,”this app reviews should only be said by mature people.” One i would say look in the mirror you’re in the wrong side of history and two we’re more smarter than you and have so many reasons we hate that orange expired racist and rapist cheeto. Tell me otherwise. Oh and hes not my president. No no no. I didn’t want him. So let me tell u if he screws up (i mean he always does) again and it effects all of united states negatively....thats youre fault not mine. Buh bye! And for all those people who support trump let me summarize what i typed out since you guys aren’t that smart. 🤢🤮🖕🍊❌","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:20Z"}},{"id":"6174302878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app everrrrrrrr","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Elss_esme","review":"When I went to download this app I thought I was gonna get good real news. Instead I got the picture of the ugliest looking creature to have ever existed🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. I actually threw up. I am now traumatized and partially blind in one eye. I can not believe people take pictures of that thing. I can’t believe that they decided to put that disgusting cheetoh puff in a “news” app. I have to take medicine everyday for it. I seriously hope that the App Store takes care of this inhumanity. I also realized that all of the “news” is just a bunch of of lies made up by the mutant cheetoh puff and his army of ugly alien looking racists🎃🎃🎃🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤬🤬🤬. I really hope that they take care of this monstrous app and all of the insanity held within it😡😡😡. I am very angry and disappointed. I will not be using this again and will not recommend it to anyone for their safety and the safety of everyone around them. PLEASE TAKE THIS DOWNNNNNNNNNNNNN. ITS ALL LIES AND UGLY PICTURES OF AN UGLY BALL OF ORANE WITH DUST FOR HAIR","date":"2020-07-09T00:38:37Z"}},{"id":"6174026100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤡🤡🤡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ah yes soup","review":"So I was trying to get my chips out of the air conditioner when suddenly this dust comes out and tells me that I need to make my bed. I was so confused and then I opened the app and I saw fat baby in the fridge and she was trying to get out and move to the freezer. So I took out fat baby and there was a whole DRAGON behind her and I was like oh well that’s why she wanted to move out of the fridge because the dragon is making the fridge hot and so I went to get my holy water and it was GONE!!! I was like omg my nail polish was chipping so I went to go get more and the DRAGON WAS THERE PAINTING UTS NAILS LIKE NICKI MINAJ. So I told it to put a base coat first and so it told me to go t pose upside down so I did and I hit my nose and then it warped into a mushroom!!!! So then my sister saw it and was like mm yummy so she ate the mushroom and but my nose off and then my science teacher came out and used her magnets to pull my nose to the North Pole and she cursed me. Now I am stuck swinging on the fan. Horrible app I rate it 1/10.","date":"2020-07-08T22:58:02Z"}},{"id":"6173768647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"corinna.c","review":"This app is just horrible. The second i downloaded it my phone literally glitched and i had to turn it off and then on again and once I finished doing that, i opened the app and it kept turning the screen black so i just got out. I gave it a few days and i tried opening the app again and it started turning the screen an orange color and all of a sudden i hear a voice it seemed like it was trying to hypnotize me saying, “yell at minorities and tell them to go back to their country!” I am seriously dissatisfied and upset. I do NOT recommend this app at all because it seems as the president here is actually an alien since he’s trying to hypnotize  me and who knows who else he’s hypnotized already. And if he is in fact an alien, then he should NOT be president because we want no illegal aliens as president or in this country according to the president himself. Because of all this I will be voting biden in the november election and also stan bts.","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:23Z"}},{"id":"6173689027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app in the world!🤬","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"The anonymous 2020","review":"This app is so bad it’s unspeakable! This app not only gave me a virus but gave my Mexican grandma a heart attack! My grandma is so afraid of trump that she passes out whenever she sees him. So we restrict anything having to do with trump! But one day she got mail and can u guess what was on that mail paper? A picture of Donald trumps face promoting this disgrace of an app. And can you guess what happened? Yea she had a HEART ATTACK!!!! Almost causing her death! I hope this apps gets sued and taken off of all platforms! Oh and speaking about the virus I downloaded this app thinking that you had to write the review on the app when it was already downloaded but to my surprise and advantage you didn’t so then I proceeded to delete this shameful app and a day later I got a virus so bad I had to take my phone to the App Store to get it fixed which cost me a fortune! And that’s not considering the hospital BILL! I would give this zero stars but u can’t So GO TO HELL!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:52:13Z"}},{"id":"6173518706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sashapants_42","review":"this app infuriates me so much. not only does it infringe on my freedom, but it reminds me of how much of a dictator trump is. the only app that relates to obama is a meme app... why does trump need his own app? oh right... he loves to infringe on our freedoms. and banning tik tok?? bruh this baby is LOSING and he’s mad. i am disgusted that people still support this lunatic. the way he acts is so unpresidential and i am baffled by the fact that this app even exists. i think the app store should remove this app at ONCE due to its disgusting content and it’s purpose- to poison minds. i don’t understand why this pedophilic app is still up when there’s literal child p*rn on this app. all i see is gross stuff- this app is going DOWN. so is trump and his dictatorship. also, the app crashes every time i open it and doesn’t even work. the buttons malfunction, the side bar glitches out, and i also have a cyst on my foot. ye it’s his fault. BURN THIS APP!! shoutout to tik tok for being smart and settle for biden!","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:25Z"}},{"id":"6173421067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app gave me a seizure😟","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Gabe Itch❤️","review":"i downloaded this app bc obviously this is my lord president mighty cheeto man right😉. but then the app started flashing orange and white and my eyes and head couldn’t take it💔. I then went into cardiac arrest and am typing this from the ambulance 💃🏼. But that’s not why i’m giving this a one star ⭐️ . While i was arriving to my hospital room the cheeto dust man walked in yelling “RATE MY APP 5 STARS” and now i proceed to mark it one star to make the orange man get mad and turn into a tomato 🍅. And this is a true story bc i’m a real one and wouldn’t lie about this💯. His wife then went walked in and said “HELLO😳” and then fell to the floor giving me the chance to write this one star rating bc carrot man  is now beside her on the floor💅🏼. i do not recommend getting this app it gave me a seizure and my grandma alzheimer's 😔🙏🏽. the people that have the balls to keep this app must have mental illness 😟😟 (get well soon) anyways 😍 #bernie2020 #kicktheorangeoutofoffice (stay mad u cheeto dust lovers🧟\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T19:19:08Z"}}]}
