I find that terrifying and even when I turn my location off my phone still notifies me that the app is tracking me. It also glitches so bad that I can’t use my phone without completely resetting it. Instead of fixing these bugs, I think the app should just be removed from the App Store for forever. It’s a tracking software made by Trump and I don’t feel safe anymore.

This app is terrible. It functions horribly. The lag is so bad i can’t read or write or see anything. The pixels are all messed up from it as well. Honestly I’m disgusted it’s even in the App Store. I can’t believe apple allows people to download this app. My phone won’t work with it downloaded. I can’t make calls or send texts or take pictures. I can’t use my phone at all. What’s the point of having it if I can’t use it? The app also spreads lies and obscene words and gross pictures.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6173193326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Aleenae4","date":"2020-07-08T18:02:26Z","review":"I downloaded this in hopes of getting regular updates from my beloved POTUS but instead started receiving THREATS via email. Mr Trump and his administration have used my enabling of location services to place cameras outside my windows and email me pictures of myself and my family inside of our home with threatening messages such as “get out of this country, fat slugs” (I’m white and was BORN on American soil) and “EAT EGGS, FART BOY! WE’RE COMING FOR YOUR HEADS” over and over again. Sickening. I’m fearful for my life please DO NOT download this application.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app in the App Store"}},{"id":"6173190213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Moni742927","date":"2020-07-08T18:01:26Z","review":"This app took forever to download and after downloading it the app wouldn’t stop asking me to buy stuff that I said more than 10 times that I wouldn’t buy after closed the app at m to bank account it said that I paired something about this app, but it’s saying that the app is free, this app is horrible there is still more problems but I don’t wanna waste more time of my life I could be doing something else right now but the app is so terrible that I had to do a review!!!!😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THAT’S THE WORST APP I EVER TRIED BEFORE"}},{"id":"6173167114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":",adgs","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:02Z","review":"It took almost 2 weeks to download and I have perfectly good WiFi! This app map made my phone glitch so bad that it froze and I couldn’t even power off my phone! I then couldn’t even delete the app! My phone is a perfectly good iPhone X it shouldn’t be doing any of this. Then a couple days later after I deleted it my phone was still glitching from this app!

Right as he opened the app he hated what he saw so much he had a heart attack and died. I was in shock that my friend had just died right in front of my eyes. The app was still on and it was being sped so today I finally got up to delete the app. Would rate 0 stars if I could. Remove this app from the App Store","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It killed my friend 😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6173116230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sharovaro","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:59Z","review":"I downloaded this app and it literally took a week to download. After this app finally downloaded, I kept getting these pop ups even when I’m not using this app. Others may think “maybe it’s because of something else” but as soon as I downloaded this app my phone started to glitch. My phone got hot easily, my phone kept turning off and overall my phone is now glitchy because of this app and I blame Trump.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My phone is now broken because of this app"}},{"id":"6173097396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"app make brain go byebye","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:57Z","review":"I downloaded this app for my 5 year old Bobby Samuel because I thought it would be a good game for brain exercising. Unfortunately, I’m not seeing much progress in Bobby’s learning curve. Since downloading, my son has lost the ability to speak coherently and think logically. I think this app has deteriorated my son’s brain celIs. I want a refund. If I were to pick a superior app, it would be Subway Surfers. It’s hearty, makes you think fast and efficiently, and great app design overall.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No where near as good as Subway Surfers."}}]}
