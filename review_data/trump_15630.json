Every time I open the app my phone would shock me so violently that I think it is starting to cause issues with my heart. Terrible app planning and honestly im so dissatisfied in this app. Everything is false and ignorant.","date":"2020-07-09T14:50:56Z"}},{"id":"6177014803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE🧚🏽\u200D♀️😘","userName":"Erin❤️😍😘","review":"It took 1 month to download this disgrace of an app. Then when I opened it this ompa lompa lookin orange thing kept popping up on my screen.

It probably needs updated or something but whenever the main picture of trump pops up on my phone it’s like my phone just doesn’t want to see him and leaves the app. Also the first picture of him with his fist up is probably not a good choice we wouldn’t want anyone thinking he supports blm or anyone besides himself.","date":"2020-07-09T14:47:39Z"}},{"id":"6176996001","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is ✨traumatizing✨","userName":"i have the power of anime","review":"When I opened the app a Cheeto flew out and yeeted me to Mars a little minion saw my phone and threw me back to earth and I landed on a bunch of oompah loompahs and they started to eat me but then stoped when they saw the app and threw me into a haunted house and a gost tried to scare me but got scared when it saw my app. So it then threw me into the sea and a shark ate me and I died so now here I am on a llama 🦙 in heaven writing this review. \n\n     Goodbye my dear children, btw my bff is mike and ikes ciao","date":"2020-07-09T14:43:38Z"}},{"id":"6176987536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Buggy, crashes often","userName":"jerdyy","review":"I came here to educate myself on both sides but unfortunately this app made my phone crash multiple times and after a while I was unable to use the app at all!

My phone is now having issues but I’m not sure if it is from this app or not.","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:17Z"}},{"id":"6176886277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WORTH 0 STARS 🥱😿🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨💔","userName":"tiktack11","review":"If I could give this app negative stars I WOULD. the app took 87 days to even download. Once I opened the app my phone got a virus, causing me to need to buy a new phone ;/ if that wasn’t bad enough, the first thing I saw when I opened the app was this big fat ugly disgusting orange blob that, at this point, I’m too traumatized to even recall the looks of the monstrosity I saw.

Also this app made me realize Donald trump is a nasty, horrible, gross person that psychopaths like to call our “president” anyway BLACK LIVES MATTER, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, ABORTION IS NOT MURDER, TRUMP IS FASCIST, AND ICE NEEDS TO STOP KILLING PEOPLE AND KEEPING KIDS IN CAGES","date":"2020-07-09T14:11:48Z"}},{"id":"6176871012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERIBLE","userName":"ToKuteGurl","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with what was goinh on and it got me run over by a bus. It was also very racist and discriminating to ME and it was so disrespectful and didn’t treat me right! It kept asking for my phone number too even though i told it i had a boyfriend multiple times! The app accused me of cheating on it when I was never with it to begin with! I couldn’t believe the disrespect I had Received!","date":"2020-07-09T14:10:31Z"}},{"id":"6176858399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is terrible","userName":"youranonsource","review":"This app literally makes me feel so uncomfortable I think my phone is traumatized by even having the app on its temporary memory. It constantly made my phone crash and I’m not sure how much data it was taking from me. Garbage app: don’t download (if you’re going to, be advised: it’s not going to work. Might as well download it to leave a one-star review like I did).","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:13Z"}},{"id":"6176757667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T GET THIS😡","userName":"daisy☺️✨🧚❤️","review":"If i could give this app a zero i would. The first red flag was that it took 15 days to download and every time i opened the app i would get a notification about viruses. They would give me threats and one example was\n“IF YOU DON’T VOTE FOR TRUMP YOUR PHONE WILL GET HACKED”. Fast forward a few days and it actually did hack me to the point where i had to get a new phone. All in all this app is horrible and it costed me $600. DO NOT PURCHASE.","date":"2020-07-09T13:40:36Z"}}]}
