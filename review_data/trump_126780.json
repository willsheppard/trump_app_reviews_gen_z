Everyone was talking about an 🍊. He sounded sound and racist so I checked this app out🧚🧚... it took 4 dates to just download😔. Once I get on the app I start to feel nauseated, so I go to the restroom to take a fat poop💩, but w once it hits the toilet a noise speaks something to me and it said that he feels attracted to his children👨\u200D👦\u200D👦... scared I run to my soon to be favorite app, the Trump 2020 app🍊. Once I get on there pictures of Donald trumps 🍤 pops out at me, so I yell and think why would it do that. I thought to my self, maybe it was non white people because the app also told me only to support whites, but little do they know... I’m a    🐕 dog🐕 . So then as I continue to search the app it tells me to give money to                            🧚🍊Trump🍊🧚 so I donate 2 trillion dollars because he is amazing. Next as I keep looking it started to tell me some things disrespectful towards other cultures, and that women are figures and objects and that men are amazing🧚🧚. Once I see this my brain starts to get really ⭐️foggy⭐️ and I can’t think straight. All that I can think about is 🍊trump🍊. With the last of my energy I look at this wonderful app and I see something at the top that said something. It said make America great again, but I remembered America was never great, it was racially profiled and disrespectful. So then I delete the app, and now I’m here to tell you this. If you are a trump supporter you are racist and disgusting. Finally my head started to clear but some days I have flash backs of 🍊trump🍊 and his🍤😔. Even looking at my reflection in the mirror sometimes reminds me of IT... stay safe kids and settle for Biden","rating":1}},{"id":"6178103022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:51Z","userName":"donaldscoochiehairs","title":"nasti 👄🤢","review":"nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti nasti \nque asco me da ese naranja descraciado","rating":1}},{"id":"6178102138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:34Z","userName":"IPMDIABOFD😛","title":"Gen Z","review":"Trump is racist, sexist, homophobic, a rapist, and a dumbass. ✨if you take away tiktok, we’ll take away your app too hun😊 also, cut back on the spray tans, for one you’re orange and nobody wants to see your shrimp dick ever again -gen Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178102014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:32Z","userName":"hsisnsushsi","title":"👁👄👁","review":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6178101716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:26Z","userName":"*Insert nickname","title":"bad","review":"💕Gen Z ain’t going down without a fight💕This app is hella trash. -1000000/10","rating":1}},{"id":"6178101601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:17:24Z","userName":"joaquin skenanadore","title":"Trump is sh*t","review":"He is the worst person alive man looks like an orange has a shrimp.
