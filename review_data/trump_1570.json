I opened the app and was jumpscared by a tall orange that gave me chills. The app asked and begged me for my personal information that I can only assume they would use to track me down and force me to vote for an ungreatful orange. I was petrified. I declined the apps request and was suddenly in shock. MY PHONE FROZE! *gasp* I gasped for air but I could not achieve it  because the app was suffocating me with its hatred towards  everyone that mr trumpy trumpster does not agree with and with all the bull donkey that the orange puts into  wrongfully mad minds. As soon as I have successfully deleted this app I was sad. Sad that people vote for this idiot. Sad that people that vote for him don’t know the true damage this man is doing to millions of innocent lives. Educate yourself because you are truly in the wrong if you support this man.","date":"2020-07-08T20:48:52Z"}},{"id":"6173543314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump 2020🧚🏻💕✨but the simpsons version🧚✨🌈💫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Yourlocalnotso(9yearold)","review":"I can't believe ‼️ what this app📱has done ✅.

He’s a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, egotistic, immoral, idiot. He sexualizes women, even if it’s his own daughter. I refuse to contribute to his support. He has handled this pandemic horribly and blames it on other countries, instead of taking care of his own. All he honestly cares about is his fame, money, and same class colleagues. He’s slowly losing supporters, and to that I thank God. I do not wish to see him another 4 years taking this country down with him. This app is the worst possible thing you could download. Most trump supporters are immature and as you can see below this app, they even created an app to characterize themselves as trump and beat up the competition. I personally think this app is trash, just like our president.

I got this app for personal reasons. Was it to support trump I don’t know you tell me. 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💅 The point is, I downloaded this app and it glitched my whole entire phone. It brought a virus to my phone and I had to get a new one. I was thinking about the situation.🤔I feel like while I had this app on my devise I tu ink it stole my personal info: my contacts, search history, app control, and etc.🙄I really though this app would be amazing, but like I told you it stole my information and stole all my personal information on my phone 😤😡🤬. I want my money back for 1 reason and 1 reason only.... I needed to get a new phone just because of this app so I want full coverage on my new phone cause the app is in fault. I don’t want to be a “Karen” but if I have to....

Right when I opened bunker boys app a terrible picture of bunker boy and the flag behind him terrified me. The app asked for my phone number that just gives me obnoxious spam on bunker boys merch. To be honest I find the text messages so sad and desperate to buy his hideous merch. I signed all in the app and it asked me to share the link to people; as if! I went on to explore the app and let me just say it’s terrible! The loading symbol is a T for trump and I just find it self centered. This app only provides the republican side which I totally think is a terrible idea. This app should show both sides but whatever🤷🏻\u200D♀️ if u can get past this terrible app that is ran by a terrible man, the terrible information on there, the SPAM, and overall a stupid app! Then I totally recommend this for u.","date":"2020-07-09T16:33:28Z"}},{"id":"6177351032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oh my god this app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Izzy...A","review":"This app has ruined my life, it’s has somehow made me want to die even more. I opened it I was terrified, I saw this man, hell I think it was a man, staring at me through my screen.. I swear I could feel him behind me.. then when I took a deeper look at this app and this scary “man” I just about puked! Apparently he doesn’t like the lgbtq+ people and he doesn’t think they should have health care!? He also doesn’t like women or children very much.. well he might just like children a little too much if you catch my drift.....  I feel bad for Obama, I hope he can still do something about this.. also is it’s true the Mike Pence is a homosexual? I saw this floating around and I don’t think that it is just a rumor.. well anyway I need to get back to voting for Kanye, hanging my pride flags, and deleting Twitter from my phone. Thank you very much for reading this!","date":"2020-07-09T16:23:03Z"}},{"id":"6177268146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App I Have Ever Seen","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"JSSCRNLNZ","review":"This app is absolute garbage. It took forever to download, I almost had to throw my phone away due to the clogging up of my data while trying to get it downloaded. The graphics are hideous, it is like a newborn chimpanzee was doing a self portrait with its own feces. There was a high pitched mosquito buzzing sound that happened the entire time it was on my phone. It made me feel like my ears were going to start bleeding at any moment until I got rid of it. Also I think it put radioactive spyware into my brain through the cell phone waves??? I feel like I’m being watched all the time now and it feels like there are bugs crawling on my brain- and it started as soon as the app completed its download. Absolute nightmare of an app. Would give 0 stars if I could. Don’t put yourself through the trauma I went through. STAY AWAY!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:59:39Z"}},{"id":"6177137276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Spam","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"amoraamirAaMira","review":"Trump is trying to delete tik tok (don’t read the words after and just trying to get the app banned) is a real one time thing to do the dishes and then go to the store I can do a happy hour after the party and I get to my house and then I get home and get my mom rhxhc I like the old unworkable yeuww then we all have kids here so we all get together and we talk a happy hour and a couple hours ago and then we went uwoqowu yeoowq I like the world to be happy with you I wanna I love to we’re done with our house party and I get out the same time and we can get a little money for it and then I put my money in and get a little money u the bush administration is not a big part the government is not a wwuw was a happy ending to a great day in my birthday party was a that night but ue is a little bit of fun I have to get a happy birthday card and I owywiqoqy was a happy u","date":"2020-07-09T15:22:14Z"}}]}
