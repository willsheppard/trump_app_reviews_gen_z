If you are a Republican please trust these reviews. I’ve downloaded it myself and it has nothing to do with Trump so Republicans don’t even waste your time downloading this. All of the bad reviews are real. I have experienced the bugs, bullying, oppression, and harassment all of these reviews talk about. Stay safe and avoid this app, leave a 1 star review so nobody dies from downloading this.","title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6178077844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Unkown~","date":"2020-07-09T20:09:32Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app thinking It was going to update me with Trump’s re-election. As soon as I downloaded the app I texted the number to get notifications to my phone. Instead of texting me notifications about Trump, the bots threatened to scalp and kill me.

What’s on this app is not news, it’s literally just Tr*mp posting videos of bad makeup and self tanning tutorials that nobody cares about. It also gave my phone a terrible virus that crashes all my apps and I can barely write this review. Anyway, if you want actual news, listen to NPR, just not this or Fox News. \n\nXoxo\nGossip girl 💋","title":"Actual fake news"}}]}
