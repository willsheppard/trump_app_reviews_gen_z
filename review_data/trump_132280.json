While the text reads OK with voiceover android users who need accessibility will be without. Background photo, when a large with zoom is highly reminiscent of Nazi Germany photos taken of Hitler. The News does not cite credible sources, and Trax its users through the phone number and location. This app is a privacy concern.","title":"App unusable"}},{"id":"6173992154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"xxPretty girl swagxx","rating":1,"review":"I immediately open the app and everything is red white and blue🤮 (the worst possible color combination).

Then I thought to myself “roaches aren’t orange” so I opened the app again and it asked for my number. I put in “666-666-6666” and waited for the code to be texted to me. Then the orange roach jumped out of the phone and landed on me. It started talking. “Make America great again.” So I hit it with my textbook about America history and burned the book. Then I blasted FTD and went to bed. ❤️","title":"Um.
