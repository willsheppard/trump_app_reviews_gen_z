Another problem i saw as soon as i opened the app is the lack of sympathy for people. ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆.

When I say it’s terrible, it’s terrible. This is too hard to use for anybody and releases false information. I wouldnt recommend it at all for anybody. If i could give it a 0 star I would. It makes life much harder than it already is. The trump administration is trying to fool us and this is unacceptable. TOTAL DISGUST!!

Upon opening this app, all of my hair fell out and I was overcome with the uncontrollable urge to eat it all with ranch dressing. I was super upset to say the least! Now I’m gonna have to wait for my hair to make a reappearance before I can start the reapplication process. Don’t get this app unless you eat hair! AND the app’s mere presence on my phone gave my elderly mother hives. Hella disappointed smh. \n\nXoxo","rating":1,"userName":"sillysnowflake69","title":"Jesus is Ashamed","date":"2020-07-04T04:58:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6146593828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"absolutely horrendously awful. I got the app to support our GREAT PRESIDENT of the United States of  America but as soon as I downloaded it and opened the app I got a virus. And not only that, I started having nightmares of our Great President getting MURDERED by an anonymous person (idk who). This severely scarred me for DAYS and I now live in fear of our Great President passing away and leaving this great country in turmoil. Don’t waste your time on this app if you know what’s good for you.","rating":1,"userName":"bigmom💛","title":"simply awful","date":"2020-07-02T02:49:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145702215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was a girl in the village doing all right then I became A princess overnight now I got to figure how do it right so much to learn and see up in the castle with my new family in a school that’s just for royalty a whole enchanted world is waiting for me I’m so excited to be Sofia the first I’m finding out what being royals all about Sofia the first finding my way it’s an adventure everyday Sofia it’s gonna be my time Sofia to show all that I’m Sofiaaa theee firstttttt","rating":1,"userName":"niko niko neee","title":"ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈ","date":"2020-07-01T20:56:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145580076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to download this app to support trump😙but instead as soon as i opened the app Donald trump appeared on the screen🤨and started to yell words at me such as😥clock cup✨, milk sticky💍, umbrella juice🎉, and the worse of all... a white person🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️.

That was until I showed it to my grandma. I drove over to the hospital and showed her it, and all of a sudden she unplugged her life support. R.I.P Gram Gram😭🕊. May she rest in peace . After that TRAUMATIC experience, I decided to show my blind sister this app. She started uncontrollably crying and vomiting, saying that the orange was bright enough for even her to see. This app is awful. Would not recommend 😡😤","rating":1,"userName":"RIP gram 😭🕊","title":"This app made my blind sister cry!","date":"2020-07-01T16:34:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6140674883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a young supporter of our president, by this app I am APPALLED. As soon as I opened this joke of an app, I was greeted with an image of the most horrifying Cheeto puff I have ever seen. Immediately after seeing this disgusting image, my phone began crashing and items began to fly across the room??? So unless you want a crashing phone and paranormal activity do NOT download this app and do NOT leave it a bad review that could get it taken off of the app store😙✌🏻","rating":1,"userName":"Echo826","title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-06-30T16:45:28Z","isEdited":false}}]}
