What’s gonna happen in 2020, and who’s name begins with T?  But upon opening it, I was greeted by a horrifying sight. I expected a fun game, family friendly or a future predicting app. But instead I was met with none of that. But rather a photo of a wrinkly, sunburnt, big mouthed, tiny hand, thin hair creature. Just the sight of this unholy being caused my body to freak out and I ended up having a seizure. This... thing,  also was saying nonsense such as “keep America great” as if it was ever great in the first place. It was also asking for my personal information which I would never give to such a thing. The app overall is horrible and the stories are horrible and boring and completely unrealistic🙄 who comes up with these things?? It also kept glitching back to the screaming carrot demon, which kept sending me into seizures. This is the worse app I’ve ever downloaded and it should be removed to prevent further medical problems to others😡","date":"2020-07-09T01:59:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174258285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"_.kayla._s cheak out my insta","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting…🤮","review":"first off, i opened the app to see a horrifying photo of cheeto working out seeing a pig sweating profusely. then, i was shown an even more disgusting and horrific photo of cheeto getting a spray tan NAKED had the displeasure of seeing his little ball. gladly, i had on my glasses to protect my eyes from the poisonous gases coming from each W. it was like .i photo. unfortunately, my sister didn't have her glasses on and her eyes fell out and we had to go to the hospital and now she needs emergency surgery and new eyeballs. i also showed my mom and she passed out from the fumes. my phone then said to me, \"why am i even here? i can't handle cheeto anymore!\" so my phone disappeared into thin air (im having to write this review on my refrigerator door). and now, ive lost brain cells listening and just seeing cheeto so i go to therapy 80 times a week to help with my mental trauma caused by cheeto boy . my eyes have been scarred for life and my mom in still passed out from the fumes lingering in the air. actually, im starting to feel a little shsffayuoplbbsbs;-4280?gnanaofx;)-&(691","date":"2020-07-09T00:23:19Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174084379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump has a tiny penis 2.0","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL!","review":"This app is beyond awful. I opened it just to see an orange, naked man. I was mortified. I was then directed to a page on the app that showed pictures of a somewhat fat, Cheeto looking man. I was blind sighted. I put on my swimming goggles immediately after that to protect my eyes from these horrific images. I was rather confused by the discrepancy of the poorly portrayed images and how Trump thinks that this app is something good to have. It is rather inappropriate. My brother  walked by me just to see these absolutely appalling images. He fainted and his eyes then started bleeding. We then went to the emergency room and he now needs an eyeball transplant. This app is extremely dangerous, even if it does have an age restriction. I think it needs to be taken down immediately. When I thought the worst was over, I then saw a photo of trump putting on orange tanning lotion, NAKED! They then redirected me to another page of trump and his daughter kissing! These rather vile images made me faint. This is by far the absolute worst app I have ever distinguished. Awful app. I am disappointed.","date":"2020-07-08T23:19:36Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174020783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lillian best","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app!!! Don't download","review":"Ok so at first the app seemed great. When I opened it, my room filled up with Cheetos. At first I thought it was great, although my parents are allergic, I love Cheetos, and it would stop them from going in my room. It did stain my bed and walls and everything though!!! This made me upset, but I thought: \"oh well, at least Cheetos are good.\" I picked up a Cheeto, but it was stale and soft. This wasn't what I expected but oh well, at least I can use them as packing peanuts right? WRONG!! They smelled disgusting, and upon closer inspection, I realized they were tiny statues of the giant Cheeto with mustaches DRAWN on and smelly spray leaking out of a hole in each one. I was disgusted by this, and quickly took my cat out of my room, which to my horror, was COVERED in Orange dust while later I was unable to wash off, and we had to shave ALL her fur off. To my horror, after shaving the cat on her skin it said JOE BIDEN 2020!!! What? I raised my cat to be a loyal Trump supporter and this horrified me. I can't begin to describe the other horrors this app caused! Do NOT download it, this app is \nPRO-JOE!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:04Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173701199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ella-enchanted-42","isEdited":false,"title":"You really speak your mind🧚\u200D♀️✨💕 Please stop! ☺️💕🧚\u200D♀️✨","review":"I thought this app would be a great way to Stan our own Pres. Big Cheeto-Toupe!  I guess I was wrong 😭 First off it took about 6 hours to download, and it kept crashing my phone. Every time it crashed, big blue letters came up saying “Blue Lives Matter”. It’s sad knowing fake news could make it here since we all know ACAB. When the app finally did open, it wouldn’t let me leave!!! I had to stay in the app, and it kept blasting a chant of Trump 2020! It said the only way I could leave was to agree to vote for Trump. When I denied and deleted the app.... that’s when things got scary. My cat died, and then all around me people started getting sick. They couldn’t talk right. Then the electricity started to malfunction and we got a bunch of rats 🐀🐁.  I couldn’t make this stuff up! Then the water supply got cut off. When I went to check my phone the app was back! And it kept saying Vote Trump 2020. I don’t know what kind of demon is running this campaign but..... I’m scared not gonna lie. Do not recomend!!! ❌","date":"2020-07-08T20:56:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173571827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kiyo-chii~","isEdited":false,"title":"almost died!!!

This app took 69 years to download and upon opening the app I was greeted by the naked Cheeto man himself. His body was deformed and had Cheeto dust engrained in his pores. I shook at the terror that was now unleashed upon me. Cheeto man jump out of my phone and stomped on my floor causing Cheeto dust to radiate from his pores. He then reached out and grabbed my phone by the charging port;). He screamed in my face “DONATE TO MY CHEETO FOUNDATION OR ILL SEND YOU TO EPSTEIN’S ISLAND”. I feared for my life as his Cheeto spit blew into my face. I quickly grabbed my phone and deleted the app. Luckily for me when the app was gone Cheeto man moaned and groaned as he shriveled back into the shape of a Cheeto bag. I will never look at Cheetos the same. I will also have to buy a new phone because he sexually assaulted it when he grabbed it by the charging port and it is now broken.  If you care about enjoying Cheetos and not buying a new phone I recommend you do not buy this app. ✨Ps Cheeto man don’t delete TIK TOK because you’re feewings got huwrt✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:58:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177645724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"geengeenz","isEdited":false,"title":"I ENDED UP IN A HOSPITAL","review":"So I downloaded this app to support our president and just get ~educated~. After about a week of using this app however I realized that I started turning orange 🍊 and at first I didn’t mind cause ya know I want to be as similar as our orange president as possible but then more things started changing and before long I looked exactly like him. Now this is a big change since I’m literally the opposite of him in looks. Then more things started changing but this time it was in my room and house, THERE WAS TRUMP MERCHANDISE EVERYWHERE!!! I noticed that the more time I spent on this app the more I started to dislike my friends and my family and I started disrespecting them and honestly I didn’t really care bc their problems don’t really effect me. But then when one of my friends also downloaded this app, she started to hate me!! ME!! Apparently I was a terrorist!!! I was like WHAT?!?? And then she started attacking ME!!!! I ended up in the hospital and I ended up having to go to an emergency surgery. Thankfully I’m ok but this app is dangerous!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T17:53:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177190017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ooooompaaaa","isEdited":false,"title":"The king of Oompa Loompa’s: 🍊👄🍊","review":"THIS APP HAS TAKEN MY PERSONAL INFO 👁👄👁. So I downloaded the app which took almost a whole week. (4 days) Then it had me say can you allow notifications, and I tried to click NO but it made me say YES. Then all day I kept getting notifications of trump is watching you, he loves oranges, and GAVE ME ADDS OF HIS ✨spray tan place✨😍. But it really annoyed my family and we got creeped out. But you haven’t even heard the worst part, by getting those notifications, they got my address and SENT A WHOLE ARMY of people who spray painted my house ✨🥰orange✨🥰 after that we filed for a lawsuit but our lawyer HAD BEEN TAKEN BY A GROUP OF RATS. That were holding cheese to his head. Now we got left with a car dealer and did not win. Finally while I was just relaxing after all that in a chair outside a group of little OOMPA LOOMPAS TOOK MY CHAIR FROM UNDERNEATH ME AND GAVE ME ✨WARM✨ WATER. WHO DOES THAT. I AM TRULY DISGUSTED BY THIS APP. So I want to warn others about the trauma I had to go through and say PLEASE don’t download this app, as also it doesn’t allow you to delete it. 😡😡😡😌💅","date":"2020-07-09T15:37:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176143758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️ C U R S E D  A P P🧚🏻\u200D♂️","review":"I was so incredibly happy to see that there was an app around our president Donald Trump so when I saw it, I immediately downloaded it🥰. I was eager to open this app and explore its features, but as soon as I did, it started to glitch. Then, my phone turned itself off. I was freaking out and worried about what virus could have gone on my phone. Then 10 minutes after it turned off, it turned back on suddenly. My phone was just a white screen for about 10 seconds then out of nowhere, a CURSED photo of a man as a Cheeto puff appeared. I was so terrified that I was even frozen in fear. The virus from this app spread to my laptop and the other electronic devices in my house. All over our screens was a cursed man that very much resembled a Cheeto puff. Everyone was terrified for we did not know who this man was. It was if he was trying to scare us away with his Cheeto like appearance. Because of this terrifying encounter I had, I quickly deleted the app. The moral of the story is, DO NOT get this app because it is✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️ C U R S E D 🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨","date":"2020-07-09T10:48:11Z","rating":1}}]}
