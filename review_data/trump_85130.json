It took me almost 2 weeks to download and since it was downloading, I couldn’t use any other apps. After waiting 2 weeks, the app finally opened and it made my phone glitch. No matter if I had the app open or not, my phone would play the horrible song. The song was Donald Trump singing “Baby” by Justin Bieber, which made my ears bleed 👂🏻🩸 , leading to a large amount in medical expenses because I had to go to the ER😔. Another glitch that I experienced was that images of Donald Trump’s face on an orange 🍊 would appear on my screen every couple of seconds. I tried deleting the app because I didn’t want to go back to the ER, my ear bleeding stared to get worse and worse. The app wouldn’t delete and the Donald Trump orange 🍊 faces stared to appear more often. I had to soak my phone in holy water, then proceed to burning it just to get rid of the wretched sound that was piercing my ear drums. I am happy to say that I am doing well and no longer have severe ear bleeding. I plan to sue the company behind this app and Donal Trump, even though I don’t suffer from ear bleeding, I still have panic attacks thinking of the horrendous faces that would appear on my screen and the horrible rendition of “Baby” by Donald Trump. I am playing on bring the company and Donald Trump to court this weekend😡. I want my medical 🏥 bills payed and for them to suffer for all the have done to me.😞😡. I hope this app gets removed so no one has to go through the same thing I have. 🍊👄🍊","title":"Horrible DO NOT DOWNLOAD‼️ 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sufferer of this app 😡","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173494418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible honestly horrible it’s horrible","title":"Bad","isEdited":false,"userName":"reasanable parent","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173471141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"99% death rate with download I’m lucky to be alive","title":"Don’t get it!","isEdited":false,"userName":"avanisr","date":"2020-07-08T19:36:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173466568","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I have ever used in my life","title":"The worst app","isEdited":false,"userName":"lexipoodle123456","date":"2020-07-08T19:34:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173438845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took FOREVER to download and when it finally dod, the app was BROKEN. it did NOTHING BUT GIVE ME A VIRUS!!!! this app is the WORST APP IVE EVER HAD!!!
