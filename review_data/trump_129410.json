Next thing I know my vision is blurry and I need glasses! I will be suing the owner of the app for eye surgery. ✨Unless this app gets deleted, I really do recommend it shutting down✨for other people’s safety otherwise millions upon millions who download this horrifying/disturbing app will go nearly blind from seeing this walking/breathing Cheeto puff🦁🦧🍂 I would also like to point out right after opening this app my phone started burning to the point where it melted.. Although, I’m glad it did otherwise I don’t know if my trauma would have let me let go.👁👅👁 Thanks to this app I now suffer from 3rd degree burns, blindness, trauma, severe depression, and now I have to go to therapy 6 days of the week in my hospital bed!

They then ask you for private information which they are probably selling to the Chinese government. The must’ve built this app for the Iphone 3gs because it’s slower than my grandmas android. The first picture it shows is a big orange man in a suit making a pouty face with a black lives matter fist?!! This is absolutely ridiculous and someone needs to look into it. My phone was bugged shortly after I downloaded the app and i received over 12 calls from the Trump campaign begging for my support. Now, I am unable to remove the app from my phone. Someone please help!!!!!","userName":"E William Baca","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:19:07Z"}}]}
