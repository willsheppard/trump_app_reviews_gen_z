It turns out that the app was created by a misogynistic, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, ugly, biased, pedophilic, child rapist, sex offender. I don’t know about you but I simply can’t support that. But by his logic, I guess that makes me a snowflake🤪. I’d rather be a “crybaby liberal” than a supporter of a man who tries to take away our rights when he gets fact checked on Twitter.","isEdited":false,"title":"Hunter✝️🇺🇸😈🎣 is typing..."}},{"id":"6174150688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:44:07Z","userName":"appreviewer420691312","review":"I downloaded this app, and to my horror, there was no COINS no OBSTACLES, no monkeys chasing you through a temple, no subway surfing, what a horrible game! There was no music except these awful rambling speeches by some mentally ill ugly guy...I wish the developers would have designed a better app.... ‘‘twas only entertaining after many drinks... once the ugly man was blurry enough that I couldn’t get nauseous just by the sight of him.","isEdited":false,"title":"sorry Donny"}}]}
