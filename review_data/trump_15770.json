Ever since I downloaded it nothing has been able to load. The second I deleted it everything was back to normal again. There are some MAJOR technical issues with this app. I recommend apple to take down this app from the app store so that no one else has the issues I experienced.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:32Z"}},{"id":"6173020974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I was abducted by aliens because of this app!","userName":"That annoying one","rating":1,"review":"It all started when I down⬇️loaded the app. I gave it a juicy 🧡⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ star review. (You know bc the racist, homophobic, orange monster is amazing 💖) abut then I heard a sMaSh on my 🚪. Bright 🍊 morons 🧠📉📉 kicking my house. They screamed 📢tRuMp 2020! Then a giant 🍊 👽 came and said 5 STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. And then it took me 👁👄👁 into the ship. I changed it to ⭐️ star and ran away from the 🛫. (Side note: Trump is a horrible president! I wish he was behind bars 💕✨🦋)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:07:39Z"}},{"id":"6172927313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Biden 2020","userName":"zoesk8s","rating":1,"review":"If you are downloading this app in an attempt to find the reason as to why vote for Trump in this 2020, I’ll save you the trouble; there are none. Trump has committed countless crimes but still continues to keep the support of his people by controlling the media. He is the embodiment of what this country is against and if we don’t soon realize it, this country will go even farther down than it already has.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:38:46Z"}},{"id":"6172905731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Reason why I am not voting for Donald J. Trump.","userName":"beckyjuinor27","rating":1,"review":"Trump contributes to lie and lie and lie. He does not go through with anything thing he says. Even with that opinion I downloaded this app to try and find some descent reasons to vote for his second term in office. Sadly, I could not find any. I would hope that he would improve his campaign, but sadly he didn’t this election. So for these reasons and many more I will not be voting for Donald trump this 2020.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:32:02Z"}},{"id":"6172902547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do Not Recommend","userName":"Cad yanks","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app I obviously had the intention of keeping up with our wonderful president Trump and to help him win the 2020 election. At first when I opened it I had to sign up, but then it glitched to an orange. I don’t know if the orange is associated with someone but I do not like oranges. It also showed a picture another orange with a bleached wig on. Please fix this bug so I can be up-to-date on Trump’s decisions.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:31:01Z"}},{"id":"6172893626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Crappy app doesn’t work","userName":"Penelopecakes22","rating":1,"review":"This app took forever to download finally once it did it wouldn’t even open! It tried to open up on its main page then it shows an error and kicks me out of it. Poorly designed app I expected something GREAT and its was the opposite just like the President. Very disappointing just like my boyfriend in bed just getting started and it’s already over.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:28:16Z"}},{"id":"6172874207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app I don’t recommend it.","userName":"Bunkerbitch","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with our current president in office. When I open the app I saw beetlejuice falling from a sign. When the app asks for your gender it didn’t let me say iphone 11 pro max. This app also asked for my social security number i’m not sure why. It also gave me food poisoning. Tik tok is way better than this app. keep Tik Tok get rid of this stupid app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:22:27Z"}},{"id":"6172889267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump 2020","userName":"Drianna20","rating":5,"review":"This is the best app I’ve ever downloaded by far and I highly recommend to others y’all whether y’all like Trump or not it’s good to have an app like this to keep yourself updated :D","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:26:56Z"}},{"id":"6172854806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP","userName":"i dont want to say me name uwu","rating":1,"review":"While downloading this app it took way to long downloading and it just turned of my phone!!
