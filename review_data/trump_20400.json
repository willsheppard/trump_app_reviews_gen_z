Once I finally got it to download, it kept crashing. I tried to delete and re-download it SEVERAL TIMES, but it still keeps crashing. Keep in mind, I still had to wait for every 1 week or so every time I re-download the app.","date":"2020-07-09T17:16:50Z"}},{"id":"6177497537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","userName":"Pineapple ninja turtle","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is a straight up liar! Said it would give me free food if I downloaded it, instead got a bunch of rats to come and eat my food! Fed em to the worms 🐛. Where’s my food HM. I wanted some good food cause I do be starving out here. Also possessed my door, slammed my brother 69 times on the back, my dog went crazy and ate my arms off currently typing with my foot and what’s left of my arm.","date":"2020-07-09T17:06:30Z"}},{"id":"6177452246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Glitch in the Matrix","userName":"sodndidheuwjdbfie","isEdited":false,"review":"First red flag was that once I downloaded the app my phone started to vibrate uncontrollably. Next when I started to open the app it said “are you lost baby gorl ?” And yes it said gorl not girl. Then when I said no it was just a bunch of pictures of Trump while simultaneously quoting 365 Days. Had ZERO political insight to Trumps plan for the next presidential election. ✨","date":"2020-07-09T16:52:59Z"}},{"id":"6177451104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible app","userName":"watermelon sugar hii","isEdited":false,"review":"I hate this app. I got so scared it keep asking me for my information and i don’t like that. The was a man looking at me and that’s so creepy i don’t recommend at all. And i’ve heard he’s going to ban tiktok. No it a place where we can laugh and laugh all day long.

Crashes your phone and making these reviews crashes the presidents self esteem. We are going to ruin his life and make sure he never gets elected president of this country ever again.","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:40Z"}},{"id":"6177426901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"horrible app and dumb💖","userName":"stinkybum😍","isEdited":false,"review":"got this app because i heard great things about it. first when i downloaded it i’m pretty sure i got a virus because a scary man popped up. would definitely not recommend. app was SLOW and waste of data space. it was a very hard access. should be taken off the app store immediately","date":"2020-07-09T16:45:12Z"}},{"id":"6177407151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disorganized","userName":"Strawberry 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"review":"I had high hope opening the app because i wanted to see what our GrEaT president was doing to make the world better, however the app is completely disorganized.

I have the newest update for IOS and an iPhone X, so there should be no problem. It then crashed. I was able to get in again but it crashed again. Also the font is off, it’s way too big. I also did not come here from that tick tack app.🤗🧚\u200D♀️✨ I expect better","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:34Z"}}]}
