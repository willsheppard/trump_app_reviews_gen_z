After the app was loaded, it asked for permission to use my Apple wallet, my Facebook, my Instagram, and my messenger. It also displays ads for whatever I’ve been talking about even when my phone isn’t on. I’m sure it uses my camera too. I’m just waiting for this app to post me showering to a revenge porn site. At least make the nsa do a little work. All apps matter, not just white apps.","title":"aLL aPpS mAtTeR","userName":"Frank and Kathi","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:55:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175934309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a whole day to download I have perfectly good storage and once it downloaded I pressed it and it started to glitch like crazy then my email started spamming with trumps a 🍊  emails and it wouldn’t stop for like 5 hours then once it all finished I tried going into the app one more time and once I got in I immediately got a phone call screaming trump 2020 louder and louder then to men broke into my my house tied me up and started screaming at me to vote for trump don’t get this app guys","title":"Horrible app😤🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"rfhsaghhyh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:40:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175922954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To begin the app to me 926 days just to download and then after that immediately after opening the app of my most favorite homophobic, misogynistic, racist, and ugliest president ever they asked for my phone number in order to make sure that I’d being giving them all my gummy bears.

Needless to say I am NEVER eating cheetoes again. Or using this app. Warning: If you are visually sensitive, prone to anxiety attacks, have any respect for POC, immigrants, the disabled, the poor, or an understanding of basic human rights, do yourself a favor and don’t download this app OR vote for a white supremacist pig please and thank you!!","title":"Horrible experience do not download!!","userName":"katalia97","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:24:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175727950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After downloading this app, my wife instantly knew I was on drugs again. For years I have been clean... or so she thought. But I tried downloading this app to see what good old Mr. President was up to. Turns out, this app is terrible and doesn’t load. I absolutely HATE this app. My wife knew that if I was willing to download an app for a president that was okay with deleting tiktok, that my brain wasn’t functioning normally. She divorced me and took the kids. Please karen, come back if you see this. 😖😖","title":"My wife left me!!","userName":"antik tokwozski","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:31:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175711089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!! I was so excited to have downloaded this app until it took 53 hours to finish?? Weird, but that’s not even the worst part. After the long wait I thought everything was better and I could get in to my American duty of supporting good ol’ Trump but when I opened it wasn’t the Trump content I was promised. It was a 5hour long video of the Teletubbies dressed in full drag, singing the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack, while engaging in unspeakable pre marital acts!!! I personally feel attacked and scarred, do NOT get this app.","title":"✨🦋🧚🏼🦋✨","userName":"Bunker Boy🧚🏼🧚🏼✨🦋","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:25:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175612142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is terrible it took like 6 days to download and it’s super confusing the app is very hard to use and when i opened the app it didn’t msg me continue without putting my phone number and email in and it completely hacked my phone my contacts are telling me i sent them spam messages when i didn’t send anything and i’m getting calls left and right from who knows where this app is absolutely terrible it should be deleted.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"karentrump2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:50:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175564969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He who shall not be named released this horrible app that that is just as horrid as his face. As the leader of supposedly the “greatest country in the world” you would think this app would work. However it works as well as his office does, it doesn’t. I hope it gets taken down and banned just as he is doing to TikTok. Presidents who try to limit free speech by trying to scare citizens about their data when Facebook steals just as much as TikTok. I hope you enjoy the GenZ wrath 💅🏽✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","title":"Just as horrible as the President","userName":"lillie bear","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:33:32Z","isEdited":false}}]}
