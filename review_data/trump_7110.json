Eventually it became impossible to drink water without using both hands. It became difficult to tweet resulting in many of my messages  being incomprehensible. I finally had to stop use and seek medical help. After having to pay out of pocket for thousands of dollars worth of medical bills, I was diagnosed with itty bitty trump hand syndrome. Eventually it will spread to my brain, and I will become a Cheeto. Please do not download.","userName":"maborder334","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:12:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app cost me thousands of dollars"}},{"id":"6175262749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app doesn't seem to function as advertised. Faulty menus and confusing navigation. I was hoping to use this app as a resource to be informed for November but it just causes more headache than convenience :( Also, after an eternity of installation time the opening page greets you with a rather unflattering shot of our president. Whoever approved the use of that photo should revise because I don't think it conveys the strength, and capability this relentless campaign usually strives to parody.  \n\nWould love to see improvement.","userName":"Leann091","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:36:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not helpful.

I also noticed I would have random apps opened up on my phone and the slightest of differences as if someone had HACKED into my phone! The glitching got so much worse!! I deleted it and it all went back to normal. Do NOT download this app. They will hack into you phone and steal your information. I was open to learning about the Trump Administration but NOT ANYMORE. I’m not on the anti-trump wagon because of this experience :)) hehe","userName":"Helrdvy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitchy phone"}},{"id":"6175100697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ll get on my phone to call you when I’m on the phone I don’t have any time for me either I’ll get you some money I wanna see ya tomorrow bro I wanna was the time I was going home I got a couple minutes late I’ll just take it off the bus and then I gotta is a time for you guys got off a lot and I’m going back home I gotta is a little bit like I gotta is the night you got me about is a little bit too much going on I don’t want to be home I don’t know how I can do be like about it I’ll just take it I’ll lyk the time I’m gonna I I wanna see","userName":"OZAPDO","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:39:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"BAD APP"}},{"id":"6175089076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is one of the worst thing u can possibly download! I was on my way to Wendy’s to get a bowl of cereal from subway when I got a call from my girlfriend who is my mom’s friend cousins wife’s grandma and she told me she was pregnant and it wasn’t mine...😔I went home to feed her clothes to my hostage, but then realized my hostage was my girlfriend who is my mom’s friend cousins wife’s grandma.

Before I downloaded it my phone was in perfect condition but after the instillation it continuously glitches. My phone calls have been cut off and other apps continuously are closed out since the trump trash app was installed. In addition, this app is tracking my location and has access to my personal data without my consent. This is a disgusting app I hope no one has to endure the annoyance and danger of the app. It should be removed as soon as possible","userName":"jaimie💫✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:33:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"One of the worst apps ever🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨✨"}}]}
