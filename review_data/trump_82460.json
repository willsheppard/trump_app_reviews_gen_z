This app made me kinda sick, and I want to know what is wrong with the five star people shaming glorious Gen Z like that. \nThere’s just something about killing random people that just rubs me the wrong way. Is it because of racial injustice? Random killings? Down-grading the people you should be protecting? In fact, a president’s job isn’t even to rule the country. A presidents job is to command the military, and that only. Every branch is equal in power. The president is nothing special. Not to mention, our so called president won’t hesitate to kill anyone who speaks ill of him. But then he’ll have to kill thousands. Which is almost not surprising. If you are a trumpet...I think you need to go to a mental hospital. This so called boy is only going to leave a huge dent in society’s way of life in the future. I don’t know how he isn’t arrested or impeached already. trump, I’ll have you remember, you chose this fight. We are not going to stand your attitude, and we will not stop until justice is served. If you read this, know that you can’t kill everyone you hate, but what you can do is silently step down, and walk yourself to the police. We will not stand for this anymore. You cannot attack us, you cannot use or show this reply as a “somebody threatened me”. Because as far as I can see, and I’m short sighted, you are the only threat here for miles."}},{"id":"6171835058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"closet kid 44","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This is a disgrace","date":"2020-07-08T11:26:00Z","review":"This put my 9 year old son in the hospital"}},{"id":"6171762501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ZamayaJ","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"BE CAREFUL","date":"2020-07-08T11:01:58Z","review":"This app will start flooding your screen with Cheetos it’s scary protect yourself and your device"}},{"id":"6171662508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jman.Solo","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed in app’s turnout","date":"2020-07-08T10:28:22Z","review":"Didn’t like the app at all"}},{"id":"6171420813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The Orangutans","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"BAD, VERY SAD","date":"2020-07-08T09:03:34Z","review":"He look like an Orangutan.
