Insanely slow and super glitchy all of the time! As soon as I downloaded this my phone started freezing and glitching out and it won’t let me delete it! This must be some kind of fake app that the crazy dems created to hack working Americans phones😡 needs to be taken off of the App Store immediately before this virus hurts anyone else. I had to take my phone to the T-Mobile store to get completely erased and fixed and the employees said DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL!","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:26Z","userName":"laurenjordan23"}},{"id":"6173937752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I opened this app to see this life sized Cheeto making America look disgusting. I cannot believe the App Store allowed such a conniving and heartless person be able to use their platform. I strongly do not recommend anything involving this man or application to anyone. Just a reminder if you support this man it’s not about being a republican or Democrat it’s about who you are at this point. This man is nothing but racist, misogynistic, and homophobic... the fact that you support him makes you all three just like him. \n🚫🚯ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK. 🚫🚯","isEdited":false,"title":"RACIST, RAUNCHY, & REPULSIVE!","date":"2020-07-08T22:24:46Z","userName":"GEN Z 2021"}},{"id":"6173937743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was walking to the store with my pet iguana named Tommy. Tommy looks 👀 at me and says” the angry Cheeto man 👨 has spoken.” I looked up at the sky and saw the Cheeto man 👨 walking through the clouds naked. I ran to the store and got some milk 🥛 for my dog 🐶 to eat. I left the store and the Cheeto man 👨 was gone. Yes!  I run 🏃\u200D♀️ home 🏠 with my milk 🥛 for my dog 🐶. I open the door 🚪 and the angry 😡 Cheeto man 👨 is staring at me. He says he wants the milk 🥛 and takes it from my hands  I cried and went to my room. Tommy the iguana 🦎 followed me and cried with me. My dog 🐶 Paul bit the angry 😡 Cheeto man 👨 and he died.

But it was burnt when I took it out of the microwave so I put it in the fridge and 15 minutes later it was bright orange when I took it out. I went to bed planning on buying a new phone the next day and when I woke up my fridge and microwave were orange.

Once it had downloaded onto my phone Trump nearly started World War III, fires spread across Australia, the Coronavirus erupted and spread, Murder Hornets were a thing, there were UFOs and there is still more to come. I think this is a sign to stop people supporting Trump. Or this is something like gods flood, except a virus kills all of Trump elderly supporters so people who will live for more than 4 years can change the world for the better instead of electing a president who is supported by Nazis.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-08T21:52:03Z","userName":"✨💞🦋Trump 2020💖🥰💫"}},{"id":"6173820671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is super glitch and took like 5 minutes to download🙄.
