The waiter brings out my salad and it is in the perfect exact shape of the cheeto man. at that second when everybody looked over and saw my salad they all ran away.\nsomething’s not right with this app, it’s not worth it.✨😕💞😜🙈🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨","title":"This app is CURSED","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:26:24Z"}},{"id":"6177557070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Lover_nini","review":"It said that a review was optional","title":"Hate it","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:25:04Z"}},{"id":"6177519826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ryankylesmith","review":"this app made my phone catch on fire and caused me to suffocate 😳","title":"this app nearly killed me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:23Z"}},{"id":"6177503880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"danisnaaanaananabananab","review":"how the f** Trump will eliminate TikTok. hope you app get deleted","title":"tiktok","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:08:26Z"}},{"id":"6177492231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"frontsmell","review":"This app crashed my phone.
