As soon as I  downloaded it, I gave Trump my phone number and was subsequently flooded by spam calls and concerning texts. One in particular was threatening to harm me and all members of my family if I was not a cis, straight, white male. 0/10 never affiliating with this orange dictator again. Also, my phone began to constantly crash whether I was in the app or not, no matter how much I restarted my phone, and it became unresponsive. This software is very damaging, DO NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR PHONE.","userName":"CC!1277","date":"2020-07-09T17:17:08Z"}},{"id":"6177473100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave me depression and lost brain kells","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Before this app I was a happy person, always singing and dancing and treating others with the upmost kindness and sincerity a person has to offer. I was scrolling on the AppStore and saw this lovely app, thinking it could contribute to my never ending goal of spreading kindness ✨I downloaded. But as soon as I did I was filled with hatred and anger and ~racism~. I was no longer the person I used to be 😥. Immediately I deleted the app and felt myself returning to kindness and good morals. I think this app is haunted and should be IMMEDIATELY deleted","userName":"kindness💕","date":"2020-07-09T16:59:09Z"}},{"id":"6177461351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app will kill you and your dog","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible and scary when i first opened it i was confused and my eyes started to burn from seeing an ompa loompa and a big fat cheeto at the same time. I then showed my dog and she was so scared she tried to run i front of a bus and now has to avoid anything orange according to the doctor or she will be traumatized. I hope jesus can give me my sight back because i had to make my mom write this.

And I quickly revolted and said “no❤️”. First off, he’s very ugly so it’s hard to look at, second off, we’ll, my guy ain’t very bright. He does think it’s ok to say he wants to date him daughter after all🦝. He’s also very ✨r a c i s t✨ so if you support him still, you’re ✨r a c i s t✨ or at least support\n ✨r a c i s t✨ideas (which basically makes you ✨r a c i s t✨. Anyway, he’s very ugly so I don’t recommend. It gave me a nightmare. It even made my Pisces sun say: 👁💧👄💧👁","userName":"HamilAddict","date":"2020-07-09T16:53:53Z"}}]}
