I cried downloading it! My parents are cheeto supporters and I was forced to download this! Oh how terrible I feel 🤧 it’s terrible to even look at the Cheeto! But of course I have hope.. hope that the world will be saved..by corona 🥺👼 I believe that if we all get infected by the virus and get near the Cheeto of this state we will infect him and kill him before he can do any more harm to our wonderful country. 🥰💅🧚✨💕I believe in our beloved gen Z tik tokers 🥰💕✨🧚😘","date":"2020-07-08T20:56:23Z","userName":"spiderlegend321"}},{"id":"6173693551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded","rating":1,"review":"I wish it was possible to give 0 stars but looks like one will do.... this app functions very poorly. It constantly crashes and makes my phone over heat. Ever since I downloaded it my phone has been acting up. It will crash on other apps and make everything go slow. Wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a virus in this app! I am disgusted. Please take this off the App Store ASAP!","date":"2020-07-08T20:53:47Z","userName":"jeisushebsbss"}},{"id":"6173692621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could.","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in an attempt to educate myself more on Trumps stance on important issues, trumps presidency has become a contentious point within my family. However, upon opening the app, I got a better understanding of what Trump’s app really is: a forum for more of his senseless, baseless messages to inspire his homophobic, racist, xenophobic, transphobic audience. This app is disgusting and should be removed from the app store.","date":"2020-07-08T20:53:26Z","userName":"PeytonH293"}},{"id":"6173677493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE","rating":1,"review":"I don’t even know where to beginning, this gave my phone different viruses and bugs to the point where it is difficult to even be active on my phone and not have an inconvenience. don’t even get me started on the amount of time it took to download. A WHOLE WEEK! for what, useless information? as said in the title this app is terrible and I strongly recommend you should never download it.","date":"2020-07-08T20:48:01Z","userName":"mary crlys"}},{"id":"6173660000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App!!!","rating":1,"review":"Never buy this app! It took too long to download and the face of Trump made my dog have a seizure; now I have to pay for $70,000 worth of medical bills. If you don’t want this to happen to you, then delete the app. If you don’t have a dog, the symptoms of seeing Donald J. Trump’s face could vary from slight fever to DEATH!!! In conclusion something terrible will happen if you download this app (or don’t delete it).\n\nPS: Please send your thoughts and prayers for my dog.","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:47Z","userName":"Purple phonecase boi"}},{"id":"6173652532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD 😪","rating":1,"review":"This app was way worse than I thought. It took 5 hours to fully download and made my phone super slow. I think the app gave my phone a virus, it keeps glitching and I think I have to go get it fixed. When I went to the Apple store to go get it fixed, my phone started farting once I handed it to the cute worker at the store. The worker thought I was the one that farted and I was SO EMBARRASSED. Worse experience of my life..","date":"2020-07-08T20:39:07Z","userName":"liza_beth96"}},{"id":"6173632378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE!","rating":1,"review":"This app took hours to download, and when downloaded i was met with another online download. I don’t know why but after my phone has been lagging so much and been so glitchy. I’m scared they stole information!

Please do not get this.","date":"2020-07-08T20:31:54Z","userName":"Stan trump 😍✨ jk dont"}},{"id":"6173623015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Bad app","rating":1,"review":"GUYSSS I’m telling you this is the worst app ever seen I tried downloading it TEN times but every time it would crash my phone and I’d have to try again.

It took a while to download and it made my cellular device glitch to hell and back. I’ve never had an issue with my phone previous to downloading this app. It either needs to be remade with a different president figure or it needs to be deleted. My whole phone is messed up now. I don’t know how I’ll recover from this :( PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! Waste of time!!! Wish I could rate it 0 stars.","date":"2020-07-08T20:07:16Z","userName":"Giandmoose"}}]}
