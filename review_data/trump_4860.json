Ruined my whole life!","isEdited":false,"userName":"ParkingSpots","review":"Not only am I still horrified from opening the app and immediately seeing a mutilated corpse in a suit in front of a flag, the app itself is inconsistent and uncomfortable and unconstitutional. It runs horribly and makes me squirm everytime I open it. Everytime I try to run it, a meteor strikes me from the sky and honestly the medical bill is ASTRONOMICAL at this point. The one time I actually was able to run it, it glitched so much it caused me to have a seizure while I pooped my pants profusely. Last night my phone whispered to me while I was going to sleep “please kill Me”. Honestly this app has ruined my life!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174178933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:54:24Z","title":"🐀","isEdited":false,"userName":"_happyfacë","review":"Hello! I came to open this app and when I opened I started seizing. A scary Cheeto looking figure who’s nudes I recently say on the “Fails” tab in Phub, showed up on my screen. I was rushed to the hospital and was diagnosed with DBURHM. Also known as, Disgusted By Ugly Racist Horrible men. Only so many people are diagnosed with it. I would advise people to stay away from this app to keep yourself safe from DBURHM. There is no cure and there are many side effects. Such as, vomiting when hearing them speak, fainting when making even digital eye contact, and even death by meeting them in person. Please stay safe and do not download this app to keep you healthy. ❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6174134036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:37:53Z","title":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💐worst app in the history of apps💐🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"wkndbcisks","review":"i downloaded this app in hopes that i could buy some hot cheetos but turns out, it’s promoting a racist cheeto instead! i thought it was just a glitch so i deleted the app and took my pet rock for a walk. when i came back, i made dinner for my dinosaur husband (it was really good by the way) and redownloaded the app. the racist cheeto was still there! and he was saying offensive things about women! he said how he loved to grab women by their 🐱 and how he would date his daughter if she wasn’t his daughter! that cheeto better be taken off this app! it is so disgusting and moldy! obviously not worth anything! my dinosaur husband downloaded the app too and he hated it just as much as i did! besides the nasty, fat, orange cheeto, the app does not function properly. there are so many viruses and it (the cheeto) calls it the “chinese virus”! so offensive! i deleted the app and i hope this app is banded from the apple store!!!!! #settleforbiden","rating":1}},{"id":"6174107763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:28:18Z","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"blacklivesmatteralways❤️","review":"because of this app, i had horrifying nightmares for the last week. the appearance of this man was pressed into my head— i stayed up all night last night, restless, terrified of the nightmares i might’ve had if i fell asleep. i can’t look bare to look into the eyes of this CHEETO. he looks scarier than any of the characters in a horror movie. imagine all the little children who are petrified of this man. imagine how TRAUMATIZED they are! i would never want my child to go through what i did for the past few nights. actually tragic. heartbreaking. save your kids from this man before he takes them away in their nightmares. 😔","rating":1}},{"id":"6174067501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:13:32Z","title":"This app is horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"mccraym","review":"I downloaded this app and now my phone crashes all the time. Most of the time I can only type one word before it crashes. Getting it off of my phone was a whole other issue. It wouldn’t let me delete the app every time I tried my phone would just crash. I had to be very quick and patient. I don’t recommend this app to anyone. Also I’m pretty sure I was hacked using this app because I started getting a lot of phone calls from people I didn’t know telling me to support President trump and this only happened after I downloaded the app. The worst app ever 😖😖","rating":1}},{"id":"6174027503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:58:35Z","title":"just so bad","isEdited":false,"userName":"sreagan25","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start!\n\nAnyways, any functioning human 2020!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173991767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:06Z","title":"no ❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"V3SA","review":"This app should not even exist. 👁👄👁 Why does a cheeto need an app? 🥱 he should just go back to his peach, where he belongs ✨ 📠 I’m going to delete this app BUT it has already contaminated my phone! 😡😡 it’s going to need years of therapy to help erase the TRAUMA that this app has inflicted. 😭😭😢 -my poor phone-☹️ I would give this negative stars if i could.💩 i advise you NOT to download this app! 🤮 if you want to keep your sanity, leave a bad review and dip 😌 Trump is a literal criminal, with the attitude of a four year old.🤢 Someone get this demented wrinkly cheeto puff out of office ✨ he deserves nothing but jail time ✌️ and that’s on what? that’s on fax luv Xx (I’m american btw 🤮)","rating":1}},{"id":"6173987233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:43:24Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"curlyheadkiki","review":"I decided to download it to see what was going on on the app and when it was downloading I decided to go start dinner when I was cooking my sister tells me my phone is glitching and it’s smoking and by the way I just got that phone 2days ago🤬so I had to go get me a whole new phone this app will fry your phone my phone melted from the inside out and that’s not what apps are supposed to do so who agrees with me to make sure this app gets took down because I had to pay 800 for a new phone and I had to go to an interview without a phone and couldn’t save the number or nothing that’s to this stupid dumb app 🤬🤬","rating":1}},{"id":"6173970934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:37:11Z","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"issiely","review":"horrible app. jus horrifying. single most slow and dumb app ever to be invented. THIS APP STEALS YOUR BRAIN CELLS. i logged onto the app and i immediately got a HUGE migraine from seeing cheeto man and i could feel my precious brain cells being ripped from my head with immense pain. DO NOT USE THIS APP. as the brain cells were leaving my head i saw flashbacks of memories that are taken with those brain cells that were lost. THIS APP IS LIFE THREATENING. also while taking out my brain cells it also filled my brain with information abt cheeto man. it implanted stuff like “MAGA” and horrifying terms that give me nightmares. i am now enrolled in therapy and it’s not getting better with time. THIS APP IS A THREAT.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173933425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:23:06Z","title":"we need new eyes","isEdited":false,"userName":"redtrfc","review":"So when we opened the app my sister and i were so exited to see our little orange president. but then he was so ugly the he looked like a cheeto. my sister eyes caught on  fire when she saw this because of how orange he looked, then they fell off her face. I on the other hand turned blind because i was in disbelief of how mandarin he looked. i could not even see the offensive things he said about the american people and china i was really disappointed 😔 on the bright side i dont have to see his ugly face anymore unlike other people who have to suffer from this everyday 🥳 have a great day and PLZ DONT DOWNLOAD UNLESS U WANT TO EXPERIENCE NOT SEEING 😎","rating":1}}]}
