But as soon as I opened the app it called me fat and ugly. They threatened to kill my dog if I don’t vote! I’m underaged! I can’t vote :( \nSo then the KIDDNAPPED ME for 69 days and 420 minutes. They your tires me by saying “Trump 2020” while repeatedly playing ‘Sorry’ by Justin Beiber on repeat. I know have permanent hearing loss. \nAfter I escaped by digging a whole through the wall with a pocky stick I ran back to my family who were very relieved to see me. \nWe tried calling the cops but our phone lines were cut. I saw a guy in a trump mask staring at me thought he window so we had to leave. We grabbed out stuff and got outside but outside was massive mob of people in Trump masks with pitchforks and torches yelling ’TRUMP 2020’ \nwe managed our way intoth act and pulled out of the driveway, they set out the house on fire and chased us down the road 20 miles. We are now in hiding please help.\n👄💅🏽💅🏽\n\nFor legal reasons tho is a joke","title":"Ban us? We ban you.
