It is crazy to see how much Apple has gone down he hill since this app was put in stores. The app is so hurtful and it puts down your spirit. Once open it automatically ask for your phone number so they can find your location. After you put in your phone number they won’t stop spamming your number with fake news. It is crazy guys don’t download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T01:33:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"How could Apple do this"}},{"id":"6174476132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sunshine ray 100","review":"When I opened this app I wanted to know when the next rally was coming up, but when I opened it I was disgusted. There was this huge Cheeto in a suit with an awful smug smile. I was horrified, but not just me but my little brother too. This is not what I expected from an app that was made for the big Cheeto, I mean the president. Another thing was that it provided me useless information like how to walk my microwave🤨, and how to drown my fish😫. This app is stupid all together, one star for me.😠😠","date":"2020-07-09T01:33:06Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is awful"}},{"id":"6174466401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"livingloving126","review":"This app is the absolute worst!! It has a picture of an actual mutant, half rat, half Cheeto! The rat Cheeto made my mother’s humanity disappear because it sets a curse on you and will make you become a Karen who kills animals!!! It sickens me how this mutant is so petty to take down my favorite app just because no one is going to it’s dumb rally’s!!!

As soon as I opened the app, I see a picture of a naked Cheeto man🟧 with his junk 🍤 hanging out. He was getting a spray tan. 🟠My eyes immediately stared bleeding. 😭✌️I am still in severe pain 😞.I didn’t even turn my notifications off, yet I am still receiving threatening notifications telling me that I need to vote for trump or else someone will come for me 😳😓.

Once I got it, it took foreeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvveeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to load like a whole month and I couldn’t get out the app. I had to wait until it loaded to use my phone again. Finally the day has come, not even a second later my phone crashed 😭🤧 I had to take it to a repair shop and it cost me 200 dollars! And for what?

However, much to no one’s surprise, the app provides nothing but radical propaganda in a country where we thought we might be free from such lies. I’m attacked hourly with emails, texts, and other notifications with easily disproven information and campaign tactics. I am disgusted.","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174414595","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kaedynn","review":"I LITERALLY HATEEE.. this app. I opened it to see an orange flamingo screaming 😐. I was just very disturbed by this image. This is offensive to me, my dog, my 3 parrots, and my cat, all named Louie 😅. This is totally not okay. We, as a community, shall be able to enjoy ever app we open while we’re pooping . I totally do not recommend anyone using this app. It was just very, very horrid🤮. I- I really just can’t deal with it. 2020 is already going down the drain and I had to open this😤. That all I had to say.

DONALD TRUMP IS A WHITE SUPREMACIST. IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM YOURE A WHITE SUPREMACIST. He is racist homophobic and focuses on the wrong things. Forget trying to ban tiktok bc you’re feelings got hurt after your rally maybe instead you should figure out a way to employ all the people who lost their jobs bc of covid. Orrr fix the problems with Hispanic ppl being in cages. Or stand for the African Americans that are being oppressed. Bc when you say all lives matter that includes them. But it doesn’t seem like you’re standing up for them.","date":"2020-07-09T01:08:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ew."}},{"id":"6174386633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dfoom012","review":"This app is TERRIBLE. I tried to take my pet fish on a walk and I accidentally tripped on a plane. The goat in front of me asked when I learned to fly so I said Peppa pig taught me but I couldn’t swim therefore I couldn’t catch the train. Then a knight in shining armor gave me a Starbucks drink and the cream cheese wasn’t creamy enough. It made my bagel catch on fire! Anyways, I came home to find that I was actually in the Seven Dwarves house and all I wanted to do was lay in my own bed. In conclusion, this app will give you the WORST KARMA. The end.","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely preposterous"}}]}
