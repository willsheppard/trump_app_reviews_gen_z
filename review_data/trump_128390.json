Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.

BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second!

Bias news sources such as The Right View. Keeps asking for location every time I click around the app despite me already entering my zip. Crashes when I click on articles. Don’t like the “War Room”, doesn’t feel very friendly. As a socialist Democrat who supported Trump, I am upset. Also, there are only American flags in pictures of articles which are BELOW the trump flag and logo... that feels like it should be against flag code. \nOh and don’t let me forget that some people may find this aspect unconstitutional - Trump is profiting off of his fame via the “points” you earn when you donate money. You can earn about 110 or so points without donating, but it doesn’t get you anywhere. If I could rate 0 stars I would.","title":"Unfriendly"}},{"id":"6176942012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:29:06Z","userName":"stupidhead1000","isEdited":false,"review":"this app has made me feel very unsafe and has opened the big span and horizon of trumps pedophilia, racism, and stupidity. i'm scared for my life and many others because of this app specifically and also trumps unhealthy mental state. this app should be shut down no questions asked and immediately. thankyou.","title":"i feel unsafe"}},{"id":"6176940831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:47Z","userName":"urmomgayyyy","isEdited":false,"review":"ANYBODY BUT TR*MP 2020.
