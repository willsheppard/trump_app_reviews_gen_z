I tried to turn it all the way off but when I touched it it shocked me. I passed out for an hour and when I woke up my room was covered in demonic symbols. I was tied to a giant chopping board along with the rest of my family. My phone was levitating in front of us holding a giant knife in its hand. It started chanting in a different language that I could not understand. I managed to escape from the demonic device.

I need you to get your act together your always talking about how much money you make off of me and the rest of your 🧚🏻TRUMPETS 🧚🏼but not giving us a sufficient app to use in order to support you. I am doubting the fact you will be able to run this country for another 🧚🏻\u200D♂️4 years🧚🏻\u200D♂️ bc you can’t even have a good app to use. Honestly I hurts me to say this but the 🤮🤮LIBERALS🤮🤮have better apps than use and I will not let that happen and don’t even get me started on these GEN-Z people trying to mess with you and your campaign on that app Tik Tok or whatever its called they need to understand to get off there phones and go OUTSIDE for once if there lives. I hate the new generation of liberals we need to stay in the past of horror instead of moving on to bigger and better things.\n\n-Love, Amy Lee Smith\n\n#allbirthdaysmatter #loveyouobama #dumptrump #settleforbiden"}},{"id":"6175656119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I just want to say something","rating":1,"userName":"Berrkkhia","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hey guys welcome BACK to my YouTube channel"}},{"id":"6175655707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Doesn’t have my vote😡😡","rating":1,"userName":"officialmikepompeo","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app as a joke to see what the hype was about. To my surprise, it was buggy and couldn’t form coherent sentences for me to read. When I went to order my tickets to a rally that I would not be attending, it took hours. Not to mention all of the lies this app tells. It is spyware that will hack into your phone and harvest your data to send to Russia. That’s right, this app is a Russian probe😤. It needs to be taken down immediately before it poisons more weak minded minds, to brain wash them with a fascist agenda. It also has over 25 sexual assault allegations, I personally think that no app should have sexual assault allegations, yet here we are. This app is also very racist. It supports a culture war, saying “white power” and calling Mexicans rapists (just to make a few). This app is very dangerous, which is why I will be, and encourage everyone else to settle for Biden. The fate of our democracy lies in the hands of the voters. We cannot go through another four years of oppression. There will be no America left by then. Anyways that got really deep. This app is dangerous -10000000/10😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6175655429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"tik tok anyone ?","rating":1,"userName":"akaaaal","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"anyone here from tik tok cuz F**K TRUMP"}},{"id":"6175654952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Never download this app it ruined my life!","rating":1,"userName":"Road😚","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:23Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As a former Trump supporter, I went to one of his rallies a few weeks ago.
