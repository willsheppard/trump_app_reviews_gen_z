I simply wanted this app to keep up with the\nbig man himself 🥳but it was too laggy and I got bored.😴 I also can’t stand that face, i mean who wants to look at it. 😳Back to my rat, i showed my rat and he lost another leg because he was so scared of that orange. 🍊HOW DARE HE SCARE MY RAT!!!😡 My friend also downloaded this app and quickly deleted it and now she has nightmares every night and has to go to therapy three times a week.👁👄👁  All I have to say is keep hiding in ur bunker u nasty troll!!!🧚\u200D♂️✨💕","title":"TRUMP 2020... on a gravestone✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6174310010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:41:03Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"andrea - #BLM","review":"This app is very offending to anyone who isn’t a white conservative. How is a president going to be so racist. The logo of the app makes me want to throw up and it made my pet rock run away. This app deserves 0 stars. I honestly would rather step in a bucket of legos instead of looking at this horrendous app. Instead of having this stupid app we should download an app to arrest the offices that killed Breonna Taylor and Elija McClain. This app promotes the opposite of what America is supposed to be as stated in the pledge of allegiance “and justice for all”. There is no justice whatsoever. Kinda sad that the administration is scared of gen z.

For someone who loves to show their face, you didn’t seem to keep that same energy during protests for equality🥱🙈 But that’s not even the worst part!😭 when I tried to get out of the app to evidently delete it, it gave me a virus that led to 10 hours of non-stop h̾o̾r̾s̾e̾ n̾o̾i̾s̾e̾s̾.😒 I was just 𝕒𝕡𝕡𝕒𝕦𝕝𝕖𝕕.

As soon as I opened the app I was violently violated 🦜and disgusted at the images that popped up, a cheeto riding a donkey🤮, a dead rat 🐄with a human eating it and a lizard with flies😬. It scared me so much that I 🐩dropped my phone into my toilet and caused it to clog and the water splashed onto my face which caused me to have an allergic 🦚reaction. So now I have a clogged toilet,👨🏼\u200D🦰 a medical bill from the ER 👙(from my rash and red bum) and a wet face all 🧤because of this app. ☘️Don’t buy it. It will only ruin your life and your face and your bills. Make the right choice and don’t buy it! Thanks.👾😹😻😿","title":"Profusely Disgusting","rating":1}}]}
