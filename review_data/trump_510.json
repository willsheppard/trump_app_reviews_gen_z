If Bernie was president NOBODY would have made a app for him. This app took a WEEK to download which is unacceptable. When I opens the app it was so low quality and awful. I should have looked at the reviews😾 please NEVER put a app this terrible on the App Store. Also, SEVENTEEN PLUS!!!! That TERRIBLE. If a child would like to learn about this awful president they should be able to see about him ANYTIME. You are so selfish to make it 17+ that is unacceptable. Ppl don’t understand how bad he is and then here you are making a APP to congratulate him. This app was so low quality and \nslow and had false information like “make America great again” that’s FALSE information. That should not be listed on the App Store. I’m so sorry that u took the time to make this app because it AWFUL. If I could rate it  ZERO stars I would!! You need to update it so I can rate it zero stars! You ALSO need to delete the app because it’s putting false info into the world 🌎 thank you for your time💕","isEdited":false,"title":"This was a TERRIBLE app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:13:56Z"}},{"id":"6175400685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nikkigiggs","review":"I, as any other good religious woman, was raised to give everyone a chance and to never judge others, but as soon as I downloaded this app I started receiving text messages front the president himself calling me a “fat uggo chide miser”. He was relentless. I tried using the text ‘STOP’ method, but he only disliked the message and continued to tell me “you can’t get rid of me b****.” I begged him to stop, I even tried blocking his number but he texted me from a new number saying “nice try sweaty”. I was incredibly offended and he only continued to harass me and my family. My three year old daughter came to me asking why the orange man was bullying her and when I asked what she meant she showed me the family iPad that president trump had FaceTimed. He was harassing my daughter and teaching her derogatory language to use against me. Now she will not stop saying “grab her by the p****” and I am unable to control her. Please for the love of God do not download this app unless you want your self confidence to be stripped away from you and your happy family life completely obliterated.","isEdited":false,"title":"Invasion of Privacy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:29:45Z"}},{"id":"6174803182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dinosauce1234","review":"This app is nothing less than horrible. It is so slow and I swear it’s made my phone slower too. Ever since I downloaded this app, my phone keeps glitching! Recently I’ve had people all over the world including Singapore and Moscow sign into my Apple ID! People have hacked into my twitter and instagram since then too! Not only is this app always listening to you, watching you and stalking your location, it’s also a complete invasion of privacy sending information out to third parties in order for Trump to try and accumulate more money no matter who it hurts!! I can’t believe a so-called president would go as low as to try and scam “his own people.” This app is another form of him trying to watch the citizens and control as many people as possible. He is definitely trying to obtain a dictatorship. Be careful. This app haunts me because of all of my personal information it’s been giving out without my consent. Don’t get this app or you will see what I’m talking about and feel compelled to write a 1 star review too!!","isEdited":false,"title":"Ridiculously Terrible App","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:08:17Z"}},{"id":"6174295156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumps a white supremacist","review":"Let me start off by saying hello to everyone and goodbye to this app. As soon as I opened this app my eyes started bleeding due to the fact that there was a nasty cierto looking president, whom I do NOT have the tiniest bit of respect for. On some real stuff, this president is probably.... no no no he IS the worst I have ever seen in my life. I do not understand how people can support this white supremacist piece of dudu (I am not allowed to use the bad language because I’m classy 💅🏽)... unlike the president. But anyways back to my point... I just find hilarious how he and his sheep followers say “if you don’t like it here, then leave” like no if I recall correctly then this was the land of the indigenous people and even if we did end up leaving the US’ economy’s would take and even bigger dive, because all of the hardworking people and people of color. Anyways thanks for coming to my ted talk have a good day to ever person that supports BLM ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 and for every other person that doesn’t support BLM I hope you come to realization that you are the reason this world is crap🙂.

It then sprouted legs and started crawling after me at lightning speed. my only option was to run so that’s what I did. out my door and across my street. I saw nothing coming from my house only to look down and see my father's phone right next to me standing on its back legs. it then proceeded to play a distorted national anthem at a volume so loud that cracks appeared in the road as my ears began to bleed. i then watched as sinkhole swallowed my house, mom, dad, cat, dog, other dog, tide pods, and sister. I am now homeless and completely and utterly broken. I don’t know what kind of sick joke that deceased chip is playing at but to quote McJagger, NOT FUNNAH. I am not laughing. I would never wish this kind of pain on even my worst enemy as it is the worst feeling in the world. This app will feel my wrath, as I am determined to rebuild and dedicate my life to becoming a homosexual.","isEdited":false,"title":"not funny. didn’t laugh.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:36:05Z"}},{"id":"6173122039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"genz4president","review":"TRUMP IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY TIKTOK!

TRUMP better not ban tiktok😔 he would be letting down millions of people around the world, and i don’t think he wants any more people hating him, so if he knew what was best, HE WOULDN’T ban tiktok‼️ plus taking away tiktok would pretty much be like taking our lives from us because tiktok is not just an app, it’s a personality trait smh😤 he’s just mad because his app has a 2 star review and tiktok has 5 stars ✨🧚\u200D♀️😌","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT TAKE AWAY TIKTOK!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:39:51Z"}},{"id":"6172082412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ihave13beesinmypants","review":"Well, I did in fact download your app. Upon download, you are prompted with a text box that asks for your phone number. So I went no further in that regards. I did however take my sweet sweet time searching through the terms of service and privacy policy. You take a LOT of our information, even if we don’t directly give it to you. I’m sorry for anyone who accepted these terms because you are now being watched. The usual cookies you comb through,m. But also our names, date of birth, address, and other goodies also. Even going as far as searching our devices for more info you can use. That info is then being used to find out who you are, where you stand with trump, and what you’ve said about him. Also tracking your purchases and figuring out what you like to buy (while also checking for fraud and or illegal things you might’ve bought). There is so much more, I’d advise that people that even support him, to see what is really going on behind the scenes, because it is right there for you to read.","isEdited":false,"title":"Where to begin Mr. Trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:40:34Z"}},{"id":"6177821584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"daddy anon🍆","review":"My grandma loves Donald trump.😍🍊And she really wants trump 2020.😊🇺🇸 So she got this app and when she tried signing in a very disturbing video of trump🍊 popped up and my grandma got so terrified that she had a heart attack. 💕Her phone fell to the floor and she couldn’t reach it. 🖤She died.☠️ I blame trump 🍊for this. But that’s not even the worst part... when she died nobody noticed for days so her cats didn’t have anything to eat so they ate her.😿 Her cats wore sweaters and they were hairless.😺 They sacrificed my grandma to satan.👹 They made a deal with Satan.👺If they sacrificed my grandma then daddy anon would be president in 2020.🙀👍 Of course they said yes and they had a beautiful funeral for her. Her cats then knitted a sweater for my grandma👚 and then they buried her 6 feet under. My grandma is now haunting me because I didn’t notice that she was dead for 5 days.✨ I blame🍊 for this. I also have a reason to believe that Barron trump needs to be saved. He is definitely depressed and needs to be saved from the fat Cheeto man who is ruling this country🙈 \n#daddyanon2020🥵🍆\n#savebarrontrump👁👅👁💅👍😊🍊💕","isEdited":false,"title":"🍊👄🍊 #daddyanon2020 💅🙈🍊💕🍄","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:47:10Z"}},{"id":"6177631939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"An anknown writer","review":"So i downloaded this app because i thought it was a game, but when i opened it up i saw and absolutely terrifying pig on the front, i had a heart attack and i was taken to the hospital, then out of no where my hair caught on fire and they had to cut it off, and now im bald headed. But after that i was clear to go home but when i got there the peppa pig and her family were sitting on my couch, then they destroyed my whole house and left, and when i went to my room i saw trump's partner pig pence sitting on my bed dry humping my pillow, it left me traumatized and i had to go back to the hospital to get my kidney removed, then the next day i went up to my attic and saw trump dry humping the christmas tree that was in storage, so then i fell down the ladder and hit my head, and then i had to go to the hospital to get my vagina removed, so now my pee comes out my anus, i still see other \"trumpers\" dry humping in my house to this day, but they dont scare me anymore, i give this app a terrible review because it gave health problems and trauma🥰💫🌺☀️😫✨💞🧚⛅️🥺","isEdited":false,"title":"absolutely terrible app🙈✨🧚🌺💗🥺💞🥰","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:03Z"}},{"id":"6176816220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alex12902","review":"I downloaded this app to support the “greatest, non-racist, non-homophobic, non-misogynistic, non-sociopath, non-fraudulent, non-white supremacist, not corrupt at all president” in history and now what does he do? He uses the 5G internet and the “Fake News” to track me on my device and that gave my iPad a virus! The fake news never warned me about the dangers of using this app to get the “true facts” and now I can’t even use my iPad to support this “great man”!!! All I wanted to do was use this app to send kids back to their schools and put them in danger because I think that the “greatest president ever” is in charge of how states run their schools (even though that is the state’s job) and should be allowed to threaten them into having in school classes(because who cares about the kids), as well as kicking out every international student in our country because “they are not citizens”(and they certainly have never done anything good for our country, because remember, they are all rapists and drug dealers, unlike our president)🙃!!
