I think he should get covid-19, but I think he’ll be fine if he follows his own advice to inject bleach into his pig body 😌. Also, can we send him diet coke? Because you know, I know there’s pictures of him drinking him and also tweeted that he “has never seen a thin person drink it.” Anyways, this review has been written by yours truly\n- ❄️","title":"Gross!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Yhaiza"}},{"id":"6174008783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:51:35Z","review":"I downloaded it thinking it was going to keep America great, but then I saw that there was an ugly burnt chicken nugget running the app and then I was horrified.
