And when I do use the app it drains my battery like crazy. Overall, the layout I dislike and hate how I can’t even get into the app without having to put my information in and sign up for things. Definitely don’t recommend!! This app forces you to sign things I didn’t want to sign and I wish I could at least get information or just SEE the app itself before having to sign my life away and pay money with all the texts they send.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173245246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️ worst app","isEdited":false,"userName":"gabriela gomezzz","date":"2020-07-08T18:19:38Z","review":"i saw many good reviews about this app so i decided to download it to support my cheeto president 🍊but once i downloaded the app and put my number in i saw an unwanted naked picture of our orange president completely nude! this is unacceptable and after clicking out of the picture my skin started turning orange and i deleted the app and my skin went back to its original color. i re downloaded the app wondering if maybe there’s a glitch or something and once i downloaded the app it kept referring me to tan salons and orange hair dye and much much more and i tried to delete the app and right before i did my phone glitched so much and it just shut off i had to get a new phone !! this app is very terrible. do not download it and if u do you will experience this or worse. please rate this app a 1 star and leave a review on your experience please","rating":1}},{"id":"6173283884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😹😹this the remix","isEdited":false,"userName":"heyimcherrypie","date":"2020-07-08T18:32:20Z","review":"This app is okay but it killed 🔪 my sister. She liked trump a lot and just turned 18 recently but then she 💦 drowned!!! My family blames it on her obsession with politics 🤪but why? Because she had an obsession with trump and this app. She spent all day 😔on this app and every trump related book,essay, etc. She never learned how to swim. The last thing she said before she died 🥳 is please don’t ban tiktok from America. Because she wants to know what all the LIBERALS 😭👶talk to each other about. #TRUMP2020 🇺🇸 Justice for My sister Alyssa! 🔪🔪🔪🔪💋💋💋","rating":2}},{"id":"6173236066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I love our orange president!","isEdited":false,"userName":"irrelavent_user","date":"2020-07-08T18:16:34Z","review":"I know what you’re gonna say “trUmP is a RaCiSt, rApiSt and a PeDo” and you’re right! I truly think it was im his best interest to r*pe those women! And little children always need to understand they only exist for men and men only!🥰 But even though i LOVE our president this app is TERRIBLE! It caused my phone to glitch for two weeks straight and upon putting my information in it kept repeatedly sending me messages from the app even though my notifications were off, waking me up in the middle of the night. In conclusion do NOT download this app it’s TERRIBLE ❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6173206493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The biggest clown in America 🤡","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ari🐸","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:48Z","review":"It collected my data and he is the worst president he also should be in jail for sexually assaulting women free those kids in ice there in CAGES it’s been almost 4 years since he became a president and he said that he was going to build a wall and that Mexico was going to pay for it and were is the wall I don’t see it overall horrible app if I could I would rate 0 stars I would horrible he is a clown and if you support him your a clown as well get a better tan you look like a orange 🍊 it’s sad get better hair is pathetic you’re a clown 🤡","rating":1}},{"id":"6173187319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is sooo trash, and here’s why...","isEdited":false,"userName":"NMNMMNMNNMNMNN","date":"2020-07-08T18:00:31Z","review":"This app is horrendous!!! If I could rate it 0 stars I would! When I downloaded it my phone screen turned ORANGE!!! And when the Orange screen went away I constantly got spam emails and messages that had only Orange emojis in them and nothing else!!! And the app would glitch out whenever I tried to open it. It was really terrible!!! To top it all off the man this app was made for is just as horrendous and disgusting!!! Point Blank Period!!!🤬💅🏾\nI said what I said! When this app gets takin down watch me celebrate like it’s June 19th😌","rating":1}},{"id":"6173162548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sent me to hospital","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bangus75","date":"2020-07-08T17:52:35Z","review":"This app is horrendous and evil ❌ When I downloaded this app and launched it, a series of flashing lights and loud noises triggered my epilepsy. I convulsed and thankfully my sister was in the room. She took me to the hospital, but because of the lack of PPE given to our medical workers and the resurgence of the virus in the United States due to the false claims and rush to reopen the country made by Trump, I also contracted the virus. I’m not able to get a respirator and with the real mortality rate, I don’t know if I’ll survive. Worst app ever. Please vote for someone who won’t let innocent Americans die while turning a blind eye.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173073857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Mah balls itch","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mah balls itchy","date":"2020-07-08T17:24:20Z","review":"The app is amazing I love it so much but the only downsides is that it took 69 hours to download which I can understand because Trump is very slow at multiple things, after a couple hours later I saw a demon under my bed 😩😿😱. And the worst part of all I saw the trump flag in my basement so the first logical thing that came to mind was to burn it and stomp on it like the kids in my base-anyways I wish I could give it a higher review but I don’t think we should be letting an orange burned peach potato sexual homophobic racist pedofile- I meant great leading president lead the country ✨🦋🙈😌❤️","rating":1}}]}
