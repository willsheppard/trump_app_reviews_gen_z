PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP!!! #trumpterrorsurvivor"}},{"id":"6178227273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:00:35Z","title":"Trump overall is just bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"potty the fed","review":"Do I need to say anything?"}},{"id":"6178225609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:00:00Z","title":"This app is trash just like our president","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Jdksbbd","review":"Trump is trash so let’s thrown him away"}},{"id":"6178220284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:58:05Z","title":"The only president to be bullied by a whole generation","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"skhchjab","review":"🥰Bunker baby 🥰\n✨ 2020 let’s make racists scared again ✨"}}]}
