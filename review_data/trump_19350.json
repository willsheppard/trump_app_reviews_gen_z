On top of this, the app is a technological disaster, as it took 48 full hours to download and when you open it all that shows up is ads for Biden. I think it’s safe to say Trump should stick to propaganda on Fox News."}},{"id":"6176664243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"curtis.haley03","date":"2020-07-09T13:16:01Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First of all the app runs very very slow and it got access to everything in my phone and since I’ve downloaded the app people in a black van has been following me to work and to the store almost every single day.
