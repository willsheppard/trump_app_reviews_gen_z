But this app for to long has been playing games with ALL OF US 🤭 I download it yknow to make America great again. Even though it was never great in the first place. 🥱 But I downloaded in hopes to help America. 🦾 when I opened the app I couldn’t believe what my eyes were telling me. It was Donald j Trump... what? 🙈How?🙊 Why? 🙉You ask... 🐒 i don’t know why... Who would’ve thought 🧐 also good for trump uniting with the BLM movement. 🎉🎉🎉 When you download the app the first picture you see is DJT throwing up the black power fist in Unity!!

Well, if you’re SO mature, why don’t you start forming your own opinions and develop a sense of morality instead of supporting a racist homophobic hateful child sex offender currently sitting in the white house? We may be young but we have brain cells that work. Age doesn’t make you any better of a person. If you’re supporting a man that sexually assaults women and children, then you’re no better than a sex offender yourself. Please go educate yourselves and stop being so close minded. You look like an idiot.","title":"shut up","userName":"Uagacsndkoqbsvfajn","date":"2020-07-08T21:24:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173716908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took 3 days to download. When I opened the app it started to glitch, as I screamed in anger my uncle pushed me down the stairs and screamed MAGA 2020. I spent 4 weeks in the hospital while my phone was glitching in the app I couldn’t use my phone or see. The doctor told me that due to shocking horrifying images on this app said I will NEVER SEE AGAIN. I encourage everyone who’s likes their vision to not download this app. Once I came home my uncle took advantage of my blindness and wrapped me in a trump flag and threw me in a fire😞. Needless to say I’m writing this from the grave.. this app cost me my life what will it cost yours?","title":"This app nearly killed me","userName":"timotheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee","date":"2020-07-08T21:02:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
