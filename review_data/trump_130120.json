Was so horrified. Not only is this app stupid, but to anyone with brains makes it obvious that he’s a dumbass who clearly only cares about himself. If he was a good president he wouldn’t have to market himself off in this way. Can’t believe this app was created with blatant disregard to anyone not white or male. This is ridiculous. I downloaded the app and my cat vomited all over the floor. She’s barely freaking sentient and is smarter than anyone who downloaded this app to support trump.","title":"Do NOT download!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Gmill159"}},{"id":"6174797051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:06:28Z","review":"I was walking mu caterpillar one day when this app came 100mph in a semi truck and brutally ran over my caterpillar and u know who was with this app driving the cheeto himself with him and his dusty crusty musty yellow hair i will never forgive them for this.

First it asked for my phone number and I barely got the know the app next. Not to mention that it kept giving me instructions. This is a free country America, why are you telling me what to do. Next I noticed all the colors in the background and this was insensitive for the color-blind community who wouldn’t even be able to see. I was appalled to see how dark the cover screen was. I wasn’t able to see what time it was or see my battery percentage. This is very important because I almost missed my daily yoga class. Once I entered my phone number this random guy kept calling and replaying me. I finally got annoyed enough to answer and he started singing to me. I’m not sure entirely what he said but I’ll try to write to the best of my ability what it was. He sang Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","title":"Horrible App 0/10 do not recommend.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"VerisnH"}}]}
