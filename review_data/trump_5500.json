Then after a month of glitching it finally downloaded and when I opened the app it kept closing or kicking me out. Also the graphics are horrendous and poor quality. This app is such terrible quality. Who ever thought about making this app should be put under consideration about ever making another app again and told to do their job right. This app needs to be deleted immediately. It’s a waste of space on the App Store.","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:29Z","userName":"Follow me on Ig: @ayyomags"}},{"id":"6173453571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"So SLOW and DANGEROUS","review":"This app is really terrible! I tried to download it, but it took me three weeks to fully download! I have really good Wi-Fi, and the app just takes forever to download! But it’s not just that, when I launched the app, it tells me to put my personal information, and then when I put fake info, it just crashes and it made my phone way slower!! Do not recommend. Do not download!!!!!!! It also injected MALWARE to my phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now the only way to fix this is if I get a new phone!!!!! The app is a waste and it will cost you $1000 for a new phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T19:30:07Z","userName":"10BGaming"}},{"id":"6173393279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TRAMATIZIN","review":"first of all this app took YEARS to download. as I was signing in I noticed that there was nowhere for my dinosaur and I to share an account. this is completely outrageous. since my dinosaur was so OUTRAGED, he bit my foot off!! this is completely unacceptable. I will need years of physical therapy that I CANNOT afford to make it through this TRAUMATIC experience which I cannot afford. another thing, once I logged in I saw there was nowhere for my pet fairy to take a poo. she was also outraged by this DISGRACE of a problem. trump 2020, ♡︎𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑦𝑙𝑒♡︎ you will be hearing from my lawyers and my dinosaur’s lawyers. hope you happy.","date":"2020-07-08T19:09:29Z","userName":"𝑏𝑜𝑏 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑒𝑟"}},{"id":"6173336899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","review":"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER!!! When I opened it my arms started to spasm and I ended up throwing my phone. It hit the wall and put a hole in the wall and broke my phone screen. Also the app made my whole house smell like carrots and Mayonnaise and all my food taste like grasshoppers. I think it also made my toilet explode 😬. Seriously I’ve never experienced more problems with an app. Even with downloading it took like 6 months to download and when it finally did download all that happened. I recommend taking it off the AppStore so that no one else has to experience toilet explosions. Also all my hair fell out.","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:37Z","userName":"sn🅾️w 🅱️unny"}},{"id":"6173309816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE!!! 😡😡😡","review":"There’s too much to count with what’s wrong neither this app. First, I saw a TikTok for the app, and I decided to give it a try. THIS WAS WEEKS AGO! Finally downloaded, wasted 4 gigs of my data, and for what? NOTHING! Second, there’s such bad lag on this app that I might as well go into a full minecraft server for the same effect. Disappointed in this app and for Apple Store for not monitoring this terrible app. The reviews are real, maybe look at them instead of being the republican white supremacists you are at Apple. Completely disgusted in the layout. It should’ve been left in the planning stages.","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:32Z","userName":"nav vanella"}},{"id":"6173285751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This App","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!! It made my phone super glitchy and my phone was at 69% when I was on this app it drained the battery to 5% within a minute! I just tried to get this app to learn about my wonderful presentation but all it did was make my phone break! I tried putting it in rice but it didn’t work!!! I’m on my way to Verizon to get a new phone! Too bad this app wasn’t helpful at all! Not to mention my house is haunted with the spirit of trump now! I walked into the bathroom this afternoon just to see a trump seance in my bathroom and a Demond in a white robe! Mr president you let me down this time🥺 and the past four years","date":"2020-07-08T18:32:57Z","userName":"AnNa loves sC"}},{"id":"6173210868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible app🤢","review":"i was scrolling through tik tok and i saw a video abt this app. i downloaded it immediately bc i love our amazing racist ✨homophobic😎, and sexist 😻president cheet- i mean  trumpie 🍊.

But then i looked at all the other things he has done. He actually tolled the cops on live tv to brig more force towards black men and woman. Honestly he also is banning an app called TikTok because he didn’t think there was enough people at his rally. We have a free will to say whatever we want and go wherever we want . The app TikTok is getting banned because influencers on there convinced people not to go to his rally because of what he did . Again we have the free will. So in that case I didn’t really find interest in this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:04:19Z","userName":"bsbnanajsjsbshhshs"}},{"id":"6172993498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My dog died because of Trump","review":"I was watching the news with my dog and he overheard trump saying we should inject bleach to prevent getting corona. I don’t know where he got the tools from but later that night when I checked on him I saw him laying on his stomach. It was pretty weird because he had a note on his stomach saying “ Trump made me do this. Ps, I accidentally pooped on your bed.” The most important thing is that I also found a bleach bottle next to him..😣😣 I’m getting emotional, sorry. Anyways Trump did this. #trumpisamurderer  #trumpkilledmydog #thatdogreallypoopedonmybed. Well that’s it for the review. Now I have to get 💩 of my bed.","date":"2020-07-08T16:59:18Z","userName":"Unhappy ex dog owner"}},{"id":"6172800378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Anyone on TikTok please read this and post it","review":"Hey let’s talk so I’m only 12 but you what I hate you with my living guts so first up you build a wall right ok and then you call Mexicans rapist you said black people who were peacefully protesting thugs you made a law that lgtq+ are not allowed to get medical care and oh yeah your a rapist not so good now are you. 👑💍👛👠👙💋🥳But the thing that really got on my nerves was that you are scared of me of GEN Z so you and the stupid government is trying to ban it well if you thought that something good came from that your wrong no one is leaving without a fight so your choice YOU PIG 🦄🏳️\u200D🌈🎉🧚\u200D♀️🧞\u200D♀️🦋","date":"2020-07-08T16:00:44Z","userName":"poopashab"}}]}
