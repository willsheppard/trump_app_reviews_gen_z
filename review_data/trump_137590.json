Read the 5 star reviews (all of which are expressing hatred and discrimination) that’s what this p.o.s. in office has down to the country. Made it trash. With the most covid deaths in the entire world because he doesn’t know how to be an actual president, so this app is a lie and a f****** joke.","rating":1,"title":"Trash","date":"2020-07-10T07:12:06Z","userName":"itsDus10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179889888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app I instantly became sick from disgust when I saw the overgrown talking orange on my screen 🤦🏾\u200D♀️. 0 out of 10 😤😒.","rating":1,"title":"This app made me sick","date":"2020-07-10T07:12:05Z","userName":"Kaythenerd","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179889515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely horrible it’s always glitching my phone and not loading","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-10T07:11:56Z","userName":"Gen Z rules over u","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179889376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Propaganda","rating":1,"title":"Useless propaganda","date":"2020-07-10T07:11:53Z","userName":"xxxemoticon","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179889411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what the intentions of my president were but I was disappointed to find out that the app doesn’t even work!

Once I finally was able to access it, my phone started to glitch when using the app. Provocative quotes that Trump has said started to pop up, such as “Grab em by the p*ssy”, and then it eventually crashes. There are also rumors that this app can give you some kind of illness? Yeah, not for me Trump but nice try. I have since deleted it off of my phone.","rating":1,"title":"Remove this app please 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💫","date":"2020-07-10T07:11:41Z","userName":"aglass1","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179888814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"horrible app. Never updates current events.

It also took 16 years to download and I don’t have that kind of time, literally, cause I’m only 14. It’s just a sucky app like everything else wrong with this world including the president himself.😊","rating":1,"title":"WHATS IT EVEN FOR🤮","date":"2020-07-10T07:11:25Z","userName":"bigbodybitty😙","isEdited":false}}]}
