My mom opened the app and her heart exploded. And then it was a domino effect. I hate this app more than life itself. It needs to get off of the App Store because it’s literally deadly. If it doesn’t get off the App Store I might just die. If I could give this app a 0 star review I would. I don’t think it even deserves a 1 star but here we are.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173697571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Many bugs!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:17Z","userName":"TrumpismyKing2024","review":"This app was filled with bugs, as soon as I tried opening the app my phone froze and it crashed on me multiple times. I ended up having to borrow another friends phone and it did the same thing on his phone. If possible I’d give this a 0 star because I’ve been trying to back up my phone since now my phone no longer works because of the bug!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173687789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👸🏽","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:46Z","userName":"🤩🥰😌✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️🌺💁🏽\u200D♀️","review":"I was a girl👧in a village doing alright then I became a princess👸overnight🌃now I gotta figure out to do it right✅so much to learn🤓and see👀up in a castle🏰with my new family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧 and a school 🏫that just for royalty 👑a whole enchanted world 🌎is waiting for me I’m so exited😆to beeee sofia the first I’m finding it what being  royal👑 is all about sofia the first making my way is an adventure 🗺 everyday sofiaaaa it’s gonna be my time⏰sofia too show them all that I’m Sofia the firsttttt","rating":1}},{"id":"6173685578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:50:58Z","userName":"Life_horses","review":"This app made my phone catch on fire as soon as I looked it up on the AppStore *BOOM* my phone burst into flames. After giving my phone an official autopsy I came to the only reasonable conclusion that it was the apps fault. Not only did it ruined my phone but it also caused such a big fire that it burned down my towns local American flag store so obviously this app is not patriotic. \n\nP.S. I am typing this review off my Samsung smart refrigerator since my phone blew up.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173667780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:30Z","userName":"simpgod69","review":"I initially got the app to see what the whole rave was about. I got it and opened it but in less than 3 seconds my phone was bombarded with horrible glitching. I saw a man with barely enough hair on his head that was just holding on for dear life, it looked absolutely atrocious. He had horrible looking skin which led me to bleach my eyes because I started to panic and get eye sores. I would not recommend this app to anyone, not even my worse enemy.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173647982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:37:32Z","userName":"JAOEO","review":"All I see a Trump but no news so this app is hella boring and the things that show are just plain out stupid like I care for America so what’s the plan trump for COVID-19 and how are you gonna solve the problem of ICE to be abolished and all the things trump is doing is bad he never made America great we have lost a lot of people to COVID-19 and we are more segregated in politics again. America is supposed to bring us together not put us apart so this is the worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6173647662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"most horrendous app to ever exist","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:37:24Z","userName":"takemybreadloaf","review":"as soon as i opened up the app, i was bombarded with pop up ads saying that i had a virus and that i needed to pay Trump $5 million dollars in order to have the virus removed. before you say anything, i got my phone yesterday and haven’t downloaded anything except this app, making it literally impossible for there to be a virus. take this app off the market, and ban it from the world.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173634735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:32:45Z","userName":"racist president hater","review":"First of all the app wouldn’t download it took 3 1/2 hours. Second after the app downloaded I saw an old orange person. It also said keep America great, America right now is not great, it needs reform. Starting with a normal person running the country. After that it asked for my phone number I would not like to give that info to whoever supports this app. They probably would use my info. I trust Facebook more.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173596643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Killed my rat","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:19:09Z","userName":"Cheetolookinbum","review":"Not only did this app make me cry- it also killed my rat. My rat was in its cage when i downloaded this app, seeing as it took WAY to long to downloaded i went and got food from my kitchen cause this b poor af. When i got back to my bedroom my rat was laid down on its back with his ears bleeding. HE WAS A PERFECTLY HEALTHY RAT NOT EVEN 2 YEARS OLD. This app killed my poor Taha...i don’t advice you get it unless you want your animal dead. ALSO BLACK/HISPANIC/ INDIGENOUS LIVES MATTER. Dumb cheeto looking toupe wearing cheeto.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173591580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍊How is this app allowed to be here🍊","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:17:23Z","userName":"Chaotic Fuse","review":"This app is running around killing people and I can’t believe apple is allowing it to still be available I download. After I opened the app it made my phone grow arms and legs and it ran around shooting colored people, thank god I’m white so it spared me. I don’t know how trump managed an app like this but it is unsafe for everyone not only kids. I’m just glad I could stop it before it burned down my house... 🍊🧚🏾\u200D♀️🎉","rating":1}}]}
