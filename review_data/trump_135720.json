(my eyes have been scarred from now on). The audacity you have to tell me to take a survey on YouTube videos and give you money is completely outrageous. Wanting to take money from children. You should be ashamed of yourself.  Once a I opened the app I felt a rush to my head like I was going to vomit. Absolutely disgusting and vile of all of you. Anyways I hope all you who participate in the production of this app burn a painful death 💖💫🧚\u200D♂️⭐️🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6133564003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Hi Bunker Boy :)","date":"2020-06-28T22:44:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Awesomesauce #0246810","review":"光芒不转弯\n\n直线不进则退 (退)\n\n理所不当然\n\n梦想无翼而飞 (起飞)\n\n筑城一个世界\n\n天选之人 (no no)\n\n觉醒在无色间迈向进阶\n\n下一个挑战向着时间行军\n\n请辩论未知的命运定或未定\n\n倒回迟疑一秒\n\n倒回后悔一秒\n\n倒回松懈一秒\n\nLimit, limit\n\n超越野心一秒\n\n超越坚持一秒\n\n超越极限一秒\n\nGet it, get it, uh\n\n地无疆 天无界\n\nIf we could turn back time\n\n再启程 再回转\n\n旅途名为超时空 回\n\nOh 重启自我\n\nMinute by minute\n\n往未来的路覆辙不再\n\nOh 无色觉醒过来\n\nTurning back time 5-4-3-2\n\nStop rewind, turn back time\n\nStop rewind, turn back time, 5-4-3-2\n\nStop (stop) rewind, turn back time (yea goddamn)\n\nStop (stop) rewind, turn back time\n\n回顾那些错过\n\n无数错过\n\n在手中留下未熄的花火\n\n那些循环因果\n\n循环因果\n\n能让懵懂改写为成熟\n\nYeah I'm a beast, don’t sweat it\n\n我会击败时间, go get it\n\n要继续继续超频揭开秘密\n\n时间的面目若拆穿\n\nI see the face of vision\n\n黎明等在更宽阔的舞台\n\n我反省完我渺小就前来\n\nLive it up double dose\n\n更多的色彩\n\n我说 no\n\n让我回到无色的我再重头\n\n从过去重新创造\n\n我将再出发觉醒后\n\n地无疆 天无界\n\nIf we could turn back time\n\n再启程 再回转\n\n旅途名为超时空 回\n\nOh 重启自我\n\nMinute by minute\n\n往未来的路覆辙不再\n\nOh 无色觉醒过来\n\nTurning back time\n\n就像万花筒般诱惑存在\n\n我们盘旋在浑沌地带\n\n请直观无色声香味触法的虚幻\n\nThe time is ticking away\n\nOh 重启自我\n\nMinute by minute\n\n往未来的路覆辙不再\n\nOh 无色觉醒过来\n\nTurning back time (take it away)\n\nOh 改写历史\n\nMinute by minute (if we could turn back time)\n\n从过往的我通往未来\n\nOh 无色觉醒过来\n\nTurning back time\n\n5-4-3-2\n\n5-4-3-2\n\nStop rewind, turn back time\n\nStop rewind"}},{"id":"6133542450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Kim namjoon President 2020","date":"2020-06-28T22:35:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stan black lives matters","review":"You say love is messed up \nYou say that it don't work\nYou don't wanna try, no, no\n(You don't wanna try, no, no)\nAnd baby, I'm no stranger\nTo heartbreak and the pain, of\nAlways being let go (Always being let go)\nAnd I know there's no making this right, this right\nAnd I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)\nBut we both found each other tonight, tonight\nSo if love is nothing more\nThan just a waste of your time\nWaste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nBaby why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nSo we don't gotta go there\nPast lovers and warfare\nIt's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)\nI don't know your secrets\nBut I'll pick up the pieces\nPull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)\nAnd I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)\nAnd I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)\nBut we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)\nSo if love is nothing more\nThan just a waste of your time\nWaste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nBaby why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me) Tell me why not\nYay, waste it on me\nDon't you think there must be a reason\nYeah, like we had our names\nDon't you think we got another season\nThat come after spring\nI wanna be your summer\nI wanna be your wave\nTreat me like a comma\nAnd I'll take you to a new phrase\nYa, come just eat me and throw me away\nIf I'm not your taste, babe, waste\nWaste it on me\nAnd I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)\nAnd I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)\nBut we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)\nSo if love is nothing more\nThan just a waste of your time\nWaste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nBaby why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me why not waste it on me\nWaste it on me\n(Waste it on me) Tell me why not"}},{"id":"6133500206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed 😡","date":"2020-06-28T22:18:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"beanz✨","review":"I downloaded this app because I’m a very ✨Christian✨ follower of 🧚✨Mr.president💖🧚.
