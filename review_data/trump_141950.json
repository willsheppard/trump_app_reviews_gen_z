Whenever you open it, to course support our favorite MAGA carrot, you are met with facial recognition software that will not let you proceed any further into the app without WEARING A MASK??! My lord and savior, Jesus Christ, did NOT put me on this Earth to breathe in my own CO2! If I refuse to go to CostCo because they enforce this stupid libtard policy, why the hell would I use an app that makes you do the same? This is outrageous! This infringes on my rights!","title":"Makes you wear a MASK to use!!!"}},{"id":"6179371042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:07:39Z","userName":"Giovanni Regis on YT","rating":1,"review":"It hacked me download and leave 1 Star!!!!!!!!!!!!","title":"LEAVE ONE STAR REVIEW"}},{"id":"6179370820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:07:35Z","userName":"Ghost in the hotel","rating":1,"review":"This💩Girl🎉Is🤡The🦟Nastiest❤️Skank🌸Bitch💴I🧚🏻Have⭐️ Ever🔥 Met💋 Do🦋Not🦷 Trust🚨 Her⛺️ She🎗Is🥈 A🥂 Fugly🥡 Slut✨.","title":"i🥵climbed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought"}},{"id":"6179370771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:07:34Z","userName":"marisolaranda99","rating":1,"review":"To you people that are commenting “y’all think those one star ratings are gonna win you the election”: these reviews might not win us the election by doing this but it’ll get this app deleted and the world will be better off because of it","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6179370505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:07:28Z","userName":"sara123445:)","rating":1,"review":"gave my phone a virus DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","title":"very glitchy"}},{"id":"6179370417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:07:26Z","userName":"✨🤩💅🏻🧞\u200D♀️😂🧚\u200D♂️🧞\u200D♂️😌💅🏻","rating":1,"review":"Just a disclaimer—if I could rate this app zero stars—if the App Store gave me the option to do so. Where do I even begin with this atrocity. First of all, the app initially brought me to a HORRENDOUS starting page with a DISGUSTING and INAPPROPRIATE image which nearly made my eyes bleed. Furthermore, the starting page is so bland Gordon Ramsay himself would crap on it. To elaborate, it is ABSOLUTELY hypocritical and of the highest stupidity for the president to make the black lives matter symbol with his fist when he does not support the movement himself. Can someone PLEASE take that fist and punch it in his face? Thank you. The AUDACITY this swollen Cheeto puff has to plaster the wrinkly raisin he calls his FACE on the app. I am certain Trump’s clothes STENCH from his idiocy and old white man smell. The font at the bottom of the starter page is as SMALL as his brain cells and penis. Keep America Great? More like Make America Worse™️.
