That I have to reset my phone so many times for it to work. But, when I did that my WiFi was slowing down like a lot. Plus, I got this app to see all the boomers and karen to see them do “the right thing” and well they didn’t. I thought when I open this app it was be calm and relax but I was traumatize!! I saw this orange person in front of my screen and I think I got nightmares from it. Anyway, this app is a bad reputation for his career still so he shouldn’t have put such an awful app in public. But, please and I mean PLEAES do not put “make America great” when all you’re trying to do is “make America white” so please don’t every put that again! Thank you thank you! Overall, I’m just saying don’t download it!","title":"Do not download 🧚🏼✨🥰"}},{"id":"6173568447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"jenn dragon","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:09:23Z","review":"honestly...i want to cry right now. considering that this app is for our super brilliant, wonderful, tech savvy, non racist, non misogynistic, president, i expected it to be better. however it took practically 3 days to download!! as soon as i downloaded it i heard a knock on my door. i opened it to see some trump supporters. they said that unless i vote for trump this year, they’ll kill my family. i told them voting for trump is the LAST thing i’d do. next thing i know they’re running over my grandmother with their car and tickling her feet!! 🦶😭it’s was HORRIBLE to watch. oh to see without my eyes if you know what i mean 😜. anyways, i’m super disappointed with this app and the people behind it. after it took so long to download it didn’t even work. smh. you will be hearing from my manager.","title":"super disappointed"}},{"id":"6173246525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Kara_Kat","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:20:02Z","review":"As you know me as a fellow t-t-trump supporter I have downloaded this app to know when and where all of the rally’s will be taking place 🤧 I booked some tickets for me and my pet Totoro to go and see my very nice president✨! Although, I had to book the tickets on another website because the app took exactly 792 seconds to download. I Did get the tickets though!! Unfortunately I’m not sure that I will be able to show up due to my other pet, bacon grease, being so tasty 😒 So instead of showing up, I will be running over my house with my land version of a submarine, I hope everyone understands that I’m not making this up and I will not be able to visit the any trump rally’s 😔 Instead of visiting the rally’s though I will be taking apart my sister whilst eating bacon grease in front of my","title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6173184867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"JaKrispy23","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:59:44Z","review":"I got this app a while ago, and I was on it 24 hours a day. I wasn’t sleeping, I wasn’t eating, I pooped in a diaper, all I was on was this app. Slowly, the more I was on this app, my Yee Yee Factor went up. I lost ALL of my melanin. I automatically grew a mullet. I somehow teleported to a crappy house in Alabama. And I grew a tattoo of a trump flag. And That’s not even it. The trump tattoo on my shoulder was slowly growing. It was crawling down my arm, growing down my chest, creeping up my neck. Eventually it was a full body tattoo. I then noticed my skin was a different texture. It felt like something I couldn’t place. When I was only a rectangle, I realized it was the texture of a flag. I am now a full Trump 2020 flag because of this app. My wife and kids don’t recognize me( I’m a flag.) I DO NOT suggest this app because you will turn into a trump flag.","title":"Be careful with this app"}},{"id":"6173153468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"da best gamer in the world","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:49:44Z","review":"I am disgusting by this man and so are all the unblinded people. I don’t even want to call him a man because he is not. 🍊🍊🥕🥕🍑🍑He thinks he is the smartest man alive but he needs to step aside and get gen Z take control. Gen Z out smarted him with his campaign in Tulsa by purchasing all the tickets and then not showing up, which made stupid Orange brain think people were going to show up. The funniest thing is if you look at him talk you can see he can’t talk because he is so high on cold medicine, people in the White House have actually reported seeing all the empty bottles of cold medicine in his office! We know you think you have done so much good but you haven’t, so now it’s time to step aside and let gen Z clean up the mess you made. Then we can start rebuilding America once and for all.","title":"Our president is a cheese doodle"}},{"id":"6173135061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Alayna Lyric Barnes","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:43:55Z","review":"I downloaded this app, wanting to get more involved in terms of my political education, however I quickly came to realize that there is no possible way to be educated based on a person’s personal beliefs and ideals. The multitude of fake news and bias I scrolled through on this platform was not only overwhelming, but enraging. The fact that someone is not only capable, but comfortable with lying to the public that they are supposed to protect, represent, and supply aid to is absolutely astounding. \n\nHowever, on a lighter note, the app needs quite a few updates if this kind of—for lack of a better word—trash is going to be continued to be spread. This app has too many glitches to stay on the app store as is. I suggest a fix on the platform itself and the information within the platform.","title":"worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173033758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"uh..i think its uh..a carrot","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:11:37Z","review":"horrible person, not a good president, his actions have made everyone’s life’s so miserable, HE HAS NO LIPS HOW WILL HE GET A KISS KISS VERY UGLY NO KISS FOR HIM. Also he’s racist, he’s a horrible human being, he doesn’t deserve to be our president cuz he raped little girls and sex traffic them. How can white people let this disgusting orange man become our president? Not to mention he also said if he wasn’t married to his wife he would date his daughter! that is disgusting that’s her father he shouldn’t be having thoughts on even touching her. Also #SAVEBARRON2020 free my boy Barrón all he wants is a good life and for his dad to pay respect towards him. Stop putting Hispanics in cages and the little kids separated from their parents, how do people sleep at night knowing it’s their fault these things are happening cuz of trump, he makes our life’s a living hell. I hate him.","title":"ugly"}},{"id":"6172979596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"john fhshshdh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:02Z","review":"I’m someone of age to vote and part of generation x but I can see why gen z wants him out of office. If writing a review pls don’t undermine gen z just cause they vocally want a good president. The app as itself though was still horrible the second it downloaded my phone glitched I started getting a bunch of emails in Russian (I used google translate) lots of them didn’t make sense once translated but I figured out I realized it was sales people I had never gotten these emails before and every other minute I would get one. I think this shows who is behind everything COMMUNISTS from Russia. I’m now contacting law agencies to get my info back before all my info is hacked. Don’t download app unless you are prepared to be hacked and don’t vote for trump unless you’re ready for a racist, rapist, and communist president #savebarron","title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6172868598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Jablartsky","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:20:41Z","review":"Me and my family got this app to learn more and support our president. But 1-2 weeks after we got it they started to change, they started to turn orange and their hand started to shrink. After a month they started looking more like Umpa Lumpas. They also were getting mode changes for example my dad started bringing in random girls at night, and my mom started painting over blm signs and was being openly racist. After about two months they were attending trump rallies all over the west coast. Unfortunately two weeks ago today they snook out. They tried to do what he couldn’t. Build The Wall. After about 1 hour and a half they got gunned down by Mexican drug lord Griselda Blanco. Last night I laid their ashes at the most recent trump rally.\n\nRip Karen and Chad\n    Two loving parents","title":"This app killed my family"}}]}
