As i had the seizure it made me knock everything down and burn my house on fire. I now have no home and live among the community of roaches. I have been pickpocketed by multiple roaches countless times and even had a knife pulled out on me. Very dangerous app and ruined my entire life. I am now in constant fear of losing my life because of the roaches, i don’t even have enough money to buy roach spray😡. I would not recommend for anyone to download this app."}},{"id":"6173535869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS","userName":"xSnowYHeart_","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:58:23Z","rating":1,"review":"today i woke up to see this app installed on my phone. i didn’t even install it which seemed kind of weird to me, but i proceeded to open the app. as soon as i opened the app, i was told to enter my email. i did so and got an email stating my ADDRESS and FULL NAME. this app tracks you and i’m sure some trump supporters are being sent to my house as we speak. i fear for my life and i advise you to never download this app and if you somehow see it on your phone, delete it immediately. this is a terrible app and it needs to be removed from the app store ASAP. 🤪💅🏼✨"}},{"id":"6173469251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cursed app","userName":"ABitchScaredOfOranges","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:28Z","rating":1,"review":"When I first downloaded the app, my whole family became racist oranges that also raped the rat army. I was so afraid that I summoned Obama and we had an epic JoJo fight, me and Obama won, of course and we threw my family down a racist landfill where all the smelly narcissistic, egocentric, racists, and rapists go. Also, this app brings horrific bad luck. I was drinking some orange juice then the juice told me it would choke me to death. I of course threw the cup out the window and came to stare at my obama mural. It seems that every orange thing became BAD. Thank you for completely making me afraid of oranges. My lawyers will be in touch."}},{"id":"6173436143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"RIP VINE 😭😢","userName":"ak74 99","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:24:10Z","rating":1,"review":"First I would like to say Trump ATE MY CHILD! 😭Fly high Olivia, we will miss you😭Anyways, I feel a duty as a citizen of America to bring attention to the fact that this app is the soul purpose and ONLY reason that Vine is gone. I think for the safety of other’s children and mental wellbeing of people everywhere this app needs to get taken down. I truly believe with the removal of this app from the App Store we can save lives. Along with the loss of my baby Olivia and my friends, many other people have reported that this app has almost got them killed. This is heartbreaking. 💔"}},{"id":"6173420617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app !!!","userName":"this app stinkys","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:18:59Z","rating":1,"review":"firstly, it took FOREVER to download and when it did it slowed my phone down completely !!! my phone shut off and when i got it to turn back on, the app wasnt there so i had to redownload. it is very slow when you click on it and alot of the information seems to be false, and trying to spread propaganda into scaring people? i didnt know news apps were supposed to do that. this app has caused deaths as well as people being uncomfortable in their own skin. honestly it is disgusting we ever let this app on the app store as its TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6173379301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I HATE THIS APP I ALMOST DIED🍊😾!","userName":"trump is a PëDœ42069","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:25Z","rating":1,"review":"this app has really grinder my gears😾! First off when i opened the app i was greeted by a LARGE cheeto puff across my screen. It was so incredibly orange it sent a orange tint over my whole house. Not long after i was directed to go to the colored section of the app. There are three possible sections to be sent sent to and this is how they were labeled: Whites😸💕. Colors🤮🧒🏿. Trumps next victims👄👧🏼. Then it started raining cheetos and the end of croissants all around my house🙀 Melania Trump showed and quickly sweeped up all the little croissant bits. All and all i found the experience very bad."}},{"id":"6173331576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"smh","userName":"pu$$yKNOCKOUT","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:47:45Z","rating":1,"review":"this is by far the worst app ever made in the history of apps made. looking at it makes me want to throw up. this app took so long to download and decided to install many viruses into my phone to the point where it it unusable. thank you trump for making me have to get a new phone😡 this will not stand with me or my husband richard, we have been married for 45 years and have supported the trump campaign until now. by golly i don’t even understand how to work this phone and to now have many virus’s installed. this has crossed the line.

App. Ever.","userName":"Gymnast9501","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:46Z","rating":1,"review":"Do not download this app!!! It took this app 8 whole days to even download onto my phone. And then when it finally did download, it would only open up to an orange loading screen and then freeze my phone until it was forced to shut down!! This app has so many bugs that I ended up having to call an exterminator. The worst part is that the app wouldn’t even allow me to delete it so now this horrid creation is stuck cluttering my home screen and is completely useless. I do not recommend at all. THIS IS YOUR WARNING!!"}},{"id":"6173308196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My cousin died because of this","userName":"😝😝😝😍😍😍🐬🐬🐬🦄🦄🦄","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:40:02Z","rating":1,"review":"One of my 24 year old cousins downloaded this app and it was on the sidewalk walking. See that so distracted by something that the app and didn’t knew sidewalk and ended and he fell off a Clift. When she was fine it started playing with death music which attracted a bird that swept and picked him up. Then fly trap in the Birdsnest and start to get an invite on a little bit of life with App Store running that horrible death music. I will never forget this Trump app. His twin sister was devastated.  If I could give it a zero out of five stars I would. Very tragic."}},{"id":"6173290510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!","userName":"MOTHER OF 3!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:29Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this application for the better in our America, yet to find out that my iPhone COMPLETELY TURNED OFF! And when I figure out how to turn it BACK ON! It has already been more then 2 DAY! and my contact information was GONE! My iPhone glitches and powers off out of NOWHERE!!
