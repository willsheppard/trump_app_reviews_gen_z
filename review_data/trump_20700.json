But I demanded it and they told ME no and I spoke to the assistant manager. He went by Barron, (#savebarron) I got my refund thanks so much Barron for refunding my app."}},{"id":"6136265866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump app","rating":1,"userName":"stygvygv","date":"2020-06-29T14:57:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is such a bad app I downloaded it and as soon as I opened it all my plates fell out of my cupboard. I thought it was just coincidence but then as my day went on more bad things started to happen. For example all the TVs in my house exploded as well as the lights flickered.

The audacity that these people have of asking for my email is frankly disgusting and creepy!!! The President Preached about protecting us from Russian Spies but the email was created in Russia that’s why I have my own Private Server to keep myself safe!! Not my President Anymore!!! Leave my Emails Alone!!!!"}},{"id":"6118711214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE","rating":1,"userName":"avid trump supporter","date":"2020-06-25T04:16:06Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I very much support the best president Donald Trump. But in downloading this app I suddenly lost all brain cells I have been admitted into the hospital because my lack of brain cells is causing me to spew absolute nonsense such as “support trump” and “trump 2020” so I recommend against downloading this app at all cost because you may end up with not a single braincell left, like me. DON’T VOTE TRUMP 2020"}},{"id":"6099527127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRACKING YOU!!","rating":1,"userName":"harold crocker","date":"2020-06-20T08:34:46Z","isEdited":false,"review":"After downloading this app I found you have to submit your phone number. If you check your settings later in your phone it shows there is now a COVID tracker in your PHONE!!! I then googled some of the news in this app and it’s!! This app is FAKE NEWS!!!! I think RUSSIA created this app to make things up and TRACK US!!! Be warned!!! RUSSIA IS ALL OVER THIS APP AND I KNOW IT!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6072305048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Decent app except...","rating":1,"userName":"Not Bryan A","date":"2020-06-13T21:36:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I could NOT enjoy the app because of the sheer amount of ads that showed up on, which is probably a bug. Hopefully it gets patched soon and this isn't a problem for many. In all honesty I'd rather spread my cheeks in front of starved lions than use this broken app, so I'd recommend to not waste your downloading it."}},{"id":"6098097281","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Poor design","rating":2,"userName":"Johnw7486","date":"2020-06-20T00:25:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I donate regularly to DJT & related causes.  I loaded the app and registered.  I then made a donation.  Then I logged out.  Now it wont let me log back in.  Why should I even need to log back... my iPhone has face recognition.  How can Trump win if programmers working for the cause are that incompetent?  Yipes.  Fix it."}}]}
