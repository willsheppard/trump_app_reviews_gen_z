I didn’t even share my email how did they get a hold of it! It was a complete violation of my privacy and I am furious 😡 I decided to do my own digging and I began researching the app. I came to the conclusion that I had to go through the apps code and see what was going on behind the scenes.  (I have a background in programming and am very familiar with the objective-c language ) it took a whole night and day but what I discovered was so disheartening it hurt my stomach.  From what I gathered it appears that the app is selling users information to the Chinese. I decided to  use my web browser to translate the emails to find anymore information and all of them were just repeating the words trump is the devil over and over again... I’m not sure what this all means but if you value the nuclear family and your rights as an American citizen do not download this app by any means unless you want to give your information to the Chinese.","title":"Beware of this app fellow Americans...","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"purple seashell"}},{"id":"6178716006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:08:53Z","review":"I knew when i met trump and he kicked me in the face and round housed my a** and called my family fly pigs, he wasn’t a good person.
