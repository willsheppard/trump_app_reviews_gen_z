But I guess one of the doctors had noticed what had happened and though I was watching child p0rn. She called the cops and they arrested me. I am now in my cell. I am bunk mates with a cereal killer!

When she did she came to me and she was possessed chanting rituals. I screamed and called for help but when she looked and her phone she saw a Cheeto and she died. I then checked her phone to see why she died and I saw the Cheeto giving a speech and I almost died. I am currently in the hospital because after I passed out my house caught on fire and my whole city burnt down because my daughter was an idiot.

I went on with my day but then I started feeling like someone was watching me I went outside not only to see a army of Cheeto puffs outside my house they started viciously attacking me. I ended up in the ER because of them. Dang Cheeto puffs stalked me through this app until they had a chance to attack me. that’s why you should delete it and the person who made it.","title":"Racist Cheeto head","userName":"now iknow whats real or fake","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:29:42Z"}},{"id":"6174105108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I’m leaving this review because Trump is attempting to violate my first amendment right of freedom of speech. It’s not my fault that the little organize Cheeto puff can’t handle being one upped by gen z. He really should have just stayed in that bunker if he’s so scared. Anyways, I truly hope Trump loses the next election and is finally held accountable for his actions. I’m tired of having a president with dozens of sexual assault allegations against him. If trump doesn’t respect women then I don’t respect him.

At first I was like, I’m sure it’s just lagging because of the high amount of creeps on the app, so I reloaded it. I opened the app to find a giant orange stain on my phone!!! I was so scared at this point, like did it give my phone a virus!!? But I looked a little closer and realized it was simply Ronald dumb on my screen. Anyways, overall, not a great experience, wouldn’t recommend 👎🏼","title":"🤢🥱🤢","userName":"pence_2074839929;7747","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:25:22Z"}},{"id":"6174053775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i opened the app to see a giant ugly cheeto and  threw up all over my house.
