This app only caused problems for my phone and i tried to download it again but all it did was shut my phone down for FIVE WEEKS. I recommend to you that you don’t download this app because all it’s going to do it bring a whole bunch of viruses into your phone and you will 99.9% have to get a new phone.","title":"terrible it should get taken down"}},{"id":"6173658617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:41:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Julieeeeessss","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","title":"Your mom 🦋🥰"}},{"id":"6173658289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:41:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Meredith Velasquez","review":"ra-ra-ra-roll 🛹 up⬆️to🥰the🎱party🎉with💎my🤸🏾\u200D♀️crazy🤪pink🥳wig🧠","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173658166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:41:07Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lolsaraslove","review":"Ok so hi this is the time where i stalked you so much but you didn’t see me 😡!! My names sexy obunga the 4th, as you saw my brother said he LOVEDD 😛 you so much he would jump from a plane for you!! Well lemme tell you MY backstory on how i would be the Obunga who stalked you 😉. So yeah my names Obunga idiot and i’m 24 cause i’m the fourth Obunga you idiot and i remember the day where you were on tv on september 11 2001 at 8:46 am with your huggeee big juicy mushy lips smacking away, I thought to myself, “wow this mans HOTT”. As you were flying the plane so radicly and lifelessly I... I just fell in love 😻 and as that plane crashed and you flew out with your big, slimy, muscular wings I just knew it was l.o.v.e at first sight. As you walked away with your bikini and platforms I was so MHMM with finding where you were, as I saw you were in New York I thought it was the perfect time to get some close ups of your frolicking locks and yellow pee hair just once, As i got a plane ticket to see you i thought to myself, “Woah this..this man is gonna BE MINE.” Teehee, as I  swept of the plane with my hairy long legs  and ran to you my lord and as i got a hotel to wait for you I watched all of your verbally weird videos and felt so yummy teehee,” now I wait and get some beauty sexy obunga the 4th sleep”. As i slept away i thought about you and me and amazing world of gumball playing in the background 😎(for legal reasons i can not record the audio). But SADLY I WOKE UP AND NOW ITS ALL OVER AAAAAAAAA. Mhm now it’s 7:23 am and i’m crying ferociously because i wanted to watch them sing “Refund the world”  But oh well 🙄. Now as i’m getting dressed and putting my trump shirt on i see a plane fall, I think to myself “jajajaja, must’ve been my brother, silly idiot obunga.” As i finish putting on my trump 2020 perfume I walk out and go to the trump tower to find you, but.. *sinffles* sadly you weren’t there so I get my long hairy legs and i run, well let’s be real here i didn’t run I dog ran teehee, as I dog ran my big legs to the place I KNEW you were at... YOU WERENT THERE AAAAAAA. So i dog ran all the way home even through DOG DOOKIE BECAUSE OF YOU!! NOW ITS OVER IM VOTING FOR MY BROTHERS SEXY SKUNNY CAT FOR PRESIDENT *spits on app cutley* GOOD BYE LOOSER 😝😘❤️","title":"The time the obungas tried to kts for trump 😛😛😳✨"}},{"id":"6173657415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:40:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Fish stick hater","review":"This big bodied Cheeto lookin ass trick almost made me die from this app just by lookin at his racist self absorbed ass.
