After looking at the app on my home screen, I knew it wasn’t for me. It gave me evil vibes and it needs to be summoned to the house of vibe for a ViBe check. President Trump got elected in 2016🧚\u200D♀️⭐️🥰✨let’s not let that happen again☀️✨💫☁️. The fact that the orange man did nothing but separate our country more and do everything but what he had on his campaign is astronomical."}},{"id":"6172437650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cateuscher","title":"Horrible terrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:19:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is so horrible and terrible 🤮made my phone glitch so much I couldn’t even go into the app, then it started making my phone glitch in all the other apps.

Instead, I was faced  with the Cheetos snapchat filter and two beady eyes behind it. Truly terrifying. I thought this app was SERIOUS. A chance for me to support the man running our country but instead Cheetos face scared me half to death and forced me to throw my phone across the room thus shattering it. If I could recommend 0 stars I would. 0/10 recommend unless you enjoy looking at Cheetos. There’s lots of them on this app."}},{"id":"6172093356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gennnnnzzzzzzzzzz","title":"Donald Trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:43:44Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I have always thought of Trump being such a great man , helping all of us fix things that Obama did but once I started really seeing him for who he is as I got older I’ve never felt so uncomfortable, unimportant , as a citizen ...
