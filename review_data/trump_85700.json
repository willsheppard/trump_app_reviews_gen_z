It was a burnt, shriveled Cheeto in front of a now tarnished American flag. I immediately threw up and fainted. When I regained my consciousness I saw the picture again and was temporarily blinded by the disgusting pig 🐷 who stood with a birds nest on his head. A few days later I thankfully was able to see again and went back on my phone to notice the words “keep America great” which made me drop and break my phone. I then wondered what had made America so great. Was it the cops murdering the very people they are supposed to be protecting? ...no. The corona virus spreading rapidly cause the world to come to a crashing halt and the troll in our White House having the incompetence to do nothing and being the cause of over 100,000 American deaths(and counting)? ...nope. How about children being separated form their families and kept in cages when their parents simply wanted to protect them and provide for them? ... I don’t think so. Perhaps finding out that Russia has a price on American soldiers heads and the racist piece of 💩 in the Oval Office did nothing? ... still no. I honestly don’t know what has made America great for the past four years and I highly doubt that trump would in any way shape or form improve America in another four years, but hey that’s just my opinion. I mean an actual opinion not a human right like equality based on race, gender, or personal identity. Anywho I feel like everyone should know that pain and spending(I had to buy a new phone) this app caused.","userName":"karenrebeccasmith"}},{"id":"6174396278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:03Z","title":"Awful","rating":1,"review":"Just awful","userName":"kam 234563/21"}},{"id":"6174381327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:04:30Z","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"review":"You get rid of tik tok, we get rid of this.","userName":"PrincesaMaia"}},{"id":"6174379887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:04:03Z","title":"literally. horrible","rating":1,"review":"i opened the app and it glitched to pornhub🤮😳i saw an orange cheeto puff holding melania trumps hand while eating a ketchup sandwich😡😡😓. so i immedietally uninstalled and i gave one star. this app has traumatized me. long live jahseh","userName":"ridicucusvdfuhcij"}}]}
