I learned nothing, all I saw was a Oompa Loompa looking old man. It is a disgrace in God’s eyes. Once going onto the app it takes thirty nine hours to download, an average app takes three to five minutes to download. But I guess this is a different case since there is a Oompa Loompa old man, once you open the app on the 46 try. Once finally loaded and could be opened. It took forty six different tries to open. Approximately what took twenty five minutes out of my day. In so many attempts, I felt frustrated, that I wanted to quit and delete the app, but no, I had determination to learn about the President that could be potentially running America for the next four years. That turned out to be disappointment, the disappointment you feel once someone fails you, the promises that they have made, but did not try to even put in action, and only made the situation worse. So after opening the app, it felt weird and suspicious, but I decided for first time to ignore my gut instincts and take the risk that a orange looking potato could track my information. That was horrible decision on part. Downloading the entire was one of the worst decisions I have made in my entire life. To have a disgrace be on my home screen was a terrible decision itself. Truly, I wanted to learn about the president through an app made by the president, but I was mistaken. And now I am getting random and suspicious calls from other cities that could possibly want my information and to torture and not treat me like the human being I am. This app should be taken down and no other person should ever feel unsafe that there information could be taken and used to capture you and be treated like a nobody. I have never written a review for an app at all. I have downloaded many apps that I dislike, but that was my fault. But this time, it was not my fault, it was me wanting to educate myself on current situation, then just sit there and assume and be wrong and continue to be ignorant. So I decided to take it upon myself and learn, and I regret deeply."}},{"id":"6178945184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:35:21Z","rating":1,"title":"no❤️","userName":"CoraBella1165","review":"this app is disgustanng and only for roaches who support trump. it took about 18 years to download and completely broke my phone so now i’m on a new one. it’s disgustang don’t download🦗🦟🦗❤️ your a 🤡 if you support trump"}},{"id":"6178939210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:33:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Just no","userName":"16 KS","review":"Way to long"}},{"id":"6178901918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:19:26Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"trump2020beach","review":"I just downloaded this app and my phone spontaneously combusted!"}},{"id":"6178882180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:12:10Z","rating":1,"title":"Keep Rating one star","userName":"navjot is fun and happy","review":"We legit about to get his app off the store Lol"}}]}
