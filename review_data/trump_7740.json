This man has nothing to offer as he has done more damage to our country then good. \n\nHe and his administration is full of criminals that have sexual assaulted children, harmed the LGBT+ community and have racially discriminated against many innocent people. He shouldn’t even have an app let alone run for President again because he is a joke. His whole campaign is a twisted horrible joke that our country doesn’t need.","userName":"LindseyJEby","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:45:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App Horrible Leader"}},{"id":"6172744892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all when I downloaded this app TOOK 3 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD, this is not acceptable!!!

The app then asked for my information, and I happily put in my name, address, phone number, and email. I didn’t understand why a dating app would ask for these, but I later found out all my information was sold and I’m scared for my life. This app glitches so much. The only things I’m seeing are ugly oranges, cheetopuffs, racists, homophobic people, bigots, and nazis. This dating app only shows the ugliest people and I’m angry, scared, and lonely now.","userName":"kpopwaterbender","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:42:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"UGLY😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6172512938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so horrible I can’t believe it it was supposed to vote not give reasons why this baby man is the worst thing to happen to American history.  Seriously how in the hell do you ruin the country you claimed to, “make great again”. Then to say if you don’t like it leave well sir your ancestors weren’t from here so since you hate it enough to try to”fix” it then you can go home too. The fact that this country is basically nazi Germany and no one cares is astonishing. You wanna make it great then leave.","userName":"keep it real not a fantic","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:39:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Complaint"}},{"id":"6172253459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible I downloaded the app the a ad popped and it was a po*n sight not only that when I pressed the icon it told me to kill myself 😔 I tried to give it one more try the it told me to give it 5 stars or they will kill me the app also showed me a video to explain why apple is “bad” 😔 I am very disappointed in the person who lives in the White House because not only is he racist he is a rapist and he orange like come on pick a struggle😒 ANYWAYS I rate this -10/10 take this app down many people will get hurt 😢","userName":"I am not Barack Obama btw😗","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:28:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t vote for trump"}},{"id":"6172115714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For some reason this made my phone really glitchy like i went on it and then it wouldn’t let me click on anything or click out of it so i had to restart my phone THEN my phone got stuck in a reboot loop and i spent 5 hours on a laptop trying to fix it. 0/10 do NOT recommend, very disappointed i expected more from my humble smart brilliant president 😔 um and then when i finally got it to turn back on the app was gone like it’s some demonic force or something.

He hasn't accomplished anything that he said he would, instead he has ignored a global pandemic, spread false medical info, and target people of the lgbtq+ and BIPOC communities.","userName":"bac_235","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:22:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Fake news, telemarketers"}}]}
