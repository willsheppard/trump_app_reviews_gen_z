This thing took a full DAY to download.  I know the admin isn’t brimming with the most tech savvy folks, but God, it’s an APP.  In 2020.  That takes a full day to download.  I’d say there’s more than an innocent (dis)informational news platform being planted onto my phone, perhaps data collection malware.  But that’s crazy.  This is America, right???\nAnd then the interface... oh, the interface.  I’ve seen some ugly ones in my day, but this takes the cake.  Beyond having a downright abysmal looking aesthetic, I can’t spend half a minute on it without this ogre of an app causing my phone to freeze.  I rebooted my device nine times in a half hour.  30 MINUTES.  For claiming to be the best at everything, surely you’d think our fearless Commander in Chief would have a somewhat functional and stable mobile platform.  I guess the tech support is as spotty as his alleged dealings with other world powers are.\nFake news?  You want it?  Look no further.  Not only are there clear cut signs of biases in the reports published on the app, but it’s as if a good number of the sources providing for this platform have agendas of their own.  Not to mention that there are individuals within this camp that seem intent on sustaining an oppressive and discriminatory landscape for particular ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, genders, etc.  If you’re looking for fair and balanced, you’re better off going to the circus to watch a capuchin monkey walking the high tight rope.  Oh, wait.  That would require an appropriate response to a global pandemic that the majority of the planet had staved off by following simple guidelines instead of making the following of these scientifically-backed countermeasures a scene of political theater.  No circus for the US because the man whose name is displayed on this app would rather line the pockets of his old pals on Wall Street at the expense of the average American’s health.\nI wanted to like this app, I really really did.  But I just can’t get behind a man who cares more about his ego and brand than he does the people who he is supposed to be leading.  I use the word “leading” very liberally, because that would entail he had any real qualification to lead anyone but himself, and at this point, I’m even skeptical of his ability to do that.  0/10, no stars, wouldn’t download again","title":"A Horrible App For A Horrible Candidate","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:24:24Z","userName":"Dubbledee10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176683246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"terrible app, takes too long to download and messy platform when you go on.","title":"do not download","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:21:04Z","userName":"ZoeJohnson914","isEdited":false}}]}
