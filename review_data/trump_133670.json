This guy as president? Hell no!","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:50Z","review":"Donald trump.. the man who does everything for “Christianity”, the man who raped and scarred many young women (12-13 year old girl) even made a bet with another man for taking a 13 year old girl’s virginity away, the man who was provoking other countries to start another world war, the man that took the rights away from the lgbtq+ community, the racist bastard, the narcissistic man who is like adolf hitler, the stupid ass man that made an app just for him, the man who feels like he should ban tiktok and other Chinese apps because he can’t look into the system, the man who was too scared to go outside if the whitehouse during the protests so he went to hide in a bunker, the white supremacists, the man who thinks immigrants and Muslims are the problem of this country when in reality it’s people like him who are the problem, the man who can sit on his ass saying to “grab women by the p$ssy” on twitter and making up fake truths to cover up his ass when there are people like Anonymous who expose the real man hiding in the bunker hiding behind his wife (that doesn’t even like him) hiding behind the flag that is now disgraced because of him with his tail between his legs making littler temper tantrums left and right when he doesn’t have his way like a toddler. You for real want this man no forget man this BOY as your president you are just like him.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173337409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ure Mómesuglí","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible Experience","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:48Z","review":"If you see anyone giving it five stars, it is NOT a trustworthy review. The second I first opened this app, my entire phone froze. It stayed frozen for at least 3 minutes. So when I deleted the app and downloaded it again, opening it didn’t freeze my phone. Instead of freezing it, I received a picture of MYSELF through my BEDROOM WINDOW from 88022. I never allowed this app to use my location! So, when I deleted it again, I received a text message from 88022 stating “Are you sure you would like to do that?” WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!?! I went through with it, of course, and I heard a knock on my door. Before I could tell her not to interact, my mother opened the door. A man wearing a “Trump 2020” shirt ROUNDHOUSE KICKED MY SON IN THE HEAD. He has a concussion now! If you are thinking about downloading this app, DON’T. It will completely glitch out your phone and maybe your son will get roundhouse kicked in the head too. Be careful.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173337302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nastypresident","isEdited":false,"title":"nasty","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:46Z","review":"terrible app for a disgusting person. how is the world letting this man become the president of our country after countless rape allegations in countless sexual assault allegations. in my opinion and the opinion of gen z and other non Trump supporters we don’t think this app should be on the App Store plus it runs terribly and Apple if you could just take it down thanks.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173337076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wowdrew12654","isEdited":false,"title":"This is a poopoo app","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:41Z","review":"The app took 7 years to actually download and when it finally did it played stupid music that made my baby poop, cry, pee, and vomit all at the same time. On top of that it also summoned an army of raccoons from the local dump to MURDER MY BABY. But because my baby is so cool it rose from the dead and got rid of the raccoons. Thankfully the music stopped playing only to play THREE SECONDS LATER summoning an army of MINI TRUMPS, it could’ve been an army of oranges I can’t really tell the difference. But these orange things were ATTACKING MY RESURRECTED BABY. So of course I called the cops but then they killed me for being black. Thank goodness my baby taught me how to come back to life. When I came back to life I tried to delete the app and lift this curse of my family but then TRUMP HIMSELF, it could’ve been a grapefruit idk, CAME TO MY DOOR, SHOVED CHLOROQUINE DOWN MY THROAT, AND THEN SLAPPED ME. So of course I slapped him back. And then he took the army of oranges to his limo and they were never seen again. So of course I will be deleting this app and voting for Kanye 2020🥳🤪🥰🥰🥰","rating":1}},{"id":"6173336572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"anonymous 2020👁💋👁","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:31Z","review":"When I got the app I was expecting to see the racist president🤡\nBut the I just saw this ugly rotten 🍊it was terrifying .
