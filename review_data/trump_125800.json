It took the 4th month of the second year after my mom was born in June to download. It took so long and every time I get on it my phone gets up and makes breakfast. Not any breakfast but toenails and car mufflers. I wish that I could rate it below one star sweet Jesus but it won’t let me! I’m deleting it and throwing my phone off a building not the app for me -1000000/10","isEdited":false,"title":"Omg this app is horrendous!!! 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-10T02:17:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"Chkbcfjn"}},{"id":"6179059267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I support my future so to be president Mr.Tump🇺🇸. but with all do respect this app is not it😔. sadly i can’t blame my wifi the downloading time is very not ok. it took 5 minutes just to load for me to confirm the action. then as it was loading it took 2.5 hours to complete. i watched a movie in that time. But i still didn’t complain cause i love Mr.Tump☺️. but the real problem started once i got into the app😐. every time i even tapped my screen an ad would pop up. and not the 15 seconds not even the 30 second ones. the ads lasted just about 3-5 minutes each😤. but i was still ok with it i was getting mad but i love Mr.Trump. but when i was showing the app and how it worked to my 7 year daughter. A clip of something inappropriate came up😑. she is 7 and i had to explain to her that the white stuff coming out of the woman was marshmallow fluff😓. that’s where i draw the line, i will still support my president but this app is not it try again 😡 \n\n(P.s China probably hacked this app so you should delete it and give it a one star rating so Apple can remove it #Trump2020🇺🇸✊🏻😌)","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump2020 but this app is not it😔","date":"2020-07-10T02:17:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"Ronnie_love"}},{"id":"6179058581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"horrible app! i download it and it hacked my phone. seriously i’ve never seen an app do this before so if your gonna download this app it will steal all your information such as emails,text messages, and will also record your phone calls. i recommend that you don’t even download this in the first place. i don’t see why you would need to. all you are doing is supporting a racist, pervert, and horrible person all together. he has not done one thing to help this country. as he promised all you trump supporters to build a wall around mexico he hasn’t even finished it yet also, who did trump say was gonna pay for it? the mexican president right? well your WRONG he lied. he in fact is the one paying for this. also on healthcare, he has failed on promise to kill off president Obama’s affordable care act. also don’t even get me started on what he has done for us during this horrible pandemic. we are all supposed to be wearing a mask for our safety and others around us but our OWN president is influencing you guys not to wear a mask. this is just embarrassing. i am EMBARRASSED to say trump is our president. we shouldn’t have to be embarrassed of that. but if you guys vote for him 2020 this embarrassment will continue. so please, settle on biden. i really hope this has changed your perspective on YOUR president.","isEdited":false,"title":"follow my insta🙂@vibew.yas","date":"2020-07-10T02:16:51Z","rating":1,"userName":"JANSBCBCJNDNSNDJ"}},{"id":"6179057845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Trump doesn’t deserve the office.

I love anime, and manga, watching, and playing basketball, drawing, video games (my favorite video game is 7 days to die), food, and cuddles, and love! Im 5'10\", 140lbs. Im also blonde, green eyes, and handsome, and my favorite colors are blue, and red, and my favorite food is pizza. 9/27/18 is the day I started watching anime (my first anime ever was Eromanga Sensei, I know it is an interesting choice xD), so please dont judge my list xD. I like all kinds of anime (action, slice of life, romance, comedy, drama, etc). Im a cool, sweet, mature, romantic, caring guy who loves hanging out with friends, and I try to make everyones day! My secret weapon is my charm, so please be my friend xD. Also follow my social medias, thank you! I try to watch anime weekly too, and Chino Kafuu is my favorite character in anime of all time. She was the first female character I liked when I first started watching anime, and the character who I looked up to the most. Shes a big reason why I watch anime. Shes really special to me, and I loved her for a long time. Shes my waifu, and I love her a lot. She will always be the most special character in anime to me, because she was the first female character I loved, and looked up to. She can't be replaced, because shes so special to me, and shes my waifu, and I love her. Shes the most special character in anime to me. Theres no one like her. I know that may sound weird, but all anime fans feel that way about a character :). RIP my 3 heros, XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD, and Kobe Bryant ;(. I also like hentai. I like yuri, and straight hentai. I like hentai mangas too! The ones that are on my manga list are ones I own, and the hentais that are on my anime list are ones I watched on different websites, so you could say I am a man of culture lol. Also I have a lot of animes I plan to watch, its just that the ones that are in my plan to watch are ones I really wanna watch. I also like to read hentai online too, and look at random hentai aswell.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me an STD","date":"2020-07-10T02:14:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"5242628389383636"}},{"id":"6179051494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗 GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗whose next👁👅👁","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-10T02:14:11Z","rating":1,"userName":"Danny Tp"}},{"id":"6179050237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"worst app i have ever downloaded! as soon as i got it, it automatically sent the oranges shrimp picture to all of my contacts including my coach. i’m kicked off the team and now all of my friends hate me! except for the weird kid, he thanked me for the picture. it also sent to my boyfriend and he came over to my house and threw my phone out the window. i’m now typing this review from my smart toilet. unbelievable. i also made the mistake of putting in my zip code and now all i’m receiving in the mail are the shrimp pictures. in conclusion i wouldn’t recommend the app. it ruins lives. don’t be a victim. niall horan 2020 🇺🇸","isEdited":false,"title":"orange cheeto got gen z-ed","date":"2020-07-10T02:13:42Z","rating":1,"userName":"only name that wasnt taken"}}]}
