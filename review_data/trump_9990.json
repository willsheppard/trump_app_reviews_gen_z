I see why so many people hate this app. Bad idea. One of my friends told me to download it and it was a big mistake. It’s terrible and offensive. The fact that an ugly Cheeto has his own app is terrible. He’s just a scared little Cheeto who wants to destroy Genz because they stomp on him everyday. What a brave guy😹 I hope this app gets deleted to nobody ever has to go through the pain of downloading it. Xoxo \nP.S I don’t like Cheetos 💋","date":"2020-07-08T18:59:12Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173319382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Really Disgusted Student","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app!","review":"When i first opened the app it asked me to set up notifications and when i pressed okay it gave me a virus on my phone and basically this sick, awful app got all my money from my accounts taken and deleted all my pictures, videos, etc.I definitely DO NOT recommend this app. Also, did I mention that they hacked into my social media’s and posted explicit stuff on there! Not okay and this app should be banned from the app store.","date":"2020-07-08T18:43:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173319288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@\"10\"","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","review":"I suddenly downloaded this but now everything is going down hill🥺😔.

I swear my phone caught some sort of virus from using it. My phone crashes and glitches every time I open up the app. No one should download this app if you like your phone. The interface is also confusing and hard to interact with. And the content, don’t even get me started about the content that is displayed on this app, it is just awful and disgusting. I would not suggest downloading such a vile app. \n✨thank you💞","date":"2020-07-08T18:27:40Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173231805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sllapspapapappop","isEdited":false,"title":"im traumatized!","review":"I downloaded this app to server our savior and do whats good for my country 🥺🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 I LOVE AMERICA 😤🤬 but as soon as i downloaded it a gremlin came to my door and hit me with a baseball bat. After i woke up in a conversation camp and they tried to brainwash me into voting for trump but they let me go after i bit one of their ears off. Also i cant even vote yet :( This app steals your info and location and shares it with bad people >:((( don’t download it!

I then fainted and could hear the white supremacists in my ear whispering “trump 2020” I then woke up in a cold sweat and deleted the app. After the app was deleted my pain was relieved, my skin was clear, and I’m thankfully not a racist trump supporter! Anyways Stan Loona 😌💅🏻","date":"2020-07-08T18:07:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173202955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GunslingerDK","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Terrible.","review":"This app is so horrible, I don’t know how it has more than 1 star. It is slow, supports the worst president America has ever had, supports racism and discrimination, and overall disgusting manners. How could anyone actually be happy with this app? It needs to be taken down immediately. I can’t even look at this disgustingly horrible app. I can’t believe it’s even on the App Store. It makes me not want to get any other app if this one’s on here. Revolting.","date":"2020-07-08T18:05:34Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173174015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"libbywood","isEdited":false,"title":"What a disappointment","review":"I downloaded the app today and I was so disappointed. This app took hours to download with my perfectly fine WiFi. When the app finally downloaded my phone started to heat up and glitch. I was hoping downloading the app would prove why I should vote for Trump but I found nothing. Also I’m very angry my kids are crying about this Kit kot app or whatever that Donald is talking about taking down. You are NOT making yourself seem better.","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:13Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173166931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"garcliea","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app","review":"This app is such a waste of time. When I downloaded the app I  had to give them my number, which I understood having to do that. But after like a day it started spamming my number with messages from this app. And then before it even did that it drained my battery, made my phone glitch, and when I would charge my phone while being on the app it wouldn’t charge. I highly DO NOT recommend you getting this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:58Z","rating":1}}]}
