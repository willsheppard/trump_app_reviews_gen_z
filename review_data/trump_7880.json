Just bad. Right when I got on my phone auto filled all my information. I’ve seen people talk about the trumpets 🎺 but I didn’t know it was real. I was approached on this app and begged to join a political cult. I have never, in my 37 years of life, been inquired to join a cult. My southern family had nine children, I was the middle child, and every single one of them has had the same thing happen to them. Trump. I am VERY disappointed, if you have a manager I would LOVE to talk to them about this behavior.","userName":"GYMNAST UNICORN CATE 🌈🦄"}},{"id":"6140175437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-30T14:21:26Z","title":"the ✨worst✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i have to say that this app has to be worse then the talking tom ones when they were watching you. not only did my grandma yell at my for downloading this app, she almost passed away from a heart attack. (this is because my whole family will NOT vote for emperor marmalade) so, i will be deleting this app, and will NEVER vote for trump because he is a sexist, rapist, racist, buttcheck on a stick. yeah, that’s what bunker boy really is .... don’t fight me on it because there is proof.   also, i would like trump 2020 🧚🏻✨💕but on a tombstone💕✨🧚🏻.     yeah ❤️","userName":"u dont need to know u weirdl"}},{"id":"6136579162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T16:35:53Z","title":"Disgusting!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is horrendous! It keeps showing me a picture of a terrifying orange blob thing that kind of looks like and ompa lompa every time i open it! This app is also racist, it called me a thug and call the corona virus the “kung-flu”! It is also misogynistic and makes me feel uncomfortable🙈. On top of that, it reeks of big macs and diet coke. After all of that trauma it has the audacity to ask me to vote for it? Honey i was shocked! Also someone bring this man a wheel chair cause he looks like he’s about to fall over at any moment. In conclusion: it’s a no for me❤️","userName":"FreshYoungKickaTyPain"}},{"id":"6135264111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T09:57:31Z","title":"i’d give it -9,999,999,999 stars","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i was really excited to use the app when it downloaded so naturally i clicked the app once it was done downloading. when i opened it the app completely crashed and it synced witch my tv and started to play Dora The Explorer on full blast which made all the birds outside my window drop dead out of the sky and then a bunch of random horse girls came up out of no where and started eating them. so unless you want dora the explorer dead birds and horse girls around i would stay far the heck away from this app.","userName":"aleeeeeeeexxxxaaa"}},{"id":"6134773090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T06:49:39Z","title":"so angry!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"my amazing president whom i love SO much seriously let me down with this one! 😡 i was trying to support our nations amazing, brave, outstanding, spectacular president donald j trump but when this app asked me for my phone number, my phone was FLOODED with phone calls and texts for the next few DAYS. extremely inappropriate and unprofessional. it interrupted not one, but TWO of my white supremacist meetings while our leader was giving an amazing heartfelt speech. it also interrupted me waving my confederate flag because it would not stop!!! so upset!!!!!","userName":"stacy phillips"}},{"id":"6134531244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T05:12:24Z","title":"Im disappointed","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It asked me for my phone number and as soon as i put it in it wouldn’t stop spamming me even though i said stop so many times that I cannot even count and THEN IT ASKED ME FOR MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND NOW I THINK THEY SOLD MY INFORMATION BECAUSE RANDOM PHONE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN TEXTING ME AND SAYING WEIRD THINGS LIKE “I’m going to kill you and you’re whole family” I THINK THEIR STALKING I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP BUT KIM NAMJOON MAKES A BETTER PRESIDENT Kim namjoon 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 and now im going to write to Raini Rodriguez about how i feel and how sad i am to relive my stress out while i sing ‘Fiesta salsa quinceañera Baila siente el ritmo ponte a sonreír’ 🤧😔😭😭","userName":"hobimysunshine"}},{"id":"6177877762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:04:07Z","title":"this is a DISGUSTING APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app makes me want to throw up 🤢🤮 and it’s not what you think it is... it shows donald trump in UNDERWEAR and just underwear with ‘ melania trump on top of him holding a sign that says “ vote for me “. this is truly a disgusting thing that no one wants to see. and there’s another part of this app where it shows that donald trump is flirting with his own daughter. whoever is a trump supporter is a 🤡 🤡. that’s all i gotta say       OBAMA 2020!!!! oh and he’s trying to ban tiktok bc he’s so scared of us but guess what WE ARE STILL GONNA TORTURE YOU!! hope you sleep well✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧜🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"barrin trump"}}]}
