I pause Mario Kart, and peek out my window to see who it is, and I see a shadowy figure that resembles Barney. I run out the back door to try to escape from Barney. As soon as I get out of my house, I run North trying to find the nearest 7 11 to rob so I have enough money to travel to Romania, change my name, and hide from Barney forever. Once I get to the 7 11 I politely ask the cashier to give me money, and I explain why I need it, and he says he won‚Äôt give me money, but he will let me come with him to travel to Brazil, but I have to hide in his suitcase in the plane ride. I tell him that I can go, but the only problem was that that we‚Äôre leaving the next week on Friday at 6:30AM so I have to hide from Barney for a week. I ask him if I can stay at his house. He says that I can, but I have to stay in his basement, and I can‚Äôt come out until the plane ride. He leaves the store and gives me a ride to his house. I am very grateful for the ride. While we are riding in the car, we have a moment of silence until he tells me that he is my father, but he left me at birth because he couldn‚Äôt deal with my mom who wouldn‚Äôt stop feeding me nutritious bud light. Once I get to his house, he shows me my room and makes me a packet of beef ramen with a tablespoon of hot sauce. Little did I know that it was drugged. I instantly go into a coma, and 1 year goes by that I am in that coma until I wake up in a room with Barney. I try to get up from the bed, but I can‚Äôt because he tied me up. Barney puts flex tape on my mouth so I can‚Äôt scream for help then he pulls out a gun. I try to wiggle my way out, but I can‚Äôt. He points the gun at my foot and counts to three then he shoots. Little did I know that there was actually a red 4x4 lego in the gun after he shoots he lets me go. However, before Barney lets me go, he tells me I have to download this app. I downloaded this app, and this app has to be one of the most horrific, terrifying app I have ever downloaded! 0 stars if I am able to rate it."}},{"id":"6175154259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dave373793","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-09T04:57:11Z","review":"The app is broken just like our president! #genz"}},{"id":"6175127981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Brandon8376282","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-09T04:48:19Z","review":"I downloaded this app and it is terrible.
