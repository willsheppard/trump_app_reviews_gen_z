He’s gonna be bloated for weeks. You know what? I’ve changed my mind as your app clearly caused this to happen. 0/10 not only is my dog dead, i will have to be cleaning up massive hamster poops for the entire duration of the rest of your presidency.","title":"TRUMP 2020, wait never mind"}},{"id":"6085055640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Janis David","date":"2020-06-17T00:33:31Z","review":"When I installed this app I was immediately surprised at what I saw. 😱 I was bombarded with pictures of our leader trump 😖( I even saw his nugget!) 🤯 I instantly poured bleach in my eyes 👁👄👁 and it was all this apps fault! 😭I could tell that this would put a curse on me, but I ignored the signals and now I have an erectile disfunction! 😡Why did trump, someone I look up to have to betray me.😔💔 I will now stream “yikes” by Nicki Minaj 😝💅🏼💓😘🥰🙈🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕✨","title":"I’m disappointed."}},{"id":"6061643518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Jessikathiel","date":"2020-06-11T05:26:18Z","review":"I just love Donald Trump. I think he’s really fighting for what our country needs right now. Trump for 4 more years! But I only gave it one star because I thought I would be able to talk with other Trump supporters on this app, and I don’t know, complain about how everything is someone else’s fault. But alas, you can’t. So I guess I have to go back to looking at my micro penis.","title":"Not what I was expecting"}},{"id":"6061376294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Eagle lover 123","date":"2020-06-11T03:40:47Z","review":"Woah, when I heard my beloved president had release his very own app I was not surprised as Donald is a remarkable man. Unfortunately, this app is more disappointing then my ex was in bed. The app is laggy, pictures are blurry, and on top of that this app sells your data! I have been getting non stop texts and calls after downloading this app. DO NOT DO IT. Waste of time. Waste of space. Not worth it.","title":"A disgrace to all apps"}},{"id":"6179199631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Bryan of Gibson","date":"2020-07-10T03:08:57Z","review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of texting the love of my life, light of this world, the peanut to my jelly, fish to my sticks, Barren Trump. But instead they sent death threats to my dog. For compensation for that, I asked for a pound of cocaine but instead they called the FBI and framed me for tax evasion and the IRS then killed my dog. I am very upset.😡😡😡. Donald tried something by making this app🤩😍✨✨how about he never does it again😘😘💖✨😌👅","title":"Worst Experience Ever!"}},{"id":"6179100432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Bracell","date":"2020-07-10T02:32:08Z","review":"I wanted to support Trump. But ever since I downloaded this app, Siri has been randomly coming on without me summoning her. Then after I deleted it she stopped doing that. I do not trust this app. I used to think President Trump was for the people but now he is listening to the people. And when I would go on the app it would crash all the time. It is poor quality.","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6179095603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"purplehatgirl","date":"2020-07-10T02:30:20Z","review":"I was so excited to download this app to be able to keep up with President Trump’s campaign & all things America. BUT, this app took 3 days to download, and upon downloading signing up to become a member took 2 HOURS. This is the worst app I have ever downloaded. The pictures on the app are god awful. Seriously, looking at a picture of Donald Trump might make you go blind. All I gotta say is gen z for the win.","title":"THE WORST APP EVER"}}]}
