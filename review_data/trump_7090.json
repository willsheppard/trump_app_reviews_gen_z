I just wanted to keep up with my favorite racist president :( i’ll just use his website i guess, you’ll have better luck using the website. the app looks like it was designed by a child. I cannot stress this enough, when you design an app, you need to take your time doing so, rather than rushing to make one so it’s for “efficient” for supporters. Everyone would rather use the website anyway!!","isEdited":false,"title":"Crashes","date":"2020-07-09T16:34:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"Emily 11 years old"}},{"id":"6177285715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App constantly crashes, barely even usable. TOOK SEVERAL DAYS TO DOWNLOAD AND WHEN IT DID IT WIPED MY DATA CLEAN! Don’t even get me started on the “social” part of the app. Awful. Someone called me fat. Worst app ever. Am I fat? There’s barely any features. Glitchy, rude people, and crashes. Maybe I am a little chubby. It’s hard after Dan left. I have 3 kids.

I’m now alone because of him, he also came in and stole my cat after beating my front door up, now people can just walk in. He stole all of my food and money and almost took off with my gold bars left from a bar fight that took place against him 3 years ago. I’m lucky to have survived, he would’ve gotten me too but my thicc juicy muscles beat him to a pulp after her killed my parents. He said he’d be back and now I’m just waiting in fear.","isEdited":false,"title":"They found me","date":"2020-07-09T15:44:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"#Why_The_Change"}},{"id":"6177163049","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was made with donald j. Rump in mind, and it must be common knowledge that donald Rump is the president of the US. By these facts i determined that this app was MADE for the one man responsible for almost 130,000 AMERICAN DEATHS(and counting) because of his ‘horrible, terrible’(rumps mannerisms) coronavirus. Rump has stated “we will feet this v- vi- virus” which gives many hope, considering the US was previously considered the ‘best country to handle a pandemic’ but Rump has proved over and over that he simply doesn’t have the brain power to do such a task. Therefore, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! !!!!! It is run by a fat narcissistic orange dictator.","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is DANGEROUS","date":"2020-07-09T15:29:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"Nina2456"}},{"id":"6177122389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is COMPLETE GARBAGE the worst app EVER used this app crashed every time I opened it, it gave my phone a virus and it over heated it. This app made me delete the majority of my apps for storage and apparently the app said it will self destruct my phone if I didn’t vote for trump so I got a new phone and tried it with a vpn thinking it will work but the app somehow managed to Spam bots to my phone and give me several viruses making my phone unusable for the past 7 days and counting. This review was made on my other backup phone if your wondering.","isEdited":false,"title":"THE WORST APP ON THE PLANET","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:10Z","rating":1,"userName":"beastaj1232"}},{"id":"6177063438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"it was the worst experience i have ever had i didn’t like how the whole premise of the app was basically a knock off version of temple run. why was a cheeto running after me and following me around a corrupt, racist, abusive, disgusting, piece of crap place called “the united states” overall i think the app designers need to do more research on current events to find out the right and wrongs of today and not be racist scum bags. i hope you take my criticism correctly and GET OUT OF OFFICE. thank you","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app i’ve ever seen in my whole entire life","date":"2020-07-09T15:01:51Z","rating":1,"userName":"GraceLizbeth"}},{"id":"6177052102","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I really wanna support the great big orange and my friends told me this app was the best way to do it but after downloading I am extremely disappointed in the usability of this app, I also started getting emails telling me to feed the great orange chicken a cheeseburger???? What’s that about???? Stop emailing me and now my mom is getting emails too I haven’t even used her email this is gross and ridiculous, and now whenever I’m on the app I feel an urge to be racist and misogynistic, I’m happy to be following the footsteps of my country tho all hail the great orange 😡❤️😡","isEdited":false,"title":"Tik tok","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:46Z","rating":1,"userName":"Finn1941"}},{"id":"6177044184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is extremely glitchy and kept crashing, and it’s there’s nothing helpful on it as well. When I downloaded it, there was nothing that was useful in any way shape or form that would help trump win or persuade people to vote for him. It also continuously crashed and lagged. Considering that the PRESIDENT of the United States made it and put zero effort into it, it’s extremely disappointing. I had hope for Trump this year, but seems like I’ll be voting against him yet again. I’d give this 0 stars if I could.","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitchy and Useless","date":"2020-07-09T14:56:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"Lexi from Gryffindor"}},{"id":"6176987534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Does anyone know how this man actually lives with himself? He is a child rapist and he has ADMITTED to it, and yet he still has the nerve to sit in our Oval Office and act like he deserves it. He is is out here sending armed soldiers to shoot innocent protesters and he sees nothing wrong with it. He is actually the worst thing to ever walk the planet and deserves nothing but the most horrible things to happen to him. And if you support him, than you are even more ignorant and asinine than he is, if that is even possible - Gen Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The worst thing I have ever spent my time on","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:17Z","rating":1,"userName":"kdnevfkabdld dlzvdlsvdjd"}},{"id":"6176929858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, it really did take forever to download. Once it did I was so excited to finally see what my great president wanted us to know to make our country great again! However once I opened it it started causing apps to crash, sometimes it would open up my messages app on its own, requested access to my bank account, and many other problematic things. I am scared this is a fake app made by CHINA to gain access to my personal info and spy on us Americans under the guise of our great president.","isEdited":false,"title":"Potential spyware 😮","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"scaredspyless"}}]}
