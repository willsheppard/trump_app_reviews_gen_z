When i opened the app my phone immediately got a virus. I got an email from the Trump campaign with the subject line calling me the n word.

Make America great again? What a joke. America was great before Trump was elected president. I think this whole ban wave thingy would be a better effort to make America “great again”. I am not a Trump supporter. Trump is a orange peel rotting away in the trash can. This app goes against probably more than half of humanity. Ban this app.","date":"2020-07-09T18:28:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177756160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"\"bop\" by hughes","title":"fix app or might as well delete it","review":"Look i actually downloaded the app and it made my phone crash. i have no type of social media but yet it made my phone crash. if i could leave a 0 start i would.","date":"2020-07-09T18:27:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177738762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Anagal0420","title":"SPAM","review":"The app kept making my phone crash and was using false propaganda to advertise the campaign. Apart from that, the slander use in the app was also excessive and they didn’t show actual reasons, evidence, or facts to support Trump’s campaign. There was only blackmail against Biden. It’s truly an unreliable app.","date":"2020-07-09T18:22:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177700398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ophelia Champon","title":"Cheeto vibes and hot Cheeto!!!😔🤬🤬","review":"I’m so sick of president trump taking away my hot Cheetos!
