Maybe it was because i opened the app on a full stomach but i threw up😬So my mom came over snd asked what i was doing and i showed her my phone. She started throwing up. We were both so confused on what was going on because we don’t get sick to our stomach that fast. So after that i deleted the app👏🏽. But when i deleted the app my phone was acting weird. It would lag really bad to the point I started to see Mr.Cheeto on my screen! I thought well maybe its nothing until he took over my screen. So i threw my phone off a cliff and everything started working better again. I think he should make this app better so people like me can get passed the first page without going through all that trauma(stan the damelio’s for clear skin😚)","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING"}},{"id":"6177431508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lizandro59","review":"I ordered a Hat AND IT GOT DILIVERED WITH POOP ON IT \n\nTikTok👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️💕","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"IT HAD POOP ON MY HAT💕🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177431229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lexiehay1015","review":"trump sucks🙀🙀🙀😼","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"dump trump"}},{"id":"6177430453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wolf and cinnobon","review":"So as a fellow supporter of the one the only ✨c h e e t o✨ I obviously got the app and I had high hopes for this app, however... I opened the app to find a disgusting image of a Cheeto Puff, and of course I got the bleach and I bleached my eyes 😍. And then they had the audacity to ask for my phone number. can you believe that? I was disgusted, this Cheeto Puff wanted my number for some reason, why? I didn’t give him the number. I’m glad I didn’t. But soon after I started seeing that Cheeto everywhere I went, and obviously I felt like throwing up! 😍😍😍. I don’t know how to make this stop, but it’s okay. Anyways what I’m tryna say is, Naruto 2020. Don’t be shy vote for Naruto. 😼😼😼😼😼. Remember kids, don’t trust Cheeto Puffs 😸","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible, horrible, 0/10, 🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6177429686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idk a name so....ya","review":"R-R-R-Roll up to the party👻with my crazy pink wig🥴but I can’t fit thru the door because😷my bootys too big🥺1%percent is human🔪99%percent plastic🤫just a sec I gotta fix my 🧚✨𝐥𝐢𝐩𝐬✨🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T16:46:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Tee hee im shy 👉👈"}},{"id":"6177429640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bigtoodies","review":"I came on here in hopes of getting the sims 4 cheat code list. Unfortunately, I was left with some oompa loompa guy? I don’t know if this is some willy wonka app or what but it was not very informative on the sims. He also talks like a sim, complete nonsense so I really thought it was a live version of the sims or something weird. Really wouldn’t recommend this app, not helpful at all. Also, DEFUND THE POLICE.
