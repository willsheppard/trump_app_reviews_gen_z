I downloaded it onto my phone to support my favorite president because I knew he was feeling down about all of the gen z kids torching him on tiktok about his 🍤 \nBut the second I opened the app it was just a bunch of pictures of his eenie teeny weenie! Completely unprofessional in my opinion, especially when I think so low of him already!\nBut wait, it gets worse! I didn’t want to see anymore of his inverted sausage, so I tried to delete the app off of my phone, but when I tried to do so, it downloaded ALL of the pictures onto my phone! I was furious! This app needs to be taken down, I don’t want anybody else to go through the trauma that I was put through. The only positive thing I have to say is that trumps ding dong is MUCH smaller than mine, and that’s really saying something, seeing as I’m a woman. Real confidence booster.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:29:02Z"}},{"id":"6174588153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ouch","userName":"hannah boritn","rating":1,"review":"I went out for a walk cause it was so beautiful out and thought of downloading this app. As soon as it opened a picture of a 🍊 popped up. Scared the living cooties out of me. I even screamed as I usually do when I get frightened however the craziest thing happened. While going for my walk I ran into some people holding flags in their front yard. The flags said “🍊 2020” i believe. They were just sitting in some yard chairs fyi. Silly lazy gooses. Any who I went up to them at first saying “good evening” and proceeded to tell them about how bad this app is. They got so mad. I don’t know why? They got so mad that they stood up, took there flags, and impaled me. The family had enough so they went back inside their house leaving me in the front yard, with this dumb app open. Last thing I saw on the app was that it was telling me I had to pay $45 to continue. Moral of the story is i’m paralyzed now. Stupid app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:04:49Z"}},{"id":"6174573611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Would give it a lower score","userName":"katyanga","rating":1,"review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I’m not married. I worked as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home everyday at 8pm at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11pm, and and make sure I get 8 hours of sleep, no matter what. After a glass of warm milk and doing stretches out of bed, I usually have no problems sleeping till morning. Just like a baby, I wake up with out any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there was no issues with my last checkup. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a quiet life. I take care not to trouble my enemies, like winning or losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know it brings me happiness. Although if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:42Z"}},{"id":"6174293392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"K-pop is awesome","userName":"k-pop is awsome","rating":1,"review":"So-sour candy\n(So-sour candy)\nI'm sour candy, so sweet then I get a little angry, yeah\nSour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low\nSour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAsk me to be nice and then I'll do it extra mean\n뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지\n비싼 척이란 말들로\n날 포장한 건 너야 (너야) 너야 (너야)\nIf you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now\n거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까\n툭 까보면 어김없이 소리질러 wow\nUh-huh (uh-huh), uh-huh (oh oh oh)\nI'm hard on the outside but if you give me time\nThen I could make time for your love\nI'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside\nI might be messed up, but I know what's up\nYou want a real taste, at least I'm not a fake\nCome, come unwrap me\nCome, come unwrap me\nI'll show you what's me\nClose your eyes, don't peek\nNow I'm undressing\nUnwrap sour candy\nCome, come unwrap me\nCome, come unwrap me\nCome on, sour candy (oh oh oh)\nI'm hard on the outside but if you give me time\nThen I could make time for your love\nI'm hard on the outside but if you see inside, inside, inside\nI'm sour candy, so sweet then I get a little angry, yeah\nSour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low\nSour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nTake a bite, take a bite\nSo-sour candy\nTake a bite, take a bite\nSo-sour candy\nTake a bite, take a bite\nSo-sour candy\nTake a bite, take a bite\nSour candy","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:35:27Z"}},{"id":"6174225898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨MY DOG LEVITATED✨","userName":"Sophia0727","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app out of curiosity because i wanted to learn more about our lord orange 🍊 come to find out once I downloaded the app my dog shape shifted into a rabid goldfish 😱 as i was running to tell my mom i fell into a POTHOLE 🕳 it was a ruthless 50 foot drop. it was almost as if i was going through splash mountain... minus the uplifting music and typical joy i experience during the ride. 🙃on an unrelated  note I still cannot get over the fact that they are changing the theme of the ride to princess and the 🐸!! i hate frogs and have an irrational fear of them🤮🐸 then the goldfish proceeded to try to eat me alive while I was stuck in the pothole defenseless!!! 🤬😡 my family watched in tears as the goldfish began to bite chunks of flesh off my body 👁👄👁 Unfortunately I didn’t make it out alive 🙄🙄🙄🙄 but still made a priority in my last few minutes to write a review on all the trouble this app is caused for me!!! no❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:11:50Z"}},{"id":"6174205474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY!","userName":"mexicogovoffical","rating":1,"review":"When first opening this app it asked me where my ancestors are from, which I thought was a bit off, but I eventually entered Germany. Immediately after I entered Germany, a large group of white, blonde hair, blue eyed, scary men banged on my front door and burst into my house yelling German at me. I was distraught and afraid for my life. They may have mentioned the word Aryan but not quite sure what that means?? I told them to leave my house immediately but they wouldn’t and eventually made me eat their toenails when I threatened to call the police🐷 on them! They even killed my pet hamster Churro. RIP baby Churro you’ll never be forgotten😞💀. I will not allow Churro’s death to go unnoticed and am writing this review so you can protect yourselves! Despite deleting the app I keep getting messages from Trump’s🤡 campaign asking me if I’m sexually attracted to cheetos🟠? This is definitely NOT what I signed up for. 😡😡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:04:14Z"}},{"id":"6173788993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!😤","userName":"Dolphingirl213 AJ","rating":1,"review":"I wanted to download this app to feel proud to be an American and to make America great again but once installing this app, it took me at least 6 hours to get it download with trial and error. When the app finally downloaded it had crash my entire phone. I couldn’t access anything such as my tik tok nor instagram and i noticed that my screen would flash orange from time to time. It got so awful that I had to factory reset my phone. But after factory resetting, these glitches remained the same and the only thing i could hear is the “Star Spangled Banner” by Fergy. I decided to throw away my iphone because of this. I am now in debt due to the fact that I had to buy another iphone because samsungs are not aesthetically pleasing to my eyes. Therefore, this is a TRASH app. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT UNLESS YOU WANNA KILL YOUR PHONE. Anyways Chile, who wants something from Chipotle, while i walk my fridge???","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:28:58Z"}},{"id":"6173716300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just no 💕","userName":"Oh no, not the cheeto puff ✨💕","rating":1,"review":"I was very excited to install the app of my beloved Cheeto, but unfortunately the app took 3 days to install and during this time I was unable to use any of the other apps on my phone. Not only that, but the app began to give my phone screen an annoying orange tint as it downloaded. Once it finished installing, it drained my phone down to 10% within 15 minutes. Exactly 1 hour after downloaded it, 5 men dressed in orange suits and Donald Trump masks arrived at my house, demanded my family to let them in and when we refused, they shot down the front door. They began to release cockroaches and took my pet turtle, trying to make it choke on a plastic straw while simultaneously boiling it alive. The orange men in suits then took us out of our house and burned it down. Due to these unfortunate events caused by this app, I am forced to uninstall it and give a 1 star review. No hate to my disgusting orange Cheeto puff. ☺️💞✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:02:09Z"}},{"id":"6173625646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not download","userName":"an0n👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"wanted to get this app to try and educate myself because based off of other sources I read, the president doesn’t seem like someone to support. it baffles me that people do. Despite that I still wanted to see why people supported him that didn’t have to do with the economy. To my surprise, I download the app and all of a sudden my phone starts glitching. It stopped charging, music started playing every time i opened my phone, I can’t text, and I always miss calls because my phone no longer shows me when people call. The keyboard glitches too. As we speak I am barely able to type these words out. It’s a lot of lagging and back tracking to get it correctly. Basically do not download this app. It’ll make your phone glitch and it didn’t even provide me with what I thought it would. Not educational. Seems to promote hate more than anything :(","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:32Z"}},{"id":"6173224797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad app and bad president","userName":"ratethisapp5starspls","rating":1,"review":"Trump has created less jobs than Obama did in 3 years. Trump also didn’t even build a wall like he said he would, i was against him building the wall so I’m quite pleased that it never happened but it shows the people who wanted it that he’s unreliable. He also has put us in a ton of debt. Did people really think a man who talked about women and said “grab em by the pu***” knowing he was being recorded would make a good president. He doesn’t respect women and thinks of them as if their objects. He called the coronavirus the Kung-flu. Trump also referred to black lives matter protesters fighting for basic civil rights for black people as “thugs”, and white armed people protesting to decry the stay at home order and to be able to get a haircut and do other very unnecessary things during a literal global pandemic as “good people”. And you can look it up, he’s done lots more of horrible things.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:12:51Z"}}]}
