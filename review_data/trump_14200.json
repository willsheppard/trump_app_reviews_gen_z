This app is constantly crashing on my brand new iPhone 11. It keeps glitching as well so I can’t even use it for what it’s intended for! I have perfect WiFi and it keeps saying it cannot connect to my WiFi. Stupid! Once it even started flashing uncontrollably! Do you know how dangerous that is for people with seizure conditions? Do not download this app. It is a waste of time and space!","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP DON’T DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T14:03:07Z","userName":"peachyhot@yahoo","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172349432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is terrible, not to mention the orangutan who is sadly the president. i’m giving this a ONE STAR because not only is our president a RACIST and a white supremacist, but he doesn’t believe in simple science like climate change. awwww poor mr president sad because no one showed up at your rallies 🥺🥺 that’s because you’re a terrible president who only cares about yourself 🥰🥰. let’s make this year your last year, hopefully the simpsons will COME THRU!!!!😝✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1,"title":"no ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T13:55:22Z","userName":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🥰","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172301074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so garbage. Glitches my phone almost to the point of shutting down.i swear to god if this app doesn’t get taken down I’ll scream. It caused me so many problems like glitching text and opening the app. I downloaded this for trump but what I got was trash and made me angry. And no it wasn’t my phone doing this it was the app bc as soon as I deleted it it stopped. What a shame our own president doesn’t know how to make an app!!","rating":1,"title":"Wow the audacity","date":"2020-07-08T13:42:01Z","userName":"jdkxkcnmss","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172210625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"A president that continues to promote his OWN self interest does not belong in power. A true president listens to his people, weather they share his views or not. Communication on differing ideas promotes growth. Donald Trump chooses to silence those who disagree with him and remains blinded to an America that wants to grow. Grow beyond racism, beyond fascism, beyond “complete loyalty” because different people have different ideas and by combining those ideas is how we become ideal. #anyonebuttrump2020","rating":1,"title":"Fascist Police State","date":"2020-07-08T13:16:52Z","userName":"DaddyAnonymous69","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172004307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible it kept kicking me out and when i first downloaded it, all i saw was this hideous orange man standing there, I should see a black man standing there and it’s supposed to be official Obama app, They seriously need to update this app,  And why does this man hate black people and hispanics? smh he’s racist and does he realize he’s not white? he’s orange.

Apps weren’t opening properly, and it kept turning off and on. The app asked for my contact info (which I did enter so that I could access the app) and now I’m receiving calls and texts throughout the night. I think the company sold my phone number to telemarketers, or the company itself is contacting me. Do not recommend.","rating":1,"title":"Awful!","date":"2020-07-08T10:50:48Z","userName":"Panic!
