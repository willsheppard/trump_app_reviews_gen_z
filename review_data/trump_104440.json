SEXY expired hot cheetos.\n\n “are you ready baby girl?” his voice curdled.\n\n“i leaned my neck back. \n\n“Show me everything.”\n\nhe delicately removed his mask. your eyes lightened, expecting a handsome young beau with fantasies and love for you beyond compare.\n\na pudgy orange stump stared back. his eyes were laced with greed and triumph. he wore a stained blue suit, complementing his shaggy balding flaxen hair horribly. his grip felt like moldy peanut butter as he grasped your hands.\n\ncoincidentally, your hands started to shake. hard.\nHE was your love? the man you were willing so hard to run away with, willing so hard to create a life with? It was Donald Trump? \n\nthe president.\n\nhis mouth quirked with a smile. “come here,”\nhe growled.\n\nyou’ve never run harder then that.","userName":"hendmsbk","date":"2020-07-09T20:34:36Z"}},{"id":"6178138565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Spam","review":"Spam","userName":"Cashepuck","date":"2020-07-09T20:29:46Z"}},{"id":"6178135840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"anonymous president 2020","review":"it doesn’t make sense","userName":"jhonbgetyouheadinmybutt","date":"2020-07-09T20:28:53Z"}},{"id":"6178122233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"That was trash","review":"That was trash😹","userName":"bruh374728","date":"2020-07-09T20:24:14Z"}},{"id":"6178108489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!","review":"0/10 do not recommend!","userName":"frivcrgjnn","date":"2020-07-09T20:19:40Z"}},{"id":"6178104884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BAD","review":"gross- never support","userName":"teganhat","date":"2020-07-09T20:18:30Z"}}]}
