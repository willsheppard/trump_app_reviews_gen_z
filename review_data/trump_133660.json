It took 9 years and 10 days to download and when it finally did I found myself cursed and haunted by toads and raspberry’s. The app itself released the toads and raspberry’s from my screen and they immediately morphed together into a giant toad shaped raspberry that likes to follow me around and haunt  me while I sleep. It literally won’t leave me alone and I’m super disappointed that this app would cause such and inconvenience. The toad-raspberry is sitting right next to me as I wright this review and it has a smug expression because it thinks it’s better than me or something. I cannot believe this. This app must be taken down before other poor souls that download it are haunted by toad-raspberrys like me. Please have mercy on us innocent people and take down this app for the safety of us all.🍇🐸🍇🥺","date":"2020-07-08T18:50:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173339305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"e","rating":1,"userName":"RAT RATTY","review":"i downloaded this because i love my racist president but the downloading took soooo long and the downloading kept staying at 1% for 2 hours!!! i’m so disappointed in this.when it did download,(it look several hours)my phone kept on glitching really bad and i couldn’t do anything in my phone until i deleted the app!before i deleted it i tried to go on the app and all i saw was this: 🟠\ni couldn’t press anything at all besides the screen but when i did the pictures of the 🟠 would change to worse pictures😱1 star review😜","date":"2020-07-08T18:50:27Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173339307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"blm","rating":1,"userName":"becca1877","review":"this is by far the worst app i’ve ever downloaded in my entire life. the second it was finished downloading it started playing Cardi B and Shane Dawson music, which obviously broke my earbuds. then once i opened the app it made my phone reset and gave me 420 viruses!! it threatened to burn my house down, hunt down my puppy and expel me from my school. i have never been so disappointed in an app in my life, it’s got to be one of the worst decisions i’ve ever made. -929292/10, i would never EVER recommend this for anyone in my life. it is absolutely shameful that Donald Trump would even put this app out onto the app store, for SHAME. I would rather download TEMPLE RUN than ever have to even glance at this app again.","date":"2020-07-08T18:50:27Z","isEdited":false}}]}
