I thought not.\n\nIt’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…\n\nHe had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.\n\nUnfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\n\nYeah anyways I nearly drowned when I used this app so that kinda stinks.","title":"Nearly drowned using this app 😱😱","userName":"StinkyHarambe","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:05:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172281995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and it was all good at first, except for when it glitches to an orange in a suit standing at a mic for some reason, I was quite confused then all of a sudden my phone screen turns black so I thought the problem was my phone. I restarted it thinking it would work and you WOULD NOT believe what I saw.. It was a man inside of a woman pushing himself in her behind😨 I don’t know what could’ve caused it! I let my sister try out the app and the same thing happened.","title":"Kept exiting to phub","userName":"Kill Trump to save 2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:36:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172266461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is disgusting. I don’t even know why anyone would ever download this awful app. Pleases delete this horrible app of off the App Store. If anyone downloads this I request that you go to a mental institution. Please do NOT download this terrible, racist, sexist, and many more awful things app. This app is the equivalencies to a port-a-potty at a rock concert sitting in the sun for over a week while over three people have thrown up and had diarrhea in it and it is also sitting next to a big steaming dumpster. DO NOT GET THIS NASTY APP.","title":"Disgusting","userName":"babynuggs333","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:32:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172173823","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in attempt to support our racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and rapist president. When I first opened the app all I saw was a Cheeto puff asking for my phone number. Considering that he sexualized his own daughter and looks at women like objects, I did not give this app my phone number. In all seriousness Trump is is a horrible person and president. Anyone who supports him (mostly white males) clearly has decided that someone being a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and rapist is not a deal breaker for you. You are disgusting.","title":"Disgusting","userName":"Soph M.

He then sent a video of him tying his wife up to the bed and penetrating her anus with a light bulb. I am disgusted. Do not recommend💦💦💦👅👅👅🍆🍆","title":"Horrible, don’t download","userName":"bigbootymamas","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:12:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171980183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app kept glitching, showing a big orange circle and almost froze my whole phone. I downloaded it know how horrible our president is but hoping to find any form of redeeming quality. Which the app essentially only highlights all those horrible things like they are in fact good and trying to take responsibility for the things the Obama administration did. Overall horrible app and person but whatever y’all can support him it you want, I’m out.","title":"Horrible App development","userName":"Extremely Accurate Reads","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:10:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171700408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a whole day to download and when it downloaded it was glitchy and awful😤😤After a day my dog looked at the app he died on the spot!😳🤯it was awful and now I’m unlucky because of this app!!!😖😖I even fell off a building because of this😱😱I would never recommend this app to anyone😩😩it even released private information to everyone about me!😞😞 AND this app deleted half of the apps on my phone!!!😠😠😠I think it’s better for The App Store to remove this app!!!!!","title":"MY DOG DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP😡😭","userName":"....%%.?€","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T10:41:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171626971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He hasn’t done anything great for this country and he loves to manipulate people. He wants to take away our freedom of speech but a lot of conservatives don’t see it. I find this app very offensive because it is spread lies about who Trump really is, a bad person. Plus it glitching too much and for some reason it’s watching my phone activity and I don’t feel comfortable with that. So I suggest it gets removed or removed.\n\nThank you for listening to my concerns, it is very important.","title":"Black Lives Matter","userName":"Hurry N Fix","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T10:16:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6145170431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app, super hopeful that it would lead me to fantastic political discoveries, bad things started happening to me. It’s not a coincidence that my first time in the app, I got blinded by Trumps bright orange face and I spilled spaghetti sauce down my new white shirt. While I was trying to wash it off in the sink, I slipped on some soap on the floor and slid right into my pet fish’s bowl, causing him to die on impact! For the sake of Swim Shady (rest in peace little buddy), I would never recommend for anyone to get this app! YOUR PETS LIVES DEPEND ON IT!","title":"Gives you bad karma","userName":"rip swim shady","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T17:50:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6135169651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was scrolling through the app and came upon some questions that i had in mind. i called the number provided as support and a woman named Karen was immediately rude. she kept accusing me of being “too busy” while to talk on the phone while i was walking my pet fly, who, by the way, was throwing maga hats non-stop on the side walk. when i told karen the situation, she proceeded to tell me to jump off a bridge and hung up. i’ve never been more appalled by this “professionalism”.","title":"Never Been More Disappointed","userName":"berth-a","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T09:23:29Z","isEdited":false}}]}
