Automatically as ANY woman would, i felt THREATENED by his act of violence. He looked SUSPICIOUS you know?? I just cant believe we have to actually look at something like that😔 I didn’t get much further into the app because it told me to ENTER MY NUMBER. FIRST OF ALL, this CHEETO threatened me. THEN, he asks me for my number?!?! This is so inappropriate I just don’t even know what to say. To say the least, the app has been deleted and I can now move onto better things with my life."}},{"id":"6174129327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:36:08Z","userName":"Khadija_05","rating":1,"title":"App review","review":"This is the most ✨𝘥 𝘪 𝘴 𝘨 𝘶 𝘴 𝘵 𝘪 𝘯 𝘨 ✨ app I ever downloaded and have to use. Everything about the app from the first feature to the last listed is absolutely trash. Nothing about it is good and I don’t recommend downloading it. And if you still continue to do then download it, write about how useless racist and disgusting this content is and delete the app ✨😌✋May this app never have to be in the App Store ever again. With none of its associations and it’s racist people 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻This app along with all the rest of the creators drinks like dirt pigs 🐷"}},{"id":"6174038437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:02:38Z","userName":"MayR0101","rating":1,"title":"Unbelievable","review":"this app is not at all as advertised.  i was expecting a political app but when i first opened it, i was greeted with horribly inappropriate pictures that i will have the decency not to describe here. just be warned that i am now legally blind because of the terrible effect of these pictures on my sight. on top of this, when i attempted to contact whoever was in charge of the app to place a complaint, i was turned away extremely rudely! unbelievable! the layout could also use work. i would rate this negative stars if i could. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6174010321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:52:10Z","userName":"idk285","rating":1,"title":"This app is horrifying","review":"The second the app opened I witnessed a burnt Cheeto screaming and if that wasn’t bad enough the Cheeto was badly photoshopped into a person. My dog was next to me when I opened the app and he had to see the pictures also. Everything about the app was so horrible that he ended up dying of a stroke shortly after. I recommend never downloading this app unless you want to die of a stroke also. I feel like I might die soon from how scared I am so I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else also. Goodbye I’m going to go die in peace now."}},{"id":"6173980994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:41:01Z","userName":"big momma jojo","rating":1,"title":"WORST THING IN THE PLANET","review":"The moment I opened this app my wife asked for a divorce and now she’s taking my 2 kids, Cornelius and Bartholomew, and she’s taking all of my money!!! I also lose my house, my car, my job like 5 minutes after. After my wife who divorced me and took my kids, lost my house, car, and house, I was left with my dog, Milkshake,  who’s my best friend and he aggressively attacked me and now I have no legs since I had to get them amputated from the attack. Now I have a $500,000 hospital bill to pay. This all happened as soon as I downloaded the app."}},{"id":"6173925673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:20:19Z","userName":"Flamisha","rating":1,"title":"✨oh honey no✨ 👁👄👁","review":"I downloaded this app and it has caused my life to spiral downward into a thickening dark hole. When I opened the app in my kitchen, a horrific orange looking thing appeared on my screen. The oranges on my table immediately became DISGUSTED with me and half of them jumped off of the table (r.i.p.😔). One of the oranges even grabbed a knife and repeatedly stabbed me! Luckily I made it to the hospital in time and am still recovering. My oranges that remain alive now need therapy and are suffering from emotional and mental trauma. Plz pray for them I truly care about my orange’s life, and I constantly regret downloading this app. 🙏🏽🍊"}},{"id":"6173900630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:11:08Z","userName":"Le_idkmesajusbored","rating":1,"title":"Oh no..","review":"when I opened the app it started asking for my information such as where I live and what my search history looks like, and other violating questions. It showed me disgusting pictures of an orange man with a tiny banana. This app even told me to commit suicide! I can’t believe what the Trump 2020 app has done. It has caused me and others in my family to go insane! There is screaming and yelling everywhere I go after downloading this app. There is absolutely nothing positive to come out of this app, it will destroy what we love. Please get rid of the Trump 2020 app!"}},{"id":"6173885483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:05:38Z","userName":"mike hunt😛","rating":1,"title":"No thanks❤️❤️🥰","review":"This app makes me sad and deeply disturbed. It is offensive and slowly but surely diminishes my will to live. I would never recommend this app to anyone for its just that awful. Unbelievable that any platform allows this to stay. It’s gross and smelly and distracting me from having a good productive day. Images and videos included in this app, which you have to pay for is inhumanly visible for anyone’s eyes, including innocent children of the world. Please take this away so my future children and family will never have to experience what I have."}},{"id":"6173885313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:05:34Z","userName":"wolfblue76","rating":1,"title":"very offensive","review":"i downloaded this app because i am a pround right winged trump supporter. when i opened the app, i saw an obese, soggy, cheeto on a sign up screen and it was very explicit. i don’t think a presidents administration should have that kind of explicit imagery on a campaign app. i investigated further by making an account and logging in and what i saw was 100x worse than what i had seen before. it was trump x anonymous hentai and smut catalogs including 20 different hentai tv shows, each with 15 seasons, 30 episodes a season. it was so terrifying to gaze at with my own eyes. i don’t want to see the man ( or baby man ) whom is “my president” having this kind of content on his app. i am very unhappy and this has changed my views on everything. i am now a far left bernie supporter. i am very disappointed for you mr president and i will now be voting biden this upcoming election day."}},{"id":"6173869503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:59:47Z","userName":"The App Judge 🔎","rating":1,"title":"WORST app","review":"first, the app made my entire phone glitch and it started saying, ‘all lives matter’ and ‘trump 2020’ (im deaf btw) anyway, let’s talk about the actual app itself. when you first download the app, it shows a picture of some old, wrinkly spray tanned MESS, and it just such a pain to look at made me want to delete the app right away. then, the app FORCES you to enter your phone number and then constantly sends you incessant texts ALL THE TIME! this app ruined my phone and i wish i never downloaded it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, TAKE IT OFF THE APPSTORE. and also, #trumpforprison2020 🙈✨🧚🏻😌❤️💅🏼"}}]}
