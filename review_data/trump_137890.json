I initially downloaded the app thinking “okay now I have some preconceived notions about this man but since all of his supporters say we’re overreacting, maybe this app will show me who he really is”. Sad to say, I was highly disappointed. When the app FINALLY downloaded after a week, I was met with the face of 45 himself, and to say it scarred me would be an understatement. Not only was his tan uneven, but he was holding up a very pale, wrinkled fist. I can only hope he was not mocking the BLM symbol. This app seriously gave me nightmares, just remembering how 45 pushed all those supporters out to walk to a church and have a photo op wit a borrowed, upside-down bible and how he managed to get trolled by teenagers and young adults who can’t even ask for extra ketchup packets at restaurants (but it somehow able to run a country??) gives me the chills. 0 out of 10 do not recommend this app. Smh, he could at least put some flavor into the design 🙄.","userName":"Jada0329"}}]}
