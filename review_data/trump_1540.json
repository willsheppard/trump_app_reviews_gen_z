How could something so disgusting be allowed on the App Store? I downloaded the app to send my praise and get updates as to the goings on of our glorious dictator Cheeto. But when I opened the app a man appeared in my bedroom(!?!) and told me if I don’t eat over 9,000 oranges I will be charged with treason!?! As I attempt to devour these oranges (a sad excuse for oranges - they were clementines at best) the man began to recite the entire script of the bee movie but each time he said the word “bee” he was some how able to go 2x as loud until his voice was so booming and shrill that the glass in my windows shattered.  How dare he come into my own home and recite texts that worship bee-stiality?? I knew there was only one solution to stopping this disgusting experience and that was deleting the app. I do not recommend.","userName":"cheetoworshiper666","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174230696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WHY IS THERE A FROG IN MY TOILET","review":"This is the first time I’ve ever downloaded an app so I thought why not download the best one which is obviously this-or so I thought. As soon as I downloaded the app it asked for my location, kind of sketchy right? I clicked do not allow but it got my location anyway. 😳 right after that it gave me a set of instructions to follow and if I don’t then Alvin Simon and Theodore will break into my house at 3 AM, so I had no choice but to follow the instructions!!🦧🐒🐸 The instructions told me to watch the Cats movie🙀, eat Caillou farts, and to summon a demon.👹👺When I finished following the instructions, text appeared on the screen and told me to go into my bathroom and look in the toilet. To my surprise it was full of frogs!!!🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸0/10 would NOT recommend!!!

My name is Kim.☺️ I downloaded this app to create my own views on politics but BEWARE ❌😱if you download this app you have to be very careful⚠️. When I download mine a virus got into my phone. I threw my phone bc I was so angry but when I did my room turned orange 🍊 and so did all my friends. At 4:20 we all had to yell Jumanji so we could turn into normal people. When we did we came back to normal life... well almost normal. We were in JAIL!!!😱Turns out we also time traveled to 2022. Trump in prison all activists at the BLM protest. 🤬We all had to wear orange jumpsuits that said “Trump Makes America Great Again❤️🇺🇸” Turns out we were just in the next level. We had to break everyone free and make another protest. Anyway I’m back now and I urge you not to get this app and not vote for trump 2020 ❌if u do ig we all just gonna end up in cage if we say or do the wrong thing 🤷🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"ISAIDSTOPPPPPPPPPPPP","date":"2020-07-08T23:49:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174152961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤮🤢","review":"I hate that crusty busty ugly musty cheeto that we call a “president” I hope he gets out of office because he is ugly and stupid and fat and I don’t know why he’s in office when there are literal receipts of the bad things he had done.

After doing this I tried to download the app again and was successful, however it took almost three days to do so.\n\nI went to open the application and immediately my phone started to glitch out and the app crashed for some reason. I restarted my phone and tried again but nothing changed. However! Because I want to keep updated with my President and the AMAZING things he’s doing to help America, I decided to delete the app and reinstall.\n\nAfter another three days the application finished installing and I opened it. 15 seconds into opening the app my phone crashed and wouldn’t turn back on. I had to take my phone in to get it fixed, there are many bugs in this app and I do NOT recommend downloading it.","userName":"Joselyn Clark","date":"2020-07-08T21:35:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173743137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Made my allergies worse","review":"I wanted to download the app to support our wonderful🍊🍑 face president! As I went to download the app my eyes started to hurt but dint think anything of it bc I have really bad allergies. When I got the app downloaded I took a allergy pill to make my allergies go away. When I put my phone number in to receive notifications, it told me to take 6 allergy pills and to put some bleach into my eyes. So, I went to go take the pills 💊 didn’t do the bleach bc then I would die💀☠️!! That day was the worse day ever I told the TrumpAdministration what had happen and they told me that Trump would come to my house to hopefully help the problem. He came and said some very disgusting and dirty things to me. He told me he secretly had corona 🤧😷 then I fell out. Today my allergies have not gotten better. Still taking 6 pills a day. This is why u give this app a 1 star review!!🤢🤮😷☠️💊🍊🍑🤡🤪","userName":"🍑🍊💊🤡","date":"2020-07-08T21:12:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173717283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Not worth the download.","review":"So I downloaded this app because I wanted to be as educated as our president. 😍 As soon as I downloaded the app, a creepy face popped up and gave my dog a heart attack. He died on the spot and was sucked into the app and then the app showed our lovely president to which he said in his lovely voice, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.” And then tentacles come into my house and start harrasing my pet unicorn. Do you know how traumatic that was?! Anyway, my mom walked in and screamed. The tentacles called for backup and then ants started coming. The ants tickled my tongue and made me eat dirt even though our president said he wouldn’t hurt me. The dirt was lowkey delicious idk. 😳 Anyway, then the tentacles and ants made a wormhole and now all I see is thick Trump with Denise maxi version on repeat!!  Please do NOT download this app! I will be talking to the manager about this insane treatment and I expect a full refund plus therapy.","userName":"Ada2.0","date":"2020-07-08T21:02:30Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173639848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"This app took forever to download at least 6 hours. While launching app it kept glitching to shrek but orange while playing irritating music that summoned many hot Cheeto girls. The hot Cheeto girls then put spicy Cheeto dust into my hamster’s eyes and into my cats ears. While causing chaos the started yelling vote for the Cheeto man. This app is so destructive to households. We had to put pickle juice into my hamsters eye using a syringe. The Cheeto dust to my cat’s ears caused deafness. Now Potter will never be able to hear the sound of him breaking pots off of tables. That’s not even half of it. After the hot Cheeto girls the Karen’s heard all of the noise and were also summoned. Karen 1 decided to yell at my hamster for his eyes being red. Then Karen 2 proceeded to grab Potter and tried to give him a bath. Karen 2 complained about getting scratched a bit and attempted to sue my bathtub. In conclusion this app is very unprofessional and should be taken down immediately.","userName":"your_local_bean","date":"2020-07-08T20:34:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173561512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"so confused???
