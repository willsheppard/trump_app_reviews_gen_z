I was reading through some reviews and someone was hating on others reviews saying they aren’t mature and don’t know anything about the election and shouldn’t be leaving a review. Another one said that we shouldn’t be over here because we have our own platforms to speak our mind and this is theirs. And that this platform is for those who want to be informed about our president and what he does. That he has morals and we shouldn’t be hating on him. \n\nYet that platform that we have (tik tok if you didn’t know) is being threatened to be taken down because we are speaking our mind. Yet you think you should be able to keep yours and do the same? Because our president has ‘morals’. You want to keep up with all of the decisions he makes and everything he plans to do. One of which is taking down our platform which you say we have to speak our minds. Yet many get shadow banned and it could be taken down recently. And I’m sure everyone is aware of it. Y’all hate that we actually inform each other with what’s going on in the election. That we teach each other things about our president and the decisions he has made that isn’t put out on the news. That we are able to speak our minds and, for those with a higher following, use their page to speak their minds and fight for justice. You hate that many people will post black lives matter and pull out facts that prove everything that you have said to knock down our protest, is wrong. So if we can no longer teach each other and inform each other about what is going on in our country, and fight for what we have pledged to the flag since we were 4!!! I don’t see why you should have the right to do the same.  \nThank you.","userName":"Holajvzth","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172885406","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:25:46Z","title":"Failure","review":"You are a small little failure and we hope you get hit by a train, with love of course.
