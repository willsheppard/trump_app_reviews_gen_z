Because of this i went into a coma and had to go to the hospital. I finally woke up from the coma 7.8 million days later. I screeched because the hospital was not aesthetically pleasing AT ALL. I ran into a forest in Transylvania. I met and giant, disoriented, evil dolphin. In a demonic voice it threatened me saying “I am the dolphin princess. My name is Sofia the First. Download the trump app or I will slap you into the earth’s crust.” I obeyed but, it ate me. After it ate me it started yelling “Trump 2020”.  I almost through up because of the dolphin saying that. Even though it was a trumpet it could stand the taste of the musty cheeto on my phone. It regurgitate me and told me to run. I waddled first dear life. While I waddled off a giant dino nugget came out of a castle made out of t-shirts that fell out of the sky. The dino nugget ate the dolphin because the dino nugget was Gen Z. I waddled to New Zealand where an baby ant named Ricardo punched me to Australia. I was greeted by a gray polar bear seating on the toilet singing “We Just Got a Letter” from Blue’s Clues. He folded me up, put me in an envelope, and mailed me to my mother. While the polar bear was shipping me off he was singing ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃᵗⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃʸⁱᵗˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵐʸⁱᵖᵒᵈˢˢᵗᵘᶜᵏᵒⁿʳᵉᵖˡᵃʸ. When my mother opened the envelope instead of it being me it was the oompa loompa popped out. My mom screamed and had a stroke. While that was happening my llama friend whacked the oompa loompa with a baseball bat. I am currently writing in the envelope. I am very disappointed that i couldn’t help my llama friend beat the life out of that cheeto puff. I am writing this bad review because a baby ant named Ricardo punched me and my stomach still hurts and because the polar bear is very bad at mailing letters. Anyway have a nice day🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🥺💖🌼💕\n\nPs: the way the dino nugget say hi don’t mean say hi back🦖🦖🦖"}},{"id":"6178693018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mimiesnfk","date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"so bad","review":"this is the worst app ever he’s so annoying and he’s not ok he’s a bad man i hate this man"}},{"id":"6178661352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Senpai696969","date":"2020-07-09T23:47:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ew","review":"Black lives matter bruh"}},{"id":"6178639446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"eriiiBig","date":"2020-07-09T23:39:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"Remember if GenZ goes down...we’re taking dump trump with us;)"}},{"id":"6178632770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JaxsonBrown","date":"2020-07-09T23:36:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Get this taken down #CancelTrump2020","review":"GET THIS TO A 1 STAR, NOW! 😁"}},{"id":"6178620058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dru'shonn","date":"2020-07-09T23:31:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting","review":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6178614899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rainnunez80","date":"2020-07-09T23:29:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"not good at all 💕","review":"r-r-r-roll ⚽️ up 🤍to 🥰the 🤪party 👌🏻in ✨my 🧚🏻\u200D♀️crazy🥺 pink❄️ wig🧿 but 🍄o cant🪐 get 🛸through 😩the 💧door 🚪 because💀 my 🍑booty🌿 too ✌🏻 big🌞"}},{"id":"6178601966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dhushdhdndkdksknd","date":"2020-07-09T23:24:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","review":"Very bad"}},{"id":"6178545927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ǝǝʎ ǝǝʎ","date":"2020-07-09T23:02:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"terrible","review":"disappointed disgusting terrible slow lagging virus 👎🤢"}}]}
