This app was initially amazing, I could see what Doni boy was doing to help aid us and his campaign, but then the glitches started. My phone would randomly close out the app I was using and open the Trump app. Now at first I just thought this was some sort of virus that got on my phone and was glitching out but after a little while I couldn’t even exit out of the Trump app anymore. That was when the threats began. My notification screen kept showing updates from the Trump app about how it knew where I was and telling me to stop trying to close the app or things would get serious. Then the threats got more real. A computer voice would emit from my phone exclaiming how it was going to kill me and all of my family. I thought it couldn’t do anything it’s just a phone app but then I notice four small stickers start to grow out of my phone, two on the bottom and two on the sides. In a matter of seconds the sticks burst out into two arms and two legs. It jumped up on it’s feet and ran to my children’s play room. Before I knew it the phone had all 200 of my children in its hands and was out the door. All that was left behind was a note that said “Respect the app Karen”. I don’t blame daddy Donald for this because I know he would never do something like this, but I cannot accept the fate of my children that this app has heartlessly distributed to them.","date":"2020-06-11T23:37:02Z"}}]}
