It was a normal Wednesday afternoon  I was sitting in my bed and I had just download the app after I downloaded it I decided i wasn’t gonna support his app and his follows. Why does he even have followers who is he Jesus, any back to the story .

They weren’t not 6 feet apart and they didn’t have on masks. I said hecky to the no. I ran my slightly chubby self to my house. BUT THEY CAME AFTER ME.

Let me tell you why. First thing I did when I opened the app my dog started to violently throw up all over my kitchen floor. It was the most horrific thing that I ever did see. Second after I cleaned up the mess I decided to look at the app again. After I did that it began asking me to pay for the campaign donation so AS A PROUD TRUMP  SUPPORTER I decided to chip it $5. After I did that I looked to see how much money it took, just to be shore and it took out $500 dollars from my account. The third thing that happened was after I tried to reach my bank to tell them I was SCAMMED they said they couldn’t do anything about it. So not only did this app make my dog violently vomit on my kitchen floor it also took $500 for me. IF YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER LIKE ME DONT BE FOOLED. THIS APP IS NOT FOR YOU. chile anyways BLM ACAB!","title":"🇺🇸+🤡+🍊+🧑🏼\u200D🦯+👺=the president"}},{"id":"6175641230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:01:29Z","userName":"heiwnegeiwkbr","rating":1,"review":"my ✨ racist ✨family actually recommended this app to me. i love my family and trusted them so i downloaded it so i could understand what the rave was about 👁👄👁. this app not only took hours upon HÓÜRŠ to download but it also would crash every time i went on it. i then got calls from the trump number and someone told me they were coming to my house💕🐸💕🐸! as the paranoid person i was i locked all the doors and windows except for one window. i went to use the bathroom and then that’s when i heard all the yee yee trump supporters in my neighborhood climb through the window. as i was taking my evening dump i heard my hamster 🐹 singing nicki minaj 👨🏻\u200D🦲 lyrics ( it’s our secret language in which we communicate when we’re in danger. i started singing as well but all of the trump supporters sang cardi b to silence me!!!! the trump supporters then threw my hamster down the gutter as he sang the exact words “ i got that super bass” . i’m very devastated and i want everyone to know not to download this app!!!","title":"this app killed my hamster"}},{"id":"6175626413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:56:03Z","userName":"Dolly Janess","rating":1,"review":"I did not have problems with this app downloading but the app itself did give me a few problems. There were too many adds on it and the app sometimes glitches and logged me off😢. When I tried to take a survey the app would answer my stuff for me and let’s just say I don’t like it when apps don’t actually work. A kid also hacked my account and tried to blackmail me into selling toe-picks online. I don’t know about you but I do know that I like my toes covered and modest. I hope this app can pull itself together and remove the nudes of old men off. I also sometimes worry about the stalkers this app attracts because been followed by this guy named Peet. Peet likes to leave dead animals like a whole platypus  or deer 🦌 and maybe even jack rabbits 🐇 on my porch and he may have mailed me an outrageous amount of packing peanuts with a single actual peanut 🥜 inside. I just don’t like the bad luck I have gotten after downloading the app so a 1 out of 5 stars ⭐️ sounds nice to me.","title":"Problems with the app"}},{"id":"6175591683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:43:29Z","userName":"ga.perez33","rating":1,"review":"as soon as i downloaded the app it slowed down my phone by a lot. it took the app several hours to download and the problems started as soon as i opened it. i went to open the app and was terrified to see an orange pop up. i thought it was donald trump but i think he’s still hiding in the bunker. so i started to think that maybe the orange wasn’t so bad. but then the orange started talking and saying that he’s actually KANYE WEST!!! i know, you’re probably terrified at this point but don’t worry because you’re thinking that this can’t get much worse, right?? WRONG. once i finished talking with the orange it started to jump out of my screen and attacked me. i had to file a restraining order against it and long story short, i got a virus on my phone. the virus automatically sends pictures of a peeled orange in my camera roll. so creepy. i totally don’t recommend downloading this app unless you want pictures of peeled oranges and probably other underage fruits in your phone. 😟😟","title":"DONT RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THE ORANGE ✨"}},{"id":"6175054653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:24:53Z","userName":"Rayrayjabbar","rating":1,"review":"My unicorn went to Washington and trump showed it terrible hospitality. I think it’s becuase my unicorn is a girl and dark skinned. The two things trump can not handle. He’s just a fat ogre who turned my poor rainbow dark skinned unicorn back to the land of Fae. All becuase he’s a racist hypocrite who can not be a decent human and who’s let several millions of people down. He’s a liar who lied his way into presidency by saying he would make us equal. But within his time: Mexicans have been banned, black have once again becomes a false face of terror, Asians have now become a “disease” white have become too privileged for their own pride, which is now too high. Women are now looked at as though they are “pigs”, by trumps own words. And he has funded money to Israel for ammunition and more supplies to harm a dying country full of children. And he has spread hate against the Muslim community making them “terrorists”. Trump, you are a fraud. You are nothing. You do not deserve to have the responsibility of millions of lives.","title":"The truth( read all"}},{"id":"6174686229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:50Z","userName":"Mrs. Jo D","rating":1,"review":"Will this app give you the most up to date, factual info about the election? No. Is this app easy to use without interruption of your other apps? Also no. After downloading this app I have begun to suspect this is actually produced by a less honest campaign and is trying to feed fake news to the republican voters! \nBe the BEST! Know the MOST! This is a poorly designed lie. \nAlso, I noticed a huge difference in the ads that showed up on my phone! Whereas before I was happily able to peruse the latest offerings of my local grocery and kitchen supply store to see what would best serve my husband and children after downloading this app I began to see ads for colleges and local therapists pop up on my feed. Now we all know that is just a bunch of unnecessary secular malarkey and I am more than happy where I belong. \nThank goodness I figured this out before my sons and daughters saw anything amiss. Stay safe folks. Stay woke. Don’t buy this horrible propaganda app that glitches all day. \nGOD BLESS!!!","title":"Not what it appears!"}},{"id":"6174277987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:19Z","userName":"🍓jamm","rating":1,"review":"It didn’t work at all once using it. The app has so many glitches and in general is a crap app. I hate that the app is also based on a crap person who doesn’t support lives unless those life’s are white and have money to give him. The app is so unappealing. This app is so irrelevant. Like who needs an app about a person who is complete crap. The app doesn’t do anything but say racist things. They say make America great again. But he means white. The land he claims are for Americans, is actually the land of the natives the government pushed into small pieces land. America doesn’t belong to the people he says it does. It belongs to the natives that were forced off land. They were forced away from their homes so the white settlers can rebel against Europe. America was never white, or ours. America belongs to the natives that were here first and rooted their history and ancestry in the ground. Their roots are what we call American soil. We can’t claim what isn’t ours. This app and who they are trying to promote is crap.","title":"Don’t get this nasty app"}},{"id":"6174203349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:03:27Z","userName":"Barry B. Benson💋","rating":1,"review":"No. Horrible app. I was so excited to open the app to support our beloved Cheeto ❤️ but was shocked at the thing that was on my screen once I entered the app. I am scarred for the rest of my life and so is my dog🐕. We will both be attending therapy from now on. When I entered the app I was shocked to see an image of the big Cheeto man (it was an unpleasant photo of him spray tanning that should not exist). I threw my phone so hard because of the fear the photo gave me. It’s broken now so thanks to Cheeto man I had to purchase a new phone. I am not happy 😡. I think since my phone broke something escaped from the app because after I threw it, it started raining oranges and Cheetos outside my window (I think it’s to symbolize the orange blob in the White House 🏡). When it stopped raining I turned around to find Cheeto man standing on my bed. I have never been more terrified in my life 😱. I grabbed my phone and it all stopped. No more Cheeto man and no more raining oranges and Cheetos. In conclusion after this fiasco I don’t recommend this app❤️.","title":"Disgrace👁👄👁"}}]}
