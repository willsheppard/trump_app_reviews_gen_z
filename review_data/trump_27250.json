It constantly crashes and when it doesn’t it displays very horrific images of the Hot Cheetos tiger🤢 I do not recommend this app for the faint of heart.

I wanted to show my support for ✨orange fatty patty✨ but instead the app started hacking my phone and saving trumps n*des on my gallery. -9/10 would not recommend they are hideous🤢 at first I thought it was an orange jalapeño but then I got a message from the app saying “are you lost baby gurl” 😭😭😔👎🏻","date":"2020-07-09T21:37:16Z","title":"No bueno","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178308104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"SlugbugGall","review":"I got this all thinking that it would be free of the Deep State, but I was wrong. This app is a LIBERAL CONSPIRACY to collect our information. After taking an hour to download it asked for my email and wanted me to create an account. The government is using this app to collect PRIVATE INFORMATION from good Americans.

There were no apps like this one for any other president, so why should we allow the old, crusty Cheeto to have one? This app literally benefits Donald Dump, so automatically it should be removed from the App Store.","date":"2020-07-09T21:11:05Z","title":"It’s a no from me","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178254229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"BrooklynPW","review":"This app is horrible.
