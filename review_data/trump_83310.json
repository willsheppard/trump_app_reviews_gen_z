But as soon as I waited a month for the app to finally finish downloading and I got to open it, I was greeted by a horrible, ugly, idiotic Cheeto puff. This simple image caused me to cry my eyes out and it will surely haunt my nightmares for years to come.  The first thing it asked for was my phone number which was weird cause I thought Trump was married??? But I gave it to him anyway and as soon as I did I heard these voices in my head almost like I was being brainwashed... it was saying things like “all lives matter” and “white power!” I was shocked. I suddenly felt the need to start yelling racial slurs and start degrading women (which is weird because i am one). A couple hours later when I came home from work I found my parents were missing along with a note that said “vote Trump 2020 and you’ll get them back. xoxo, Pence.”  I cant believe my app would do such a horrible thing. I called the police but when they came to my house they said they couldn’t help me because they had better things to do such as kill black people and get away with it.  The only thing I could do in that moment was open the app and maybe find a way to reverse all this.  I was shocked and disgusted to see president trump’s NUDES pop up as well as a nonsense song in the background that said “real women vote for trump! We don’t need no liberal chumps...” I finally managed to delete the app but there’s no reversing the mental damage it has put onto me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.\n\nLove, Gen Z\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆"}}]}
