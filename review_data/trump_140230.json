When I downloaded this app it literally made me have diarrhea the entire time i had it. Every time I got a notification from the app I would jump in the the camp rock signature dance... I probably did it 40 thousands times. This deserves 0 stars. I hate it so much I have had this app for at least 2 years and when you do have it , it starts to transform your body to be built like donal trump. And lady’s you guys know how we cut off our penis every month yes well my penis looks exactly like Donald trumps and it’s indestructible. I haven’t had my period in over a year ....... please delete this app I hate it. Generation Z for life.","title":"TERRIBLE!!!

He has long been a subject in music. His surrogates explain away his videotaped boasting about sexual assault by comparing it to music. And despite artists’ objections, his rallies continue to use music. But Trump has also been a somewhat strange subject to protest with music. How do you raise consciousness about a subject that’s already depressingly overexposed? What noise can be louder than this noisiest of narcissists?\n\nTrump embodies a media environment that complacently merges entertainment and news, where the mere mention of his name has a Midas-meets-Idiocracy-like power to transmogrify celebrity gossip into politics, and back again. So a fair amount of the musical response to his rise has had more to do with wrestling-style anglesthan, y’know, music. Everyone from R.E.M. to Adele to Neil Young to the Rolling Stones has complained about Trump appropriating their tunes. Tyler, the Creator and the White Stripeshave sold Trump-bashing merch. Countless big names across every genre have dissed him onstage, from Nicki Minaj to Kesha to Roger Waters to the Dixie Chicks. Wavves went so far as to ban Trump supporters from his shows. Anderson. Paak and 2 Chainz each baited him in their music videos. Carly Simon tweaked “You’re So Vain” against him for a pro-Hillary ad. The Roots even mocked him moments before Jimmy Fallon tousled whatever it is that Trump calls hair.","title":"Seriously ruined my phone— I think it has a bug or something that downloads a virus","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179526522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:59:59Z","rating":1,"userName":"eat my ass trump90","review":"I’m going home now I’m home now and I’m home I got home I just send it home and send you a text I just got to the bank I got a text I just got my car and send you the phone number and send you a phone text me send you the text and I can get my car to you later and send it back and I have a car I have to send it back and I can get my number to go to the car I have a phone text I just got it and send you a phone number I just got a phone text and I can get it to send it back to send it and I send you the text and I have a text I can get my car to go get my phone text I can get my car to go to my phone and I have a car I have a couple of days to send it to my phone text and send you the phone text and send you a phone number I just got a phone number I can get my car phone text I can get it to you the phone number is it just got it to me I can get my car to go to my car and I can send it back and send it to send it and I send you the phone number and I can get my car to go get it and I can get my phone back on it back and I can get my car to send you a phone text I just got home I can get my car back on the car I have a couple of my phone text I just send you the phone number I can get my car to send it to you send me a phone text I just got home I can get my car to go to my phone and I can get it back on the car I have to get my phone number I just send you the phone number I just got a text I got to get it to you the phone text I just got home and send you a phone number I just got it to you the phone text you text and I can get mymy I have to my phone number I just got home and send it back and send you a phone number I just got home I got to get it to send you a phone number and send you a phone number I just got home I got to go to the car text you got to send you the phone number I.","title":"Go","isEdited":false}}]}
