I downloaded this app because I need some motivation to help cure me from being a dirty, unwanted, and useless Mexican, but INSTEAD, I was welcomed by this fugly Cheeto ass looking self, that I am so proud to call my president 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 then after I played around with the app (which I forgot to mention took 2 WHOLE DAYS TO DOWNLOAD), I suddenly got super sick and I went to throw up. After I threw up, I went to look at my phone again, and I felt SO SICK AGAIN, and then I realized looking at this nasty man’s face, IT ACTUALLY MADE ME SICK. Eventually my phone just actually threw itself against the wall, and then attacked me, and beat up so bad. I had to go to the emergency room, and while I was there, I realized my SKIN WAS TURNING ORANGE, MY LIPS WERE ALL SCRUNCHED UP, MY HAIR BEGAN TO FALL OUT AND I WAS LEFT WITH LIKE 4 STRANDS OF BUTTER COLORED HAIR, AND I HAD A TURKEY CHIN. THIS APP GAVE ME A TRUMP VIRUS AND ITS RUINED MY LIFE FOREVER. DO NOT GET IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE THE UGLIEST PERSON TO EVER EXIST. \n\nKeep America Great 2020 🇺🇸✨🇺🇸✨🇺🇸✨","userName":"some useless mexican girl","title":"Waste of my LIFE"}},{"id":"6178407463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:07:52Z","review":"Hello, my name is Karen. I would like to just say that when u opened this app the first thing that saw was, \"Trump just put jelly beans in his toes and feels excited 😏\".

This is disgusting.Delete this app before i delete my existence. You have no idea how much i want to chug bleach right now. Im not going to because i will out live this orange wrinkly tea bag.

not go down without a fight. F trump😒 worst app ever. LET ME TELL U MY STORY, I downloaded this app as a joke because someone told me I could find my dad with this thing. Approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes later after downloading it, I heard a knock on the door, and when I opened it, there it was, a beautiful white silky phat milk carton. I didn’t know what to do and I was highly embarrassed because I was dressed horribly and the milk carton had to be the sexiest thing I ever saw in my life. I did the Debby Ryan and slammed the door because I got shy teehee. I thought of just walking away, but then I remembered, this can be my soulmate. I opened the door again and there it was, Staring at me with those intimidating eyes🥵 we started talking and we immediately kicked it off. We fell in love and I just couldn’t control myself. 7 years later, We planned a beautiful wedding and has three sexy kids. Then one morning.... my far away aunt who had no idea about my love life, broke into my house and waited till I woke up from my nap so she can SURPRISE me with a birthday present. When I woke up.... she told me she got a little thirsty.... AND SHE DRANK MY MILK, SHE DRANK IT ALL AND LEFT NOT ONE DROP, I fell into a horrible sad devastation and that’s when my aunt whisper into my ear...” it was that app, the trump app.” ANYWAYS THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE!
