Trump needs to work on being a greater president instead of being a fat knuckle head cheetoë. Such as doing good for our minorities. My grandmother had this app and ended up being put in the hospital for how poorly done it was. She almost collapsed of sadness when she found out a bunch of white supremacists TOOK OVER. THEY LITERALLY WERE SO BRUTAL😢. This app is NOT GOOD!!! And apple had the audacity to keep this up here.. I'm so ashamed. Apple, you need to remove this app now. Or things are going to get WORSE!! Hopefully Gma recovers safely.. from this treacherous app and trumps hideous obnoxiously orange and obese body.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:34:49Z"}},{"id":"6177824395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mary A. Williams","rating":1,"title":"awful app","review":"cool time machine! awful presidential app. when i opened the app i was immediately taken to the 1910s as i had no right to my own body and white, straight, Christian men were in control of everyone else’s voice. i was hoping to be educated on this election’s republican candidate but i was instead greeted with “#repealthe19th”. also, looking at the news i see countless deaths of blacks with no justice! then i realize that this is just the news today and that the app isn’t a time machine, it’s just Annoying Orange wanting to oppress minorities the way they were in the 1900s. no justice, no peace. \n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\n\nyou take down our app? we take down yours. good luck Bunker Boy.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:47:59Z"}},{"id":"6177806973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"color switch player","rating":1,"title":"Don’t download, even as a joke","review":"Literally makes my phone go from 100% to around 30% in just a few minutes. Not only this but it also made my phone overheat! I do not experience this with any other app. I also saw a red line at the top that said “recording” while using the app for just a split second. I think this app listens to you and that’s why it takes up so much battery. I think this app is made by the globalist elite trying to identify Trump supporters because he is such a threat to the democrats. When things go down, they want to know who won’t be on their side. I love Trump but I’m not risking my safety or privacy for him! Find other ways to support our president!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:53Z"}},{"id":"6177757055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"CRobinson2045","rating":1,"title":"Do not download!!!!","review":"I downloaded this app to stay up to date with the current election. I just wanted to be informed. This app flooded my phone with notifications even after I tried to turn them off several times. It would also randomly play the nation anthem at full volume through my phone which was super creepy. When I would try to read things on it for more than 5 minutes it would crash and completely shut my phone down. I also received emails asking if I was blonde? This must be a fake app because my president would never put out something like this! I’d consider redownloading if they fix it or release a new version but for now: MO THANKS!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:27:51Z"}},{"id":"6177674218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Judy Judy Bo Booty 👁👄👁🔥🍑","rating":1,"title":"Judy Judy Bo Booty 👁👄👁🔥🍑","review":"Where do I even begin with this app every time I open it this crusty Troompa Loompa is staring at me like ew app would be way better if he wasn’t the poster child. Second he is very ugly and has no lips he’ll never get a kiss kiss now very ugly why did we vote such an ugly man into presidency like we go from Obama who was smoking to whatever that thing is. Third this is my payback if you get rid of TikTok the only thing that kept me sane during the pandemic which the man this app is for continues to blame China when he’s the one who didn’t close the boarders fast enough like 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️ so screw this app my dude hope it goes down faster than your name in history as the worst president my dude #momowithagun2020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:02:41Z"}},{"id":"6177560315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Karen Songbird","rating":1,"title":"Utterly Disgusting","review":"I opened the app but o be greeted by The Annoying Orange cartoon. He kept blinking oddly. Then I was in a ski shoot and was shot out into a pile of gravy! The gravy wassss so sticky! Like glue! I forced myself out and then was flown into a bowl of cereal. Except the cereal was human remains! I didn’t know what to do so I ate myself out until I got to the top 🥣🥣. Where then I was flung into Toe Land! 🦶it was so scary, I was the size of a pebble looking at feet that were close up! I was traumatized. Absolutely traumatized! 😖. Then I almost got stepped on! Terrible experience. At one point I HAD TO climb on a foot 🤢😵. And I was kicked into a dinner with annoying orange. At that point it got so bad that I just- *drifts away in raft* thanks for coming to my TEDtalk. App is horrible! 🙄","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:26:04Z"}},{"id":"6177505983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😹😻😾😿😽","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"it was just no good. awful. I cannot explain how awful it was but you must trust that it is just not a good application whatsoever. So i am leaving a 1 star rating so that this app receives a 1 star rating. The reason for which I am leaving a 1 star rating is that it simply does not meet the standard of a 2 star rating, much less a 3 star rating, or a 4 star rating, or a 5 star rating. It is just not what it needs, or deserves or what america needs or deserves. I did nothing wrong it was simply the application that did not meet my standards or anyone’s of whom I have spoken to who have used this application. That is all i very much believe what it is that I have written which is this 1 star rating.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:09:04Z"}},{"id":"6177445536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ornage cat","rating":1,"title":"This app turned my cat orange 😿","review":"When I download this app there were problems. I was sitting in my living room with my family. Opening it, I felt a dark, dark presence and my phone felt like it was ice, then it felt red hot. I dropped it in surprise, and there was a big boom, and suddenly my sister was gone. Our family cat then starting hissing and turned orange, with a bit of yellow fur on top of its head. With closer examination, we found a note on our cat saying that we had to vote for trump in November in order to get my sister back. I quickly uninstalled the app and my sister mysteriously reappeared. I highly discourage anyone to download this app. It is dangerous to your health and my cat is still a sickly orange color.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:50:57Z"}},{"id":"6177436514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kikiwaka luv 😍","rating":1,"title":"no❤️","review":"when i first got the app i was excited to see what cheeto man could deliver. i was SHOCKED to see a wild ēmu flying around his head as soon as i opened the app. but that wasn’t the worst of it. there were little peanut butter crackers running around a subway surfer track into cheeto man’s belly button. i quickly clicked past that to see what would happen and then found myself in a tellatubby cult. the worst part was, they were singing 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣. i started crying and ran for my life only to bump into a care bear facility. the leader was in fact melania trump and she just kept yelling “hello”. then i got whisked away by a can of beans that was in the shower shaving. didn’t enjoy this app luv❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:48:11Z"}},{"id":"6177351287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lindsey730","rating":1,"title":"tiktikkkk","review":"so i order my food over 2 weeks ago from chick-fil-a on this app.  and it still hasn’t arrived.  i don’t know how exactly trump expects to win this upcoming election when he’s literally withholding chick-fil-a from people. to me it’s absolutely and completely disrespectful and i don’t like it.  anywayssss after waiting 2 long weeks. my chick-fil-a finally arrived and it waS half eaten with flies all over it. Trump i know you get bored in the whitehouse sometimes but to go off and eat somebody else’s chick-fil-a is so disrespectful and the lowest form or rudeness. i’m sorry but the most i can do for this app is give it 1 star.    i’m so done. i thought i could trust you Trump but yknow what.  it’s whatever.  i’m done.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:23:08Z"}}]}
