I know, I too was shocked. This app took an entire 87 hours, 64 minutes, and 102 seconds to download. Very very disappointed to say the absolute least. I would not recommend downloading if you lack patience as I do.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-10T02:07:58Z","userName":"Ann Chovee"}},{"id":"6178986922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Well to start off the app took way too long start up then crashed my phone within 3 seconds of opening it so I had to restart my phone entirely.

All I wanted to do was support my president:( I couldn’t for 30 days!! Overall the app is terrible, and a bad way to represent our humble and level headed president. It’s structure is just un-usable, and I hated every second I spent on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.

I thought him being amazing was non-existent so. Ofc there weren’t any memes on them at all such a disappointment.

Not only does the app have bugs, the layout is not desirable for what it’s intended use is marketed as. I Installed it to receive presidential updates, but unbiased news outlets are more reliable.

This made me delete the app bc I don’t trust you with my “personal” information that you could track (like you said about China).
