But this app? This app makes me depressed and angry and wanting to die. No one can hold it against me. Rather than fixing the atrocity that it is, I would rather you just leave me there and let me be sad.

This app is awful, poor quality. Not to mention made by one of the worst people on the planet.

I would not recommend this app unless you want all pets, humans, creatures,organisms to drop dead of a orange disgustingly mess. Also the app isn’t diverse. 🤓🏃🏾\u200D♀️🏃🏾\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174782505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hgxdghb","date":"2020-07-09T03:02:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I hate this","review":"When I first downloaded this the only thing that showed up was a white screen.
