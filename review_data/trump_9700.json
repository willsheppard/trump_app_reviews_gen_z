It also took up sooo much storage. I wanted to support and learn about the big orange guy! It also made my phone lag and glitch very much. I do not recommend this app. Also, when I downloaded it the police showed up to arrest me when I undownloaded it. They made me download and sit there for 5 hours!!!! CAUTION IF YOU USE THIS APP YOU WILL GET VERY ORANGE AND BE STUCK IN A LARGE PEACH WITH THE PRESIDENT!!!!!! Luckily I was able to delete before it spread. But now I’m perfectly fine and safe."}},{"id":"6175612802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:06Z","title":"This app hacked my phone! Don’t download 😬","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jUsT a FaN 👌","review":"I download this app and then suddenly as soon as I opened it I saw the screen of my phone start blinking off and on. I tried to stop it and it only got worse. After a little while of fighting with it, I fixed it. I opened the app again and then my phone malfunctioned! I had to bring my phone in to Apple Tech Support for them to look at it and fix it. I wish I could give this app zero stars"}},{"id":"6175595950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:45:01Z","title":"THIS APP COMPLETELY RUINED MY LIFE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lil Skizurz","review":"Immediately after this app downloaded (It took days to download by the way) I went to check my phone and everything on my phone was wiped clean and my wallpaper had suddenly changed to a confederate flag that read “heritage not hate” which made me uneasy as a Muslim and a person of color, after this all took place I had decided to go to the mosque where I was greeted by president trump himself standing with a group of klansmen and I was almost lynched"}},{"id":"6175459557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:52:44Z","title":"WORST APP ON THE APP STORE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🌷🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥰👄","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to learn more about donald trump’s politics. It didn’t download for 6 days!!! 😳 Once I was FINALLY able to get in my phone was wiped of EVERYTHING. All of my pictures and personal data GONE. The app then proceeded to give my phone a virus. I had to sell my kidney on the dark web in order to buy another phone. The app began sending messages to my new phone (that I hadn’t downloaded it on) calling me fat and ugly. The app also killed my dog. Worst app ever."}},{"id":"6175364872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:15:50Z","title":"HORRIBLE GET IF U WANT ACNE 🤢🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"3512771234","review":"After DAYS of waiting for the app to download the app crashed my phone.

When I finally managed to get my phone back on, EVERYTHING was wiped clean. My pictures, contacts, EVERYTHING! All that was on my phone was this app. My wallpaper and lock screen had a inappropriate picture of Donald trump. So doing what any reasonable person would do, I threw my phone in a bowl of acid. I was TERRIFIED. After spending $1000 on a new phone, I’m here trying to warn my fellow Americans. Be safe & don’t download this."}},{"id":"6175253255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:32:52Z","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE 😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Raine_Makenna","review":"I got This app to track what’s going on with the election of our fantastic, definitely nit racist president, but as soon as I downloaded it I started getting glitches. My phone was fine before this. The app is useless. Don’t get it. Also, I started getting random visions of the man himself making boxed Mac n cheese. He turns around and asks if I want some, but then he sees that my dog is black and gets angry. I think he got into my brain. Anyways, app is a no no   \n\n👀👀\n\nManny2020"}},{"id":"6175104112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:40:32Z","title":"if i can give it 0 stars...i would","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"fat_girl_DUH","review":"the absolute WORST app i’ve ever downloaded. it had sooo many bugs and wouldn’t even let me open the app! but once it did let me open it, it glitched and was not letting me do anything. also a peach kept showing up on the app...wait...sorry misconception that was donald..\n\neither way....this app needs to be deleted...i don’t think anyone can fix this mess...just like how trump won’t be able to “fix” america 😊"}},{"id":"6175074232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:30:59Z","title":"A southern woman’s thoughts","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"heyyallitsanna","review":"As a conservative southern woman, I am so disappointed and disgusted by this app. I used to be a MAGA supporter but after being on this app for exactly 27 minutes I immediately went and changed my voter registration to democrat. Yes, that’s right bunker boy turned me liberal. This app promotes killing (spreading COVID-19) amongst so much for hate crimes in this beautiful country. Such a shame that so many still use and support this app. I wish I could leave 0 starts because this is just that pathetic!!"}},{"id":"6175071944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:30:16Z","title":"👎🏻","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jules eliz","review":"I am repulsed! I, am American loving patriot, downloaded this app to support MY candidate (Donald J Trump 🥰💘), but I was met with something truly disturbing.  This disgusting app requires my phone number! Now I am a true whole hearted republican, it would be against my better judgment to give my phone number out to to government!  For what?  So they can track me?  I don’t think so.  This truly violates my right to freedom and privacy.  Our FREEDOMS are being taken away here people.  Open your eyes!! Disgusting."}}]}
