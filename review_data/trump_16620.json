After I downloaded it my phone shut off and then it over heated. Once I finally was able to use the app it said that only people over the age of 30 can sign up.

Kids, teens, and adults that have TikTok have the freedom to post appropriate videos, and make others days. In my opinion and many others, our life without TikTok would be ruined and i know that sounds pathetic and stupid but it’s true. Please don’t ban TikTok across the US. Thank you.","userName":"#ItsYourGirlEmmy","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:35Z","title":"Donald Trump Administration","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173082614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Your app is straight trash🧚🏽\u200D♀️ it’s not even just your app💕💕it’s you too!

All I saw was a blurry orange face when I opened the app. Also, why is there an app that supports a sexist, racist, and homophobic president? He’s done nothing to make ‘America great again,’ all he’s done is made it worst. If you give this app five stars or you support Trump, remember that you too, like Trump, is racist, homophobic, and a sexist! This app also gave me a ton of viruses.","userName":"beanybay","date":"2020-07-08T17:13:24Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173033727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I hate the app it takes forever to download and here I was trying to find a way to like him but all he dose is make it worse he is not good and the app is not good I am sorry but he will not be getting mine or my family’s vote this year just like last year the app over all dose not help him as a president it makes him look worse but ya I got off topic sorry but bad app sorry","userName":"Lexie159121","date":"2020-07-08T17:11:36Z","title":"Hate it so much","isEdited":false}}]}
