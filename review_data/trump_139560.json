After 69 minutes of trying to fix it the app kept deleting itself 420 times. It stopped lagging after 666 minutes. I went in the app and it said vote Obama and wouldn’t accept my email. It asked me to give out my private info. I resented the app again and it got me locked out of my phone for 6 hours and 9 minutes. When I finally got on my phone was filled with pictures of memes about trump. This app broke my phone so I had to save 420.69 to get a new one. It is a sloppy app do not download it. It also kept saying stuff about saving tik tok this app is bad. Get it off the App Store are people can not get this issue.","date":"2020-07-10T05:23:35Z","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6179596516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yeehaw yyeee","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Okay so first of all everyone rating this app 5 stars is LYINGGGG.!!!😬 this app is nothing but a scam(.) i was looking for a mobile way to get oranges sent to my dear sweet grandmother and i came across this app🧚\u200D♀️✨🙈.

I started downloading this app on Tuesday, June 2nd and it literally JUST finished today, July 9th. That’s ridiculous. For the several weeks I was waiting, I took my pet rock for several walks and hand trimmed my grass with my fingernail clippers, I came periodically to check on the app progress and it still wasn’t done. I then proceeded to bring the weekly food down to the basement for my grandma and watered my rug. It finally finished and I decided that Donald Trump is just too good of a person to even be in the presence of an app, therefore giving the one-star rating.","date":"2020-07-10T05:23:23Z","title":"Ugh omg"}},{"id":"6179596060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cass1dy_17338","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app has no lips!

This app is fundamentally flawed. The app is also very slow when using with WiFi and the sliding options are so disgusting. Not to mention the aesthetic of the lay out is so visually appalling, gross to every degree.
