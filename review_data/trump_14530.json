When I was finally able to open the app it attempted to attack me by shooting a sparkly knife out of my phone. Luckily it was pointing towards one of the dolphins instead. I was during the developers but my lawyer turned into emily from SM6 Band and did the Debby ryan face.

I’m extremely disappointed in our president and his tech team. Why can’t a humble girl just download an app to support her president that she previously adored? Is that so much to ask? I’m completely heartbroken. I don’t think I will ever view president Trump the same again. Thank you for ruining my life with this poopy trash.","date":"2020-07-09T13:31:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"poopy ‼️‼️‼️","rating":1,"userName":"Ivankas Clone"}},{"id":"6176702153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was just trying to check the news but I can’t because this app gets in the way and is just another reminder that our government system is broken and this country is falling apart if we can’t even stand together. As soon as I downloaded it, my whole phone blacked out?!?!?!?! I paid for this phone myself as a colored woman in the US. Now I need to go buy a new phone.

Destroyed my storage space and occupied all the CPU. When it would open, there would be illegal acts displayed in the app. Extremely vile content. Nasty. Truly not a god fearing app. IT WOULD THEN ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR MONEY AND PASSWORDS. A total scam. Insane amount of illicit activity. Afterwards the app would constantly crash until I had to factory reset my phone. Do NOT GET UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE TO BUY A NEW PHONE.","date":"2020-07-09T12:26:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Destroyed my phone","rating":1,"userName":"Flanemaster26"}}]}
