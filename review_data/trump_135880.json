What actually happened was after I installed the app, my 69 children all started running out of our apartment, all yelling,”Help! Help! There’s a deranged alcoholic trying to keep us in a basement!” Or something along the lines of that. I believe this is the orange boy’s fault that I’m in solitary confinement. Thanks a lot, Cheeto boy.      -XxJonnyOPMinionxX5853258963\n\nPS: They took my poop sock. :(","title":"Was expecting better","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T20:05:20Z","userName":"Veryhandsomboat","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6060199110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I am under the age of 18, I thought downloading this app was fine considering I would “LoVe” to help keep the US under control by a giant Cheeto puff uwu. So, with my lack of brain cells, I quickly downloaded this this “WoNdErFuL” app. A few hours after I posted my latest tweet about racism and taking away women’s and LGBTQ+ rights, I got a knock on my door. I rushed to the door hoping it to the TRUMP 2020 shotgun I ordered off of the ANTIFA terrorist website because if they were against the ugly Cheeto puff, then I would shoot them with the their own weapons. I got the door, and to my “DeLiGhT” the lying Cheeto puff himself, Donald Trump was there. I was so excited to speak with him on killing all people that didn’t support him with American designed shotguns. But instead, he was only in his mighty trousers. He held up the Trump 2020 app with a location dot right where I was. Darn libtards must've rigged the app to let people see  my location. Without saying another word, he pinned me down against my American flag printed wall and he had this little croissant looking tumor coming out of his trousers. It was about 1/2 an inch. I thought at first it was a croissant he bought for me in exchange for selling my brain cells to join the Trump army. But no, he took that tumor thing and raped me with it, and then gave me a Trump 2020 anti african american hat and said if I ever told anyone, he would get his police force to put their knee on my neck for 9 minutes until I was dead. Despite all of this, I am still going too (not) vote for Trump 2020","title":"This app made Donald Trump rape me","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T19:50:52Z","userName":"lmaooooooooooooooooo","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6060081582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was checking what you can do then a breaking News came out and said Anonymous has been exposed for raping and then I was mad because if there’s an app for one of the worst presidents then make an app for one of the best presidents from the last decade Barack Obama.","title":"This is the worst app F*** Trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T19:10:17Z","userName":"Aaron🇺🇸🇺🇸","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6059536934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"✨🌈🍒god never makes mistakes🍒🌈✨ except when he made this app ✨🌲✨🌲 this app sends a message 🧚🏼✨🧚🏼 never send it again ✨this app should take a nap🥰🧚🏼 and never wake up ✨❤️ dori said just keep swimming ✨🧚🏼 in this case drown ✨❤️🍄🍒🌈🍑🦋","title":"✨🧚🏼 i give this zero stars🧚🏼✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T16:10:19Z","userName":"fairyluver","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6058414972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and it immediately called my dog a piss baby 😡 after that it yanked my cats tail and tied it to the ceiling fan!!!! it turned the fan on and laughed!!! 😡😡 my cat now has a permanently sprained tail and my dog is currently crying!!

Also it shows video evidence of police brutality. It also talked about how you can still be donating and signing petitions to help the cause. And it linked to this thing blacklivesmatters.carrd.co which has a lot of really good information so you can stay informed about the blm movement and easily find petitions and other ways to support. \nOverall it is a really bad app.","title":"BLM","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T06:40:56Z","userName":"Billybobgorgefred","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6057662517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is FAKE NEWS and actually created by the Clintons.

But I don’t like the app because it has trrrible user interface it’s a no from me luv period.","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T06:24:30Z","userName":"LonelyMunchies","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6057527365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is unsafe and unwanted! It uses your camera, microphone, and location without asking! Whoever is behind this app (Donald J. Trump, maybe?) should be behind bars because of what they did to me. Put me through absolute HELL! I had just put my son, FuqXII, to sleep and I was in my room lubing up my body for the full latex suit I slept in. My phone charges on an upright stand, so....my camera has full view of the room. Suddenly I started getting a bunch of notifications from the app, even though I turned the notifications off....alarmed, I went over and opened the app. What I saw....will haunt me forever.....45th President Donald J. Trump in a full-body latex suit. I was horrified as I knew they could see me. Turns out they could hear me too! As a city girl, I often get catcalled on the streets, and the app had been listening the entire time! Then the app began playing audio. Trump’s creepy voice repeated “I see you, mami” over and over again. I started to cry. But those tears were exactly what the latex needed to get up over my ass; I pulled on the rest of my suit, assaulted by Trump’s voice the entire time. I tried closing the app, but my phone was completely unresponsive. That’s when another notification popped up. This was a suggestion for a Republican-owned latex store in the area. That was the last straw. I punted my phone out the window. This app cost me my phone and my sanity. To this day I still have nightmares about Trump in a full-body latex suit. I’ve never worn latex since.","title":"😬Like An Episode of Black Mirror🙅🏻\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T05:40:35Z","userName":"⭐️lize","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6057440562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’d rather do pretty much anything else besides ever having to look at this app again, MAGA my ass 🙄","title":"Oh no","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T05:06:13Z","userName":"Gland he skajfb","isEdited":false}}]}
