When i opened the app there were a lot of Donald trumps nude pictures and I was traumatized. I cried every night because it was scary. Anyways that one thing that happened another thing is that viruses keep popping up and it damaged my phone so I had to get a new one. Last but not least, this app is the worst so don’t download it.","title":"Im traumatized"}},{"id":"6173407780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:14:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Leiladanielle","review":"The app was super glitchy and it was not working my phone would shut down every time I tried to use it. When you opened it, it would freeze up and I would have to restart my phone and also my family that used the app will also say that the app wasn’t so good if I could give a 0 star I would don’t get this it’s a waste of time and energy and not worth it","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6173396075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:10:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"#settleforbuden","review":"this app is the WORST app i’ve EVER used!! first things first it asks the most personal questions when you have to sign up for it. then when you try to use it it keeps crashing and kicking you out. it threatens to sell my information and there is really no point to it because you can’t even use it. honestly it is a danger to its users and i feel unsafe that i had it on my phone.","title":"TERRIBLE APP!!"}},{"id":"6173380351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kiki180🤡","review":"The people who actually support Donald trump and think that by him being president he is helping our country but in fact he is just bringing us down. I am only 13 but I have an opinion as most of you and he is not helping anyone but himself. All he talks about is how HE did something and never WE. This app is going to give someone disease. So all of you Karen’s that support him just shut your big mouths and use your 👀. STUPIDS!!!🤡🤡","title":"🤢🤮🍊"}},{"id":"6173364022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Imnotracistbut","review":"I downloaded this app to support our WoNdErFuL president. It took 5 days to download and as soon as I opened it, it crashed😑.  When I finally got it to work, it opened on a black screen. Which SURELY disgusted me bc MY president🍊should be against all things black. Not bc he’s racist but bc Trump2020🇺🇸.  Then it showed me a naked picture of Trump. I WAS APPALLED.  I DID NOT WANT TO SEE HIS CENTIMETER PETER.🤢🤢. It then showed me Mexicans crossing the border and him golfing. He obviously isn’t doing his job. But still Trump2020🇺🇸.","title":"Noodles 🍝"}},{"id":"6173329152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:46:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Your local commrad","review":"I tried to use the app and then my cellphone started glitching and I wouldn’t let me out of the app until my phone died! And then when I charged my phone the app was closed but a little red light was at the top of my phone and it didn’t go away for like an hour which was so scary! Keep in mind this has never happened as I have the newest phone. -10/10 do not recommend at all","title":"This app is so bad !"}},{"id":"6173306978","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:39:39Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bittersweetTea","review":"I tried to download it but when it said it was done downloading I clicked on the app and all I saw was this scary orange man. So of course I clicked out of the app as fast as possible. But after a couple days of the app being on my phone my phone started to shut down. COCKROACHES STARTED CRAWLING OUT OF MY PHONE. I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENS. Anyways don’t get this app it is terrible, it glitches a lot, and no one wants to get jump scared by an orange man😣. Please be careful","title":"This app is terrible"}},{"id":"6173301500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"crusty queen","review":"This app glitched and broke my phone to such a bad point, i literally had to bring it to the apple store!!! none of my apps would open, all my phone would do was show me pop ups talking about trump along with a bunch of other american propaganda, and it wouldn’t stop playing the annoying national anthem over and over again. It also stole all of my info. 1 star, do not download this malware.","title":"don’t buy this app."}},{"id":"6173301087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen lolndenberg","review":"It was glitching and i couldn’t even use it. I am a 50 year old women just trying to support my president 🍊, and i couldn’t even use it? how horrible .
