I downloaded this app because I figured why not and right after it finished downloading I went on it to see what kind of content I could possibly find. Right away, I realized something was extremely wrong!! The app began flashing black and white and a noise from my phone began chanting the phrase “trump is the most handsome president in history” repeatedly. I knew that had to be a code for something because even as a constituent, I think he’s one of the ugliest people I’ve ever seen. Nevertheless, after chanting the phrase three times in an ominous tone, the app summoned a holograph of Trump himself. After being completely shook by what had just happened, I said hi to his holograph, which then proceeded to physically hop into my car and run over my entire family. Long story short, I do NOT recommend this app, unless you want Trump’s holograph to kill your family.","title":"This App Killed My Family"}},{"id":"6175070647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:29:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trump smell like shrimp","review":"Worst guy ever he stole my oranges color he poop on my McDonald’s floor and he stole that blond wig with this bold head sank like fish","title":"Hate him"}},{"id":"6175070064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:29:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Me!!!!!!!!! :)","review":"Honestly if I could give this app a negative star rating, I would. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone. Literal scam of an app for anyone that would believe this crap. Trump plans to ruin America and not protect anyone but the top 1% in 2020.  Don’t forget to vote my dudes!! Remember if you don’t like either candidate, you have to vote for the best out of the two or else that’s another vote for trump.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME?!\" Well you see, I've been farming potatoes in skyblock. That wasn't a joke. It all started months ago: I'd just gotten a set of superior armor and wanted hot potato books to upgrade it. I could've just bought some from the auction like a normal person, but if Hypixel has taught me anything, it's that if you have a problem, the answer is slavery. So I had twenty potato minions with twenty enchanted lava buckets, twenty super compactors, twenty diamond spreadings (cuz i-it's just free money [to] get this upgrade) and with this setup, I was making about two hundred forty-two thousand potatoes per day. At this point I had enough potatoes for my armor. I could have stopped. I could've put an end to this. But I thought: no. No, what if I went even FURTHER. You can check your ranking in each individual collection and I was already top fifty in potatoes. I decided at that moment that I was gonna be the number one potato farmer in skyblock. How hard could it be? First, I needed to get more minion slots. Now, I already spent a lot of time getting to TWENTY minion slots, because I believe minions are important—I mean they work twenty-four seven gathering resources, even if you never bother to log-in—and as such represent the only way to achieve the dream that all skyblock players share, which is to not have to play anymore. Unfortunately, each minion spot requires exponentially more resources than the last. So I did what any self-respecting skyblock player would do and sat in the shop buying ice for thirty minutes. I'm having fun! I dropped out of college for this! After spending many hours, and fifteen million coins, I finally unlocked... the twenty-second minion spot. At this rate I thought I had first place in the bag— I mean there's only a couple of solo players that have twenty three minion slots, and I figured if anyone went to THAT much trouble to get more minion slots, they'd probably spend it on a minion that actually MAKES money, like clay minions. But I thought to myself, \"Y'know what, I'm gonna go even more overkill, alright? I'm gonna upgrade my level seven potato minions to level nine.\" Now you might be thinking to yourself, \"OH TECHNOBLADE ISN'T OBVIOUS? ISN'T IT JUST MORE POTATOES? WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT IMMEDIATELY?\" No. No, it's not, alright? Upgrading past level seven on minions never makes sense. You're never getting that money back because upgrading costs over a hundred thousand potatoes just to get to potato nine. That'll take over TWO MONTHS to get that money back, over EIGHT MONTHS for level eleven. It's just a bad idea. \"OH BUT TECHNOBLADE ISN'T THAT JUST A LONG TERM INVESTMENT?\" No. No, it's not. Remember cactus farms? Remember how they were great for like, FIVE DAYS, and then the admins obliterated them in an update? Yeah, you really think your dreams are gonna go that long without being crushed by the admins? No- no, you're never seeing that money again. I'm sorry, it's gone. But I wasn't farming potatoes for profit, I was farming them for HONOR, for GLORY. So I started upgrading them to level nine. My last hidden weapon was the farming crystal which increases the speed of farming minions by ten percent. I can only fit twelve minions in that radius, but I thought, \"Y'know what? Whatever. I'll just make a SECOND farming crystal!\" \"Here we go!— Oh okay.\" No- no, I'm glad skyblock tells you that after you make a second crystal— I mean i-it's not like you could tell me that after I make the FIRST CRYSTAL. Whatever, it's not a total waste of money. At least I can auction— Thank you, Hypixel.\n\nMore of this on twitter @technolovebot they did the whole script and everything about them is probably better than this app\n\n*definitely better than this app","title":"Potatoes"}},{"id":"6175067290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:28:50Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ebby lougua","review":"so i downloaded this app and well i went to the store 😹and when i came back my house was on fire👁👄👁 i went in and my phone exploded and my pet dino was gone😾 then i looked outside their was my cat playing with my flying fish my cat ate it and then i got a new phone and it keeper saying trump 2020😡 and i got mad and yelled at it and then tears were coming out of my phone and it ruined it and also my phone got a virus and it exploded 103838447 times and each time it was a different color🏳️\u200D🌈.n e ways sometimes 😿i don’t want to be happy😹 don’t want it against me👊🏻 if i’m down🔽 just let me be sad.😿 👁👄👁💅🏻😹😾😿❤️😠😌😔🏳️\u200D🌈🥀💀😹😽😾🙀😻😺😼😿😸gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec also trump needs to pay up cause my dinosaur was really old and this app made me loose it and i don’t think a lot of people have some dinosaurs but if they do i bet they want to keep em n e ways JOE BIDEN IS BETTER TAHN THAT ORANGE ORANGUTAN 🦧","title":"WORST APP OUT THERE"}}]}
