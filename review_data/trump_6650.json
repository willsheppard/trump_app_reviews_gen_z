It took up all my storage space, and worst of all its such bad quality. I thought I would have been worth it but no the app glitches so I can only go on it for 10 seconds before it kicks me out. Not to even mention why is the app orange when I open it like I know the Trump orange and all but why?? If I could I would give this app 0 stars because it is so hard to use and navigate thru. Anyways I think you guys should take this off the App Store it is so unnecessary. Thank you.","userName":"yd7_11","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173713175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:01:03Z","title":"I dislike this app🙅🏽🧢","review":"So I decided I would vote for trumpet and I got the app my mom found out and she then proceeds to slap the stuffing out of me??

As soon as I opened the app, my entire room got unbearably hot and a fire shot up from the floor. A large piece of my floor fell through and the devil himself rose up and told me to delete the app. I was told if I didn’t, he’d drag me down there to spend all eternity with him. I closed the app and Lucifer disappeared along with the fire. I can’t even support my president without the devil threatening to bring me to the depths of hell! I’m so disappointed in this app and this is truly an outrage! I’m deleting the app NOW. Terrible!","userName":"InCaseABumTryToTouchMeEW!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173595521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:18:46Z","title":"worst app EVER😡","review":"This is the worst app ever. Don’t download it. As soon as the app was downloaded on my phone my entire family died of corona and my house burned down. Reading the information on the app has now made me clinically depressed and I have lost so many brain cells that I will have to get brain surgery. After only 5 hours of the app being installed, my entire bank account was drained. Then I was mugged while looking at the app on my phone and the mugger proceeded to amputate my left leg so now I can’t walk properly. This app ruined my life I don’t recommend.","userName":"akb989","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173590179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:53Z","title":"ALMOST DIED!!!(not clickbait!!)😨😨","review":"as i was sleeping 💤 🛌 i was visited ✈️ by our Lord orange 🍊😱😱 he told me to download this app 📱🤯 and so as i woke🤗 from my peaceful ☮️ slumber 😴 i downloaded it😁🤟.

When I signed in to support the campaign, this horrible music played and summoned an army of fire ants in my neighborhood. The ant army proceeded to march into my house even after I did everything to try and stop them. The red army took my dog and carried her out the door to sacrifice her to their orange ramen haired leader as my family and I watched in utter despair and horror. I do not recommend this app especially if you have a small child, cat and or dog.","userName":"A troubled party","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
