It broke my foot! Hate it! -10000/10. My house almost caught fire. Awful!! It also called me fat, washed my flipper, owes me money, made me provide excellent service, made me experience high tide, poisoned my town’s water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses!

Do not download!","isEdited":false,"title":"Despicable"}},{"id":"6172554529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:51:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"JoeJud","review":"There are too many flaws in this app. When I first downloaded it it took none of the less of 72 hours to download. When it finally loaded, I was disgusted at what I saw. The app automatically changed my home screen to the White supremacist group we all now. I immediately tried to delete it but it wouldn’t go back. My only other option was to throw my phone in the lake before it burst in the flames and drag me to the pits of hell. Unfortunately I was too late.As I tried to throw my phone into the lake It didn’t leave, it stayed in my hand. Then it slowly and painfully drag me into the pits of hell where I met the devil himself who ,you guessed it, is Donald Trump in the form of a fat orange(not that he already isn’t one). In hell I was forced to wear a Trump 2020 shirt, Make America Great Again hat, and wave his trump 2020 flag to everyone I saw. It was my worst fear. I was gravely embarrassed. When the fat orange decided that I could go back home, he left me with a curse that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. My family is forced to wear MAGA hats and shirts for the rest of there lives and we have to say “make America great again” at least 50 times a day. \n\nOverall the app is low key cursed.","isEdited":false,"title":"cursed app"}},{"id":"6172553538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:51:08Z","rating":1,"userName":"morgan da potato","review":"👁👄👁I’m disappointed on how this app is soooo ✨dumb✨ it is from Mr.orange man🍊🍊and looks like a✨carrot✨🥕🥕🥕🥕🥕🥕 I hope this app gets out of mE sWaMp🙃🙃🙃and ✨out of the AppStore✨ for a racist president that puts people through misery 👁👄👁 and me take me entertainment🙃 this is just the ✨beginning✨                         teehee.","isEdited":false,"title":"tHe mOsT sLoW aPp iVe SeEn"}},{"id":"6172552321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:50:47Z","rating":1,"userName":"Alex Peanut Butter","review":"I wanted to stay informed on this rapis- oh oops I meant on our dictators views and stuff, but this app took literally 5 HOURS to download.
