Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT. BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second! He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth.

I wish I could give it 0 stars. The second I downloaded it all of my apps crashed and my phone immediately died. When my phone turned back on it was playing “be happy” at full volume and I couldn’t turn it off. The song wasn’t playing from iTunes or Spotify, but it was coming directly from the app. I couldn’t open the app to turn it off and I couldn’t close out of it. This is an absolute scam and a promotional ploy for the song. After a while it gets kind of catchy, but DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It doesn’t belong on the App Store at all.","date":"2020-07-10T02:30:00Z","title":"Gave my phone a virus!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"roser246"}},{"id":"6179093327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"hey everyone! Please read my review because there are a couple issues with this app that I would like to discuss! FIRST OFF, as soon as I downloaded this app to my phone (as a birthday present to myself, because if you know me , you know how much I loooove politics 💕🧚🏻🥰🎉) I received a 45 picture airdrop request. IT WAS GRAPHIC PICTURES OF DONALD TRUMP, NAKED. I will never unsee what I have seen today, and this app is to blame. I declined , but then my phone started vibrating and it took me to a website called trumpsnudes.com and oh my god my eyes. IN THE CORNER OF THE WEBSITE IT SAID PAYED FOR MY DONALD TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIN APP!!! IM SO DISGUSTED AT THE VIOLATION OF MY PRIVACY . THIS APP DESERVES TO BURN IN HELL.","date":"2020-07-10T02:29:33Z","title":"IF 0 STARS WAS AN OPTION, I WOULD ******* DO IT","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"MaiaSMILE"}},{"id":"6179093225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app thinking it would taste like mint but it tasted like cat poop.
