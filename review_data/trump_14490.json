I saw that this app was actively calling democrats “socialists” other stereotypes and I didn’t agree with that. Also it had a system of rewarding supporters based on their activity within the app which I saw as childish and immature. Do not use this app if you wish to maintain you’re freedom and rights as an American.","rating":1,"title":"Big no no"}},{"id":"6177961095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:31:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ahspeters26","review":"well i got the app and i kid you not after a day of having it my boredom and disgust built up so much from this app i was physically sick, call it✨vomiting✨. I would definitely not recommend this app to anyone who has common sense or just to anyone in general, it made my fingers tired just thinking about pressing on the app, anyway i’d rather eat 10 mole rats at the same time than use this app🥰.","rating":1,"title":"trash"}},{"id":"6177903334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:12:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🍊✨🍊tumpyNOT2020","review":"IMMEDIATELY after opening this app I saw a horrible image of a buttered corn 🌽 on the cob ( oh sorry I mean our president✨🤩🧚\u200D♂️) anyways that image is drilled into my mind .

I got the app and started to register for it, putting in phone number, name, birthday etc. but right when I was registered I got a weird email.
