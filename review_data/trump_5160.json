He has done so much for POC, second only to Lincoln. I got this app because I was excited to get news straight from the Trump team and not other fake news media outlets such as CNN. Unfortunately the app took hours to download. When I opened the app it downloaded several viruses into my phone, slowing down the device tenfold. Additionally , once the app finally started to work, it was pretty much the same as the Trump 2020 website, which I frequent. Unfortunately this terrible experience might just make me switch my vote to Kanye.","isEdited":false,"userName":"NithyaC829","title":"Unfortunately, horrible","date":"2020-07-09T14:28:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176923587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If 0 stars was an option, I would rate this stupid app 0 stars! absolutely horrible. horrendous. disheartening. as soon as I opened the app I was greeted with a nazi symbol and it asked me my race. when I said I’m bald black I was told to go back to africa. WOW. I am extremely disappointed in this app. absolutely disgraceful. “make america great again”? no, make america HATE again. but to mention the app barely functions. after downloading this app my phone started acting up. showing ads for trump flags, nazi stickers , etc. absolutely extremely disappointed to say the absolute least. disgusting","isEdited":false,"userName":"m stewie","title":"disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T14:24:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176897849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m honestly here to support our great president but I am a simple person. And this app was downright confusing. I didn’t understand what it was trying to show me and on top of all that it kept sending me annoying push notifications even though I said no. Honestly I wish I could rate it even lower than one star. Just overall bad app. If you want to support our absolutely fantastic president then I suggest not getting this app. Honestly this app is a big part in why I’m going to vote for Biden. If this is how trump runs his app then what does that say for how he runs our country?","isEdited":false,"userName":"whatdoyoumeanAIsatakennickname","title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-09T14:17:34Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176858142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hate this app I hate it I hate him he avoided what scientists were saying and caused us to stay at home for months. He keeps kids in cages. He IS RASIST. We weren’t perfect before him but we were definitely better without him. All he cares about is money. Why hasn’t he talked about what happened to Vanessa? Because he doesn’t care. He just wants MONEY!!! This app is just horrible I tried to get in and it kept crashing and ugh just delete this app already!!!! Don’t you dare ban TikTok because we will rise on other platforms either way ITS A LOSE WIN. We win trump loses. This app is disgusting.","isEdited":false,"userName":"we will stand against","title":"Absolutely disgusting 🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176422074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting amazing things of course 🧚\u200D♀️✨🌈💞🧚\u200D♀️ and it wasn’t downloading and it froze my phone completely, once it unfroze (because i stuck my phone in the microwave to reverse the freeze) i was finally allowed to go on the app but a warning ⚠️ sign came up that said “due to the to the lack of culture from this app this phone will self destruct in 10 seconds” and then it made this weird ticking sound so i through it out my window, but once i did that it hit one of my neighbors cats named sprinkles and both my phone and the cat blew up","isEdited":false,"userName":"kyklers","title":"Just like Trump this app is a dump","date":"2020-07-09T12:10:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175749744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hey🥰 I did 🥳a couple😜 things 🤢I did and then👿 I’ll text him 💩when y’all😻 can ☠️hear me 👽from the 😽message✊ I’m 🦾gonna 👋was your✍️ name 💄so I’m just💋 saying 🦷I love you👁👄👁I love 🗣your 💂\u200D♀️voice 👩\u200D🎤and you🧟\u200D♀️ can tell you I 🧚wanna 🧜\u200D♂️hang out 🙆with 💆\u200D♂️y’all I’m going👩\u200D🦼 through 👯\u200D♂️my life 🚶\u200D♂️so much better 👩\u200D🦯and I wanna🏃\u200D♀️ do I love 👬your mother 👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩I wanna hang👩\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧 up I gotta 👨\u200D👨\u200D👧I was 👨\u200D👨\u200D👦\u200D👦like I wanna👩\u200D👦 was the🧶 day I wanna 🐭was the 🐶one that🐯 you 🦁got to 🐹do it and 🦆then it 🦋was like I wanna 🕷do y’all🦑 want 🐋me ☘️to hang out 🐚with 🌝me then🔥 I’m ⛄️you☂️ can 🍒just tor 🍑rotoscoped🍆 the🧄 day and 🎾then 🎱it 🪁is.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jj💋💋💋","title":"Innoproprate content","date":"2020-07-09T08:38:45Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175721735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the tik tok app because my lovely children brad and chad told me about it.. i had seen the reviews for this app but did not believe them because i thought it was all another joke from tik tok. but turns out they are real.😳✨❤️ brad and chad are very strong conservatives and we thrive on putting poc down, so i thought i would download the app to see if it could help us to find more ways to make people uncomfortable, but instead my phone started glowing a rainbow flag (for the gays) and started playing “shawtys like a melody in my head”. i was very scared but trusted my wonderful president. but i opened the app and it gave me a message saying “vote for melanin king or your grandmother will die” i giggled it off but then found out something terrible. my mother had called me and said the my wonderful grandmother had been hit by a car😔💔😿. please don’t get this app if you love the people that gave you life💔💀","isEdited":false,"userName":"Newsgirl ","title":"killed my g-ma😔💔😿👵🏻👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T08:29:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175708650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took several weeks for this app to download, and when it finally did it hacked all my data and personal information. I am 13 and am very supportive of our misogynistic racist homophobic xenophobic transphobic islamophobic president! It asked for my number and I put it in not knowing why it was asking, then soon received a text from out rapist president asking if I wanted to go out with him. First of all, I’m 13, second of all, he’s married maz then he said if I didn’t he would sell all my information on the dark web and lock me in his basement. So 10/10 wouldn’t recommend this app ❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"Da Macho Taco","title":"DISGUSTING","date":"2020-07-09T08:24:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175704242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took three whole days to download.
