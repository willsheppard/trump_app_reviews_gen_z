First of all it takes forever to download. I just wanted to support our horrible HORRIBLE president like all of his other blind supporters. Then it installed a virus on my phone that shows trumps ugly face on my phone whenever I try to open any apps. I could barely get it to work in order to write this review but I had to let the world know. Also this app sent THE MAFIA after me. I’ve been living in fear ever since I downloaded it. I can’t even leave my house without them trying to come for me. This app is not safe and will send people after you. It’s almost as bad as our president and the rest on his administration.","date":"2020-07-09T14:02:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"0@&$);dvgshgudfla"}},{"id":"6176827232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"my pet rat could do better 🐀","rating":1,"review":"I was really on the fence between Trump and Biden and was leaning toward Trump because I, too am a massive bigot! So I downloaded this app in hopes of supporting the cause🥰however I quickly noticed many flaws in the software and it began tracking me and sending me explicit notifications. It blackmailed me and told me that if I didn’t endure seeing such grotesque images of the president, Mitch McConnell would kill my family. For days I endured this torture and lived in fear. When I finally tried to delete the app, it malfunctioned and my device burst into flames. I do not recommend! This experience has haunted me and I will no longer be supporting the Cheeto man💅","date":"2020-07-09T13:59:03Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Unsettled Mother"}},{"id":"6176487905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Immediately crashed my phone","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and not long after my entire phone crashed. I mean I’m missing photos, some of my other apps got deleted, some of my contacts are missing. I’ve been emailing people instead of calling/texting because of this issue. It only took 10 minutes to go haywire after downloading. After I got my phone started back up, every time I opened the app the whole thing crashed AGAIN. Finally got sick and tired of it and deleted it, I haven’t had any problems since. Thanks for this garbage app, now I have to jump through loops to get back everything I lost.","date":"2020-07-09T12:28:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"auralightsss"}},{"id":"6176061911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is horrible!","rating":1,"review":"I only downloaded this app so I could keep up with our president.... 72 hours is how long it took to download it! When it FINALLY downloaded it kept glitching So I got off the app...I tried to on it the next day but to my surprise I got HACKED AND I HAD TO GET A NEW PHONE!! This is a useless and worthless app. If anyone is thinking about downloading this app DONT. All trump talks about on the app is useless crap and stuff we already know. For god’s sake HE TOLD THE POLICE TO RUN OVER PROTESTERS! I know the protesters are a problem right now but maybe if cops weren’t being racist and such jerks WE WOULDNT BE PROTESTING. If I could I’d give this app a 0 star review I would. This app was very disappointing.","date":"2020-07-09T10:22:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"scarlet😕"}},{"id":"6175765226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP OF ALL TIME","rating":1,"review":"honestly this app is so dumb. it’s actually the dumbest of the dumb. if this app went to high school it wouldn’t even graduate !!! and i just want to say to the person who made this app possible to support the big fat ugly Cheeto... their IQ is also very very low. i’m so sorry for you. anyways this app is useless and unworthy to be in the beloved apple store. it is ONCE again useless and absolutely DISGUSTING 🤢. I’m am in fact from generation z so i know that my existence already pisses off that ugly cheeto man. He was to remove tik tok because he is insecure and DUMB ! ugh he’s is so ANNOYINGZz. but what do i know... i’m  just a woman that shouldn’t open her mouth and have no rights right ?! 🧚\u200D♀️✨🤭","date":"2020-07-09T08:44:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"just_facts 💅"}},{"id":"6175741067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"seriously...","rating":1,"review":"first of all i downloaded this app to try to support but the first thing that pops up is that i need to enter my phone number... how about some privacy ? i will NOT be letting my kids download this either. Also, i made an account anyways with my husbands (vomit) phone number and the graphic were really bad. honestly there’s not much to do on this app and i will be getting rid of it. there’s also too many notifications ! talk about spam , it almost made me crash my mini van with my kids in it while i was listening to madonna. my family used to love trump but after this we are reconsidering... please fix it","date":"2020-07-09T08:35:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheryl stickim"}},{"id":"6175672248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL, DEGRADING, INSULTING😡","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and the CEO started saying racist, xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and bigoted things!!! ALSO, it crashed constantly, I THINK IT GAVE MY IPHONE 7 A VIRUS!!!! BEWARE! SAD! CROOKED APP! It asked for my personal information like my NAME,,, THATS an infringement on my constitutional rights and privacy! APPS are trying to STEAL OUR DATA! the few times it actually worked it was constantly sending me notifications supporting ANTI-LGBTQ rhetoric and other close minded, disgusting ideas.

Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Just absolutely the worst- you know I know people, very intelligent people, in the app developing industry, and they say, and let me tell you they are very intelligent people, they say, they tell me this app is just not great. It’s just awful. Probably has something to do with CHIIIYNA. And they ask me, and I tell them this app is the worst. The worst in the country.

As soon as i downloaded it, it asked me a bunch of personal information and then maybe a week later, i got a text from a number who i recognized as the trumpies who made this app saying that they had “detected a virus on my device” and needed to scan my ipad to see all the private stuff i have on there. turns out my ipad got HACKED by these STUPID TRUMP SUPPORTERS and now i can’t facetime, text, or even search stuff on google anymore, but i somehow managed to write this review. probably because these self absorbed trumpies want it all to be about THEM.\n\nsincerely,\na VERY unsatisfied customer","date":"2020-07-09T07:53:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ILOVEMYSELFMORETHANYOU"}},{"id":"6175567259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"trash terrible","rating":1,"review":"this app is the worst app i have ever downloaded in my entire existence. it should be taken off the app store immediately !!! terrible awful. after just five seconds of downloading it i had to go get a new prescription of glasses bc it burned my eyes, my grandma fell over a table  and my parents got a divorce and my dog ran away. 0/5 stars😡😡 anyways ꪮꫝ 💞ꪶꪮꪜꫀꪶꪗ🌲 ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ 👁ꪮꫝ👹 ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ👑 ꪑꪗ 😌 ꪶꪮꪜꫀ  have🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄 \nMÿ🧠bräin😱ispoisonèd🤮and I’mmséârching forthe🍷ântidotêbutevêrytíme Ifindit👀mydefēnsësscream🙅\u200D♀️ohnóyòu👆don’twhoâh😳but it’sfinënorèällyimfinē🤚\nwhy❓don't⌛we🔪just👽relax😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅radio📻 would👿you😼like💕EMMMM👹or🤪 FMMMM👺\nlõÄf 🥖 lõäF 🥖 love ❤️my 😡 lõäf 🥖 lõäf 🥖 lõäf 🥖 LOVE ❤️MY 😡 LÕÄF 🥖 lõäf 🥖 lõäf 🥖 loove ❤️my 😡 lõäääääf 🥖","date":"2020-07-09T07:34:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"0/5😡"}}]}
