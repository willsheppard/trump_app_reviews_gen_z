Unfortunately Donald, your application has technical flaws that make it impossible to maneuver through. When I signed up, I had to enter my email in six different times! I have crippling arthritis in my fingers, so typing my email out that many times was excruciating. Also, when I finally got into the app to see the president’s beautiful face of pure melanin magic, I was instantly taken to the clorox website. I guess It’s just his genius way of reminding me to take my daily sip o’ bleach 🤩. When I finally got back into the app, everything was pixelated and muddy looking, and then my phone froze. It wouldn’t let me leave the app at all. Suddenly, I saw the volume icon on the side of my screen rising even though I wasn’t changing the volume. When it finally reached max sound, my phone started blasting this song I’ve only ever heard coming from my daughter's room, I guess my daughter had the app too? The song went FOREIGNER 💞✨💫 FOREIGNER🤩🧚💞 FOREIGNER!!! I loved the tune! Please fix the app ASAP so we can get back on track!","date":"2020-07-10T07:06:38Z","userName":"sullyIvey","title":"Poor quality","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179875418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this app and saw this ugly orange corn haired idiot and just don’t waste your time🤡","date":"2020-07-10T07:06:37Z","userName":"hsndkudn","title":"just horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179875336","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It was horrible took forever to download and it was confusing and it was hacked and corrupted this app was terrible he is not suited to be president take the app down no DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT ALL COST it is complicated disturbing","date":"2020-07-10T07:06:35Z","userName":"jules 🤬🥶","title":"The worst app ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179875258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

The app immediately asked for both my phone number and access to my location. This made me extremely uncomfortable but I provided both as there is nothing I wouldn’t do to please president Trump and support his selfless goal of achieving a ✨dictatorial state✨. However, after giving the app my information, I began to receive texts from an unknown number in which a man who would only identify himself as “pssygrbbr69” forcefully requested pictures of my feet covered in cheeto dust, stating the photos were necessary for preservation of dear Donald’s seat in the Oval Office. I deleted the app because I wasn’t comfortable providing these pictures but this man has refused to stop contacting me. I think he’s broken into my house. Sometimes at night I see his lumbering orange form lean over me and hear him whisper “r u lost bby gorl?” I fear for my sanity. I fear for my life. Do not download this app. 💕✨","date":"2020-07-10T07:06:07Z","userName":"PepperCat101","title":"Terrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179873673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried buying a shirt but it somehow knew I was Hispanic and the t-shirt went from saying “Trump 2020” to “ICE 2020.” Is this some kind of joke?
