It started with Snapchat and instagram. Next it was my camera roll. If only I would have taken control of this situation sooner. Now my phone has 350,000 new cases of this appâ€™s misfortune on my phone. Soon all of my apps will contract the virus and I wonâ€™t even be able to use it.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.\" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your app gave me cancer anyway.","title":"Yo girlfriend look like my mom"}},{"id":"6179238202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:22:41Z","userName":"jacaeripriest","rating":1,"review":"Tried downloading and it wouldnâ€™t even finish installing!!!
