While our president was already a joke to begin with, him using a little app to promote himself is the equivalent to a child making a sign for their loom bracelet business. In addition to his already childish decisions, this bastard (also known as our gracious president) has been deciding on whether or not he should delete TikTok- an app that allows individuals to educate people of their environment and express their true selves, mind you- because he can’t deal with a little criticism. Good sir, if you cannot even fathom the idea that not everyone loves you, maybe you should resign :)","userName":"N3N3PAPA","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:02:13Z","title":"✨Let’s kill that orange goblin✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6173177284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app the other day because I’m a huge racist and really want Trump to win this election. But when I got the app my phone screen turned really dark and since I like Trump I’m scared of anything that’s not white. This is a very scary thing for me. My phone also kept glitching and blew up and my cats guts went all over me then I had to take a shower which ruined my 23 month streak of not taking a shower. I was very sad about my cat because I would always love to play with it in the pool😔. Never did I ever think being racist would be such a bad thing. So I’ve decided that I’m not going to be racist anymore because I’m not an idigit.

I went to a new app ✨TikTok✨, and it appended that there was a virus trying to destroy my phone! Later that day I went back on my phone and everything was toned orange. I went to the Apple store and they said there was “Orange Man” virus on my phone, they said that the damage was caused by the app. They weren’t able to fix it. I got a new phone after a month of dealing with a slow, laggy, orange, phone🤮.Before I got it fixed it would it take me to google sometimes and search up ‘Trumpy Bear’ it was so creepy. Never get this app or it will make you have to get a new phone, even after deleting it 😪","userName":"1234567890$$;($)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:55:57Z","title":"A virus 🍊🟠✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6173125486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nCome and be my love, come and be my love baby\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nCome and be my love, come and be my love baby\n멍하니 서서 막 고민고민 해\n나 이거 진짜 잘하는 짓인지\nYeah yeah yeah yeah 뭐 어때\nNo no no no 미쳤어\n난 쯔위라고 해\n무작정 인사할까\n내 전화번호야\n쪽질 주고 도망칠까\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n어떡해 no no no no\n지금이야 girl, you can do it\n눈이 마주치고 있잖아\nLove is timing\n놓치면 후회할지 몰라\nLove is coming, coming\n좀만 더 용길 내\n더는 망설이지 마\n이상하게 생각해도\n어쩔 수 없어 반했으니까\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 놓치기 싫어\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 어떡해\n바보처럼 안 기다려\n내가 말할래 반해버렸다고\n니가 맘에 든다고 하루 종일 보고 싶다고\nWould you be my love\n반해버렸으니까\n표정관리 해 어색하지 않게\n말투는 cool cool\n긴장할 필요 없어\nYeah yeah yeah yeah 정신 바짝 차리고 집중해\nNo no no no 어떡해 똑바로 못 보겠어\n지금이야\nGirl you can do it\n눈이 마주치고 있잖아\nLove is timing\n놓치면 후회할지 몰라\nLove is coming, coming\n좀만 더 용길 내\n더는 망설이지 마\n이상하게 생각해도\n어쩔 수 없어 반했으니까\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 놓치기 싫어\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 어떡해\n바보처럼 안 기다려\n내가 말할래 반해버렸다고\n니가 맘에 든다고 하루 종일 보고 싶다고\nWould you be my love\n반해버렸으니까\n너도 날 원하게 될 거야 날 사랑하게 될 걸\n간절히 바라 너도 나와 같기를 oh yeah\n망설이지 마 먼저 다가가\n사랑을 말해 주저 하지 마\nCome baby, be my, be my, be my love\nCome baby, bae, bae, bae, bae\n이상하게 생각해도\n어쩔 수 없어 반했으니까\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 놓치기 싫어\nYou're my heart shaker, shaker 어떡해\n바보처럼 안 기다려\n내가 말할래 좋아한다고\n니가 맘에 든다고 하루 종일 보고 싶다고\n사랑한다고\n반해버렸다고\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nYou are mine, be mine\nYou are mine, be mine\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 좋아한다고 말할래\n반했으니까","userName":"UxGretel","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:40:53Z","title":"stan twice✨🥰","rating":1}},{"id":"6172886624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The recent events in our nation have showed me that not only is Donald Trump uneducated and not fit for the job as president of the United States but he also has an inability to unite the country in a time of need. Beyond that, his approach to the coronavirus situation was completely unacceptable and his continuous comments on certain matters such as the way he glorifies certain behaviors has made me sick to my stomach. He then had the audacity to go in front of a church and pose for a photo shoot and hold the Bible, it’s like he has absolutely no conscience or respect for himself or the country. These are the main few reasons why I change my mindset and will not ever support Donald Trump or this terrible app that he has created.","userName":"Camcam123456727","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:26:07Z","title":"A change in mindset","rating":1}},{"id":"6172810529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app made my phone glitch extremely bad to the point where i had to buy a new phone.. i also noticed a terrible stench coming from my phone due to this app. this app is so bad and smelly i could go on all day about how horrible it is. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. i honestly think it should be deleted from the app store for peoples safety, it is very dangerous and will break your phone!! (oh i also forgot to mention: this app literally tried to kill me and my family, as soon as i downloaded it there was an explosion in my house and now we are living on the streets) 😥🤬😭thanks to bunker boy i have no home, phone, or money, & i am constantly being followed by the horrible smell of this app🤢","userName":"andré🤪😎🥶😹😻","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:03:37Z","title":"worst app ever💩","rating":1}},{"id":"6172707073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came on this app to find One only one reason why people think Trump is a good president or even a good person. Yet the second I go into it I find a million more reasons why this man is horrible. He should be arrested and anyone who supports him is just. WOW. This is terrible. If you support him you are a racist hypocrite. You say your pro second amendment but god for bit a black teen pic up a water gun right. You say your pro life but don’t care about the kids that are in cages and yet you have to make sure that a teenage girl doesn’t get an abortion even if she doesn’t want to have the child of the man who raped her. This is not making “America Great Again” this is making it Segregated Again.","userName":"Lula bear 22","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:34:02Z","title":"Ignorance is bliss","rating":1}},{"id":"6172681157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about the presidents campaign for the upcoming year. The first thing I saw were multiple articles about Joe Biden! They even had question of the days for him! Isn’t this app supposed to be about Trump? Almost every article when scrolling through the “news” section had something to do with Joe Biden. Who do you think I am? I came to this app to learn about Trump NOT Biden. The next grievance I have is that the app wanted to use my location. Excuse me?!?!? You will not track me! And finally, this app seems more like a game than an actually news source. You earn points to get prizes! No thanks! I will stick to FOX News and the words of OUR president!","userName":"JMN2021","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:26:47Z","title":"Terrible App","rating":1}},{"id":"6172590310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE! Me and my family tried to download this app to educate ourselfs with REAL information but it took about 12 hours to download. Then when it finally downloaded, the app kept glitching and kicking us out the app! For some reason when it was kicking us out the app, it was playing terrible demonic music. Which me and my family are Christians so that’s completely taking our rights away! Also when it finally let us in the app the screen kept on saying, “We hate Christians” “We hate Christians” do we were completely offended and never gunna use the app again. Because of this, WE HATE DONALD TRUMP for allowing this and causing this to happen. Our Votes will now go to Kanye West.","userName":"Ipadgamer4life","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:01:19Z","title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1}},{"id":"6172530215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t understand why anyone would get this app. this app took 1 WHOLE YEAR to download, and that’s the only app i have ever used that took that long. But besides that, Donald Trump said make american great again...so he thinks by “making america great again” is by removing positive apps that make everyone laugh and smile, making sure anyone that protect for BLM gets hurt, wants to BUILD a WALL so mexicans can’t come to america. the world was great before Donald trump became president, also he has done so much more disgusting and disappointing things in this world. anyways App is trash, like what’s so interesting about this app LMAOO.
