But he ended up dying. Smh, this app let my fish die. They said it would be okay to take him on a walk. Honestly this game was a mistake, just like me, but bigger. I wish I could write a longer review, it’s just that by bird is driving my car into a lake. Oh!

I downloaded this app thinking my fellow Americans were right about out president but was completely wrong. After I opened the app I started to get a headache I don’t know what they did but they are tying to brainwash us 🤥✨DISGUSTING✨ if you see this☺️✨🌸🧚💕 leave a one star💕☺️🧚🌸✨ anyways... \n\nGen Z Unite ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","date":"2020-06-29T07:51:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"melizok","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134864264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely awful!!","review":"I was so excited to support the BEST president this country has yet seen, but upon opening the app the image displayed in the background gave me HORRIBLE flashbacks to when I took a trip to Cuba but was taken to Jamaica instead. \n\nIt brought up awful memories of being involved in a Jamaican dog fighting circle that had taken me years to overcome. \n\nEven weeks later after using the app, I’m still having HORRID flashbacks and fever dreams. \n\nMost definitely would not recommend, worst app I have EVER used in the 47 years I’ve been on this wonderful earth. \n\nSave yourself the time a trouble my fellow supporters, take care:\n\n-Linda Evangelista","date":"2020-06-29T07:25:40Z","rating":1,"userName":"Linda4433","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134829066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE DEM PROPAGANDA!!","review":"Don’t get me wrong ... I am a true AMERICAN and I love TRUMP . However .. I am lead to believe this app is disguised as a Trump campaign when ACTUALITY it is a ploy for the SNOWFLAKES and UNAMERICAN DEMOCRATS to hack into my iPhone 6 and download viruses and unwanted applications . Not to mention ... The app sends electronic waves to SHOCK YOUR HANDS and set surrounding fabric on fire , including my BELOVED NEARBY CONFEDERATE FLAG ( passed down from my grandfather ... ) For the love of god , if you are a true American , DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ! Cheers 😃🍻🇱🇷","date":"2020-06-29T07:11:58Z","rating":1,"userName":"Gogosqueeze2002","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134116485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BAD BAD BAD!!!","review":"As a HUGE trump supporter I expected better.

Once I logged into it my phone started glitching and the email i signed up with got hacked. This app sells your information. DO NOT TRUST IT. All i wanted to do was support our great president but I had to delete this app after not even 15 minutes of having it.","date":"2020-06-27T02:30:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"Nick12545","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6122376851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","review":"I LOVE the president i really do but the very first screen is a phone number screen. I really was hoping to have access to news without spam messages but apparently not. Not to mention theres a weird point system to get various things. It also kept kicking me out every time i opened the app. Trump 2020, but not this app.","date":"2020-06-26T02:36:21Z","rating":1,"userName":"Panda 19","isEdited":false}}]}
