It is a app dedicated to porn and I guess this is what trump supporters are into? Maybe this is why their base is so cultish? They all watch the same porn together. It was disturbing to say in the least and I had to delete it.","title":"Fake app fake news","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:57:03Z"}},{"id":"6179849881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FŒŪR ÏÑ HĒR","review":"Today I stand as one to tell u my story. It all started when I needed some guests for my party I was hosting that was two days ago. I downloaded this app to buy some Cheetos bc the front cover looked like a Cheeto speaking into a microphone which made me laugh quite a bit since I don’t have many friends. As I went through the app, there were in fact no Cheetos. Minus points. There were, in fact, people that supported Cheetos. I support Cheetos cuz they are rlly yummy. So I invited them to my party to have a Cheeto party. They all arrived at my house when one car crashed into my house and started yelling get the water off the car. I offered them some Cheetos since it was in fact a Cheeto party. They said no and it hurt my feelings so I started crying. And crying. Tears were running down my legs and then I felt people’s tongues drinking them up! Disgusting! Many people came to my house and started to steal all my stuff and kick my face and cut open my Cheeto bag without my permission. I searched up on the internet that trump is not a Cheeto but actually the president?? I didn’t know this and his supporters were screaming into my ears, “what is I’m the MONSTERRRRR.” It hurted my ears and that’s not good. This is trumps fault. I now know how trump is. Trump is bad. Trump even came to my party and started to take off all his clothes and started to be naked on the counter as he took shots of tequila in his stomach. I was scarred and wanted to bleach my eyes with bleach. Grrrr Im mad. Don’t download this app unless you want a similar experience as mine, if u do, I totally recommend getting this app.","title":"GRRRRRR 😡😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:56:59Z"}},{"id":"6179849794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@Exclusive","review":"Please delete this app. This app is terrible and a waste of time. I downloaded it to see what was happening and I do not like how the first thing that comes up is Trumps face. It also is making my phone act weird. It will make me go off the app without even touching anything. I tried to restart my phone and it was still like that. There are some other problems also but I will not get into detail. I just hope this app gets 9deleted.","title":"Bad App👎","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:56:57Z"}}]}
