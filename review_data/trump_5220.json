So when I opened the app I saw the most hideous thing ever 😰. It was an orange rice grain attached to our so called president orange 🍊. That’s wasn’t all, I began to notice the app started flashing ✨✨ THE APP WAS CONTROLLING MY GRANDMAS LIFE SUPPORT! 👀 my poor grandma was jumping up and down because of the app👹 so I did what anybody would do I plugged out her life support and that’s when the flashing on the app stopped 😡 this app wanted to kill my grandma 👵 I hate this app and I hope nobody gets it 😤","date":"2020-07-08T19:31:16Z","userName":"hsudldbdh"}},{"id":"6173448701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The worst app I’ve ever had","review":"I downloaded this app to try and get the orange supremacist more votes. As soon as I did the FBI showed up and took my family. They told me Donald J Trump is my daddy now. I am only twelve and now I’m an orphan. Now I live with a family of rats who try to be eat me every now and then. I want my life back. I need to go back to normal, but because of this app I have nothing left. The orange man has stolen everything I have. After months of struggling and living with rats I ran into a demigod who taught me which craft. Now mr supremacy must be ready to be smoten because my new father Maui and my sister moana are coming to save the world.","date":"2020-07-08T19:28:28Z","userName":"youngblood320"}},{"id":"6173397908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is disgustingly horrible!!!!","review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP It is very bad. I can’t believe all of the problems with this app. This app is so extremely glitchy from the SECOND you open it. I could barely even create an account!! Not to mention they ask for so much personal information!! I feel very unsafe using this app and I do NOT recommend! Very bad quality and very poor graphic design, hurt my eyes to look at!!! I have also heard that MANY people using this app are able to track your address from your account!! Very scary and dangerous so DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI hope this app gets taken OFF the Apple store!","date":"2020-07-08T19:11:10Z","userName":"PetNamedSteve"}},{"id":"6173314835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS AWFUL","review":"Downloading this app immediately caused my phone to glitch out. It’s a racist app that tries to convince small children to believe in orange gods and that killing other races is good! It’s an awful devilish app that I would never want my children being around! I feel terrible sorry for anyone who enjoys this app or what is is apart of because it’s all just a big mind trick and it makes me dumber and dumber as you surround yourself with the false evidence, racism, sexism, fascism, and so much more. The people who support this app are supporting the DEVIL himself in disguise!! he is coming to take over the world please hide while you can!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:09Z","userName":"marleybilyeu"}},{"id":"6173172201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"I’ve been hearing very many good things about this app but I am disappointed that it absolutely DID NOT live up to what all the brainwashed white supremacists have been saying 😭😭The app will not stop glitching and crashing as soon as a picture of the great Cheeto pops up. This app also caused my phone to be really slow and not function correctly. Pres Trumpo’s voice just kept playing in the background on my homepage The app needs a lot of maintenance and possibly even to be taken down and completely redone. Really disappointed with this download for sure. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! WILL RUIN YOUR PHONE!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:55:38Z","userName":"savetiktok🥺"}},{"id":"6173122284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Scary 😰😰","review":"I downloaded this app because all the supporters said it was great, but when I downloaded it a fog 🌫 of orange 🍊🍊 dust came in my room and as soon as I inhaled it I became an 🍊. I didn’t know this till I went to the bathroom as I was choking looking into my reflection in the mirror I realized this horrible thing 😨. I was horrified 😱 but I stayed strong 💪🏼 , deleted the app. And now I’m back to what I was like originally, I don’t know if I will ever recover from this incident... That being said, I would NEVER recommend to a friend as this was an extremely traumatizing event. Never again. I thought our great Cheeto god was better than this. 😞😭","date":"2020-07-08T17:39:55Z","userName":"first lady wanna be"}},{"id":"6173116527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP!!!","review":"This app is completely horrible, it took me two years to download it and even after that it wouldn’t even open and every time I try to open it just crashed and then it killed my phone I’ve gone through three different iPhones just trying to use the stupid app and in the end the same thing kept happening. When I finally did get into the app the content in there wouldn’t even load and he kept making me purchase all sorts of things which I obviously did not do this app is a complete waste of time and it shouldn’t even be on the App Store.","date":"2020-07-08T17:38:05Z","userName":"Reese1995"}},{"id":"6173084108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed - wish i could give this app a 0","review":"Quite disappointed in the hypocrisy that our president spews. I tried to see what’s he’s done but it only looks like he was to “Make America Great Again” when only white men had the right to vote. as a woman how can i support someone trying to infringe on my rights. plus infringe on the rights of immigrants, African Americans, and the LGBTQIA+ community’s when they are american citizens. He blatantly doesn’t care about the American people and is using the military to suppress our first amendment right, which is communism. he probably learned a thing or two from his best friends in Russia and China.","date":"2020-07-08T17:27:40Z","userName":"hailt15"}},{"id":"6173053773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I almost died 😭😭😭😥😥","review":"One day I was very bored when I decided to download this app for our 🍊 president it was really late so then I went to sleep. When I woke up there were little cheetos everywhere trying to kill me and i had to kill all of them by eating them. When i ate the last one i felt like i was being wachted and then i saw this giant cheeto come out of no where, i thought i was gonna die but  then i just imagined it was the orange president and then got a knife, which was under my pillow and then stabbed the Cheeto 100 times I had a good dinner that day😋. ANYWAYS THIS APP IS AWFUL AND IF U WANNA FIGHT LITTLE CHEETOS THAN DOWNLOAD IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Thank you for reading.","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:52Z","userName":"SHIASSAISJEEJ"}},{"id":"6173047616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app🤢🤮","review":"I got this app in hope that I could agree with something Trump believed in, but I was so wrong. I must have been drugged when I thought I could agree with something he liked. Anyways let’s talk about the app. First of the icon is atrocious. Trump 2020?? More like Dump Trump 2020. Then when you open the app it’s says keep America great. HONEY if you wanted to keep America great you wouldn’t have ran for president!! And you thought this app couldn’t get any worse!! Once the downloading page goes away you see Donald Trump’s wrinkly face🤮🤮🤮 Anyways I would never recommend this app to ANYONE not even my worst nemesis!!!!!🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:57Z","userName":"emmie<3:)"}}]}
