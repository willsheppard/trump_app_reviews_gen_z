Many bugs and racist propaganda, reminiscent of old day slavery and Jim Crow era racism. He demeans and views anyone that opposes him as weaker while simultaneously encouraging young, impressionable children that the best life to live is a life of hate. I’d give it a zero, but then I couldn’t write a review.","isEdited":false,"title":"Racist Garbage","date":"2020-07-08T14:18:44Z","userName":"Arrest Breonna's Killers"}},{"id":"6172403662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So I opened this app to see our lovely president and I had took acid so I typed my phone number on in then I saw the orange head it was floating and I could not see my president I got scared and threw my phone then I realized that I gave him a bad review whoops and deleted the app became its trash","isEdited":false,"title":"Too much orange it’s my favorite color","date":"2020-07-08T14:09:56Z","userName":"jlburger1212"}},{"id":"6172135478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is quite possibly the worst thing on the app store.
