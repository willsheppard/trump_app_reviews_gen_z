As soon as I downloaded they immediately asked for my information (age, gender, address, social security, etc). I thought it was a little weird that they asked for that info but since I am so passionate about the president’s whereabouts, I entered in all the information and kept going. For a few days everything was normal and I spent all my free time on the app. Then everything went weird. After putting down my phone to eat a quesadilla with extra cheese as the fat ass I am, I heard a knock at the door. There was an orange on my doorstep. I thought maybe one of my friends did it as joke, because I couldn’t think of an explanation as to why there was an orange on my doorstep. I ended up eating the orange to make up for the quesadilla I had and then got back on the app. The next day there were two oranges on my doorstep. I stuck with the same conclusion I came to the day before, but then the next day there were four oranges. Then 8, then 16, 32, 64, 128 and so forth. The oranges were doubling by the day and eventually got out of control. At 15 days there were 32,768 oranges on my doorstep. I had a feeling it had something to do with the app. Besides the oranges, my face started to tint orange and my dirty blonde hair went at least ten shades lighter. My lawn started to fill with Trump 2020 signs and my car was covered in Trump 2020 stickers. I didn’t know what to do. So on the 16th day of having the app and there were 65,536 oranges on my doorstep, I decided to delete the app. It has now been a month since I deleted it and my skin has gone back to normal and I haven’t had an orange show up on my doorstep since. Therefore, I do not recommend this app. Seems like it may be run by the Chinese to spy on us. Please don’t download this app unless you are willing to go through the experience I went through. 🍊🍊","title":"Terrible experience","userName":"juicy oranges","date":"2020-07-09T20:52:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178203111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened the app it was glitching for 10 minutes straight.Then Donald’s trumps face popped up and almost shattered my screen.A sudden big fat orange thing came on and I screamed with terror.This app is horrific.","title":"The worst app ever created","userName":"trumphater125","date":"2020-07-09T20:52:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178202699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to download this app to look at the sexiest president of all time and to look at his hot nudes.(0.5 inch penis)But I got many viruses after watching him stick his little Twinkie in his daughter.All of my phone files and data are corrupted!Random trump moan come out of my speaker during the night time.Do not download this app!Get it to 1 star gen z!","title":"Horrible                                                    Tik tok","userName":"TFG_HxNri","date":"2020-07-09T20:51:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178202139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"✨Trump sucks✨","title":"Terrible","userName":"big booty b🍑","date":"2020-07-09T20:51:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178201839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i downloaded this app to support our “wonderful” ✨orangê✨facist leader, known as Donald.
