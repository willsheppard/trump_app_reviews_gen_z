Just awful. I opened it up, hoping to learn more about our wonderful, illustrious leader, Donald J. Trump, and his 2020 presidential campaign. (He has GREAT hair, FANTASTIC hair, the libs are just jealous 😤) Much to my horror, this app actually heavily advocates for white gen*cide. That’s correct. This app is anti-racist- read ANTI WHITE. This app called me a boomer, a Karen, an Anti-Vaxer, and countless other anti-white slurs that made me SICK to my stomach! 😡🤬 This iPhone application also had the gall and nerve to claim itself as an official app for our glorious supreme leader! I will be calling the police. Apple, it is a disgrace that you allow this racist, christianphobic, heterophobic, cisphobic disgrace to remain available on your Apple application store. \n\nGod speed, \nVote for lord trump 🙌🏻","userName":"Chavo1970"}},{"id":"6175814830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:01:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"so i downloaded this app and it took 276 days to download and when it did download i was spammed with messages from the Russian government telling me to vote for Trump it must have been a glitch tho because all of the messages where willed from my phone the next day! this is just the beginning tho after this my phone LITERALLY BLEW UP and when it did i found a trump 2020 flag in the remains of my burnt phone... so i had to get a new phone and i decided to try this again MY MISTAKE because as soon as i opened the app my phone SHUT DOWN and it erased all of my data! i think it transported Trumps data to my phone though because the only app i had was this one porn hub and twitter! anyways this app is terrible and Trump 2020 ✨🧚 on a tombstone","userName":"hehehgegeg"}},{"id":"6175810235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:59:33Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"disGusting","review":"so i downloaded this app because i was told it would ensure the safety of lgbtq+ citizens of America, but i was later proved WRONG because when i did install this app to my phone it BROKE it. yes, that is correct. my iphone 11 was immediately COVERED in cheeto powder which then proceeded to POUR out of my phone at a rapid rate, thus flooding my house with screaming rednecks and cheeto powder from what i assume could only be the product that donald trump puts in his hair. i was disGusted by the amount of cheeto covered rednecks were flooding my house. i had to move to canada to escape the EVIL that consumed my house. warning to all that download this app that cheeto covered rednecks will invade your home and all of your rights as a human being will be taken away from you. do not make the same mistake.","userName":"brayden 🙈"}},{"id":"6175773750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:46:56Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Lots of Paywalls :/","review":"I thought this would be a good app to help my friends and I bond over our love of fascism, but as soon as we downloaded, it popped up with a paywall. 😡 We looked at each other, shrugged, and tried to pay, but then the app said only Pablo, our Mexican friend could pay, and then he couldn’t even use the app! 😫🤷\u200D♂️ Very disappointing and hard to think such a non-racist, progressive person would come up with something like this. My 4 years have deffinetly been worsened. 😭😭😭And for some odd reason, this app also tells you to delete TikTok?😳🥴 What does that have to do with anything? Too much racism and nationalism. If I could rate this 0 stars, I would. \nLooking forward to the sequel though. Trump 2020 (In Prison) sounds fun! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤎","userName":"LittleWolfman30"}},{"id":"6175763325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:43:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WOULD GIVE ZEROS STARS IF I COULD","review":"all i wanted to do was support OUR president! but it’s clear the Dems have done a horrendous number on this app. first of all it took 69 days to download, how ridiculous is that??? second: the app crashes whenever i open the app. i see an oompa loompa on the screen instead of OUR handsome president :(( third: when i finally could open the app it asked me for my mobile phone number. phones are NOT MOBILE. that clearly must be a mistake on the Dems part, not our GENIUS president. fourth: i don’t think there is enough american flag in the background 😤 donald that’s actually on u 😐😐 unfortunately this was all just too much for me to even begin to think about wanting to leave a good review even if this app is about our GLORIOUS president","userName":"Connor 🇺🇸🎣🥶 is typing..."}},{"id":"6175698175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:21:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD 🤬🤬🤬","review":"it was the worst 🤬 i hated it and it gave me weird random glitches on my phone and made my dog get hurt. complete waste of my precious time. 0/10 absolutely. anyways one day i was walking and i tripped and a boy saw me and started laughing and i was like hey why are you laughing and he was all “that was cute” and he lives in my neighborhood so i think i’m gonna go talk to him next time i see him bc he’s kinda cute too and we have mutual friends and oompa loompas started moving in next door and the food was really good at the restaurant and i feel like being pro choice is amazing and you should really wear your masks bc corona won’t go anywhere if we aren’t being cautious oh and of course BLACK LIVES MATTER!!! and get trump out of office 2020 ❤️✨😜🥰😘🤪🙈🖕🏽😍❤️ xoxo","userName":"Keke5544336677"}},{"id":"6175670117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:11:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"can’t believe this app was THAT bad","review":"i downloaded this app a couple days ago and it immediately screwed up my phone. it started messing with other apps. i would open something like instagram or snapchat and it would take me here. the only way i could get into those apps were through notifications. this app also would not stop sending me emails, texts, and notifications that said nothing but “TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸”, that was all it said. because of this, i tried to delete it and it wouldn’t delete. it literally would not delete. so now i am stuck getting stupid notifications every 10 seconds and can’t go to any other downloaded apps. i hate this app so much i will not be voting for him anymore.","userName":"harry az crack"}},{"id":"6175633913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:58:49Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"False advertising & Misleading information","review":"I truly believe that anyone is better at advertising such a app. This app has been misleading every fact about Donald Trump, in fact, he isn’t even allowed to do such a thing as self promoting his speech’s. Not only is he covering up his crimes but he is also leading the death rate of people in the USA. Impacting our lives and the lives of our kids in danger. When he should be prioritizing the people of the USA but he only cares about himself, nothing more. We as the people can change our world by choosing better choices and not letting should a selfish, misleading, and dishonest man lead us. Time to make a change for the better of our future and to change the real problems that are current.","userName":"Choosing whats right"}},{"id":"6175515043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:14:49Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"BEWARE!!!","review":"So disappointed!!! I downloaded this app because I’m sick of seeing sleepy Joe Biden in the fake news media, but I had no clue what I was signing up for. Immediately upon opening the app, a giant orange tore down the street and broke through my bedroom wall. The app commanded another deadly orange to roll after me, and I’m not cool with this! It clearly stole this concept from Raiders of the Lost Ark! Unoriginal!🤬 I was willing to give the app another try, but then it took control of my phone and starting sending me white nationalist propaganda! Like helloooo that’s so 2016! Come on, Cambridge Analytica did it better...This app is actually a hub for an Oompa Loompa cult that is taking rights away from U.S. citizens and making America the laughingstock of the world!
