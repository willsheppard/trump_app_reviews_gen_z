There were no memorial dates at all. Very disappointed my friends also said they had the same problem. We came to the conclusion that it was because the IQ of the president was so low that he didn’t realize that he couldn’t create an obituary for himself months before he died. Overall this app did not do what was advertised of it.","userName":"01901919","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6137445520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T22:03:10Z","review":"This is the WORST app ever I do NOT recommend this I repeat do not download this app is the nastiest app ever not only the quality is disgusting is poorly designed as an app developer I feel attacked I do not support such poorly developed app If you hate vomiting don't download this horrendous app 🤮🤮. In fact, they should also throw away all the people that the idea of creating this app they should be placed in a mental hospital because clearly, they are mentally and physically challenged.

The embarrassment I felt looking at the style and fashion choices trump makes was ASTRONOMICAL. I could feel his stanky onion breath through the screen, who does he think he is... SHREK!? No hate to shrek because he is amazing!! Actually come to think of it... SHREK 2020!!! I’m really confused and disturbed by this app. Definitely gonna delete it right now because I’ve already been scarred for life...","userName":"blobllama","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I can see why this is rated 17+"}},{"id":"6134038752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T01:50:44Z","review":"i would first like to personally give a BIG shoutout to gen z !! we couldn’t have done it w/out the best generation out yet !! but about this app i downloaded it b/c i really felt like this app would do me good . instead it was terrible , first it’s ran by trump .. second it killed my cats mom ex boyfriend’s sisters aunt .. i know right .. very tragic . so i want to sue the app ... w/out actually suing . anywho .. rate this app a 1 star .. & keep it going !! all love , unless ur a trump supporter , racists , or homophobic . stay peachy and remember ...

But as soon as I texted my number to this app, it started spamming me with lies and started talking about fake news. I am overly disappointed in this as I just wanted to support my orange fluffy president but was greeted with a handful off lies. Not to mention that it started telling me personally information about my life, I hope this app will improve so maybe this country will be great again! 🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"Kaaann_issse","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"A let down ):"}},{"id":"6122512821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-26T03:26:10Z","review":"I am VERY disappointed with this app, especially for it being the app of an Incumbent President for his Campaign! It immediately said something about payment, which I did not give nor want to give! Mr. Trump is supposed to be helping the economy, not taking my money!!!!! I do have reason to believe this app is FULL of Fake News! I know Mr. Trump would never let the Lazy Liberals hack into his personal app, so what happened?? Very Disappointed. Should reconsider my vote! #fake #news Also where is my promised wall????","userName":"JJ🤩✌🏼","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"FAKE NEWS!"}},{"id":"6177729209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:27Z","review":"I downloaded this app in the hopes to get more educated on our wonderful president! Unfortunately, the app takes a very long time to load, and on top of that is extremely cluttered and difficult to navigate. I am very disappointed because in addition to this it crashes very often to the point where it is almost impossible to use. The app is glitchy and makes my phone lag. DO NOT download this train wreck of an app!!!!👎👎","userName":"atthetorch","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible👎"}},{"id":"6177711357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:14:06Z","review":"I wanted to SuPpOrT our great president, so i downloaded this app. The bad part is the app took FOREVER to download. I was waiting about two weeks before it finally finished. It wasn’t my phone that made it take forever it was the app, because i have no problem downloading other apps. Once the app finished i went to see what it was and all i saw was pictures of CATS. I’m greatly disappointed in this app and can say not the oranges best work. Have a great day!","userName":"thanks but i don't want ittttt","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"huge fail"}},{"id":"6177632637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:17Z","review":"Wish could rate zero stars. After downloading, my phone has never glitched more. My battery would barely charge. It also required so much personal info that is not necessary for general analysis. CREDIT CARD INFO UNNECESSARY. I feel like I may be robbed and even murdered by the government with the amount of info had to give them to continue. Left a very sour taste in my mouth. At least sleepy Joe Biden didn't destroy my phone's battery. I can never trust my president ever again. 0/10","userName":"manuel pere","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump"}},{"id":"6177622094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:45:53Z","review":"So basically I got the app cause trump is definitely not a sex offender and trump is definitely not a racist cause they for sure always take that out of context no matter how much proof they have of all his wrong doings anywayyyssss...the app brought ROACHES into my home and RACIST RATS into my home they were telling me they were gonna drag me to Mexico.
