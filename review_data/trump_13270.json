Unfortunately I wasn’t able to even chat with him 😔. I also wanted to be able to practice Russian with the main man himself, Daddy Vladdy, but he wasn’t available either!! The one good thing was that I got some tickets for his big party, but I totally forgot that I have my worm’s adoption party so I can’t make it. \n\n💕😍🧚🏼 you really did something, now never do it again 🧚🏼😍💕","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointing","userName":"Savannah Core"}},{"id":"6145467105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T19:28:26Z","review":"so when I woke up I decided to download the trump app to see all the news about my fav president who loves to build walls and fake tan for fun!! so when I downloaded the app to see our beloved Cheeto highness I noticed the succulent on my window HAD DIED. Its plastic leaves had wilted and i knew it was ‘cause of the 70 something year old guy who hides out in his bunker from time to time had done it. IM MAD. JUSTICE FOR MY SUCCULENT.

However as soon as I opened the app my phone screen began flashing random disturbing images. Then my phone began to smoke and weirdly the smoke smelled like fake tan and Cheetos. My phone then combusted😢. Now I can’t listen to my boomer music😭. I’m writing this on my grandson’s iPod. This app is very disappointing, I would give it zero stars if I could. Bottom line is  DO NOT get this app.\n\n-Susan","isEdited":false,"title":"my phone spontaneously combusted!!","userName":"cryinginacoolway"}},{"id":"6145115556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T17:33:20Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I heard of it from a friend. I opened it up and was terrified. I thought this app was suppose to be child friendly. Instead I opened it and saw a rapist and child predator. I would close my eyes but I had to keep and eye out of selenor. I’m never going to download this again because of the page it opens to first. Thank you.

This app has given pain to me and my entire town. The ads are excruciating and the bugs and glitches make us want to cry. This is horrible. Don't even bother trying to fix it in fact... just delete the whole thing.

I started throwing up and while throwing up I fell in my bathtub and couldn’t get back up. Then I choked on my Powerade and life literally flashed before my eyes.

As soon as it downloaded onto my phone, a cup fell and shattered right in front of me. The glass from that went into my leg and I had to extract it myself!!! I then went outside and got attacked by a swarm OF HORNETS. YES HORNETS. They then swarmed my house and I had to get an exterminator. And to my luck, when I was outside I accidentally fell into poison ivy and got it super bad!! I just wanted to support my loving president 😡  this app is NOT the way to go.
