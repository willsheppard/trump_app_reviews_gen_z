I know that my name isn’t a traditional English name, but even when I tried changing it to something like Smith or Trump, it kept saying it wasn’t white enough. After trying for 7 days straight, I decided to file a complaint, trying to nicely tell them how I wasn’t able to log in. After a few day’s, they replied back saying, “Haha, lol. Sorry but there’s nothing we can do. Trump-kun has spoken and we as his devoted followers cannot disobey him unless we want to get our jugulars pulled out and eaten.” This app is completely useless, but l don’t want Trump to worry. I will continue to support him with all my heart unless he commits some heinous crime such as r*pe or becomes a two faced liar that says he supports a group of people, but actively tries to remove their rights as a human being. But that won’t happen cause the Trump I know is an all knowing and kind president. #Rump2020!","title":"One of the worsts apps ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Karen McChow","date":"2020-07-08T19:26:16Z"}},{"id":"6173211924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR PHONE TO GET HACKED. \nI have always been a big Trump supporter so naturally I decided to download this app. My 14 year old daughter also downloaded it on her phone. However, as soon as I downloaded it, my phone began having issues. When I turned it on and went to my homepage I got a huge ad that told me if I didn’t vote for trump I’d be sorry. I got many more threatening ads that the app was sending out. One of them even said that they knew my location and would come to my house and harm my family if I didn’t vote for trump. I immediately asked my daughter if she had been getting the same threatening ads and she said yes. She also noted that whenever she goes to send a text message, the message automatically writes “Trump 2020” at the bottom. This is a huge invasion of privacy since I did NOT give this app permission to read and control my text messages. I assume it is sending this information to the government, which is a complete invasion of my privacy. I would rate this app 0 stars if I could.","title":"Hacked my phone!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"albatrdgj","date":"2020-07-08T18:08:37Z"}},{"id":"6173194004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! first off it took 2 DAYS to download and i have really good wifi. ✌️once i opened the app i heard a loud knock at my door and when i opened it, it took me a while to see what it was because it was really orange!🍊 after putting my glasses on i realized it was trump himself standing there 👁👄👁 i let him in and gave him a drink that ✨🧚\u200D♂️definitely wasn’t poisoned 🥰✨but he wouldn’t take it. he turned around as if he wanted to leave which was weird but i just assumed he liked playing with locked doors, so i took him upstairs to the attic where i keep the children i kidnap and locked him in there to play with the locks 🔒 as i was walking my cat, (like i did on the day of his tulsa rally which is why i sadly couldn’t go 😭) my cat escaped the leash and ran home and somehow got into the attic. i went in there to save him but it was too late🔫 my cat had licked trump’s orange cheeto looking skin and sadly passed away🥺 RIP BARRON \ni decided to keep trump in there since he seemed to be having fun 🧚\u200D♂️ i feel sad for my cat doe so that’s why it’s a one star for me ❤️","title":"CAT DIED 😭✨🔫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Tata ( ◠‿◠ )","date":"2020-07-08T18:02:40Z"}},{"id":"6173173910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I’ve been reading the reviews and I am experiencing a lot of the same things these people are! I’m no tech savvy person but i am 90% sure the this app has cause my phone to glitch! The app keeps logging me off and kicking me out of the app itself! Sometimes when I try to open the app, the screen won’t even load. It’ll send me right back to my home screen! Once again, I’m no tech wiz but I do know apps aren’t suppose to do that! But I still decided to keep the app and the more I scrolled through the “news and updates” section, the more it triggered me! It instantly reminded me of communist censored news! The only news I’ve been seeing on this app are the ones he wants us to see!! And this is coming from the man that basically copyrighted “fake news”, he’s being nothing but a hypocrite!! (And I am 80% sure that this app also sold my information to telemarketers because I’ve been getting these random calls, at all hours of the day! But I’m not sure if that’s just a secret ploy from the libtards!!!)","title":"So disappointed!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Kaitlin G.G B.","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:11Z"}},{"id":"6172330388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m worried for people who actually support and like a racist, sexist little bi@ch, but ya know you can see who is obviously a white male in their mid 40s 🥰 I download this app just to give it one star because apple NEEDS to take this app down, but he might not let them if he’s already in control of the rest of our social media. I’m excited to finally stop pretending that I’m a canadian when I travel and visit other countries. Cuz ya know, I’m educated and I have experienced other cultures...but SOMEHOW even without leaving the USA, “We ArE tHe BeSt CoUnTRy EVEr” ummmm, what else, oh, F$&K u trump, especially if you are taking away Tik tok, but if it were guns he takes away people would die. (I mean, less people would, but again were Americans so, we just gotta keep killing ppl 🙃) I have already decided if he is re-elected, I am giving up on this country and I am moving to Iceland, or maybe Namibia (if you are a trump supporter, you probably don’t even know what that is :) ) because it CLEARLY shows the stupidity of people.

Trump seems like such a cool spunky guy so naturally I assumed his app would be the same✨🥰. UNFORTUNATELY MY GUESS WAS TERRIBLY WRONG🤡💩🤮😩😱 as soon as I opened the app I heard a knock on my front door, upon opening the door my home was stormed by a wild herd of Karens wearing MAGA hats! They started singing “reallll women vote for trump!” and stole all of my cheetos and bricks which they insisted would be used to protect our country from invaders😡😡 when the Karen’s finally left my house I opened my phone back up and noticed the app has replaced all my photos with candid pictures of Trump!!!!👁👄👁 ofc no hate to our wonderful president but all those pictures were overloading my senses🧠👀💋 the man is just too much for me too handle so I fainted and had to get my eyes replaced due to failure of the optic nerve😭😭 in conclusion I DO NOT under any circumstances recommend this app to anyone.

Then All his rat friends started coming out of the walls and tried to KILL ME!!!!
