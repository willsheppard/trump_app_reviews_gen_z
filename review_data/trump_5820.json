I wanted to join and share my respects to Trump who passed away recently... But now.. I can’t even do that 💃. Because, as soon as I joined, my phone bit me 📞 My phone has been trained and has been behaving since I bought it, so the fact that this app has possessed my poor phone?! 🦵Unbelievable 🙅😠. I had to go to the emergency room to check for rabies. Just like the rally, I booked 8 tickets and was really excited to go, but then my oranges I packed tinkled themselves 🍊 and I couldn’t go 😔 Thanks for being a load of garbage 🗑 Rest In Peace 😘"}},{"id":"6146032455","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T23:11:11Z","title":"INFECTION 😍💕🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"pride 🏳️\u200D🌈 blm ✊🏽","review":"When I realized that our wOnDeRfUl “president” , my family barking and bumping everything, it was like they were infected with a parasite.

Over the course of three days after using this app, I have been visited by Mr. Donald HIMSELF IN MY DREAMS. During his visits he insists on wearing nothing but a speedo, I honestly couldn’t take it anymore. After seeing the view of his horrific porous flabby skin pouring over the red sparkly speedo my husband had to stop me repeatedly from bleaching my corneas! The next day an exorcism was held for me at my local church, where I was finally relieved from Mr. Donald’s presence. I will forever live with this trauma, pls keep me in your prayers."}},{"id":"6145484676","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T19:34:42Z","title":"Orange troll pop ups 😭","userName":"Game for everyone.","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of trying to support my president. However, the app has many issues resulting in this rating. First of all, after downloading Trump 2020 I began to see images of naked Trump everywhere (he is lacking if you were wondering🐸). It doesn’t end there. In trying to show my little brother the app a photo pops up. He was so frightened by the orange troll this app shows. The photo then started screaming “i’m the grumpy old mexicans who live over the wall”. It was a Dora horror story. In conclusion, this should be removed from the app store immediately. DON’T GET IT!"}},{"id":"6145166764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T17:49:10Z","title":"mom can you please come pick me up","userName":"cat_o7","review":"so i downloaded this app cause why not and as soon as i opened it up i got teleported to a some sort of a fever dream. all i could hear was mr. prez saying CHAI-NA and him chasing me up and down a maze like in the scooby-foo movies during those villain chasing scenes. if that’s not a sign i don’t know what is. the weird thing is, it only happens when i open the app so i got rid of it. i then came to see the reviews and saw someone’s paranormal experience and how someone’s goldfish escaped the fridge. i’m glad i deleted it before something worse happened. DONT GET THE APP OR YOU MIGHT GET POSSESSED!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6141231543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T19:49:39Z","title":"disgusting","userName":"D1328","review":"My little Kendall got this app to support Trump and her phone got hacked by the government. Little Kendall was more then mortified when she found out her information was being shared without her consent because it’s her business not out presents. Once my little Kendall’s phone got hacked she started to blame me for what was happening and I just didn’t believe it but when I came home from protesting for Black Lives Matter my little Kendall was on the phone with Hitler and I asked her who she was talking and she put him on speaker (This was on my old phone.) I was shocked to the core. NEVER GET THIS APP EVER"}},{"id":"6133824043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T00:25:31Z","title":"MY FAMILY HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED😭😭😭😭😭😭","userName":"mybigfatbussy","review":"I was just trying to see how are beautiful and most amazing president ever was doing😊😊😊😊😊😊I was trying to keep up with him because #Trump2020🇺🇸❄️ but as soon as I downloaded the app my WHOLE FAMILY GOT KIDNAPPED🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯I had gotten a call from the kidnappers and they said that I needed to pay them 100,000 thousand dollars😅😅😅😅😅 I don’t have that kind of money and I want to say it’s the app’s fault🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄Why did this happen to me?!?!?!

When I first opened it it asked for my SSN and my credit card number. This is supposed to be a news app not an online store. It also asked me for my number, I put it in and I got spammed with random calls and texts. My phone is glitching out so much now because of it. It won’t stop lagging and keeps shutting down every few minutes. Do not get this app. Do not vote for Donald Trump. Everything he does is fake. Guess I’m going to have vote for Jojo siwa since I’m left with no other choice."}},{"id":"6177735356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:16Z","title":"Spam","userName":"Kwon Hoshi (fuckyouhae)","review":"I was really excited to get this app and support our Cheeto president but when I opened the app it asked if it could send me notifications and I pressed no, but it sent me notifications anyway (like 50 a day) the notifications got weird too, for example one said that they knew where I lived and that I should delete tiktok because it was brainwashing me. Days went by and the notifications kept coming so I decided to text Mr. Trump but all he said is \"but I do know where you live chiki baby, let’s go get so tacos next week” and it was disgusting. Please stop this."}},{"id":"6177526364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:15:28Z","title":"Spam ads","userName":"user4098716891","review":"If I could rate this app at 0 stars I would. I downloaded the app to see what Trumps plans were for the rest of his term and what we were in store for if he actually won the election coming up.... You would think with the amount of money Donald Trump has he would create an app free from spammer ads, but that’s clearly not the case. I was looking through the app and out of no where this porn ad popped up on me screen with audio and nothing blurred out. My 6 year old niece was laying with me on the couch and had to see and hear it. Completely disgusting."}}]}
