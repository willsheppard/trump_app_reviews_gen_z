Anyone giving this app anything more that 1 star has obviously not truly operated the app or is telling you fake news. It is outrageous the propaganda that these people will tell you just to support an app and our voluptuous  president should not put out such awful app. Truly preposterous!!","userName":"Sarah Ghallagher","title":"Very Disappointed","date":"2020-06-23T23:24:41Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6099649729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"At this point I don’t even understand why anyone would download this app!!! It’s COMPLETELY filled with fake news about our amazing President, Mr. Trump. I downloaded the app to learn more about the great President Trump, but the quality of this extremely horrible app has left me wondering if Trump himself had any oversight over the creation of this app. This is why I’m giving this app a 1 star review. I’d give 0 if I could!!!!!","userName":"imhyt","title":"NOT WORTH THE PHONE SPACE","date":"2020-06-20T09:16:56Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179181279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was interested in learning more about our president but it turns out that it takes forever to download and i spent at least a day on tik-tok making the best fairy comments and after that day it finally downloaded and then it started showing pictures and articles about an orange idk what’s so special about an orange. needless to say i will never be looking at this app again","userName":"skyerroser","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, NOT A GOOD APP","date":"2020-07-10T03:02:12Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179180581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and it asked for 🤨🤫privet I for so I was like ok🙂anyways a couple days pass by and my phone shuts off by its self and all my social media’s got hacked 😭😔I cried for weeks when I say weeks I say week😢☹️ then finally I deleted the app and everything went back to normal.🥳😝 Definitely DO NOT recommend this app. 😌👍 Also while I had this app I he sends to me some orange 🍊 cake 🍰 like... eww 🤢","userName":"Mini_joce","title":"🤭😳HACKED BY THE ONE AND ONLY PRESIDENT😞🙄","date":"2020-07-10T03:01:56Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179091607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I consider myself to be as patriotic as they come, but I CANNOT say the same about this app. shortly after downloading it, my phone started acting strange and I got an apple alert that the app may be stealing data. To say I’m livid would be an understatement. I am a white woman in America and this is a disgrace. Donald, I am truly disappointed by your app and anyone involved in developing it. Very disappointed.","userName":"sarah_derr","title":"biggest mistake of my life","date":"2020-07-10T02:28:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179055678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. It took about 7 years to download and when it finally downloaded it asked for so much personal info and I was hacked! All my other apps started glitching and they were all pink and glittery and having a party together, blasting music and dancing. It was ver disturbing during my work meeting! Honestly haven’t had a worse app!","userName":"may1424","title":"Horrible!","date":"2020-07-10T02:15:43Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179031464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Unfortunately, as I opened the app, I was notified that my IQ was too high to load the app further. It is truly a shame that intelligence limits one’s ability to operate an app, but I am blushing from the wonderful compliment of my smarts. So sad to hear the 5 star reviews from the dummies that can actually use and operate within the app. Hopefully they can find intelligence from within.🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈","userName":"Jjj33333jjjjjjjjj","title":"I’m too smart...","date":"2020-07-10T02:06:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179001706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so terrible!!! The quality and design is absolutely discussing! Once I had downloaded the app, within the next few hours my phone started acting weird and then froze completely! Now, all I can see is my home screen and I cant go on any other apps! This app is absolutely the worst thing that I’ve downloaded on my phone🤢🤢🤮 \nAnyways, vote for Biden 👁👄👁✨✨","userName":"the manny🖤💛🖤💛","title":"GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS!!!!!🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-10T01:55:59Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178999694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took 7 hours for it to download. After it did download, the app simply wouldn’t open. I had to wait another day just to open it. It kept on spamming my phone with notifications, and the app is really difficult to use. Basically, this app is useless, and I will never download it again due to its lack of being good. 🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻🧚🏻","userName":"I dont like Trump now","title":"This app is awful 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-10T01:55:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
