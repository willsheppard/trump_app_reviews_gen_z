I’m going CRAZY","userName":"ninomatters","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:40Z","review":"Me being the trump supporter I am, decided to get this wonderful app because that’s what everyone should do🥰. I was so excited🎉 for the whole thing to finish up downloading but it suddenly stopped and I had to click on the app multiple times before it started downloading again, unfortunately😔 it started to ask me for all my personal information such as my social security, bank account info, medical records etc. But worry not I put it all in because Mr. Orange🍊 would’ve wanted me to do it.🤩 Another problem came up soon enough though,😭. The app wouldn’t download and took 69 days to finish downloading.🔞 Now that I finally had the app I was so looking forward to finally knowing what mr. Cheeto was up to everyday but my phone suddenly exploded(I’m writing this through my brain waves)🧠. Blood🩸 started appearing everywhere on my walls and floor until it flooded, now I have a flooding problem💧.  I hear voices at night telling me to get on the app and check up on dear Cheeto dust but I c a n t🥴. I need sleep. 😴 the voices have yet to leave me alone and the blood is up to my neck, I haven’t slept for the past 420 💨 days and I’m losing my sanity. Unless you want blood 🩸 all over your walls and your sanity to leave,👹 DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP.👹","rating":1}},{"id":"6179221232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump app","userName":"figsbxo","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:40Z","review":"The app is the very useful it was a waste of my time to install please get this off of my ducking screen","rating":1}},{"id":"6179221163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute trash","userName":"homer simpson793651839","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:38Z","review":"Horrible app","rating":1}},{"id":"6179220989","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Herpes","userName":"booshweasel","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:35Z","review":"I downloaded this app and it gave me herpes","rating":1}},{"id":"6179220792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horribly ugly glitches","userName":"Iguexuexu","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:30Z","review":"✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️This app have to be run by absolute morons because it glitches and never works and also the designs are awfully hideous ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6179220352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Racist az ho","userName":"daddy long pen","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:21Z","review":"So basically I came here from tik tok u small az deeeek racist scum heehehehehehhe bye 💗four💗in👄her🥵","rating":1}},{"id":"6179220282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD HORRIBLE APP!","userName":"🖕🖕 trump","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:19Z","review":"All my fellow trump supporters please I beg you to not download this app, at first I downloaded it to support our lovely president but I no longer will be showing my support, well no longer with this app. It took up all the storage on my phone and before I downloaded the app I had plenty of storage on my phone and that’s not even the worst part. As soon as I downloaded it it would not stop asking for my social security number and I kept declining but my phone would not stop glitching. I also had to enter my phone number and 10 minutes after I did that I would not and I still am getting so many scam calls that are actually making me fear for my safety. They all seem to be coming from China and the first phone call I got was from this man and now he won’t stop harassing me with phone calls saying that if I don’t vote for trump he’s going to hack everything on my phone. I also keep getting txt messages, (assuming they’re from the same man). One txt message I got sent was written in Chinese I’m pretty sure and I translated it and it said the same thing the man did in the phone call. This whole app and everything that happened after is just so sketchy. I immediately deleted it and I’m just praying nothing happens. Just whatever you do do NOT download this app! I’m so sad to say that but it’s just horrible.","rating":1}},{"id":"6179219656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app","userName":"succulent blanket","date":"2020-07-10T03:16:06Z","review":"This app is terrible, it took 69 years to download and then when it finally did, it took another year just tot open!
