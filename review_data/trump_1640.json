If I could give this app zero stars I would. So many things went horribly wrong. I was very excited when I saw this app and when I went to download it, it took over three days to download and it wouldn’t let me open any other app during it. Once it had finally downloaded I was very excited to test it out and it almost DESTROYED my phone. It made my phone glitch and delete VERY important apps for my work. I wasn’t even able to look at any of the information available. Throughout the day I went through horrible situations. Everyone I touched got electrocuted, thank god they’re all okay. Needless to say I will never find love, have children, or be able to feel human contact ever again. I’m no longer a Trump supporter and hope that no one else falls for this apps horrible illusions. May the Cheeto never get re-elected. :("}},{"id":"6173888110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! REMOVE THE APP!!","rating":1,"userName":"LisaX;)","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Let’s start with how long it took to download. It took 5 hours to download and I have perfectly good WiFi that works. This is unacceptable!! When I first opened the app there was this orange with nasty looking horse hair and it was disgusting. Right after I opened the app my phone started glitching so much I had to restart my phone! I get random alerts and notifications and it’s unacceptable! I tried to enjoy this app but whenever I was on it there was a creepy old man watching me from outside my window. I thought to my self would the “president” send an old creepy man to watch me. ABSOLUTELY! Guess what he was white I think it’s unacceptable! The color of his skin was disgusting. OH DOENST THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? I THINK SOOO. just like how our “president” is racist and can never admit when he’s wrong 🥰. I think that man was straight too ugh disgusting. Sound familiar??????????? YEA I THINK SO."}},{"id":"6173879120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the worst app i’ve ever downloaded","rating":1,"userName":"vvvvv disappointed","date":"2020-07-08T22:03:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"the moment i opened this app it started blasting  r_cial, h_mophobic, and s_xist slurs from my phone, and continued to do so every 15 minutes. there’s NO feature to turn it off and it is REALLY loud, like the orange man that this app is supposed to be supported by 😤😤🍊 So i was like ok whatever i’ll just turn my phone off, well little did i know that it runs in the background and donates $100 to his campaign every 30 minutes. this app also DELETED all my other apps because it’s “more important”. so now i hve no other apps on my phone, i’m broke, and labeled as a horrible person by everybody on the train with me but WHATEVER. the thing that FINALLY pushed me over the edge was when this app told TWO STRANGERS my garage passcode and sent them in the middle of the night to give me a spray tan while i was sleeping. nobody deserves what this app did to me, NOBODY."}},{"id":"6173796096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Frog 🐸✨God","rating":1,"userName":"Frog 🐸🌟🙏🏻God 2020","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Way to many bugs and glitches!!! 😾😾 When trying to download the app, the sky opened up and a voice from the heavens started chanting at me and I felt VERY unsafe❌😰😨. The chanting summoned ancient Roman gladiators⚔️which killed my entire family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦❌. I called the cops👮🏻\u200D♂️and pleaded for help, but understandably they told me they needed to go shoot at some peaceful protestors 😔😩. When trying to delete the app I was struck by a bolt ⚡️of lightning sent down from the crack 🍑 in the sky ☁️ and was then ridiculed by a swarm of flying lizards 🦎 people who then took me by the arm and sent me into a alternate universe where the government is run by lizards and we worship a frog 🐸🙏🏻🌟god. I’m writing this review from this alternate reality and I have no intentions of returning as the lizard people seem to be doing a better job running 🏃 the systems 😌, however I kinda miss my fam so I have to give this a 1 star."}},{"id":"6173693249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not a fan of the orange creature","rating":1,"userName":"FoxDoge","date":"2020-07-08T20:53:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I first downloaded this app to support Donald trump ( since I’m a racist, homophobic, sexist, and a terrible person in general), I clicked on the app and was met with his NUDES, I was DISGUSTED, even his 🤏🏻was orange. After an hour or so of downloading the app my fingers started to turn ORANGE I was mortified, the disease kept spreading all over my body and then my hair started thinning, even to the point where I had to hold my hair down or else it would fly away. I decided to get help and go to a doctor, but my inability to respect women made me turn down the only doctor who could help(woman btw). I went home and noticed that everyone( including animals) would scowl away because of the NASTIEST stench coming from my flabby toosh. I soon deleted the app and noticed that everything started to go back to normal, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYBODY!!!😡(and don’t forget to eat the rich)"}},{"id":"6173686229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hacked my phone","rating":1,"userName":"geybitch","date":"2020-07-08T20:51:13Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I tried downloading this app to take pride in the best president in the world 😍😍. However I was very displeased bc this app ruined my dreams of strength my support with the wonderful leader of the United States of America. After installing this app my phone was very glitchy and slow. I reset my WiFi’s multiple times and the app still wasn’t working. After having the app for only a few hours all of my apps started to acting up. I believe this app has given me a virus and it has spread throughout my entire device I’ve had to buy a new phone. All I wanted was to be part of my community and celebrate my values without libtards getting in the way but that couldn’t even be done. Whoever made this app needs to do better or get it deleted bc it is NOWHERE near the app someone as noble, articulate, and intelligent as the President deserves. Don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6173613813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible!","rating":1,"userName":"Ewwww Trump 🤮","date":"2020-07-08T20:25:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I came on this app to support our orange president, Donald Duck. I am terribly disappointed to find that there have been multiple instances in which the app has malfunctioned. First off, I have come to notice that many ignorant old white men have gotten this app, which is not good for minorities who wish to vote for someone sensible. Afar from that, there all also technical issues that lead me to believe that a entitled child made this app: for one, downloading the app has caused all 3,074 photos on my cellular device to overflow with an orange tint. All of my apps have started to glitch, causing my 4 year old son to get electrocuted (yes, this happened!) when he was playing a game on my phone. And lastly, ever since I downloaded this scam of an app, there has been multiple instances in which my device kept playing the Star Wars theme song. Fix this, or lose a supporter!!!!"}},{"id":"6173612534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😤😫👎TERRIBLE","rating":1,"userName":"hello my doods it is i","date":"2020-07-08T20:24:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app destroyed my everything. When I installed it, I suddenly felt my hands shake and my phone exploded! 😿 I picked up a broken piece of my phone and it grew into a big orange 🍊 with a blonde wig 👱\u200D♂️and it grew bigger and bigger until it destroyed the roof of my house 🏠 and rolled away 🤯 it took 40 years to rebuild my house and it’s haunted 👻 one day I got on my bike 🚲 and rode to the grocery store when my bike exploded into thousands of snails 🐌 and all of them were chanting “orange with blonde wig” and it was so scary I screamed and ran home.

When I opened the app it opened a portal to another dimension👁🤚 Millions of cockroaches, spiders, flies, and all sorts of insects came rushing out. I almost fainted.💀 I quickly rushed out of my house finding an escape to these creatures. I couldn’t escape them. They followed me chanting “trump, trump, trump”🧚\u200D♀️😻I had no where to go so what did I do? I quickly went to the nearest market and bought all their oranges🍊‼️I threw them at the bugs and they melted. Petrified I moved to a different country👻 I am now traumatized and can never see a bug again in my life. 10/10 would not recommend😭😤😔🤢 the only way I was able to deal with this terrifying scenario was listening to Twice🥳😝😻 stream more and more👁👅👁"}}]}
