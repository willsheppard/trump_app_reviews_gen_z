And when I typed almost every word I said was auto-corrected, and it looks like the colors are red and blue but when you actually open it they are orange!!  Orange is the worst color and the color is so bright it hurt my eyes, I deleted it within 5 minutes of installing. Not worth your time.

Once it finished downloading I opened it and to my surprise it wouldn’t even load!

It’s been terrible with him around and now he has an app it makes it even worse that I have to see it in the App Store","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:35:56Z","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6173073417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gracey231","review":"This app was absolutely horrible. It kept asking for very personal information and took forever to download. But once I gave them all the stuff they needed, everything was super glitchy and extremely slow. I’m pretty sure this app had more than two viruses and I regret even downloading it in the first place.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:24:12Z","title":"Disappointment"}},{"id":"6173038898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"glkrab","review":"This was terrible first it took forever to download then when I opened the app it began to make my phone glitch. I thought it was my phone at first but I even got a new phone and it still glitched. But it probably worked out for the best because the only reason I got it is to see what idiotic things the president was doing next. So 1 star.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:11Z","title":"Terrible app"}},{"id":"6173034732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"regina goerge 😔❤️🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I shouldn’t even give this app a “one star review” this app gave me carpal tunnel syndrome trying to use it. I spent 30 hours trying to download and once i got it my phone got a virus so i am leaving this review on my LAPTOP this app is a mistake waiting to happen. Plus i’m not sure why you need it, it has no uses, you get this and you get life problems.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:11:55Z","title":"Don’t Recommend"}},{"id":"6173027877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MannyFlag✨","review":"The app is TERRIBLEEEE it almost made me die 😨 I was walking and the app all of a sudden said, “My name is Donald Trump and I hide in a bunker!” And then I tripped on a stick 😡👊🏽👊🏽 And to think that a racist pedo could make an app- shame shame 😤 I’d also like to add that the app made my phone walk into my closet and started talking to me in the middle of the night! I opened the closet and the orange dude was standing right there! I am flabbergasted 😪😡😤👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:09:49Z","title":"✨Bunker Boy ✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6173026497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"D-MASTERFLEX","review":"I downloaded this app cause my friend wanted me to but when I went in to the app it completely turned off my phone I kept trying to get into it like two more times but same thing and now it does that often whenever I’m doing something else on my phone I had to buy another phone","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:09:22Z","title":"Made phone glitch"}}]}
