I looked deeper into the app and found traces of misogyny, homophobia, racism, and white supremacy! And even more, I found out that this idiot is trying to host in-person rallies and events during a world pandemic! This is unacceptable and I demand to speak to the manager of this campaign immediately. This man is clearly out of his mind and needs to be shut down before his cult grows. I WILL be calling corporate to tell them about this man and make sure that he is fired.","userName":"sk8rlulu","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible, terrifying app!"}},{"id":"6176837769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:01:48Z","review":"i wish i could give this app ZERO stars. the app itself seems quite racist! i downloaded the app... but immediately deleted it because i saw who the app was about! tr*mp clearly isn’t running a good campaign, so how would it be possible to leave a good review on a CAMPAIGN app?? also, ALL apps matter🧚🏻💞 it would be VERY RUDE to praise an app when i can’t praise every app... so therefore, i cannot leave a positive review because that would be offensive to the other apps🙁 if you were actually looking to download THIS app, i would also recommend watching fox news! i heard they’re pretty similar. also, i think all my data was completely hacked. VERY dangerous. anyways, i’m going back to GOOD apps like tiktok and twitter😋😚","userName":"An angry instagram user!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6176777627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:45:55Z","review":"I absolutely thought I would love this app because it’s my wonderful presidents and I love him but it took about 15 hours to completely download 😪I was so excited to see what our president had for us😍and next thing you know as soon as I opened the app after I downloaded it ,a picture of trump getting a tan came out🙈😍it was so much to handle 😔this app also made my Tvs start acting up. once that happened I decided to delete the app because I was so scared😨👿after a couple minutes passed by, my lights started flickering a lot and I got a message saying I need to redownload the app in order for everything to stop🛑✋🏼and go back to normal WHICH MADE EVERYTHING EVEN MORE SCARY. anywho DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ITLL HAUNT YOU FOREVER xoxo🙈","userName":"okayyaliexpress","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"hOrRIFyInG😪😡🤬🤯"}},{"id":"6176764198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:42:20Z","review":"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.","userName":"GoBigEd","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176759952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:41:13Z","review":"First of all, this app took 1 year to download! I have been sitting by my phone for a year waiting for this glorious app to download, and it was painful. Once it finally downloaded I was ecstatic! But then, as soon as I opened the app, things went downhill... The second I opened the app all of the lights in my house went off. I was scared but I assumed it was just a power out. Then the app asked for my phone number, and I gave it because I love to receive calls from pedofiles. Once I gave my number, I started receiving calls from a satanic like voice that said if I didn’t purchase MAGA merch I would be sacrificed. Needless to say, I deleted that app and am never going back. Save yourself, don’t download this app.","userName":"talvs01","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Satanic App"}},{"id":"6176708028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:34Z","review":"I got this app to support our great president, but this took 3 weeks to download. Then it said that they needed my number and my social security number. It was asking a lot of private questions and I didn’t feel very comfortable. Then I realized that they hacked into my phone and looked at everything. But the thing is, when I closed the app, my mom texted me. I didn’t respond because I didn’t want to right way, but when I looked at my phone, it texted for me. Then I deleted that app. There was someone knocking at the door begging to re download the app. It was the Smurf’s. When that didn’t work, the minions, Oompa Loompas, came a started begging that I re download the app. Then I called the cops on them and they died.","userName":"🎄☸️💓♓️💚📍📆📐🗂","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨🤫👏🐭🌺✨"}},{"id":"6176704785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:26:44Z","review":"i downloaded this app to see if the child rapist who is our president might have something good to say. after it took 20 minutes for a simple app to download, i was immediately asked for a phone number, which seemed inappropriate since he already HAS my phone number from when i reserved tickets to his rally. too bad i forgot that i had to walk my pet snail that day and couldn’t attend :( but it gets worse. almost immediately my phone started glitching and every time i tried to open the app it crashed. i went to check and see if it affected my storage and boy did it, it was almost completely full! all around a terrible app and i wish i could rate it one star.","userName":"suckmyballs2020","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"zero stars"}},{"id":"6176603140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:59:49Z","review":"Unfortunately upon downloading this app I also downloaded a disease which seems fitting because our president cares more about profitability than my health, life, or safety. Additionally, the content on this app was so mind numbing that it gave me a brain bleed which resulted in my temporal lobe melting out of all my facial orifices including my nose. I would see a doctor about the symptoms I’ve suffered from due to this app, but the American healthcare system is currently overwhelmed due to the global pandemic we’re ignoring in this hazardously capitalist country and I unfortunately couldn’t cough up the exorbitant copay regardless because our for-profit healthcare system doesn’t work. Bummer. Do not download this app or you will get a DISEASE.","userName":"a01219","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me a disease"}},{"id":"6176566493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:49:49Z","review":"I downloaded the app you know trying to see if it could change my mind about our racist,homophobic, cheeto of a president. So I downloaded it opened it and saw a nasty man as soon as i opened it. So I went to bed after, Little did I know I would have nightmares later that night from an APP but that’s not even the worst part I woke up cause the nightmare was so scary and i checked my phone and his nudes were in my camera roll and i NEVER had them in the first place, he’s nasty for having an app put in his little cheeto in a MINORS camera roll 🤢🤢. All I wanna say if that doesn’t make you not want to vote for him then i don’t know what will, hope you get help if you still want to vote for him. Get better luv💙","userName":"Big PP Brian","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Scary President Vibez"}}]}
