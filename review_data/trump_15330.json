I don’t understand why this orange racist man thinks he is the king. I’m giving this app a horrible review because why can trump have his precious app and we can’t have tiktok. But I’m also giving this app a horrible review because I wanted to see his plans for America. But the app was messing up my phone and taking up WAY too much storage."}},{"id":"6177988125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Discrimination!","rating":1,"userName":"Cory the Explory","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:40:08Z","review":"When opening this app, all that appeared was a blank screen. Every button I pushed took me to another blank screen. No content to be seen. I tried to trouble shoot this issue, and found hidden deep in their user agreement that the app content is only available to men. I am a woman who wants to read the news, and this discrimination is unlawful. I will be calling my lawyer."}},{"id":"6177981896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ridiculous","rating":1,"userName":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)(ง'̀-'́)ง","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:38:10Z","review":"so i downloaded this app because it seemed interesting and i wanted to stan our educated president... right? everyone was saying how it was so good and it could educate me😌 BUT all of a sudden it started glitching and my phone was burning up, like a fish in the sun. it almost EXPLODED, and then what do i see?

After I opened it my children started to hear strange noises and a man around the house repeating “grab her by the p*ssy”. Me and my family have been seeing orange stains all over the walls. We are mortified and will all be attending therapy because of this app. Never again 😳"}},{"id":"6177933033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful🍊🤮","rating":1,"userName":"trump🍊🍊🍊","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:22:15Z","review":"I was so excited to finally get this app but when I opened my eyes started to bleed. I was horrified because this orange 🍊 thing was just there I can't believe I was excited. I decided to go a little further in to the app when I started crying so much. My eyes couldn't handle what I was seeing until I went blind. So if you don't want to cry blood and become blind I don't recommend this app."}},{"id":"6177930772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"nasty🧚🏾\u200D♂️🤣👅😋🥰","rating":1,"userName":"gsudgd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:21:29Z","review":"🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾you tried don’t do it again🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧜🏼\u200D♂️nobody likes this app it has no use tik tok has a purpose which  is to inspire and encourage ppl and help them laugh in case they are having a bad day idk even know y u thought you could rlly ban TikTok when there are millions of ppl that will come for your neck if u tried but since u wanted to take something that was ours we are gonna do the same🧚🏾🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾🥰🥰🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾🥵🧚🏾🤭⚡️"}},{"id":"6177900544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the app ate my donut","rating":1,"userName":"judybabooty","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:11:32Z","review":"i was casually eating a salsa like a normal person and i saw an add and downloaded the app once i was on the app the app started making weird noises and trump jumped out and ate my donut i was fairly angry at this and then the app started to tell me that he will eat ALL my donuts if i don’t keep the app\ni immediately started crying my carpet where my leftover donut fell and deleted the app \ni was disturbed and very sad🥺😭😭🧚🏻✨😤\n\ni got some jokes aHaaaahhhh"}},{"id":"6177891647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Donald worst president ever","rating":1,"userName":"Andre.C.V.3","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:38Z","review":"Okay so I’m actually going to write a big review for this just because of how horrible our president is and for a fact that he has done nothing for this country and only broughtDespair sadness and chaos to the Economic and social part to the country and trump does not Deserve this app or being president and should of been impeach.
