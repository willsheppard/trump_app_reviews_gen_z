The Gummi Bear \"Cleanse\". If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy. If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!\n\nFirst of all, for taste I would rate these a 5. So good. Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.\n\nBUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose. I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined. Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare. I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.\n\nThen came the, uh, flatulence. Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited. I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.\n\nBut wait; there's more. What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw. I swear my sphincters were screaming. It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste. 100% liquid. Flammable liquid. NAPALM. It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.\n\nAND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.\n\nI felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day. There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.\n\nI had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.\n\nSilly woman. All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened. I think she was crying.\n\nHer sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating. She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left. She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc. Lots of people who generally have limited access to toilets on a given day. I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day. I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!","userName":"MikaZ312","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174664138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"okay, starting off... right when i opened the app i saw a picture of an unpleasant orange without the peel ! i was downloading the app so i can get caught up with the latest news. but unfortunately when i tried to load my username & password.. my password kept changing into something very disturbing, my password kept getting changed to “pluckmypubes334” and my username got changed to “pubeyfish” when i tried to change it, it was getting more & more disturbing !! i would personally not recommend this app & an alternative to this app could be the one called “joe biden 2020” overall a horrible app!! 👍🏽","title":"disgusting app!!","userName":"pluckmypubes334","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174664019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is eating some Chinese food.]\n\nPhoebe: (looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!\n\n(They all run and join her at the window.)\n\nRachel: I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.\n\nRoss: Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.\n\nRachel: Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.\n\nChandler: And we're done with the chicken fried rice.\n\nRoss: Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!\n\nAll: Good idea! Yes!\n\nRoss: It would be so cool to live across from you guys!\n\nJoey: Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!\n\nChandler: Or we can do the actual telephone thing.\n\nOpening Credits\n\n[Scene: Ugly Naked Guy's apartment, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are checking out the place. Luckily, Ugly Naked Guy is nowhere to be seen.]\n\nRoss: Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!\n\nRachel: Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.\n\nPhoebe: It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.\n\nRoss: (laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)\n\nRachel: Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)\n\nPhoebe: (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!\n\nRachel: What?!\n\nPhoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!\n\nRachel: Oh my God!\n\nPhoebe: CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!\n\nRachel: OH MY GOD!!!\n\nPhoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!\n\nRachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!\n\nPhoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!\n\nRachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!\n\nPhoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!\n\nRachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!\n\nRoss: (entering) What's going on?\n\nPhoebe and Rachel: Ohhh!!!\n\nRachel: (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!\n\nRoss: What?! What?!\n\nRachel: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!\n\nRoss: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)\n\nPhoebe: (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)\n\n(Ross starts jumping and screaming incoherently and hops over and joins in on the group hug.)\n\n[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there talking about Chandler and Monica.]\n\nPhoebe: You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!\n\nRachel: Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.\n\nPhoebe: Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.\n\nJoey: (entering) Hey guys!\n\nRachel: Joey! Come here! Come here!\n\nJoey: What? What?\n\nRachel: Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.\n\nJoey: You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)\n\nRachel: No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.\n\nPhoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?\n\nJoey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!\n\nPhoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.\n\nRachel: Wh-what do you mean?\n\nPhoebe: Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.\n\nRachel: Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!\n\nJoey: No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.\n\nRachel: Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.\n\nJoey: I can't take any…\n\nPhoebe: No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!\n\nJoey: Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!\n\nRachel: You don't have any secrets!\n\nJoey: Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)\n\nRachel: (To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?\n\nJoey: Ugh.\n\nPhoebe: Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.\n\nRachel: Okay.\n\nPhoebe: And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.\n\nChandler: (entering) Hello children!\n\nAll: Hey!\n\nPhoebe: Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.\n\n(She gets up and goes over to Chandler who's ordering some coffee from Gunther.)\n\nChandler: Hey.\n\nPhoebe: Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!\n\nChandler: Really?\n\nPhoebe: (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?\n\nChandler: Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?\n\nPhoebe: Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.\n\nChandler: Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.\n\nPhoebe: Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.\n\nChandler: What's going on?\n\nPhoebe: I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.\n\n(She makes a show of bending over to get her coat and showing off her bum. She then walks out, leaving no one to eat her cookie.)","title":"WORST APP EVER!","userName":"mksmith30","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174663866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app once I got it would no stop glitching.
