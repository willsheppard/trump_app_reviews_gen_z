There is a billion advertisements every 2 seconds. It keeps asking for payment methods. I think it’s a scam. It keeps trying to get me to buy random stuff. It won’t let me even open the app with out crashing. It is ruining my phone. It takes up so much space.

When I asked my phone what’s wrong, it started break dancing to music coming from the application. I was so fed up with it, that I drove all the way to the nearest cliff and threw my phone. That phone was extremely expensive, and it was a hassle to buy another one. I do not recommend this app for anyone else.","isEdited":false,"userName":"CrazyPinkWigg","title":"Do Not Download.","date":"2020-07-08T19:26:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173441872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t recommend this app at ALL. Once I opened the app there was millions of bugs that came out of the screen. Just to be clear I I’m afraid of bugs. I hade to go to the emergency room then found out I hade a huge phobia of bugs. And don’t even get me started with the nightmare I hade. For 3 days straight I kept waking up to our beloved president screaming at my dog. After days my dog disappeared. Once we found him under a bush eating oranges.","isEdited":false,"userName":"K K Kim G","title":"DONT DOWLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T19:26:06Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173427486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took 2 days to download and normally every app takes less than a minute to download 😡😡 when I opened it my phone glitched and I had to take it to the Apple store and I’m pretty sure the app gave me a virus 🤬🤬 I had to pay 100 dollars to get it fixed!

When I had actually opened the app, my phone caught aflame, and I set it down in my panic. Unbeknownst to me the liquid was actually gasoline that had excreted from the actual app which set my whole house on fire. It was an okay app but I don’t really like the fact I have no house now.","isEdited":false,"userName":"abikat bitchhhh","title":"It was okay but I have no home now","date":"2020-07-08T19:14:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173401857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took 48 hours to download on my high speed internet. it now causes my screen to randomly flash to a orange crusty baby. and when i launch the app it plays a bass boosted national anthem. and when i have it open (while blasting music even if i turn my volume off) it just shows a bunch of scams and offers. i’m afraid that my phone will never be the same!","isEdited":false,"userName":"crusty bumkin","title":"do NOT download! it’s a scam!","date":"2020-07-08T19:12:34Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173373409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app killed my entire family. let me explain. this app leaked my address to every squirrel in the area. on july 2nd, 400 squirrels showed up in my front yard begging for food. i tried to explain to them that i had none but they wouldn’t listen. they stormed into the house with screams of anger. i tried to reason with them, but that only made it worse. they tied up my family and held them for ransom. they told me if i didn’t feed them, the rest of my family would. paralyzed with shock and fear, i said nothing. they then began to eat my family members one by one before my very eyes. please don’t download this app. it will only bring pain and anguish.","isEdited":false,"userName":"meowziworker","title":"worst app in the world","date":"2020-07-08T19:02:20Z","rating":1}}]}
