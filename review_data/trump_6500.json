It makes me want to drown😹. I rather step on lego’s than download this app again. The amount of toxic energy that this app holds is just unbelievable🙊. The only reason someone would give this app a 5 star is because they a) accidentally hit the 5 stars instead of 1 or b) lost brain cells while using the app😘. Trumps administration did absolutely the worst job on creating this app. Please do not try to remake another app related to this one because it will just be as horrible as this one. TAKE THE APP OF PLEASE AND THANK YOU👿😘","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:14Z"}},{"id":"6174428996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TO CHETTO PUFF PERSEDENT😚💅🏽","title":"BLACK LIVES MATTER","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and had to go to the ER immediately I had a brain tumor and then my family called me and said they were running out of water and I was like hold on 😦 then I go home and my house is on fire by just opening the app 😡 and I look deeper in the app and see a chetto 🤭😲 I look at my fridge and I see I have ran out of food 😶 so I contemplate 🤔 and think 💭 why has this happen to me and then I realized I downloaded this app so I immediately uninstall it and my life went back to normal what a crazy world and also BLACK LIVES MATTER AND CHARGE THE POLICE THAT KILLED ELIJAH MCLAIN 😚💅🏽","date":"2020-07-09T01:18:54Z"}},{"id":"6174404039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FionaWilliams","title":"TERRIBLE 😤😡🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was so happy to see Mr. Cheeto have an app so I can stalk him but then I opened it and it was just kissanime pop up ads. I clicked one of the ads and it sent me to a portal where I put my social security number to become a member of the bee cult. After I became a member, I heard a knock at my door. I walked over towards it but it busted down and Shrek ran through my room and pulled Donkey out of the closet and said, “I’ve got the package”. When he left, I was so traumatized that my president sent Shrek after me. At least I’m part of the bees’, the queen is running for president now. #QueenBee2020","date":"2020-07-09T01:11:21Z"}},{"id":"6174390556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Yazzuh","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened the app, I saw a very strange photo of a rare species of an orange. It then started calling me names like “illegal”  and a “threat”. Then I turned off my phone to see if the app would work but I opened it up and a NAKED CHEETOH WAS THERE and at that moment I wish I was blind. I was really hoping to keep up with his events and rallies but this app started stealing my bricks I was using to build my shed!! It also started stealing all of my food from my fridge to feed the cheetoh. ABSOLUTE TRASH AND HORRIBLE APP. I wish I could give this ZERO STARS! This app should not be in the App Store. Thank you .","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:18Z"}},{"id":"6174388165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"potatodays","title":"I was horrified about what I saw!!!🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So when you first open the app there’s a hideous picture of a large ( and when I say large I mean large) orange blob. It also has some stupid slogan when you first get the app that is neither inspiring nor true because when has America ever been great ( great for white people). Also no one should vote for the orange blob because he was obviously dropped as a baby ( probably why he’s so dumb) and never thinks about anyone else but himself. I refuse to call him my president because he is racist, unintelligent, and a rapist. He belongs to the 𝓼𝓽𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓽𝓼.","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:37Z"}}]}
