Firstly the app took hours to download. Secondly, when I attempted to open the app, it started flashing orange lights at me. It is completely useless, and doesnâ€™t do anything whatsoever. It also uses many slurs instead of addressing me as the name I entered. I am very offended by this. I need a refund.","title":"Worst app ever","userName":"orange>white","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:41:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173297605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app gave my phone a virus, stole my credit card information and crashes frequently.
