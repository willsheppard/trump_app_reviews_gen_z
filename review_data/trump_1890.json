Before I downloaded this app, my phone was perfectly fine, it was BRAND NEW. After being on the app for all of 5 seconds, my iPhone began glitching and eventually crashed. When I was finally able to turn my phone on again, a notice appeared on my screen that said that my credit card info has been stolen and I had to call \"apple\" to recover the information. Turns out, the phone number given to me was not actually Apple, but a scammer!! After I refused to call this number, my phone crashed AGAIN. But this time, it did NOT turn on back on. At the end of the day, I ended up having to get a whole new phone. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in President Trump for creating such a dangerous and unreliable app, and I implore that you take my advice and DO NOT download the app."}},{"id":"6174600094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ashlinm","date":"2020-07-09T02:08:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"YIKES! Had to delete....","review":"First off....the app takes forever to load!! But that is not even scratching the surface of how scary and bad this app is. Next... the app has ads that I don’t trust!! I think they may steal my information! I have kids, and a husband, and a family and friends that I love! I can’t have my information stolen like that. On top of that... the graphics are very hard to read, and besides my readers, I can see just fine, almost 20 20 vision. Lastly... I think it is killing my phone battery. I have a brand new iPhone 11 and still, it takes almost half of my charge straight out of my phone! And I had only been on it for a few minutes! I swear...almost like that generation z made it.... not good, I expect better from MR TRUMP!!! You know what app is better? starts with a t... ends with a k.... has ikto in  between😼"}},{"id":"6174566865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jdjdndncncnkos","date":"2020-07-09T01:58:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"NEVER AGAIN 🤬","review":"i wanted to get this app cause i’m a libtard and love pedo- i mean are peod- i mean president i mean the app completely bugged out and now i’m scared that it completely went thru my phone and stole all my credit card numbers and information because as soon i downloaded the app an email came in to confirm and order for DILDOS mind you i am 52 and have 3 kids and a loving husband.

I was shooketh to THE CORE to not find any Kim Namjoon fancams...10/10 disappointment😔 I was really hoping to get good use out of this app but it was the opposite effect🤚 I rather use up my precious storage to save shirtless pictures of REAL MEN rather than using my storage on a overweight Cheeto that has done only bad to this country. KIM NAMJOON WOULD NEVER! I thought I could make some kpop friends here but I realized no one had the app because a racist rich boi ran this dumb app. Bruh what is this app even for? It’s a joke just like this whole country 😹😹😹😹LAUGH OUT LOUD!

The operation was successful, but the doctor noticed a Swa$tik@ tattoo on her left a.$ cheek. We have no idea how that could’ve ended up on a six year old child. She’s alive, but was left with significant brain damage and a permanent speech impairment. Despite weeks of intensive speech therapy, the only sounds that have come out of her mouth have been the phrase “MAGA” and a few sporadic, incoherent moans. \n\nApple, I beg you to take this off the app store before this terrible tragedy is repeated and more innocent children are harmed. There are plenty of apps to choose from, but I will never have my cousin back. Is this what it means to make America Great?"}},{"id":"6173859013","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hellbus plesde","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i’m ✨s c a r e d✨","review":"this app is TERRIFYING. at first when i opened it, i kept getting kicked out at least 3 times. the 4th time, i got jumped scared and i threw my phone. thanks this the app, i have a broken phone. when i went to go threw the app, my phone kept glitching and then donald trump popped up saying if i don’t do what he says, he’ll find where i live and kill my whole family. i was rlly scared to the point i fainted and then i woke up in the hospital. i felt really nauseous and tired. my parents told me that they heard a thump upstairs and they went to go check what it was and they found me on the floor and the app open. my family yet is now scared cause we might get assassinated and i’m still very young. all i wanted to do was help out my wonderful president but then it turned out that he wants to hurt us if we don’t do what we are told to."}},{"id":"6173677972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump hater 1111","date":"2020-07-08T20:48:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"zero stars","review":"this app is utterly horrible, took ages to download. my phone was working perfectly fine before downloading and now it’s lagging like crazy. the colors clash with trumps complexion and made me BARF everywhere. the spinning circle in the beginning gave me a heart attack and now i’m dead. i’ve never been more disgusted with an app of this program.\nand i saw another review that said the music brought them roaches and i didn’t notice until just now. there are roaches IN my genetalia and i’m pretty sure that my use of this app alone has given me 4 different std’s.\nnow i can never be a mother and my vagina is broken. my dreams of motherhood have been demolished and trump is all to blame.\n\nalso while the downloading process of this app my cat went missing and he was just now found DEAD in my fathers dishwasher. again, trump is to blame for this malfunction.\nand ANOTHER THING. the heat and color radiation from this app has sent my family into a state of oblivion and they do not remember who i am. the radiation also caused me to turn purple like that poor girl in charlie and the chocolate factory.\n\noverall, this app is grotesque and repulsive and DO NOT download unless you want to gain std’s and be shocked from the face of the earth"}},{"id":"6173539886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Byebyebabyfat!","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"One star Trump is no good.","review":"We all want Obama back.
