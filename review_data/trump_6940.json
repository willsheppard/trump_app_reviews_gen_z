As soon as I download it my dog dropped dead right in front of me. I wasn’t sure if it was because of the app so I deleted it and immediately my dog miraculously came back to life! I asked my friend to download it just to see if the same thing happened to her cat and IT DID! Her cat fell right off of the counter and died as soon as the app downloaded. When she deleted it her cat got up and continued walking just like nothing happened. This app is a literal curse and I would not suggest anyone to ever download it!","title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6125220716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-26T19:26:39Z","userName":"Aliyah Monet","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded the app and opened it, I immediately saw the “Welcome to the Trump 2020 Campaign App” Text with President Trump as the background. The picture of our beloved President is not an inviting one, he looks distressed and like he was crying... NOT how I want to see the President of the United States of America. If I wanted to see an emotional President, I would’ve voted for Hillary because she’s a WOMAN! Not to mention the President is seen to be holding his fist up, as if he is a black lives matter supporter! DISGUSTING!!! This app was NOT created by the Patriotic Republican party, but by the radical soft left. ONE STAR.","title":"Not fun to use"}},{"id":"6079978697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-15T19:13:38Z","userName":"Mary Lambart","rating":1,"review":"I thought this app would be as incredible as my beloved DJ. unfortunately there were a lot of mistakes in the writing; bad spelling misinformation etc. I was so shocked to find out that this app didn’t provide me with any important information, like how Donny just made it legal for trans people to be refused health care and other medical services just because of their gender. And as a good Christian I am appalled by his blatant disregard of Jesus’s teachings, like when He said “love all men” and “blessed are the poor”. I didn’t see either of these attitudes reflected in this app. So sad.","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6177889025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:07:46Z","userName":"bob the builder 💅🏻","rating":1,"review":"my brain cells evaporated 😙🤩 oh my god. i got the app, i opened it and there was something saying “keep america great” idk is it really that great where my dad and family have to get stopped at TSA everytime we leave or enter the country in front of every other non person of color cause of our last names and we look sus 🤩🤩🤩 then some cheeto wack orange lookin person was there asking for my number and i was like EW i’m a minor and you’re asking for my number? but that’s nothing new for trump 😌","title":"you did that 💅🏻🤩🧚\u200D♀️ never again 💗🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177730106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:43Z","userName":"hahahhahahahaahah has","rating":1,"review":"U Download this app thinking I would help the community so I downloaded the app and I went to eat an orange and I saw the president face and know I’m traumatized I was hearing things like someone say racist things like “Mexicans are rapist” and I was mad because as a little Hispanic I got offended and like more racist comment I was traumatized and I started getting dizzy and all I can’t see are Cheetos and oranges 🍊🍊🍊🍊 and went reaching for my phone to delete the app and finally the dizzynis went away don’t recommend getting the app unless u want this remember TRUMP 2020 IN JAIL ❤️","title":"Orange 🍊"}},{"id":"6177705516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:12:20Z","userName":"Peace out 37!","rating":1,"review":"I got this app because I was curious to learn about Trumps plans for the future if he were elected again. Oh my GOD was this awful. It took DAYS to download and would crash every time I had to reload the page. After a few days I got rid of it because of the horrible connection but I still kept getting spam emails from it. Not only did I get little information on his vision for a next term, I learned that I disagree with MANY of his political opinions and he is a disgrace to the American image. #Biden2020","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6177663140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:59:08Z","userName":"Martha 🐕","rating":1,"review":"I’m very disappointed in this app. I was looking forward to having it to keep myself updated because I love trump. I am a mom of 3 so I can not just keep constantly watching the news I thought this was the way to go. It was completely unorganized and took up way to much storage. It kept crashing and making my phone turn of randomly. I deleted the app and my phone was fine again. I completely do not understand . Thank you for your time have a tremendous day!","title":"Do not get it’s very bad"}},{"id":"6177576969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:31:25Z","userName":"tiktok madd me do it","rating":1,"review":"This app was complete trash as soon as I I opened the app I saw an 🩳🍑ORANGE📙 trash face I honestly downloaded this to see his plans for 2020 but I truly got scared of this app it made me feel so disgusting and it made me want to shower after I just got out of the shower and as I was looking more into the app I saw an ugly pickly orange 🍊 I had so much regrets going through my head while this weird app was downloading and this is why I think this app should not be in the App Store  I have never felt so demolished while downloading this pickley app 🤮","title":"It’s Britney sis  tiktok made me"}},{"id":"6177535179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:18:12Z","userName":"ded.chump","rating":1,"review":"this app kept on crashing when i tried to open it and nothing would load. I’m positive it’s not just my wifi or my phone because everything else on my phone is working fine. I got the app because i wanted to be updated on the stupid stuff out “president” was up to, but it wouldn’t work. And when it finally did load, the app was just confusing and difficult to navigate, and that’s coming from a youngster who’s very experienced with technology!","title":"This is a terrible app."}},{"id":"6177510073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:10:22Z","userName":"xxThicMaddiexx","rating":1,"review":"I’ve been on tiktok for most of my life, ever sense i was 6 and I’m 13 now. Ever since musically first opened I was on the app. And this is not freaking fair that other people have to be punished all because China is banning it. All of my freaking memories are on that app. And now there all going to be gone, and Yes I did only get this app to write this. We’ve don’t nothing wrong but use tiktok during quarantine to cure our boredom, but oh well we will all just switch to another platform or we will find another way of using tiktok :)","title":">:("}}]}
