It was terrible! I just want to keep up with our wonderful tangerine of a president! When the app finally downloaded it wouldn’t even open! I knew what I had to do so I said goodbye to my family and decided to travel the world to find the perfect WiFi in order to run the app. I couldn’t stand to be uneducated! With only the clothes on my back and my cellular phone I began my journey. After two years I finally got a clue. I was walking down the street when someone asked if I was searching for the WiFi. Excited, I said yes and they brought me to an underground lair. This is when I had to join a secret society of scholars. Once I went through the 37 trials of hardship as initiation, they finally let me in, I had to get a tattoo as proof. I entered the library of the scholars and found a book with a map showing me to the strongest WiFi. I hurriedly left to go there. When I arrived, I discovered it was on the top of an active volcano. With a deep breath I decided to climb to the top to get the WiFi. At last I could open the app. I tapped the screen and an error alert showed up. I needed to update the app. I dropped down to my knees in sorrow, and went to the App Store. The app has been updating ever since. My family thinks I’m becoming too obsessed and is worried about me. I reluctantly agreed to go to therapy. After a month of that my therapist recommended I deleted this app. This is my final goodbye. I warn you not to download or this could happen to you. In fact, it probably will. Again I repeat, this is the worst app ever. It ruined my life. 😭😭😢","date":"2020-07-09T21:00:15Z","userName":"Ddarlin2015"}},{"id":"6178223756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Digusting","rating":1,"review":"I just didn’t like it at all it made me cringe downloading it","date":"2020-07-09T20:59:21Z","userName":"tifromthehood"}},{"id":"6178211054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Tik tok","rating":1,"review":"This app is so glitchy and it makes my phone crash so bad it’s vary bad and yes","date":"2020-07-09T20:54:50Z","userName":"your moms botty hole"}},{"id":"6178210024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Spam","rating":1,"review":"All it did was spam my email","date":"2020-07-09T20:54:28Z","userName":"VOETE.
