It makes my phone have a seizure every time I open it. Not only that but I think there are subliminal messages within the app to make you believe things that aren’t true. Everyone around me said I didn’t make sense and that was only after I downloaded this app. On top of that, it will get you bullied. If anyone is ever looking at my phone or borrows my phone they immediately gag upon seeing that this app is downloaded on my phone. Then they call me terrible names and say they want nothing to do with me. A terrible app overall, just vote Biden instead.❤️😙✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Piece of trash"}},{"id":"6174634328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"notforthecheetoman","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:50Z","review":"This app took all of quarantine to download. Once it opened I saw this VERY large orange Cheeto man. He was running closer and closer me through the phone! I dropped it in fright and almost shattered my screen! I opened the app again hoping it wouldn’t happen again and luckily it didn’t. I continued to explore the app when all of the sudden a large picture of the orange Cheeto man staring into my soul appeared on my screen! I was so scared I got nightmares for the entirety of the next week! All in all I believe this app should be under the horror genre and I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this app. (Especially for people with a brain who are eligible to vote)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"NOT A GOOD APP!!!"}},{"id":"6174505497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"penelope--k","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:17Z","review":"i opened the app to see someone holding their fist up in the air. i couldn’t tell because his face seemed to be really orange. isn’t this the donald trump app i expected him on the front cover. this caused me to write the review. i also have a couple concerns when i opened the app my cat 🐈 started flying across the room. then he scratched my Trump 2020 flag. it’s ok tho its not like i like trump at all. my main concern was that my cat was flying and my plants tried to eat me luckily i survived. so i would highly recommend not downloading the app because it will do crazy things. also don’t vote for him because if he can barely run an app he can barley run a country again. ( you know cause he kinda messed up this year a lot). ok and last thing i just want to type a whole bunch of emojis just for fun to type a whole bunch of emojis \n\n🦍\n\n🌵\n\n🌾\n\nthanks that was a ton of fun. DONT VOTE FOR TRUMP AND DONT USE THIS APP THANKS IT WILL DO CRAZY THINGS \n\nCRAZY THING \n\nC R A.

I have deleted the app and wouldn’t recommend this to anyone not even my worst enemy. When I first opened the app it kept crashing and broke my phone. When I fixed my phone I tried to open the app again. When I did this I found a picture of a disgusting cheeto all sweaty and I could smell the picture and it smelled of wet dog. I closed the app and reopened it and this time it showed another picture of a Cheeto in a bikini I am scarred for life and can never unsee it. 🤮🤮🤮 Dont download the app people.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6174468061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alex808f","date":"2020-07-09T01:30:43Z","review":"When i first opened the app, i noticed that Trump is standing in front of the American flag with his right fist up. However, isn't he the same person that destroyed America? He's the same person that enforced laws and regulations to discriminate against diverse minority groups and he waited till the last minute to handle the pandemic, doing poorly when he began handling it. I don't think it's fair for him to have an app where he can expand his platform when he's clearly unfit to be president of the United States. This app is a waste of everybody's time and it's disrespectful to the groups that he's discriminated against.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The Worst App I've Ever Gotten"}},{"id":"6174454513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️✨✨✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T01:26:38Z","review":"this app is gross🧚\u200D♀️ i opened it and there was a oversized potato assaulting a carrot i went to my home screen and saw my wallpaper had been changed to the same photo 🥕🥊🥔 then i looked at my walls and it was covered in potato’s harassing carrots so i leave my room and find one of my fish turned into a potato and my dog turned into a carrot and my fish was attacking my dog 😱 then i walk outside and it’s raining potato’s attacking carrots 🥕 i immediately ran back inside and hid under my bed i come out to go to my pantry and realized the only food in the pantry are potato’s and carrots!! i was like this is revolting so i ran to the store and they only had potato’s 🥔 and carrots 🥕 i was like well now i’m forced to be on a diet so i took a hike in the woods and you won’t believe it! there were at least 200 potato’s attacking carrots!!! i am revolted by this app it changed my life forever 🤯 anyways hope this didn’t happen to anyone else 😌🥕🥕🥊🥔💅🏻🥰🤯🥵😱✨✨✨🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"carrots?"}},{"id":"6174449987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leiajung","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:16Z","review":"when i got this app i loved cheetos, especially mr president cheeto😁✨ my pink alpaca 🦙named ms bobby😻 also loved mr president cheeto and we always danced around the tré🌲🤩 listening to xue hua piao piao😼😹and chanting our devotion to our cheeto president👺🥵. but yesterday i downloaded this horrible😡app✨and the first thing i saw was a picture of mr cheeto’s croissant 🥐 while he got spray tanned!!!😡😡😡 that’s when i knew🤔 that his orange 🍊 cheetoness was all fake!!!!! 🤬😭😰 i was so upset😾 that i used the app to text mr cheeto and tell him how disappointed ☹️😔 the picture made me and how i didn’t want to sing 🎶😩 the cheeto ritual anymore. but just 2 hours after i sent the message, mr cheeto🥵 showed up to the tré🌲🍃🌳 and flashed his croissant 🥐 at ms bobby😻 the pink alpaca 🦙 ms bobby was so traumatized that she went blind and had a heart attack💔 on the spot😧. mr president cheeto was coming towards me but i didn’t care anymore😭😭 i buried ms bobby today, and i will never sing around the tré🌳🍃 for mr cheeto again😔","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"mr cheeto is a murderer🤬🤬🤬🤬"}},{"id":"6174317547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"135Rose","date":"2020-07-09T00:43:36Z","review":"Oh my god. If it was possible to give negative stars, I would. First off, why does a freaking ugly fat Cheeto of a person have a whole app dedicated for them to inflate their ego and try to convince themself that they actually have a brain. Ew 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 Secondly, the app is as terrible as the person. The pictures are honestly disturbing and nauseating. Lastly, the incredible amount of misinformation is on this app is completely astonishing. It’s even worse that all these people are being brainwashed and manipulated by this waste of space walking spray tan. Ugh. Please remove this app from the AppStore in order to better society. Thank you.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Remove App NOW"}},{"id":"6174314430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"aaronwarner","date":"2020-07-09T00:42:32Z","review":"This just wasn’t it. I logged in and it it attacked me. Absolutely unbelievable, I cannot express how much this app has ruined my life. This app is toxic, not good for the world. It’s 2020, time to cancel toxic apps. I feel oppressed, disgusted, and just absolute terror. It called my dog a rat, I’ll have you know it is well reputable dog. The customer service was awful. This apps customer service could never compare to Dunder Mifflin's Paper Company customer service. I rate it 1 stars and I’ll do it again (bop bop bop). This app has run its course  🥰 straight into hell😊✨🧚. This doesn’t get fixed, I’ll go super Karen on everyone.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The toxicity in this app is astronomical"}},{"id":"6174311597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ERP17","date":"2020-07-09T00:41:34Z","review":"This app is the worst. Terrible quality, doesn’t do what it’s supposed to, whoever made it must have no qualifications/experience. I would leave a zero star review if I could. This app does not deserve any stars. I hate everything about this app. I would not recommend it to anyone. To anyone reading this, download the app and see for yourself. Once you download it, you’ll know how terrible it is. Then you can leave a nice long one star review like me. If you have half a brain, you’ll see that this app is trash. To the App Store, please remove this app. It should not be in the App Store. It is a terrible app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible"}}]}
