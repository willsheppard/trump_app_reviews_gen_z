My phone was immediately wiped upon opening for the first time.

I must go hide in my bunker!\" whispered the goblin that lives on stolen land.\n\nI looked at the goblin; it had an very evil look in its eye. I loved my brothers and sisters. I did not want the monstrous goblin to take anymore from them. Especially, the ones that have gone through to much.\n\nI examined the dull,ugly, goblin. I studied it’s cowardly ways, which ranted like a in titled, uneducated, spoiled brat.\n\nThen I remembered time will come when the goblin will rule no more. All stolen things will be rightfully given back. \n\nHail no more for Donald Trump will cease to exist. \n\n💫✨💕🧚🏽\u200D♀️Love💕🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💫 Not, we hate you!💕✨💫🧚🏽\u200D♀️\n\nGEN Z🥰😍😘😘😘"}},{"id":"6175113047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:43:27Z","rating":1,"title":"SCARY","userName":"vinylemo","review":"so i went to support out president when i noticed how he disrespects women’s day his child doesn’t support him. so i open the app and for the next WEEK my phone was messing up. awful app. my niece open it thinking it was a game and now she won’t touch my phone and paranormal activity keep happening in my house!! awful!!!!"}}]}
