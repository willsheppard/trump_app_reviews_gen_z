When it FINALLY started working I opened it only for it to glitch constantly. I have read previous reviews about how only immature underage children are making these claims which is entirely false I support my president 🟠 fully and will be voting 🧚🏾💅🏿✨ I also secured some tickets to his rally, unfortunately I had to water the McDonald’s parking lot. Totally hope my president 🐷🥕 understands as he is very busy worrying about taking down apps instead of other things. Like black lives matter, who is she 🙈 and human rights for the lgbtqia+ we don’t know her 👁—👁. Anyways, hope you guys fix the errors 😴, you can find me in the McDonald’s parking lot 👅💋"}},{"id":"6173343036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"doritocheeto","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:51:46Z","title":"God awful do not download","review":"First off the app took three months to download and when it finally did me and my family were out to dinner and right when I opened it music started playing and all the waiters and chefs started singing a musical number we thought it was a joke but at the end they went crazy and started stabbing people. Me and my family were beyond scared for are lives so we ran out the back. Every one who survived tried to call the police but they were to busy killing black people and getting away with it. And I went back into the app and deleted it and most things went back to normal but me and my family are emotionally scared. And we still haven’t been out to eat since. And if something similar has happened to you or your family members I’m am so sorry."}},{"id":"6173299233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lovly3000","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:12Z","title":"disgusting.","review":"this app is horrible!! it made my phone an utter and complete mess. it started messing with the files i didn’t know the app could reach. also the president is a pedo and a racist little brat soooo and all of trumps supporters can’t argue with us cause their only comeback is “tRuMp 2020” like bro shut up if you don’t know what you’re saying. anyway i don’t understand why so many people like this cheeto of a president. he is \n🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨ D I S G U S T I N G  ✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️\ni am truly astonished that people still want to vote for him after these four years of hell. like how would you still want him in office after him being exposed for being a rapist???? do you not have kids??? the kids he did that to have families, parents. and if you’re a parent but still support him go get help please and thank you. \nThank you for coming to my Ted talk✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️🥰💕🥴"}},{"id":"6173220432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"opo Huntington","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:11:24Z","title":"terrifying app😭😤😱🤬","review":"i downloaded this app to see what the hype was about this orange man 🥕🥕 but t took HOURS AND HOURS to download and as soon as it did little orange minions started coming out of my phone attacking me yelling TRUMP 2020!!

It began happening even when I didn’t have the app open! It was so embarrassing! Then when I tried to delete the app to stop this from happening, my entire phone shut off and started blaring Trump saying “YOU’RE FIRED”. Now all I want to do is live my life in peace so I ended up throwing my phone into the incinerator, but the second I threw it into the flames it came zooming back out. It now has a flaming Cheeto on the front and it has changed to saying “COVFEFE”. I don’t know what to do anymore, it completely has a mind of its own. It doesn’t want to be contradicted and acts like a child, throwing temper tantrums whenever I tell it to burn in hell. And this is all because of the app!😡🤬"}},{"id":"6173037383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Princess+Serenitae","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:12:44Z","title":"baddie but without the bad ✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","review":"This app traumatized me. I downloaded it to keep up with the news about my president (kinda like Keeping Up With The Kardashians but with more lies and drama 🤭), but then something really traumatic happened to me. I was chilling in a pool while going through the app and I was really focused on it because of the dark mind control spells in the app (which is VERY unhealthy for you). Since I was so focused, I didn’t notice that there was a man who painted himself blue and sat at the bottom of the pool to blend in just waiting to grab my ankles. When that happened, I had a panic attack and almost drowned. I’m still traumatized and refuse to make contact with any water. It’s been a couple days since I’ve drank water. I don’t have much longer to live so I’m writing this review with my dying breath to warn you guys of the danger."}},{"id":"6172983416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cheryhatestheupdate","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:56:13Z","title":"YOU GUYS ARE STALKING ME!?🤬😱🟠","review":"I got this app to see why everyone could like such an orange like YOU🤢 I entered it and a red light turned on my camera😨 I didn’t think much of it until my Alexa went off and started saying “TRUMP 2020!” 🤮🤮 so then I immediately ran downstairs cause I was SO frightened😮😦 I thought it was all done until I saw MELENIA TRUMP OUTSIDE MY DOOR!!🤭 i then said to her “come here I’ll save you and your kids from Trump!

When I opened the app it started glitching but I didn’t think anything of it, but an hour after using the app my phone wouldn’t even turn off! It was stuck on this stupid app!! My brother’s friend is a tech geek so he tried fixing my phone and after a few days my phone FINALLY started working again but it still has a few glitches.\n1. Every time I get a text my phone screams “BUILD THE WALL”\n2. Almost every time I use the letter “k” in a work it autocorrects to add three “k”s. Ex.) “amerikkka”\n3. (This is the worst yet) IT CHANGED MY HOME AND LOCK SCREEN TO A PICTURE OF TRUMP’S FACE!!! I can’t find a way to change it back, I’ve tried everything!! \nI’ll have to buy a new phone sometime soon and I’m for sure gonna vote that 🍊 out of office."}},{"id":"6172863928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cheetoh hater 🤬","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:16Z","title":"Dear cheetoh 🤪","review":"Hi cheetoh🤪 this app was ✨HORRIBLE✨ when I downloaded the app, I heard a knock at my door and there was GIANT cheetoh just sitting on the steps😰 I took it inside because it was raining and I did not want it to get soggy 😌When I brought it inside and gave it a warm blanket and tea, it started talking about so many homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist, xenophobic, and other horrible things. It started getting louder as it spoke, screaming words that no human ,in his case thing, should ever say! He was screaming so loud that all his spray tan....i mean cheetoh dust started flying off. Some even got in my mouth 🤢\nSo, I decided that enough was enough, I deleted the app and poof...he disappeared! It left cheetoh dust all over the floor and it took me HOURS too scrape all of it off my floor 😡  This was a very traumatic experience! I have never eaten or even looked at a bag of Cheetos the same😱"}}]}
