Three days later I wake up from the coma just to open my phone and seeing siri forcefully delete the app leaving a message saying that she couldn’t handle an app with so much cancerous content in it.

As I opened the app I was quickly facing a naked hot Cheeto bald headed rotting expired mole rat. Just as my pupils slowly disintegrated, I came to realization that it was just our president ✨🤡🧚🏽\u200D♀️.
