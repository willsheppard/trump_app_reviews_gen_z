Awful App experience and had to delete immediately. Takes up way too much storage on your phone and freezes up. If there was a negative 5 star value option I would click it so hard I'd break my phone.","date":"2020-07-08T17:30:12Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173089118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cornelius the lll","isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me foot fungus 🤬","review":"I was excited when it downloaded but when I opened the app it threatened to give me COVID-19 so I kindly said no. Then it glitched my phone causing the screen to freeze and said to vote for trump. I am highly offended because that wrinkled tangerine is highly racist and homophobic but his sewer rat fans say “he’s not the best with words”. Long story short trump is a horrible president and I hope that him and his little fans swim to the bottom of the ocean with no gear. Anyways this message is for trump and his supporters, \nyou’re so confident 🌈✨🥰 you shouldn’t be 💖🧚\u200D♀️🍯\n\nLove,\n\n  Your local toe hair\n\nP.S BLACK LIVES MATTER BLACK LIVES MATTER BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","date":"2020-07-08T17:29:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173068589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"janessababy","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"Downloaded this app in shortly after had explosive diarrhea🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻 my dog came into the room and told me that Cheeto man was at the door so I went to the door and there he was just standing there so I offered him a drink 🥃 of course I served him the finest Windex in the cabinet after a cup or two he yelled at me because I’m black and ya after that we did drugs so In conclusion I still have diarrhea 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰","date":"2020-07-08T17:22:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173062997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mia jt 28","isEdited":false,"title":"‼️DON’T DOWNLOAD‼️","review":"Throughout the past few months I have been hearing about how “great” our president is. And honestly I wasn’t seeing it. So I attempted to download this app to see what others were seeing. It took forever to download, and it shut down my phone for half an hour. I would have thought our president’s app would have worked better. DON’T DOWNLOAD‼️","date":"2020-07-08T17:20:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173035619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jessthedress","isEdited":false,"title":"Really bad.","review":"So, I checked to see if America had gotten “great again,” and was extremely disappointed. Appears things are much worse, and Donald Trump is just a narcissistic, sexist, racist, manipulative, lying idiot. So, I did delete this app after double checking. I don’t think this country can handle any more of this shoddy leadership (if you can even call it leadership).","date":"2020-07-08T17:12:12Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173027010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tayah Wilson Breh","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting","review":"This app broke my phone due to the disgusting and disrespectful content on this app now I’m getting a new IPhone because of Trumps app. If he really wants to ban other apps he should think about deleting this one first he put my eyes and ears through burning agony because of his nonsense. It also caused my cat to go brain dead when I listened to one of his rallies on this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173013678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bellamaggiesadie22","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!!!!!!","review":"if i could give it zero starts i would. this app is glitching so much and doesn’t even work. i’m not surprised as to why it has 2 stars. i wanted to learn more abt our president but i couldn’t due to all the glitching. it’s not like you can even fix it the glitching is so bad it even messed up my phone. i deleted it right away.

I hate to say it but I can no longer say I’m a trump supporter. The app seems just .  . . With lack of better words, confused. And it’s confusing as well. Layout and navigation are difficult, and I don’t want to be brainwashed by bogus information.","date":"2020-07-08T17:00:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172972639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"joeyp03","isEdited":false,"title":"STINKY🤢","review":"I originally downloaded the app to keep track of the obese carrot’s plans. When i woke up the next morning to visit trump and his trumplings on the app i witnessed a horrible stench coming from my phone. It smelled a little something like spray tan and cheeto dust. I was in AWE😱but i kept the app. But it happened AGAIN only this time it smelled like fish and unwashed BALLS🤮i have never been this disappointed🤧","date":"2020-07-08T16:52:53Z","rating":1}}]}
