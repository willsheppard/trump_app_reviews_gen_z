Once i clicked download it took over a month to download which i think is outrageous for an app that is suppose to be professional. After it downloaded i click on the app just for it to ask to use my camera and then a guy popped up just to cuss me out and make fun of me. He said I look like a “special person” and then he mad me cry. I asked for him to stop, but he didnt. He repeatedly mocked my dead family and said i should die. Is this what you call an app? This app is the most horrible app i have ever seen. Whats the point? After i had a mental breakdown from the traumatizing bullying i went through the app just to find tons of wrong information about the president. It said he was a 54 year old slim Caucasian with an 8 pack. It also said he was 112 pounds which is clearly wrong. It had a lot of misleading information like, “If you vote for Trump you will get a million dollars.” I find that very wrong and miss leading. There were a lot of bots as-well commenting saying very weird things. For example: A guy named Abor Chion said he loves our president and said he is an amazing president that is not rascist and loves all people. Thats so weird... it almost sounds like its donald j trump writing those awfully wrong comments. At the end of it all i backed out of the app and it brought me back to the app and then sent out an amber alert with my house on it and the police came and arrested me for “child endangerment” It took 4 weeks of court to get out of that. Very horrible app and j hate it. \n-love joe \nTrump 2020 on a grave 😻","title":"Very horrible @justjoethehoe on tiktok","rating":1,"userName":"afraid against"}},{"id":"6173733856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:37Z","review":"this app is so slow it took up almost all the storage on my phone and kept glitching out and now my phone has multiple viruses on it and i need to buy a new one because of this it made it so my phone can’t make any calls or texts to android phones this is the worst app of 2020","title":"so glitchy","rating":1,"userName":"k_ier"}},{"id":"6173733359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:25Z","review":"This app took a full month to finish downloading, and in that time it somehow managed to give my phone every single virus that could possibly exist. I downloaded this app to save my marriage to my 12th husband, and instead this app summoned President Donald J. Trump to my front door, where he proceeded to peg my husband right in front of me. My poor children saw the entire thing, and they haven’t stopped crying in six days. I thought that the President shamelessly porking my beloved 12th husband on the front porch would have been the end of the ordeal, but sorely mistaken was I; I woke up one morning to see President Donald J. Trump licking my long, slender, juicy toes. My feet, now permanently stained a horrific shade of orange, reek of carbohydrates and white supremacy, and now my children refuse to be in the same house as me. They’ve kicked me out, and now I’m living alone under a bridge. My only companions are the flies, whom I’ve allowed to live rent free in my ass. All this pain, all this suffering, all because of this app. This horrid app that I had hoped would save my marriage to my 12th husband. I could not have asked for a worse app. Utter garbage indeed.","title":"Ruined my life","rating":1,"userName":"Sexy Sid the Sloth"}},{"id":"6173733032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:18Z","review":"Absolute poop","title":"Absolute poop","rating":1,"userName":"ksoskepd"}},{"id":"6173733006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:17Z","review":"Great👍grandma👵🏾you😊always🥰know🤨just😜what😳to😉say😆hogdthffjtdjfdhjfgfjkggdhjchffffhfy✨e a c r i s t m a s✨jjfsagedbhhht","title":"Very no cool","rating":1,"userName":"miagacha10148"}},{"id":"6173732745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:11Z","review":"as soon as got the app i started to poop big amounts of green noodles","title":"?!?!","rating":1,"userName":"pasteldiamond"}},{"id":"6173732580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:08Z","review":"First the orange piece of trash has a terrible app because it’s all about his orange ass.
