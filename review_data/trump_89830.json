And then it’s came back down and proceeded to say “All lives matter” so then I was done with the app and was going to delete it ASAP. But then it wouldn’t let me delete it. After that my phone started walking towards my dog and then it body slammed my dog. Then it picked up my dog and threw it out the window. There was a car coming and my phone pushed it in the road. My dog died 😞. So I then grabbed my phone and proceeded to throw it in the garbage but my phone stopped me by pushing me away. So then we fought....the phone won. And he proceeded to kill my WHOLE family. At this point I was tied up with tape over my mouth and sitting on the floor. The phone started walking towards me with a knife and right when he was going to stab me...GRU CAME IN!! GRU came in and kicked my phone to the ground. He took the knife and got on top my my phone, he then cut my phones neck and told it to delete the app..or else. I was relieved!! But then Donald the orange duck that doesn’t know how to understand that BLACK LIKES MATTER Trump came in. The 🍊and GRU fought for a long time. During the time I was untying my hands and feet. I sneaked into the kitchen, got a pan and knocked the 🍊out. KO. We tied him up and threatened him. But then my phone came alive again. And kicked me in the back, I fell to the floor. GRU then murdered my phone and helped me up. We threw the 🍊 in the dumpster and walked away. We soon then got married on the beach and had 58 children 🤗. But anyways this app is HORRIBLE.","date":"2020-07-08T20:11:48Z"}},{"id":"6173570258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Customer service was a nasty one!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHC","review":"I AM SO UPSET BY THIS APP.
