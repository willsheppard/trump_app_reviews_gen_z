After I opened the app my phone was flooded with messages from some child trying to get me to sign his birthday card, I texted him back and told him that I was very sorry nobody wanted to wish him a happy birthday and that it should be his parents responsibility to make him happy on his birthday!!! Overall I did not enjoy this app and I now have to see my therapist twice a week instead of once bc of all the nightmares I’ve been having with the Oompa Loompa in them.\nXoxo Martha","title":"Horrible😤","userName":"martha💦✨👄","date":"2020-07-09T12:36:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176508096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My phone starting having cramps after downloading this app. I guess my phone is female too so it was not in support of this app. In addition, my phone starting heating up and blanking out. I later saw a notice across my screen stating “BLACK LIVES MATTER! PHONE CANNOT OPERATE WITH TRUMP APPLICATION. Please try later”. I ended up deleting the app and surprisingly my phone has not given me any more issues. I think this app is connected to a virus.... like the coronavirus 😔 weird how the virus associated with an app owned by a man child who allowed the coronavirus to spread across the US and called it a hoax. Anyways, BLACK LIVES MATTER!!! 😊","title":"Worst app ever!!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!!\nAnother thing- when you first sign into the app it asks you if you would like notifications from this app so I said yes because I love our president. The app started sending me inappropriate messages with cuss words and more inappropriate things. 0/10 I would not get this app again. Terrible. I wish I could put a 0 star rating.","title":"DO NOT GET!!","userName":"Jammer 😁","date":"2020-07-09T11:55:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176366477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","title":"The fitness grahampacer test","userName":"error 1563","date":"2020-07-09T11:54:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176258146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I download this app because I curious about it then I realized I did not understood anything so I delete..... after that I hear a noise on the window then I realized it was the FBI then BOOM BOOM they throw a bomb a BOMB.. we didn’t know what to do and then they were starting to SHOT at us.... we ran out to out basement and we saw a rat a RAT we started screaming and unfortunately they found us then my dad acted quick and he throw some water melons and tomatoes then they start to abort the mission then my dad is our hero and the FBI never came back because they are scared now so don’t download the app because that might happen to you as well","title":"Trash","userName":"Figueroa369","date":"2020-07-09T11:23:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176171284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You are probably wondering if you should download this app or not. let me tell you what happened to me when I decided to download this app in order to support my woman loving, non-racist, non-homophobic, non-sexist, non- misogynistic president🧚\u200D♂️ This took DaYs to download! Hacked my data and destroyed my phone! Like this was NOT enough, now my  house is haunted!!! This is ALL because of this cursed app! Electronics in the house  randomly shut down, few seconds later they turn back on only to show “Trump 2020” on the screen!!!. I already called Sam and Dean and they are on their way to cleanse my house. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GUYS. SAVE URSELFS.

I will never be opening this app again. After I exited the ad, it had a threat for my dog to go missing if I didn’t vote trump 2020. He had ads for Cheetos, I know why... The app asked for ALL my information, and I kept getting boxes of Cheetos in the mail, with a spray tan bottle, that I NEVER ordered. I also kept getting charged when I tried to open the app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT GIVES YOU A VIRUS THAT GOES STRAIT TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AND CHARGES FOR CHEETOS AND SPRAY TAN. I will never be downloading an app like this again. Very unprofessional. I 0/10 recommend.","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE🤢😬","userName":"sammy200726","date":"2020-07-09T10:11:23Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176003633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Today i woke up and opened the facebook app this morning, and my loving neighbor suzie💕, suggested that I download this app. The downloading time was completely horrendous (3 hours🤬🤬), but me being a christian & a big supporter of Mr. Donna😍, decided to overlook that fact. Once I proceeded to open up the app, my phone froze and went pitch black!!! I tried to turn it back on, I even put it in rice, but nothing worked. 😔I am highly disappointed Mr. Trump, this app is just a scam to hack your phone and take all of your information!! $800 down the drain. My lawyer will be in touch, & we will be expecting compensation.

Then like two days later, these agents came to my house and said that trump had sent them to look at my birth certificate. When I handed it to them they ripped it up and sprinkled it on top of my head like confetti and said “you don’t exist anymore <3” and when I asked about how they were able to say “<3” out loud they hit me with a “yeah❤️” and drove away running over favorite garden gnome named gaspacho","title":"Not a good app","userName":"Xue🥶Hua🧚Piao😻","date":"2020-07-09T09:59:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175828687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was told that all gen z kids who download this app get free tacos but there was a huge firewall i couldn’t get passed. then i saw this big orange thumb on my screen and threw my phone across the room. sadly the phone didn’t make it and i blame the app for this one fellas. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. i will not vote for this because of the service and frankly because of the racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic “man” behind it. i would give this zero stars if i could. i was not impressed. for someone who has plenty of money to throw away this was terrible quality and DID NOT make the cut. apple, baby, you know what you gotta do :)","title":"zero stars","userName":"dumpity trumpity","date":"2020-07-09T09:05:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
