She wanted me to vote Biden. But I downloaded this app just to check it out. And it was horrible. My wife was going through my phone and saw the app. She immediately started yelling at me. I still thought I was fine. Then she opened the app and saw how bad it looks. She yelled not only do you support a horrible person but an app worth bad design. She then walked out the door. That was last week."}},{"id":"6172782643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made My Toilet Clog","userName":"Clicking Master","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:55:37Z","rating":1,"review":"I was just minding my business signing up for this app when I suddenly had use the bathroom. I went to the bathroom and I proceeded to sign up for this app. Then I saw Donald Trump‘s face and it made me vomit. Not just any type of vomit projectile vomit. Fortunately I was quick enough to turn around and vomit in my toilet but now my toilet is clogged. I still have not received my second stimulus check so I do not have the funds to fix my toilet right now."}},{"id":"6172762681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ruined my phone","userName":"alexcomerson","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:56Z","rating":1,"review":"When I tried to download the app it took over two hours to completely be installed. But then my phone started glitching and the next day it completely shut off. Took it to Apple support and they said the app was corrupted. They were able to get my phone on again, but it was full of pornographic images and none of the apps worked. Had to buy a completely new phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."}},{"id":"6172692617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Would give zero stars if I could","userName":"Eraveni","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:30:00Z","rating":1,"review":"Almost a few minuets after downloading the app I experienced a ton of glitching- my phones key board wasn't working properly, I couldn’t open the app— and when I could, I’d be kicked off a few seconds later. Whoever made this app really should have spent more time in fixing these bugs before letting the public use it. Im deleting this app - one of the most glitchiest apps I’ve ever downloaded!"}},{"id":"6172678773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusted","userName":"karens app reviews","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:26:07Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app for my son, who wanted to learn more about politics. After a few short minutes of having the app, my son began to scream in fear. I took the phone from him to see what was causing this behavior. I was absolutely DISGUSTED when I saw a nude photo of Trump on the screen. Is this his entire campaign? Showing nude photos in hopes people will vote for him? That is unacceptable. My door knob is bigger than the Presidents penis. Take a hint, Bunker Boy, we don’t want you anymore."}},{"id":"6172661937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hdiebdjdbdh","userName":"jkrnchdkdnfnf","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:21:22Z","rating":1,"review":"I honestly don’t like the idea that this app is being used to track location, and I also don’t like the idea of having to reach out it could take info from us and fellow supporters. Now I get that you guys might want to contact us I don’t think it is that necessary. And to have us PUT OUR PHONE NUMBER IN SHEESH i don’t like it btw imma Karen 😌✌️✨✨. I also don’t like how you disrespect all these different Hispanics #HISPANICLIVESMATTER and the fact you disrespect it makes me mad!"}},{"id":"6172650986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Orange Man🍊","userName":"ttfreckles","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:18:18Z","rating":1,"review":"To start this app took weeks to download, it was horrible waiting that long. Once I finally had gotten the app the lemon tree in my backyard started growning 🍊’s. I tried to stop it but it soon filled my whole backyard with 🍊’s, it didn’t end up stopping until a jet flew over my house blowing it off the ground. Little did I know it was the main 🍊 himself. I couldn’t believe it I got this app for him and now I’m homeless because of it! This app is cursed DO NOT GET IT!"}},{"id":"6172650148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wow trump","userName":"Madixsonrae","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:18:04Z","rating":1,"review":"Ok first off don’t get the app bc trump was joking about hurting little girls when he is a sex trafficker and homophobic he need to leave we need Michelle Obama or Biden who ever likes trump go ahead download the app but then poor water into ur eyes wit some soap and also he’s really racist and he was talking abt putting Hispanics in cages cause there “monkeys” when there human and also talking abt slavery again which we are not living another 4 years with getting stabbed in the back so #BIDEN2020 screw trump DONT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6172626441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Death","userName":"all countrys matter","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:11:19Z","rating":1,"review":"I first downloaded this app to try and understand our president. It would only stay open for one second and then it would crash. My phone started to grow an image of a wall across its screen and all of the words I tried to type autocorrected to racial slurs. Then my phone caught all of the symptoms of corona virus and it died probably because it refused to wear a mask. It then gave the virus to all of my family and I am the only one left."}},{"id":"6172567291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏽 such a very disappointing app i must say🧚🏿\u200D♂️","userName":"gen z 🧚🏽🧚🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:54:57Z","rating":1,"review":"This app was such a major disappointment🧚🏻\u200D♀️ it took over 4 hours for it to download on my phone, which i swe is a very common thing with other users✨ All i wanted to see what my amazing president campaign but all that kept popping up was this orange wrinkled man🧚🏽 I really wanted to support my awesome president because he has totally not screwed up the USA✨ Because of this app, I have decided to vote for Kayne West instead🧚🏿\u200D♂️ I DONT RECOMMEND"}}]}
