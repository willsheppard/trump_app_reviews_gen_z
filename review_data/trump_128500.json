terrible DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! 😚\nfirst off it asked me for my number which i find really sus considering he’s married but whatever. i gave him my number anyway so he could hmu.\nthen he kept messaging me so much like he WOULD NOT STOP 😔 and then i’m thinking to myself “why are you so obsessed with me?” like ik u wanna look as hot as me with ur cheeto face but i can’t just give it away to anyone just like that. no baby that’s not how this works 🥺\nso i blocked him and decided to move forward with the app and explore it 😍 to my horror 🙀 i saw a nasty pic of him PICKING HIS NOSE 🤢 and i fell off the golden gate bridge and onto a white van with a bunch of turkeys in the back 😐 they all said “gobble gobble” and KICKED ME OFF 😡 i did notice they kept playing that “HAHA” song from tiktok in the car tho and we was vibin for a few seconds before they kicked me off 😭 then i rolled off the bridge and into the ocean where I COULD BREATHE and i saw a little mermaid that i recognized 😎 IT WAS THE BLUE MERMAID FROM THAT BARBIE MOVIE WHERE THE FAIRY HAD TO DEFEAT LAVERNA 😻 but then i got sucked into the whirlpool that brought me TO MY HOUSE WITH A MOUSE ON THE ROOF AND WE HAD A TREE HOUSE IN THE BACKYARD 💕💞💓💗💖💘💝 i always wanted a treehouse in the backyard. i don’t even have a backyard ❤️ anyway, i fell on the concrete and broke my ribs, my back, my arms, my legs, and i dislocated my hip 😘 then i went inside and saw my mommy and my friend crimson and we all had some nice lemonade.\nbasically i’m saying i broke almost every single bone in my body because of this ✨s t u p i d✨ app

I’m disgusted by his leadership and how big of an ✨egomaniacal sociopath✨this ✨annoying orange✨is. He does not deserve the right to ban an app that we could use for our ✨entertainment✨.

Don’t waste your time.","userName":"Bunnygirl1224@minecraft","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Writing this review is the last thing I’m ever going to do on my phone before I destroy it. Here’s why. I got this app because I thought it would be funny to help make Trump think that he has more support than he actually does. When I installed it, it instantly gave me an out-of-control virus. A bunch of fat orange sprites popped up on my screen and started wreaking havoc. They deleted my TikTok account and all my cat photos. Then they suddenly disappeared into the maps app, and by the time I opened it, the countries’ names had been changed. America was labelled as “Trump’s Patriotic Utopia” and literally every other country was called “Communist Sh*thole”. They were spraying their pixelated piss everywhere except America. But that’s not even the worst part. The sprites went through all my social media accounts, so they know that I’m part of antifa. I’m terrified that they’re going to show all of their findings to the government and that I’ll be arrested on “domestic terrorism” charges (because apparently, opposing fascism makes me a dangerous terrorist now). The only reason they aren’t preventing me from writing this review and spreading the truth is because I was able to create a diversion by making a nude photo of Melania my wallpaper and leaving them to gawk at it. But it won’t be long before they get bored with her and continue to ravage my phone, so I’m going to destroy it before they can leave the system and report me. Please don’t make the same mistake as me. Find safer ways to troll Trump."}}]}
