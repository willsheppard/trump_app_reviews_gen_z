Seconds after it downloaded, my oven got sick. Poor thing had a fever of 350 degrees for a whole week. During that time, my fridge quit his job, and so did my leftovers, leaving me with Ritz crackers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, about 9 days after downloading the app, a whole colony of bats flew into my living room, demanding cheese. The problem was my fridge had already left by then, leaving me with no cheese. They were furious and decided to kidnap me. They carried me a lengthy distance, and eventually I ended up in their cave as their prisoner. That is where I reside currently, while I continue to attempt at making some cheese negotiations with the bats to set me free. Please, for your own good, do NOT download this app- you will regret it instantly, and these bats are NOT easily forgiving.","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174793972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"u wont be missed❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"nice try but no❤️","review":"basically, this is what happened, it was one in the morning and I was busy trying to get rid of the ants all over my room and drinking milk when I decided I wanted to go on our beloved presidents app to make me feel better🥰 but when I got there i got a bunch of pop ups telling me that mexicans were gross showed on my screen and I find that absolutely disgusting. he was our PRESIDENT. he shouldnt have been condoning an app like this. horrible disgusting app 0/10 I would not recommend for anyone to get. it was so glitchy and had a bunch of pop ups I couldn’t believe how bad this app was considering it’s for the president. it was so sad to see trump go he’ll always be missed, he was a horrible president and a horrible person and I thought this app would be good remembrance but I thought wrong. riptrump2020 we all hated u❤️ fly high🥺","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174769949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"timmytowerrr","isEdited":false,"title":"worst thing ever created 😘😹","review":"i decided to download it because trump is obviously keeping ameriKKKa great so i needed to show my support 🧑\u200D🦲 when i first opened it, my phone glitched like crazy and lines came up on my screen 🍀 then, i put my name in and it decided to show up as “Abor Shawn” which is NOT my name but it’s kind of a good name so i’m not complaining 😼 as i was exploring the app, i got at least 10 notifications in 5 minutes 🙀 then it started saying some nonsense about ameriKKKa 🇺🇸 then it started raining rats on my screen, literally 😦 then my phone glitched and shut off completely 😿 i had to call apple support with my phone and when i got it fixed, i had to call the manager of trump 2020 (on a gravestone 😘) and they said they couldn’t do anything about it! how rude 😐 anyways, don’t get this app, give it a 1 star review and #settleforbiden","date":"2020-07-09T02:58:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174657531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DanDanTheReviewMan","isEdited":false,"title":"All apps matter","review":"Many, many years ago when I was 23\nI was married to a widow who was pretty as can be\nThis widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red\nMy father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed\nThis made my dad my son-in-law and really changed my life\nFor now my daughter was my mother 'cause she was my father's wife\nAnd to complicate the matter even though it brought me joy\nI soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy\nMy little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad\nAnd so he became my uncle though it mad me very sad\nFor if he were my uncle that would also made him brother\nOf the widows grown-up daughter who was of course my stepmother\nFather's wife then had a son who kept them on the run\nAnd he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's son\nMy wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue\nBecause although she is my wife she's my grandmother two\nNow if my wife is my grandmother then I'm her grandchild\nAnd every time I think of it, nearly drives me wild\n'Cause now I have become the strangest case you ever saw\nAs husband of my grandmother I am my own grandpaw\nOh I'm my own grandpaw\nI'm my own grandpaw\nIt sounds funny I know but it really is so\nI'm my own grandpaw\n(Listen to this now)\nI'm my own grandpaw\nI'm my own grandpaw\nI'm my own grandpaw","date":"2020-07-09T02:24:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174636909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"J Parrot","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWLOAD!!!!","review":"I don’t 🙅🏻\u200D♀️ 🚫 know 💭what ❓ I was thinking 🤔 leaving my 🤰 🤱👩\u200D👦 child 🕺💃 behind now I suffer 😩👺 the curse 🧪⚰️ and now 😺 I am blind 🙋\u200D♀️🙋\u200D♀️🙈 with all ⭕️ this anger 😡👿 guilt 🤓😕😟 and sadness 😢😭 coming 👾👊 to haunt 👻👹 me 👤 forever ♾ I can’t wait 🥴 for the cliff 🧃🧃 at the end of the river 🚙💧 is this 😲😲 revenge 😈🥶 I’m seeking 🔦🔎 or seeking 😳🚷 someone 🤩 to avenge me?????

Which made me pee A LOT. Then I decided to play with some dolls cause I was really bored. Then I ate a French toast bagel for lunch because I DESERVE IT. I also had some chocolate and a nectarine. Then around 4:35 I left my house to go to a running club. I was terrified because my running skills aren’t that great. We did uphill sprints today and I’m still very sore. I actually was really close to puking during the cool down. Anyway this app was incredibly OFFENSIVE. I never wanted to see a naked Cheeto but...I SAW A NAKED CHEETO. awful. Horrendous. I am a straight, woman, member of the lgbtq+ community, single father, grandmother that found this app truly disgusting. MY PET ALIEN HATED IT AND WASNT COUNTED IN THE 2020 CENSUS. Talk about inclusion. Anyway I’m going to watch mr bean and avoid talking to my friends cause I think they all hate me :) hate this app. It MUST be deleted.","date":"2020-07-09T01:00:00Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174168480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"skurt skurt skurt","isEdited":false,"title":"SHE WAS SENT TO THE HOSPITAL??!! ( NOT CLICKBAIT)","review":"I saw this app was downloaded and I didn’t remember downloading it so I opened to take a little looksy. But what I saw was horrifying. It was little bunker boy. I know this sounds crazy already butting gets even crazier. I immediately started profusely vomiting and bleeding out of my eyes. When my family heard all the ruckas they came rushing in and saw my phone and the picture on it. They all started profusely vomiting and my sister passed out. We had to take her to the hospital and she fell in and out of consciousness. She was rushed  into a memory wipe surgery and it lasted 17 hours. While all of this my family and I had to go to therapy because it was so scarring. I wake up screaming from nightmares. My sister is now mute because it was so very traumatic for her. Please don’t download this app I do not want what happened to my family happen to yours.","date":"2020-07-08T23:50:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174091222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Meowiemomma","isEdited":false,"title":"Just no 🤢🤮","review":"So when I got the app there was a horrifying picture of the Cheeto.😬😳The picture was so bad that my eyes nearly went blind, but don't worry I went and got my glasses for protection. Glasses 👓 When I opened the app, there was a picture of the Cheeto working out. He was trying to burn off his Cheeto calories but it doesn't look like it's working.😰😶Then I went through the app I was just LOOKING around and then I saw the worst thing in my life. It was a picture of Cheeto getting spray tanned NAKED.🤮🤢😷Like I don't want to see that tiny little ball of his. It almost made my glasses break. No wonder he's a Cheeto he gets Cheeto colored spray tanned. Quick question why would he think this color would look nice 🟠? Like come on bro are you blind it’s not orange enough. And that’s why I give it a one star review. Thank you for your time whoever is reading this or even Chetto. 😁","date":"2020-07-08T23:22:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174021466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KweenSoren","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst Pizza Place Ever. 0/10.","review":"What the heck. I downloaded the official trump app to order some pizza from America’s #1 cheese factory, but turns out their pizza is absolutely TERRIBLE. when they say bunker aged, they mean it! Disgusting. Smells like moldy lasagna. Smells like a garbage dump. Smells like rotting flesh! The cheese is an unnatural and disturbing shade of orange, that can only be described as “putrid.” The sausage on the pizza was tiny, I had to get a magnifying glass in order to see it! Disgraceful. The ordering experience was terrible as well. I thought I’d be able to order it remotely, but turns out to fight order fraud I have to drive to the place, order, drive back, and wait for it to be delivered. And the delivery staff was terrible! He assaulted me, stealing all of my money, and then he did something he called “trickle-down economics.” I think you know what that means. 0/10. Gave me extreme and life threatening diarrhea.","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173988649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gg you gg you gg you","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is the worst","review":"This app is the worst because it first off has a very racist man as the face of this app. He is like a second hitler. He wants to take over and take people away from there family’s for nothing but just trying to have a better life and a living in America. But trump won’t allow it. He keeps saying to make the world better but how is he doing that when he spreads family’s, making racist jokes, not giving people justice, and at any little circumstance he gives out money to people to make them think that everything is right. And it not. Like at all. How is money gonna help solve worlds problem like homeless people. People getting separated from their ownnn Homes. And people not getting justice for what other people do to each other. And this is why I think this app should be deleted immediately. Thank You!","date":"2020-07-08T22:43:57Z","rating":1}}]}
