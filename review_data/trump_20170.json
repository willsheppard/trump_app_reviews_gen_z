After opening up the very hideously designed app, I was HIT by a photo of this UGLY MAN. I instantly went into a seizure that lasted 4 days. I’m still recovering from seeing such cheetoesque. It has negatively affected my daily life, mental health, and has given me irreversible ptsd. LEAVE A ONE STAR REVIEW. This app needs to be taken down before it can cause even more damage.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:41:25Z","title":"Horrifying","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174270291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"frederick55","review":"I was very disgusted to see a walking Cheeto when I got on the app! I was so scared I threw my phone out my window, thankfully it ended up in my dogs food. My dog then ate it but wasn’t able to swallow it because of the deep fried Cheeto fumes. He threw it up and I buried my phone (R.I.P iPhone..) I wrote this on paper towels, (so I don’t waste my ✨ 𝓹 𝓻 𝓮 𝓬 𝓲 𝓸 𝓾 𝓼 ✨ toilet paper) shoved it in a bottle, and flushed it down the toilet ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥳","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:27:33Z","title":"AHHHHHH 💀","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174246545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kirito 1610","review":"Bad user interface, slow load times even under the best circumstances and worst of all there’s just so much of this uncanny valley model on there with hair thinner and more lacking than most senior citizen’s and the most sickly and unnatural looking orange and blotted skin I’ve ever seen. I’d rate it lower if I could it’s just such a badly built app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:22Z","title":"This app is just a straight up miss","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174245119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tapatel","review":"This app makes me nausea. Every time time I open it I constantly see a Cheeto when I thought I was supposed to see a president. I think this app is a danger to society and should not be open for anybody to see. As soon as I started using it my phone started glitching. I would not recommend. And if u downloaded it and enjoy it get help❤️.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:18:52Z","title":"Disgusting🤮🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174230516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"evjshevejwmdbbrj","review":"This app is just overall terrible just like the president😚❤️it almost gave me a heart attack as soon as I opened it I saw a orange old man  🍊 it was so scary like something you see in a scary movie.
