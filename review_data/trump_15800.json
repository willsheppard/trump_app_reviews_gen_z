He WAS my idol but that all changed when I went to one of his rallies. I got dressed and ready for the rally, Trump 2020 merch and all. It was a dream come true but then that all changed when trumped refused to take a picture with and back handed me in the face 😖 he then pushed me to the ground, SPAT on me and stomped on my larynx.

I’m so disappointed and upset!! As soon as I got the app it asked for my credit card information, and I don’t know why it would need that! I’m not buying anything!!

I told my grandma to get this app and when she did, it had a jump scare and she had a heart attack and died. RIP Gram Gram 2020 😭"}}]}
