From forth the fatal loins of these two foes\nA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life,\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows \nDoth with their death bury their parents'strife.\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,\nAnd the continuance of their parents' rage,\nWhich, but their children's end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.\nThe which if you with patient ears attend,\nWhat here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend."}},{"id":"6177173787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ch4ssidy133","title":"Terrible App Not Worth Getting","date":"2020-07-09T15:32:28Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"App crashes. takes too long to download, dont respect the things and spam on this app. horrible app wasted my time and many others. this app is senseless and waste of phone storage and space. if I could rate no stars I would. worst app ever.
