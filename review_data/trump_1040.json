I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone","rating":1,"title":"T E R R I B L E  A P P"}},{"id":"6174657227","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Strangerthingsmike","review":"so i downloaded this app yesterday and as soon as it finished downloading all of my other apps stopped working! i thought it was a problem with my phone, but when i turned off my phone and turned it back on thinking that would fix it i noticed that ALL OF THE OTHER APPS ON MY PHONE THAT I HAD DOWNLOADED HAD BEEN DELETED EXCEPT THIS ONE. i thought that was strange so i went to ask my friend what she thought had happened and both of our phones stopped working! then siri began say extremely sexist and racist things(quoting trump) on both of our phones. it was like the app had taken over. i then got a call from my mom (which was very glitchy, by the way) telling me that all of the electronics in our house were not working and the tv would only play trump programs and fox news! then i realized that i hate trump and he is a terrible person and i never should have downloaded the app and i will not be voting for him in november.","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE DO NOT GET"}},{"id":"6174594905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kermit ü§®","review":"This app is HORRIBLE! I opened it in front of my 7 year old warthog and what we saw was DISGUSTING!!!! We saw a full grown HOUND DOG commiting terrible disgusting crimes! My 7 year old warthog dropped DEAD!! I am horrified! What came next was even WORSE! My 2 year old child I was babysitting looked on my phone and she started crying and her eyes started to BLEED!! She is in horrible condition in the ER! What showed next after that was disgusting! I might have fainted! We saw a full grown man NAKED after getting a spray tan! They were ORANGE!!!! I am truly horrified and DISGUSTED. After that, we saw a terribly graphic scene of HOT CHIPS AHOY being MURDERED. They were like humans! What I saw in this app was true lI disgusting. I opened this app with high hopes, what I got was disappointment, disgust, horror, much more. After everything, there was something even worse then what I could find on the deep dark web! Terrible graphic murder scenes of people, their family‚Äôs forced to watch in pain. This was truly DISGUSTING.","rating":1,"title":"This is horrible üò≠üò≠"}},{"id":"6174525869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:47:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Scarlette Johansonn","review":"I was so excited to support my bunker baby ü•∫ but when I downloaded the app it warned me of partial nudity? I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until the moldy Cheeto himself came out from under my bed with nothing but his bits covered!!! My 12 year old dog clinging onto life immediately killed herself at first sight, leaving me alone with the pedo. That really bothered me so I went to the store for some hot Cheetos but they just had small naked replicas of creepy Don so I left with some laxatives for my constipation problems. When I came back home there was a wall around my house and i was told by Pence that they thought I was illegal and he literally STOLE MY LAXATIVES!!!  He popped them all right there and proceeded to launch turds around my house and on my dead dog before Bunker boi came in and tattooed ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020‚Äù across my forehead and bit off my mothers earlobes. I really don‚Äôt recommend this app only because now my mom can‚Äôt wear her diamond earrings. üò°","rating":1,"title":"My dog is dead and my mom has no ears!!!"}},{"id":"6174397524","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dkevin20","review":"I would like to start off with the fact that this app has the audacity to greet me with an atrocious image of an orange; also known as an excuse of a president. Who let this fruit run our country, let alone an app? Secondly, just being greeted by this orange... or cheeto?? made me physically smell a musty and putrid odour through the screen. Can you believe it?!? Horrendous! I have seen enough when this THING‚ÄôS naked photo was leaked on twitter. Seeing this musty crusty image makes me want to shove something in my head to erase the memory of even seeing it. This app triggered my flight or flight response, and nearly gave me a PRTS if that horrific event. This app needs to be deleted ASAP! No excuses! This cheeto even has the nerve to raise his fist on the app pretending to support the BLM movement, knowing well that we‚Äôve all seen him and his pigs throwing tear gas and macing everyone for his pathetic photoshoot with a bible! I demand this app to be deleted. Hopefully the president will be deleted soon too!!","rating":1,"title":"A no from me!"}},{"id":"6174293782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:35:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Snackkkkkkkkkk","review":"I AM SO MAD AT THIS APP. Today me and my family went to go eat our dinner today as I told them how horrible this app is. My dad agreed as he told me to hand over his ice cream sandwich.

We can‚Äôt find my dad but I called him and currently he‚Äôs on mars which is a better place. Anyways, I‚Äôll probably be going to mars so yeah. I‚Äôll tell you about my trip on this dumb review.

I was alarmed to see a man of an orange hue with his centimeter sized ‚ú®penis‚ú® out in the open. All of my friends, Anna Bortion, Rae Cism, Homa Phobia, and Horra Ble.
