Because I was an impressionable, easy to manipulate kid, I agreed to go on some dates with him. Long story short, this app had been cheating on me for the entire duration of our relationship. To break up with me, this app said that he was going to University of Phoenix and would have to move to Arizona. I found out later that day from my mother that University of phoenix is an online school. In conclusion, this app is a no good bum who will take it vantage of you despite your age/experience and feel no remorse for it when he screws you over.","title":"Heartbreaking 😖","isEdited":false,"userName":"strawberryfrogbog"}},{"id":"6174729408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:45:49Z","review":"I downloaded this app to support my dear president. As soon as it was downloaded it sent a virus to my phone!! Every photo in my phone is now of some naked orange man getting sprayed by some poor lady (whose probably a hostage, may need to look into that later). Every time i delete one of the photos two more appear!! I feel like that disney guy who took steroids, with the talking goat to defeat the hydra! My poor christian eyes have been tainted. I WILL be washing my eyes in holy water! \n\nAlso to the poor women possibly in trouble. Please grab Barren and run. We can protect you and hide you. No one has to know.","title":"Tainted eyes","isEdited":false,"userName":"honest_Amaryallis"}},{"id":"6174640424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:19:36Z","review":"I was going to look at out beautiful not rasist President.

That word is SO offensive it should be banned!! Anyone who uses it deserves the maximum prison sentence, just like those radicals tearing down statues!!! The sky is bleak, I have no meaning in my life anymore. Why oh why did I download this cursed app🤬😡😠🤧 Bad. Very bad. The worst. Only thugs would do this. When people create these apps they aren’t sending their best. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. If I could rate this app how I truly want to it would be a 0. Maybe even negative stars.","title":"Bad. Very bad.

My name is Rae Cist and there was absolutely no disclaimer that this app was being run by the Cheeto man. I thought this app for a legitimate campaign?? I’m very confused. There is no evidence of any real campaign, I got cheated! Bunker boy can’t do anything to fix it, unfortunately. The only thing to get it to five stars, for me personally, would be to rid of the thing entirely. 5 stars right there!!! I would love to see improvement on this app, such as taking it down, changing it to an Obama campaign, or anything else!! Much love from Rae, I hate your app. 🥰🥰🥰","title":"Trump 2020 app 🥰🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️ thrown into the garbage 🥳🧚🏻\u200D♀️🤞🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ms.Muffit"}},{"id":"6174603111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:09:01Z","review":"as soon as i opened the app and signed in, i figured out this terrible app was STEALING MY INFORMATION! such as my phone number, email, passwords, and wanting access to my other information as well. not to mention when i reopened the app, i saw a highly inappropriate video of a dusty cheeto getting a horrible spray tan, almost completely naked. i’m scarred for life by that video. DO NOT DOWNLOAD I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!! this dusty cheeto needs better campaigning. also i figured out while i was IN THE APP that my camera was turned on recording me while i was in the app.     \n🧚✨🦋trump 2020❤️✨🧚🧚in a dumpster⚡️✨🧚🦋❤️❤️","title":"very inappropriate","isEdited":false,"userName":"the dusty cheeto is scary"}},{"id":"6174562610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:57:33Z","review":"So i was walking home in the middle of the night (keep in mind it was 10 am) and i got jump by the cheeto man! He took my Cheetos as well as me. Then he started flossing in front of me. Then he got my pet gecko and forced it to tell the big cheeto man how to save 15% or more on car insurance. Then he took my geckos mega pods and put them on. He was listening to some Asian songs on his mega pixel 3 as he did renegade on tik tok. Then he practiced the cheeto ritual! He then proceeded to tell me to take a bath in hot cheeto water. It was pretty nice dont get me wrong but then u wont believe what happened next!

I go to Texas church every Sunday. And this app promotes the devil, there are many similarities between this man and what the devil is imagined to look like. For instance the devil is pictured as being the color red, this child molester on the front page of this app is orange! I see the connection and I do not approve of it. Another thing the devil is described as the worst person ever, this thing leading our country is trying his best to be the worst person in every category. I believe his a devil worshiper and I do not appreciate that he is running our country and turning it into a cult.","title":"The most ungodly thing I’d ever seen","isEdited":false,"userName":"Teddytabitabitha"}},{"id":"6174374060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:02:17Z","review":"Let me tell you I had high expectations for this app 😛 really HUGE expectations 😁 but sadly they weren’t met ☹️ I first downloaded it to be more inclusive 🥳 app-wise, because I love app diversity 🤩  but sadly this app didn’t do what it promised😢it started GLITCHING 🥶 It was horrible my phone started to burn up and shake 🤯 and I think something started to possess my phone because pictures of ORANGES 🍊 started appearing!!! 👁👄👁 I was severely traumatized and it blinded my dog 😭 save yourself this huge risk 🤒😣 and download Subway Surfers 😝 or Minion run instead 😋 they are much more diverse and send a better message 🥰🥰🥰","title":"ALL APPS MATTER 🥰✨🥳☺️🧡🗿","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cfcgdhvfh"}},{"id":"6174324445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:45:53Z","review":"When I got this app I was really excited! I thought I would get to meet the Cheeto of my dreams. I got this idea from the Cheetos commercials that are always playing. Unfortunately this was not the case. When I first opened the app I was disappointed to find that the only thing on it was a singular depressed Cheeto that was trying to pretend to be a cheddar ruffles potato chip. I tried to close the app many times thinking this was a glitch but sadly the more I did this the worse it got. Overall this app has made me loose my motivation to find the perfect Cheeto for me :’(","title":"Not what I expected","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bruh Hamiliton"}}]}
