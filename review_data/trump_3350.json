Boy was she wrong, not only did I get a virus which I had to change my whole phone because the app broke it, but the news it gave me was inaccurate and hateful towards others so me downloading it wasn’t even worth it. The virus I got from this app consisted of my phone freezing every 20 minutes and glitching to a pitch black screen, I also kept seeing inappropriate pop up ads where there shouldn’t be any pop up ads in the first place. I got those pop ups showing up even in the home screen of my iPhone sometimes. 0/10 do not recommend.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:36:30Z"}},{"id":"6173612364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"skinnykermit","title":"My mom flew away 😭","rating":1,"review":"I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS APP!!!

Okay, should be easy enough, right? Well, I waited, and waited and waited for just about ten minutes to receive my confirmation text message, and by then it wasn’t even valid! So I did that for another 15 minutes until it finally worked, and I was in the app. Great! Butttttt it looks nothing like advertised. The events are extremely hard to access, and harder to sign up for. The information being thrown at me wasn’t even supporting Trump, it was just saying about how bad everybody else is. I hope that they find a way to fix this app before it crashes.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:52Z"}},{"id":"6173524583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AngelFire1212","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"review":"To all these trump supporters giving this app a 5 star review and complaining about all of the bad reviews✨... I can’t imagine what its like to be a brainwashed, old sack of bones!! So sad that all you can muster up from your sad, unfulfilled life is be buried in your grave and harass younger people on the internet 😢. But anyways lets get into the app!!! (And if you’re wondering it does apply to me because I can vote) As soon as I opened the app I was greeted by a large, orange ball-sack. I was praying it wasn’t Trump’s... But I courageously went further into the app anyways and to my dismay the app shut off! And it kept shutting off! Horrible interface, especially for the president of the US. Couldn’t say I expected any better though 😘.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:31Z"}},{"id":"6173524217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lili mangai","title":"This app caused me to be captured by Aliens","rating":1,"review":"So, I downloaded the Trump 2020 app to see what our d e a r e s t President Trump was up to and all that, but as soon as it was installed and I opened it, my whole ROOF exploded and there was a huge UFO with a cow driving it, I was beamed into the ship and it immediately started flying to outer space, very quickly I might add, So I got motion sickness cause i couldn’t handle the speed so I didn’t even notice when an alien took my phone, broke it in half, and threw it out of the UFO, but when I did I asked, “why in the world would you do that!?” And the alien responded with “Cause Trump is a terrible person.” I realized I was never supportive of him and said, “PERIODT!!!” \n\nAnyways Black lives matter and arrest Breonna Taylor’s murderers","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:24Z"}},{"id":"6173511937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"So cute 224🌹😘","title":"I know where you live 🍊🍊","rating":1,"review":"I was parked in my red Nisan trump-mobile when I was ready to download the app my awesome republican friends suggested to me since they said it was so life changing. It took TWO HOURS to download and that’s not where the horror started. It started when my phone was hacked by trump himself. I thought my love for trump would protect my phone from being hacked but no. No it did not. All my photos of the great Cheeto man were gone, they were replaced with all black matters posts. I was TERRIFIED. The color black really made me uncomfortable. Please fix this, I want to able to go back into my camera roll and see the great Cheeto man again. I am no longer supporting this app until everything is fixed.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:50:06Z"}},{"id":"6173290629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Math_geek100","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1,"review":"I just had a colonoscopy so I thought it would be the perfect time to download the trump app. The second I downloaded the app my phone started oozing a thick orange liquid. I tried to stop it but it just kept going. Soon enough the was an orange puddle forming at my feet. Then my cat came over and licked the liquid which caused him to get 49 seizures and 37 tourretts attacks. Then if things couldn’t get any worse, my pet chinchilla began profusely masturbating to my seizing cat. Suddenly my sister began listening to country music 🤮 and I started bleeding out of all my orfices. Eyes, mouth, nose, you name it. Some places I think you would rather not know. Then, my mother awoke from her coma just sing gabbie Hanna songs for an hour straight. Thanks trump.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:31Z"}},{"id":"6173276033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Someday star","title":"WORST APP EVER 😡😡😡😡","rating":1,"review":"they played the video from The Ring as soon as I signed in!! now I only have seven days to live!!!! how does trump expect me to support him if I don’t even have a week to do so. and not only did he show me the video, he used secret technology from Area 51 to send WORMS through my screen and onto my face because I was holding my phone upside down 😡 😡 😡. now I have squishy squishies all over my face. and then trump FaceTimed me to LAUGH at me. this app is a gateway to being a victim of our prankster president. HE MIGHT DROP WORMS DOWN YOUR THROAT TOO AND YOU DON’T WANT THAT DO YOU!!!! he also told me that I’d never be as attractive as his daughter 😭 😭 😭 but I had to let him be rude to me because he’s a star, and when you’re a star, we let you do it 🤬","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:29:47Z"}},{"id":"6173255811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Reader1974","title":"WE ARENT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT TRUMP","rating":1,"review":"Dear Donald Trump aka the Human Cheeto, \nWe, the people of Gen Z are NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT and not letting you take away Tik Tok. You and your fellow blind and deaf supporters are trying to prove that Tik Tok is a dangerous app because it steals information from our phones and sending that info to China. Little did you geniuses know, that China Tik Tok and US Tik Tok have different CEOs. You’re just being petty and you found out that the app is an outlet for us Gen Z people to sabotage your rallies and a lot of people completely DESPISE you on there. Bet you don’t know what freedom of speech is huh? You decided to be THE PRESIDENT and you have to take criticism from people that live in America. Yet YOU DONT. Well, if you can’t take the heat, then, there’s the door, LEAVE.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:09Z"}},{"id":"6173250018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Walouijiiiii","title":"I wish I could unsee","rating":1,"review":"I wish I could unsee the things I have seen on this app. There are extremely autistic and RUDE people on here that all support this 74 year old Cheeto. I found out shortly after downloading that all Trump supporters are actually aliens with the intent to rip apart our society. Their leader? Donald J. Trump. They prey upon the weak at heart and turn them against us everyday with things like #all lives matter and #blue lives matter. They are so hateful and careless to the point that it disgusts me. Im in shock and utter disbelief at the fact that people still use this app. Shortly after downloading just as a joke, I was violently assaulted by an orange Cheeto in a ninja mask. I can only hope now that since I have deleted it, things will get better","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:21:10Z"}}]}
