I opened it and my phone automatically started overheating. Every time I tried the app would randomly close out and after a while my phone started glitching out completely not even when the app was open just in general. All I wanted to do was be involved in the presidential election but now my phone is having troubles all because of this app. It needs to be taken of the App Store so it won’t mess with other people’s phones."}},{"id":"6174023619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD","userName":"mdvskshdn","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:57:06Z","rating":1,"review":"Horrible app. I downloaded it, wanting to support our president, but instead of seeing a sign up screen, I’m greeted with an entire file of cheeto’s nudes. I am absolutely disgusted in what I saw. I’ve never seen anything that small in my life. I also tried to take my pet caterpillar on a walk, but there was a force field around my house. The app hacked into my phone and sent a death threat to all of my contacts. It stole all my money and my account was deleted and it didn’t seem like it would be mean at first, but then I soon realised that I was wrong. NEVER AGAIN will I download another app like this.😤💕😌✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174012648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮🤮🤮","userName":"Jasiri1","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:53:03Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app a while back. It was nothing bad at first until I began to enjoy it too much. I became obsessed. My wife, Karen, hated my obsession. She said I yelled too much. My own children were scared of me. She sent me to rehab, and it worked! I felt like a new man! Everything was great until the app… it seemed it lurked in my dreams. There was no escape, I couldn’t help myself. It was worse than ever. Constantly I was using this app, everything I did was about this app, all I did was use this app. Overall it’s a great app, but Karen, if you see this, please come back, and at least let me see my kids on Christmas."}},{"id":"6173914446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨🌈STREAM ON BY BTS🌈✨🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"achoooooooooooo","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:16:12Z","rating":1,"review":"Ooh ooh\nIn a world where you feel cold\nYou gotta stay gold\nOh baby, yeah\n魅惑的な moonlight\n今宵も眠らない\n月明かりを頼りに\n君の元へ hide and seek (ay)\n心へ (ay) と忍びこんで 君の間近\n近づくのさ いつの間にか (ay)\n穢れを知らないな\nその瞳はダイヤ\nどんな宝石よりも beautiful\n何度も (yeah) 見惚れてしまうほど\n君から目離せない no more\n時計の針さえ 動きを止めるよ\nUh let it glow, whoa\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\n気づかれないように\n近づいてく slowly\n予告するよ baby 無防備な君を優しく\nいただくのさ 君の深いところ now\n高鳴る想いは 鼓動を早める\nUh let it show, whoa\nStay gold 君さえいれば\nStay gold 何もいらない\nStay gold, gold 抱きしめたくて\nStay gold 愛は果てなく\nStay gold 光を放つ\nStay gold どんな星よりも\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\nJust close your eyes\n何も言わない\nI'll steal your heart\n魔法のように\n奇跡なら僕が見せてあげる (yeah)\nその手を出して\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold, gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\n覗き見する moonlight\n今宵眠らせない\n握りしめたその手を\n離したくはないよ\nStay gold, uh yeah"}},{"id":"6173825478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TO THE BOOMERS!!!","userName":"abc 18/7 jsb","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:42:59Z","rating":1,"review":"It’s funny to me seeing all the five star reviews by the old people who support trump. Most of them keep talking bout how we are children and are using immature language, but ya got your facts wrong grandpa cause bad language is considered adult language so thank you for believing we are mature when you see the literature written by other people in the reviews. :) Not only the fact that your not our parents and have no say in the words that come out of our mouths, Bc it’s our bodies not yours so mind ya business; but we ain’t gonna sit here and let you Dinos decide OUR future. You had your time now it’s ours.

But then once i downloaded it the app continued to crash and all of the sudden my cat stood up and started to rap Nicki Minaj Songs, and THATS TERRIBLE because my cat is a Conservative Trump Supporter! So then I just kept crying and all of a sudden I got rushed with Vote Bernie advertisements which Scared Me! Sorry Donald, I won’t be able to attend many rallies.

However, I revived the EXACT opposite. This app is secretly run by !!LIBERALS!! They are using this app in hopes of brainwashing us into seeing the REAL facts. Every time I open the app my phone goes from 100% battery level to -4%. Not to mention, once I submitted my phone number I started receiving #biden2020 spam and messages. Random numbers connected to the liberal side of the internet have also been texting me fact checked information about BLM and CLIMATE CHANGE. This is unacceptable. I will be deleting immediately.
