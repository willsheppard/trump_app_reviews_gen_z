DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","review":"This app requires so much memory that I had to delete ALL my other apps AND all the pictures of my dog Chichi from my phone. Then once it had finally downloaded it crashed my phone, which then would not turn on for more than a minute and kept crashing. I had to factory reset it just to write this review. Finally opening the app I saw it contains extremely racist, homophobic, sexist, and xenophobic content and I uninstalled immediately. My children use my phone sometimes and I do not want them being exposed to such filth. This app will break your phone and melt your brain cells to boot. DO NOT INSTALL IT!"}},{"id":"6175630375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:57:30Z","userName":"fat hot cheeto take L","rating":1,"title":"TRULY THE WORST APP","review":"ugh the downloading experience was so awful ! can‚Äôt even imagine who would want to go through with such a thing ! oh whale,, i only did it to see what the campaign was really about. was i surprised w my disappoint ?? NO. since it‚Äôs so awful, it‚Äôs hard to pick which is worse. the fact that it exists or the fact that people download it un-ironically !! if only there was a way to rid of it sigh. it may be hard to see it go, but i have more important things to do, like fight for human rights !  im so sad to see it go, but what‚Äôs even sadder is the amount of injustice and ignorance in the country. shame shame."}},{"id":"6175605500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:48:28Z","userName":"saVe TiK tOoK","rating":1,"title":"Just don‚ÄôtüíÄ","review":"Despite the fact of my crippling depression this app has done nothing but push me to my breaking point. Every time I even think about opening this app I can feel my soul burning in agony because this app resembles almost perfectly my own personal hell. Also I am pretty sure that satan came down to the earth just to make this app. Wait no, sorry I am positive that he has done so. I can feel this app physically crushing my will to live and eating my soul whole. So with that said and done just don‚Äôt download this app unless it‚Äôs to write a review like this. Btw I like Cheetosü•∞‚ú®just not all over my faceüßö\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®."}},{"id":"6175579997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:39:05Z","userName":"0fficialluiss","rating":1,"title":"Never AGAIN!","review":"App took 13 minutes to even load on my screen when I first download it! And to top it off I thought this was a presidential campaign. Why do I have a racist clown holding the black panther fist as soon as it decides to open. I thought Apple had strict app rules but seeing that this app made it to the store I am really eerie about that. How could the App Store allow a racist, rapist, misogynist clown upload to such a sacred store we call our App Store. I am hoping that Apple will review this app and take it down as soon as possible as it is obviously promoting a racist and rapist for our country. Thank you for joining my ted talk."}},{"id":"6175264438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:37:11Z","userName":"_ahlammm","rating":1,"title":"absolutely terrifying!!","review":"I downloaded this app when I opened it it had a huge warning saying that it could sense a Muslim women opening it and that they would deport me back to my ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù country. I was scared b/c I am an American just like anyone else. But it didn‚Äôt surprise me though cus the president himself doesn‚Äôt like Muslims so why would his like us it don‚Äôt make any sense. Anyways this app is absolutely horrible you should get rid of it. It absolutely terrified me and I am on a miner I might not be able to sleep at night after opening this app the terrible thing it should me really terrified me. No human should go through that."}},{"id":"6175217902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:19:42Z","userName":"ZipZZipp","rating":1,"title":"Horrific","review":"Heard stories where the works was simple. But something changed. A man, with the objective to watch the world burn, was born. He grew up believing he deserved the best. He was the best, he thought. As he grew older, his arrogance free with him. He got money, power, and fame. He washed more. To be worshipped. He became a part of trafficking. Poor girls as young as eight, Target away to be used as machines for pleasure. Horrific sights. Didn‚Äôt like- no, despised those of rich culture. He wished to ‚Äúrule the nation‚Äù. Four difficult years. Those that had to experience the effects of the man‚Äôs purposeful mistakes were and are warriors. The man now wishes to make an application. This platform must fall."}},{"id":"6175002106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:08:20Z","userName":"owner of a pet rock","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP BROKE MY WASHING MACHINE!!!","review":"if i could give a 0 star review i would. i was walking my pet rock to go get a smoothie from walmart and then i got lost on the way to walmart and ended up in kentucky!?!

Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT download this app. I brought it to the apple store to try and get the virus type thing fixed, but they couldn‚Äôt figure it out and i can‚Äôt afford a new phone. Really thought that a whole administration could make an app that at least somewhat works, but i guess not. It would be actually best if it actually got deleted just to prevent others from going through the same experience i did!!! :(("}},{"id":"6174816564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:12:12Z","userName":"mike whochezeharrie","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I‚Äôve ever downloaded!!","review":"I opened the app and it asked if I‚Äôm of Hispanic origin and if so my whole family will be deported! Then, a light scanned down my face and suddenly I couldn‚Äôt remember who I was!! The app scanned and took like half of my brain it took a week for me to remember the English language at all. I tried to uninstall it but the app didn‚Äôt like that and it released a virus into my phone and now every 5 minutes a pop up that I cannot close plays the Gangnam Style music video. It‚Äôs driving me mad I can‚Äôt even turn my phone off to avoid it because the app won‚Äôt let me.
