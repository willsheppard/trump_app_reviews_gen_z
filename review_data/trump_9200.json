I downloaded this app to see how America is doing in a different view but that is the opposite of what I got, racism is spread across this whole app and more. Ever since I downloaded this app my whole phone was glitchy even if I wasn’t on the app. Everything was slow and sometimes apps won’t even open. This disgrace Cheeto of a president can’t even run an app correctly so why is he trying to run a whole country."}},{"id":"6174723966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:44:13Z","title":"Worst app","userName":"sbsbxbdnnNsxncjjdj","review":"I downloaded this app to get updates but soon after the app started glitching. I thought it was my phone so I restarted it but that made it worse!! Slowly the whole app went haywire so I re-download it... DO NOT DO THIS!!!  Soon after my whole phone was glitching out. I restarted it yet again and that solved for about three minutes. Then my whole phone shut off!! Nothing would turn it back on, so I had to get a new phone!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174700105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:37:01Z","title":"This app is tremendous","userName":"haleypetterson","review":"This app is by far the worst thing I ever seen. There should be no such thing it has the lowest quality. Trying to use this app is extremely nauseating this app privacy settings is a complete mess. This app design and format could be a lot better I wouldn’t recommend this app to of my associates or friends this app was a waste of storage I’m glad people are speaking their minds about this because ethos has taken a complete toll on how I think of app designers"}},{"id":"6174695938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:35:45Z","title":"This a Joke¿","userName":"babygorllll","review":"This is app is pathetic. Made my phone glitch n over heat nonstop. no real news on this app unless it’s about cow feces conservation. very concealed about informational articles and un logical ads for sex toys on every page. Paid for a year long obedience to Trump petition for more rights and then my bank account was deactivated. lost all my money but a 100$ “oopsy” deposit from Trumps team. all my personal info was up for sale on a site linked to this app. Tiktok lives matter.

SECURITY RISK!!!","userName":"Neritice","review":"I downloaded this app to vote for my great president, but after I had it downloaded on my phone for a day my phone went berserk!! The key board would move while I was typing! A few of my coworkers had the same problem and countless others! I brought my phone to get it looked at and they told me someone was attempting to hack into my codes and it was linked to this app!! I think the nasty gen z may have created this app to ruin us more!!

People will know your location and steal your important information from you, including your pets. In my opinion and basically everyone else’s opinion ;Trump is the worst president and a heinous role\nmodel with multiple crimes. This poor excuse of a president belongs in prison and deserves every painful and suffering action that innocent people get no for no reason. Do not. I repeat. Do not download this app, you will instantly regret it."}},{"id":"6174666610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:27:07Z","title":"Terrible App","userName":"Sir Manny the Brave","review":"To start, I was immediately disappointed when I found that the program is incompatible with my pristine flag that has been gaining popularity amount the Zoomers as a profile picture. I also found it extremely disrespectful that there was not a SINGLE poll or discussion forum where I could offer condolences for the deceased Donald who recently passed when he overdosed on hydroxychloroquine. Also dissatisfied with it being incompatible with my transgender ferret. #totallynotfakenews #RIPtrump"}},{"id":"6174655372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:23:53Z","title":"Bad","userName":"thispresonbri","review":"When I open the app there is a orange on my screen screaming at me for nothingI did nothing it all he did was scream and scream and scream I was terrified and I looked at him again and was like oh he looks like a Cheeto I couldn’t have that and I was like Nah this man and creepy and crazy then he started saying a whole bunch of racist stuff and I just couldn’t handle it anymore are you guys everyone not to get this app because once you get it you’ll be scared for the rest of your life"}},{"id":"6174646163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:21:15Z","title":"i hate it here","userName":"lilyjanes","review":"this app is terrible! i thought that by downloading it i would become a straight white male and have the ability to do whatever i please! but no, my gender remained the same and i still have no rights! this app is a reflection of the way our country is being run and i, for one, will not stand for it. i am sick and tired of being controlled by a misogynist who does not understand the concepts of respect, equity, justice, and being a good human being. i miss obama. if cheeto bunker boy child rapist isn’t out of office soon, we’re going to have a lot more to deal with than we think. get off the app store, stop meddling in our human rights, get a grip, and take a good, hard, long look in the mirror. you won’t like what you see donald. you’re a disgrace to the world."}}]}
