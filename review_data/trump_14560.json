Not to mention, I found out it monitors your location even when the app is closed. As someone who wishes the best for society, I would not recommend anyone to download this app. It slows down your phone and decreases battery life significantly due to it monitoring your location. Please do NOT download this app","date":"2020-07-09T06:20:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175353599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"So disappointed ...","userName":"lil.ana","review":"As soon as I opened this app it took me to a weird homepage that I knew had nothing to do with Donald so I was confused and then after it wouldn’t let me exit the app so I waited like 30 minutes and my phone was so hot and then I kept getting notifications from the app itself that I was being scammed and I had viruses but from the app idk it was weird definitely do not recommend","date":"2020-07-09T06:11:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175274602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚\u200D♂️✨This app is bad🧚\u200D♂️✨","userName":"SpongeBobbiggestfan","review":"I had to wait 3 seconds for the app to load in.

All there is a the rambles of a strange Cheeto alien that does nothing but golf, talk about how good it is when it only crashes and burns my phone. And talks so much racism that is disgusting and will not let this thing be in power or have the right to talk such drivel. Do not get this app. It is buggy as the person. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it","date":"2020-07-09T04:49:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175115358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely horrible!!","userName":"PRISCI11Aa!!","review":"I download this app because I love our president. However, it’s horrible and slows down my phone and causes glitches. It’s so bad that it makes Donald Trump look amazing. Don’t download it I’ll make you leave your country and force you to pay to build a wall!! Horrible app almost as horrible as leaving children in cages and having sexual assault charges and still being in office.","date":"2020-07-09T04:44:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175093622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"don’t bother","userName":"ICE-ICE(steals)Babies","review":"In the privacy policy it states that a few key items of personal information required, such as name, phone number, etc. I don’t feel that it is right to support an app run by a fascist Cheeto that asks for your personal information, as those identifying factors will most likely be sold to third parties to use for ads. Also the app runs slow and the graphics look hideous.","date":"2020-07-09T04:37:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175062505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just terrible.","userName":"Agentp0813","review":"This app nearly crashed my phone, the number of notifications was insane. Probably upwards of 20 a day. I thought I had turned off notifications on my Apple Watch but somehow this app turned them back on and spammed me all day. On top of that, the number of glitches makes this app unusable. There is absolutely no reason to get this app, it doesn’t work at all!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:27:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174940341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed in our president😔😤😫","userName":"trumpylover69","review":"I got this app to get updates on our wonderful presidents campaign but was met with problems as soon as I opened. The app immediately gave me an alert to inject disinfectant into my veins to stop the corona virus. This app still sends me upwards of 50 notifications A DAY. In addition to that, it caused my whole phone to glitch and literally cracked my phone screen. I do not recommend. YOU WILL REGRET GETTING THIS APP!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:48:48Z","isEdited":false}}]}
