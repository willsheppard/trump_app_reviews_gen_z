I can no longer download any apps or delete this one and the only internet I have access to is Fox news and Donald Trumps twitter account. For some reason when you open the app each time it plays the national anthem of a different country. I thought that was odd at first but the last straw was when I opened the app as I do daily and it began to play the North Korean national . This is unacceptable. This app needs put in rice. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🍊👩🏻\u200D🦼\n\n     - A concerned citizen","date":"2020-07-08T20:34:08Z","userName":"onedirection343"}},{"id":"6173635068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"terrible app","rating":1,"review":"so i downloaded this app because i love our president so much! but immediately when i opened it, i came across a video of him saying he’s going to sacrifice my family😳!!! i quickly exited out of it but then my phone started messing up. random apps were being opened and weird things were popping up. i went to the apple store and they said that i had a virus and they couldn’t fix it! so i had to get a whole new phone all because this app wanted me to sacrifice my family and gave me a virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:52Z","userName":"bellai1016"}},{"id":"6173608080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"review":"Disgusting! I was sitting with my grandma and as soon as I opened this app a picture of a sickly man came up and the orange bright light shocked her and put my grandma into a seizure. She then is a cold daze educated me on every thing the man has said like about he likes to touch little kids and walk in on minors during his pageant competitions. She also said that someone named Barron trump needs saving and could also be getting sexually abused since the Orange man said on several occasions he’s attracted sexually to his own children. Never download the app very bad get rid of Orange pedo man.","date":"2020-07-08T20:23:14Z","userName":"izzyloeffle"}},{"id":"6173601987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is a danger to my family","rating":1,"review":"This app gave me and my family cuts  and more every time I would open the app I would get Terrible headaches and I would get sores all over my body this has never been a problem before and I’m getting concerns from my other family members who have the app as well my fingers would start to cramp and get sore when my hands where even close to the app icon this never stopped until I deleted the app but I will still continue to support my dicta- I mean president from the sidelines","date":"2020-07-08T20:21:03Z","userName":"ilovetrump2020😍"}},{"id":"6173587626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Alexa, play Despacito","rating":1,"review":"This app is so sad, if there was a zero star review option that’s what I would choose. Unfortunately I was super excited to use this app hearing how great it was from friends and family however, the app took way too long for comfort to download. Finally, once it did download and I was able to use it my phone immediately crashed. I deleted the app and my phone is working just fine. I would recommend this to others and I will be sharing this with other friends and family.","date":"2020-07-08T20:16:00Z","userName":"eeney teeney weeney"}},{"id":"6173566620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"MUST DELETE THIS APP","rating":1,"review":"This app is so horrible.

I felt slightly disrespected but decided to give him a chance unlike him when it came to people of color. This app made my phone glitch out and it went crazy. I don’t want to be rude AT ALL of course because he’s just trying to make america great again but I couldn’t possibly take any more of the things he’s done. Ever since he wanted to “build a wall” I found it pretty sus and now I don’t even know how to act. He’s not very nice. I’m disappointed 😢","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:19Z","userName":"Your Fav boo thang 😉🥰"}}]}
