First of all it took a whole week for it to download on my phone which I thought was unacceptable. Like it just took an incredibly long amount of time to download. Second of all, my phone got a bug because of it. And the bud got so bad that my phone would just turn off. So I took it to the App Store and they took a look at it and as soon as they shook my phone an actual ROACH came crawling out of my speaker. Then it yelled “TRUMP 2020.” So I laughed, but apparently that made it angry. So it grew and grew until it’s big crusty looking forehead busted through ceiling of the apple store. Then it started chasing everyone around the store and parking lot. I ran to my phone to delete the app but it told me I had to pay 70,000,000 dollars to get it removed, AND I WAS SHOCKED HUNNY I WAS IN TEARS ALMOST. It also gave me the option to use a password. I figured out what it was through my great great grandfather’s Friend’s cousin’s sister’s dog’s friend’s owner.
