When I downloaded the app, I saw a Cheeto puff with eyes and then threw up multiple times. My throw up ended up attracting billions of ants which ended up overrunning and kicking me out of my own house. While on the streets I befriended a beetle named Ferdinand. One night while I was sleeping Ferdinand stole the rest of my personal belongings and then literally stabbed me in the back. I walked to the nearest hospital with the knife still in my back, and the doctors said that I needed surgery to live. The surgery took two weeks and I ran out of vacation days so I got fired from my job. The surgery also put me in tremendous debt. Here I am two years later still homeless with a phone that cost me $30. 0/10 two thumbs down 😾","userName":"goodparent567","rating":1,"title":"This app made me homeless"}},{"id":"6174442484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:57Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First off I saw an orange duck in front of a flag and I didn’t like that.Second I feel offended why do you need my phone number third I just didn’t like how it was forcing me to give my number and finally I just wasn’t working","userName":"puppy aid","rating":1,"title":"Don’t"}},{"id":"6174441529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app, I saw this orange monkey looking thing.
