The whole time I tried to use the app it was glitching and was really pixelated. The contents in the app wouldn’t work ether when I wanted to press on something it would send me to this website for the blue blew balls and I do not have a single clue why.","userName":"chelltopp","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172633769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:13:24Z","rating":1,"title":"there’s 💅alot🙇🏼of🌾people👯\u200D♀️in👑𝒜𝓂𝑒𝓇𝒾𝒸𝓊𝒽","review":"I decided to download this app for my beloved president, Bunker Boy. Please keep in mind my dog was with me (he’s a huge Tr*mp supporter) and as MANY of the reviews have said, as soon as it loaded i saw a frightening orange face. My dog collapsed out of fright and died. Do NOT have your pets around this app! or anyone with a common sense! My dog has been through 69 surgeries and 420 shots as of today and STILL died. 😿😿 I blame TRUMP!","userName":"LAUV 🍞 LAUV 🍞 BLM)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172582804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:59:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"Just a terrible app. It took 26 hours to download and then when it did download it deleted all my apps! I was very frustrated and annoyed so I went to go delete this app but I couldn’t, instead it deleted all my pictures and put pictures of our president on my camera roll. This app has ruined my life! Please listen to me and don’t get the app.","userName":"nickmanenotfound","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172567838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:55:06Z","rating":1,"title":"HORRIFIC","review":"This app was so disappointing to me. It was wayyyyyy to glitchy and it my my bed flip over with me in it. I ended up with 2 concussions and a broken HEAD. Not to mention his sticker app!!  The stickers are trashy and they don’t look well made at all. I would rather get trump\n stickers in the dumpster. Wait don’t do that they need to say in there. \n\nWhen I was looking more deeply into to the map and my dog walked in he stop to nonstop vomit all over the floor. I can tell he doesn’t like the app either. \n\nOverall I would NOT recommend getting this app. It is a waste of time and energy. Please don’t get this app you will be very disappointed and very hurt. Bye.","userName":"vsco.girl.2019.sksks","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172486076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:32:11Z","rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible and do not vote for Trump","review":"Trump shouldn’t have his own app if he’s trying to remove other apps that are helping the community in the whole world that’s not a president that I want to help other apps and other social media platforms this one is just not helping all it is is just an app where you try to make Trump president again but you just shouldn’t","userName":"Phoeebe22","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172471897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:28:23Z","rating":1,"title":"😡😡🍊🍊","review":"I downloaded this app to see if all these reviews were true 🙁the next second a fudging orange bursts into my house NAKED screaming “WHO IN THE HELL PUT THE MUFFINS IN THE FRIDGE” and then started running up and down the road screaming “ALL LIVES MATTER” which is absolutely disgusting and then some kid was on his scooter and he ate the kid and the scooter like what did the scooter do to you so that is my experience.\n\nAnd on the behalf of gen Z we would like this app BANNED FOREVER- gen Z","userName":"the truth☹️😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172439022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:19:32Z","rating":1,"title":"Daddyyy Barron😘😘","review":"Stop using the self tanner you like a crusty dusty Cheeto puff baby🥰🥰💕💕💕✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ AS SOON AS I OPENED THIS APP LARGE DISABLED COWS STARTED TO ROLL DOWN MY DRIVE WAY!!

But as soon I a opened the app I stopped breathing, my heart stopped beating and I was stating to see the light. Now I know that this THING is evil itself.\n\nThis THING of a person is nothing but the devil. I don’t even want to call him a person because he’s not. He is the devil himself on our surface causing chaos and destruction to everything it sees.\n\nThis THING is a RACIST, CHILD MOLESTER, WOMAN ABUSER, PREDATOR and everything in between.  \n\nPLEASE don’t download this app and have DEVIL bring this beautiful county down to the pits of hell. I love my county and I know that this THING is not what we Americans stand for!!
