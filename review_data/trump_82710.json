Basically when you‚Äôre signing up it asks for your phone number which then proceeds to send you some spam messages, which isn‚Äôt too bad I guess. The second thing is the app insists that you sign a statement proclaiming your unbreakable love for your president and how he is your absolutist ruler. I don‚Äôt really know what absolutist means but I‚Äôm sure its not a big deal. Anyway, I decided I didn‚Äôt really want the app anymore so I deleted it. The next day, 20 heavily armed secret service agents intruded into my bedroom while I was watching Steven Spielberg‚Äôs academy award winning masterpiece, Shrek 2. Anywho, 10 agents came directly through my door while the others smashed through my windows while dangling from ropes attached to two helicopters. Not a huge problem, but I was upset they interrupted my movie. They demanded to know why I delete this app and I told them it was taking up space on my phone that I needed to get Beat Blade. I asked them nicely if they could keep it down since my dog was sleeping and they proceeded to punch me in the face. I was dragged out of my bed and all 20 held me down, telling me I had committed a war crime. It was chill though. The one guy who punched me seemed nice. I‚Äôm writing this in some sort of dank dark room somewhere. I think the guard who brought me rice said something about Somalia? Who knows. My cellmate hasn‚Äôt moved in a few days. We made a TikTok though.I don‚Äôt think they know I smuggled my phone down here. Moral of the story is maybe don‚Äôt download this app. If you do, don‚Äôt delete it. :)"}},{"id":"6176536554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"iz anjos","date":"2020-07-09T12:41:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"do not download!","review":"i had the worst experience using this app & even worse experience living in a country w this man for president! get him out of office now."}},{"id":"6176521580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Meghan4215","date":"2020-07-09T12:37:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible App","review":"Terrible president, terrible app, Let‚Äôs not make America Great Again"}},{"id":"6176488176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sava151","date":"2020-07-09T12:28:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Trump","review":"This is the worst app ever, you should never get this app"}},{"id":"6176434030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kaira makayla white","date":"2020-07-09T12:13:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Who cares about trump","review":"I hate trump he is the worst president in history"}},{"id":"6176422952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alaynaa‚ú®","date":"2020-07-09T12:10:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"this app stole all of my information, made my phone combust, and killed my cat."}}]}
