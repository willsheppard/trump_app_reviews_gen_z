This app is more then just an app, it’s like watching a horror film. It reminds me of the conjuring, Annabelle, the nun, it, and chunky all combined. It is a disgrace to the world that should not be an app that is able to be downloaded by any human being. It so wrong and so horrible. I am very sorry to anyone who has had to see the horrible sights that are held within this app.✨👎🏻👎🏻","userName":"gehdudnwbwoodbx","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:16:40Z"}},{"id":"6173904945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"yeah just no","review":"once i opened the app it asked for my number...i don’t think it’s a good idea to give a random orange my number 😳 they night call me and i don’t want that at all..and i also heard from another rating that it opened the app the a NAKED CHEETO i just cant believe it...i am just too young to see something so...disgusting and i’m vegan so no thank you😖overall i don’t think the app is a very good app and don’t recommend getting it 🍊","userName":"🐭🥘🦆","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:12:43Z"}},{"id":"6173873472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app 0/10","review":"I am incredibly disappointed in this app. First of all it took 3 1/2 hours to download. After finally downloading I opened it up, and became very upset, everything started to glitch. So I exited the app thinking I could try again but I came to see that my entire phone was crashing. Unfortunately it became so bad that I had to get rid of my old phone just be of a stupid app. Very disappointing","userName":"hdjfbdk","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:01:16Z"}},{"id":"6173826174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Will not be downloading again.","review":"this app is terrible and i already had low expectations. the app took so long to download that my grandpa had 2 heart attacks. once i opened the app the first thing i saw was furry porn. that is not something i need to see! once that went away i started hearing noises that busted my eardrums and my dog kill itself. this is a sad true story and i will never be downloading an app from the producer ever again.","userName":"Emmmmmmà","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:43:15Z"}},{"id":"6173806469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"MY BEDBUGS KILL THEMSELVES!!

I had to bring my new phone to the Verizon store and they had to burn it because it was infected by this app. My whole house had to be rented and sprayed with anti- spray tan solution to get the gross orange residue off of the walls. The spray didn’t work so we had to burn the whole neighborhood down. We are now homeless and all infected by the orange residue.

It was really freaky. Then it started singing the savage song and dancing. Then the weird orange thing got backup dancers and started do the whip and nene. And then my phone blew up. I had to pay for a whole new phone my charging people to hookup with me. It took 2 days because I’m broke. This is a true story and it has to be heard.","userName":"hrhhdbdbanja","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:20:29Z"}}]}
