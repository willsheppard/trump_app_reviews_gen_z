Finally I would be able to get all the news from my president! \n\nHowever, when I began the download the app my phone began to glitch. I thought my phone was just being weird, however, moments later I saw many horrible images begin to flash onto my screen constantly!! Many of them were of Trump in different poses naked as the day he was born!! I was horrified so I quickly threw my phone away from me and onto my bedroom floor!\n\nWhen I creeped out of my bed to check if it was still happening it wasn’t and the app was downloading normally.  I thought that maybe I just hallucinating from being so happy but that quickly proved itself to be false 3 days later when the app finally downloaded.\n\nI was asleep when I was woken up seemingly by nothing. I checked my phone and it was 3:00 a.m. I am a very deep sleeper so it was strange to be woken up. \n\nI didn’t feel tired anymore and decided to play on my phone, but the moment I unlocked my phone it started to glitch. Black screen on and off. I sat up, weird out and about to get some water, but when I sat up my phone flashed. I looked down at it and screamed!! I saw someone in the reflection of my phone. I turned around but was only met with my wall. \n\nMy heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. I came to the conclusion that it was just my tired mind playing tricks on me and got up to get some water. I walked to my kitchen and felt as if someone was watching me the whole way. I kept looking over my shoulder on my way to my kitchen. I swear I saw something glowing orange in the corner of my living room but when I blinked it was gone.\n\nI felt the hair rise on the back of my neck and goosebumps formed up and down my arms and legs. I grabbed a glass from my cupboard and began to run the faucet. I began to fill up my cup and then heard a creek from the hallway. I froze. My cup began to overflow and I shut off the tap in an attempt to get a better listen. Another creek this time from directly behind me!\n\nI spun around to face the intruder but was dumbfounded by the sight in front of me. It was Donald Trump! He was naked and glowing orange!! He screamed and ran at me full speed! He was chanting “TRUMP 2020!” His toupee flew of his head and I shut my eyes tight, ready for the assault, but when I opened my eyes he was gone.\n\nI see him whenever I look in the mirror. Standing behind me. Naked. I tired deleting the app but it did nothing. At night I hear him whisper in my ear “Trump 2020.” I wish I never downloaded the app. Would not recommend. :/"}}]}
