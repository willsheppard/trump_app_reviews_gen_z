It took weeks to download and there is so many ads. The app even gave me a virus. Now my phone won’t stop glitching out with pop up ads saying “ vote for Donald trump 2020”. It also made me get a very bad spray tan so now I look like a Cheeto. I am warning you if you get this app you will regret it. Honestly at this point if you have the app you might as well the throw away your phone! Now I am going to make my own personal warning for this app.\nWARNING:\nThis app may cause millions of people to die due to trumps lack of care for the American people during coronavirus because all he cares about is making the economy get better. This app may also cause you to become increasingly unintelligent as well as sever orange discoloration showing up on your body. \nYou have been warned!","userName":"jken2000","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would!!!!!

He hasn’t built a wall as he promised, he’s consistently blaming democrats for the issues that occur in this country instead of taking accountability (and mind you democrats make up literally half of his citizens), and now he wants to take down one of the most unifying apps in the country out of spite of the Chinese government (even though there’s an American CEO for the tiktok we use). \nIt is clear to me that Trump is beyond unprofessional and inconsistent with his information, especially as he cries “fake news” while proceeding to make one incorrect statement after the other. If he can’t even attempt to unify his citizens let alone lead us with professionalism, I have reason to believe his app was not made to do the same. I am thoroughly unimpressed and disappointed.","userName":"meggo ponyo","title":"Here’s my issue with the app."}},{"id":"6172841054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:12:25Z","review":"Why do you people support our president. With the Ukraine scandal, proof that he raped 13 year old girls, his response to the corona virus pandemic (he called it a hoax and now its killed more then 120,000 people), and more. Why do you support this. Do you think he’s going to solve America’s problems if he already has too many of his own? Don’t you dare tell me I’m too young to understand politics when my generation are the ones who have to inherit this world. WE are the ones who are going to have to fix it or else the human race will not survive. YOU are going to be dead by the time there is an apocalypse. So stop supporting people who have no respect for Americans, please. Stop hiding yourselves from the facts, for the sake  of your futures descendants. We are counting on you to give us a say on the matter. If you don’t, we will overthrow you. Remember that.","userName":"Syna 26","title":"My parents are weird"}},{"id":"6171858122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:33:30Z","review":"I don’t recommend getting this app bc I woke up this morning to my phone being blown up by the notifications. I went down the kitchen to see my mother crying, clearly I could tell something was wrong. I wanted to ask her, I looked back at my phone and the screen cracked and slipped out of my hand on to the solid rock floor, - my phone was cracked and a paper fell on to the ground saying ‘BLM’ I thought twice and saw news about his speech talking about BLM about  ‘nOt bEiNg ImPoRtAnT... ‘ 😡😡😡😡😡😡 then a rainbow ad sort of appeared on my screen, the colors were outstanding, I loved the colors, then I thought more, I remembered that mr. orange peel didn’t like the rainbow colors, and as soon as I got my phone repaired I deleted the app, And should I say opening the app makes your screen white and maybe crack- so I recommend not getting this app. 🍊✨","userName":"no- honey","title":"Don’t vote for this orange peel 🍊✨"}},{"id":"6177835980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:51:25Z","review":"Now i actually download this app not because of the whole “gen z” take down trump thing,but because i wanted to see trump’s plans of the election. But in reality this is really the worst app Apple has included! While looking for information of trump i noticed that it started to take up the storage on my phone so much that my phone wasn’t available for almost a month! While suggesting what this app could do better i had started to get notifications on a warning that if i flies more complaints my phone will be completely unavailable! This is very unexceptional! This app is forcing kids my age to do things that they might not no about. I am very suprised that Apple has allowed this app in there store! Now i am sure everyone demands change in this store! anyways✨💜🤪👺🧚🏻💙💓😘fuck🥰🤪👺🧚🏻😚💕💛🤩 donald trump ❤️😍🤬🖕🍑🇺🇸","userName":"✨horrible✨","title":"✨horrible✨"}},{"id":"6177679963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:04:30Z","review":"I download the app just to see what my lovely 🍊was up to. As soon as I downloaded it, it was using my location without permission and when I told it not too, it called me rude and fat. I thought our lovely ra_ist (c or p you fill it in) President would show some respect to me for actually trying this app. But instead it takes over my phone and starts flying across the room hitting my parents in the face. Then as I put my i formation in, it spams me with emails telling me to put my secret information in. Now I live on the streets cause my parents got tired of my phone hitting them in the face. I have no job, no money, and no home. And I tried to contact the president but no answer. I guess that means it was my fault for getting into my situation. Overall I lost all of my life over this app and would not download it again.","userName":"Nono298471","title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6177477388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:00:24Z","review":"So I downloaded this app thinking it was gonna be helpful and have real IMPORTANT information, but I have learned some unsettling things with this app such as Trump is lying about his hight ??? Apparently he’s actually a short king and is 5’5 like WHAT !? That one I looked past and tried to find new lovely things about MY PRESIDENT, until it tapped into all my Alexa’s and starting playing some loud loud song that was very vulgar and scared my baby twin sons awake so I then had to deal with two baby boys screaming AND this vulgar loud song, then thankfully my husband came home from work (he didn’t get home about an hour after this started !!) and tried to fix it, but he couldn’t !!! He had to break every single one of our Alexa’s and both of our sons have lost hearing in their right ear and almost the other one !!! THIS IS A BAD APP !!!!","userName":"Kaighlyn","title":"I am so heartbroken 💔"}},{"id":"6177133054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:21:07Z","review":"I got on the app and immediately I saw this hideous orange looking blob type thing. I was nearly blinded by its ugliness. It looks like this Cheeto had a bad spray tan job. I continued into the app and it showed me then that I needed to sign up. It kept telling me sign up or you cannot enter the app so I screamed at it like any other normal person but it didn’t listen to me. It kept telling me to sign up but I didn’t want to I just wanted to see what the app was all about. This orange nasty looking to the thing kept appearing on my screen I did not know what to do because I was nearly blinded the first time. This app was deaf because it could not understand that I did not want to sign up. To make it worse, it kept telling me to vote for 2020 president. This app was all around bad, and the worst experience of my life. Do you not download this app.","userName":"tik tok👉🏾❤️👌🏼✊😍💅😻","title":"Worst app ever"}}]}
