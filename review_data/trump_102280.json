Get ready for a true horror story. \n\nSo I got a text from this group chat talking about a lot of one star reviews being left here. I’m for that so I pull it up, and realize I can’t make a Review until I get the app. Well shoot😐. So I download it. It finishes downloading and then my entire screen goes black. I can hear in the background some Mario final boss music. Then everything goes back to normal. I open my phone and to my dismay, I see that all of my apps are just trump 2020. I tried to delete them but every time I delete 1, 2 more pop up. So I decide that I have to go into the app to try to stop this madness. I pull it up. And the first thing I see is a huge link to trumps only fans. I skip that as fast as I can. Now it makes you put in your email and name and all that Jazz so I do that. \n\nThen... it lists off my address. My email password my Apple ID password my phone password and my social security number. And both of my parents credit card info. I then get a text. It starts off mellow. “Hey, so and so don’t forget to vote for Donald trump” then it gets scary. “Or else we will blackmail you and force you to watch trumps only fans.” I get scared. I go back to the app and go to the main page. There’s 3 buttons. One says vote for trump. The other says vote for trump and the last one says vote for Bernie. I didn’t know what to do so I press vote for Bernie. Nothing happens for a few seconds. Then all the sudden a man in all black is choking me from behind. He threatens to kill me if I don’t go back and vote for Donald trump. I refuse. He then prys one of my finger nails off. I scream. AHHHHHHHHH. He says “ do it now or else.”  I know I can’t so I stall. I point to my window “LOOK OVER THERE” he looks and I punch him in the face. He drops to the floor instantly because I’m a body builder. \n\nI then grab my phone smash it and tell my family to pack up NOW. We rush into the car and ride all the way to Mexico and drive straight through the wall around Mexico. We now live somewhere in Mexico. We are not disclosing our whereabouts for fear trump will find us. My family now lives in constant fear of being found. \n\nThat’s why I gave this a 1 star review. I don’t recommend getting it.","userName":"mynameisbobqwerty","rating":1}},{"id":"6173518971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:52:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"y’all dumb ❤️","review":"why do you support this orange? what good has he done? anyways this app so stinky. nasty nasty.","userName":"melania trump😹😏😯🙄😳","rating":1}},{"id":"6173514671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible","review":"just absolutely terrible!!!!!","userName":"hficickydutdtix","rating":1}},{"id":"6173488278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ew","review":"you get a 1 star just cuz you finna take tiktok away from us","userName":"YUHHHHH GET INTO IT","rating":1}},{"id":"6173486538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:41:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad","review":"No just no!!!!!!
