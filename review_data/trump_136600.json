Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. (it wouldn’t let me do the whole bee movie script but this was the best i could do😎)"}},{"id":"6180171425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lorryvickytony","title":"𝕋𝕠𝕜𝕥𝕠𝕜","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T08:55:43Z","rating":1,"review":"𝕀 𝕒𝕞 𝕥𝕒𝕜𝕖𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕒𝕡𝕡 𝕕𝕠𝕨𝕟 𝕓𝕔...

It took me a couple of days to realize the app was the culprit for the constant freezing and glitching.

Ok so I woke up this morning and just had an urge to install this app, I really don’t know why but that’s besides the point. And by “woke up this morning” I mean 3 pm🥱.So anyways I tried installing the app but it took like 3 days like bruh💀.\nBut as soon as it installed it started asking me some very inappropriate questions like,\nWhat’s ur zip code?, What is ur phone number? And etc. Like why does Mr.trumpet want MY phone number😳. But me being my lil ahh self, I gave him my number. Strangely immediately after it took me off the app, but I didn’t think much of it because either way I was hungry and in need of a light snack. And by light snack I mean like 10 tacos de asada😌 🌮 . So after I’m done with my “light snack”, I head back to my room and grab my phone and for whatever reason I wanted to look at my pictures so I did. AND U WILL NOT BELIEVE  WHAT I SAW. All of my pictures were gone and were all replaced with some very strange pictures of ORANGES 🍊. So I ran to tell my mom but she was asleep so I decided not to bother her. Ok that was a lie I actually tried everything to wake her up but the women would not wake up🙄. Eventually I gave up and decided it was time for my late afternoon walk with my pet donkey. As I was walking my pet donkey on her leach I got a text from an unknown number, it said the following: IM WATCHING YOU. But I get strange text like this a lot of times. They’re actually the only notifications I get plus weather alerts since I have no friends😔. I know what ur thinking, Who wouldn’t wanna be friends with me and my donkey? It’s ok I ask myself that all the time but people say it’s strange to have a pet donkey but I don’t see how🤷🏻\u200D♀️. But anyways back to the story. So I decide to just brush off the text messages and head back home. So as I’m asleep I quickly wake up to the sound of something outside my window. And I immediately get a bunch of text telling me to “VOTE FOR TRUMP” and some even threatening to hurt my donkey🥺. But I am not an easily scared person so I run outside ready to confront the person outside my window, but not forgetting to bring my handy dandy butter knife ofc. And as I’m walking outside I see my donkey being shoved in a van by a faceless, walking orange🍊. I tried to run to him but it was to late. He had taken my donkey never to be seen again😭. So right now I’m telling u DO NOT INSTALL THE APP THEY WILL TRACK U AND STEAL UR PET DONKEY😱. And R.I.P to my beloved Donkey🥺💙🕊."}},{"id":"6180169684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Beckyblosser55555","title":"Do NOT download!!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T08:55:04Z","rating":1,"review":"This app took SEVERAL days to download. When it finally DID download, it IMMEDIATELY asked for my phone number. I thought it was one of those things where it would send updates about our lovely president, Donald Trump however, I began to receive TERRIFYING messages asking for pictures of my feet. I am a MINOR. When I refused, I began to receive messages calling me a dumb ginger and telling me to “stop thinking out loud Ed Sheeran” which is EXTREMELY offensive!! I was very concerned because there should be no way of knowing my hair color over the text messages. I then began to receive messages stating my address, full name, social security number, date of birth, and other very scary personal information that should not have been known. I came home from practice the following day to my family missing, my cat hanged and skinned, furniture floating, house trashed, and my goldfish dead on the couch. I found disturbing notes and a trail of blood leading me to my dead family. This has been a VERY traumatizing experience. Please please PLEASE do NOT download this app if you value being happy. I loved President Trump but now I simply cannot support him after what happened to my family after I downloaded this app."}},{"id":"6180169363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hello_im_the_goat","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T08:54:56Z","rating":1,"review":"Absolutely horrible, trump and his whole campaign is a joke, does not deserve to be president again! #blacklivesmatter #allcountriesmatter #bernie2020"}},{"id":"6180169369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wkdkjfj","title":"I used to like oranges","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T08:54:56Z","rating":1,"review":"I used to like oranges then I downloaded this app😔😭.
