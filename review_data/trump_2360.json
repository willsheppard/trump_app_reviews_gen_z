I couldn’t even download my favorite songs on my phone after getting this app 🙄. My battery is always draining and I have to constantly keep my iPhone on a charger. But that didn’t work either because it broke my iPhone charger!!! So with now a dead phone I made my way over to google, and my phone suddenly came on!!! But my home screen was covered in Trump 2020, and pictures of Trump. So I made my way over to delete this horrible app. And when I did, my phone BLEW UP. So I’m currently typing this review on my stove. Moral of the story is, learn from my experience and NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP. The developers really need to fix it but it’s so bad that the just might as well DELETE IT OFF THE APP STORE. 🧚🏾\u200D♀️ ✨","rating":1,"title":"No ✨❤️","userName":"GirlWithoutAName101","date":"2020-07-09T01:29:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174381986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I went to open this app and when I opened it, there it was. This orangutans nasty wrinkled ball sack. I mean i’m not surprised but the indecency there are pet gold fishes on this app now being scarred for the rest of there lives. My very own chicken/labrador mix opened this app at 9:99 in the morning and his ball sack wrinkled up and dried when he saw trumps nudes. My pet dinosaur stopped growing when he saw just a picture of Donald trump trying to eat, and that’s why I say that this app should be deleted IMMEDIATELY, no other chicken hybrid, dinosaur or human needs to go through the trauma me and my pets have been put through. I now have to go to therapy for the next 3000 years and my therapist (my chicken labrador mix) says i may never get better. This needs to be taken off the app store.\n     Sincerely \n\n-Donald J Trump","rating":1,"title":"just no","userName":"Mikaela_m","date":"2020-07-09T01:04:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174272145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE🤬 where do I even start😠 first of all this dumb app took two days to load and while it was loading my 200 year old boyfriend dumped me!

As soon as I opened this app, i’m greeted with a wrinkly, bald-headed, Big Ed neck having, old man 🤢. Then right after that my body and brain just shut down from seeing that horrible mess. i was literally 𝗮𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 into another dimension because it was so ugly. My parents had to witness me spazzing out on the floor of room, I couldn’t imagine what they were feeling at that moment 😔. Now here’s the tea, when my parents rushed over to me they saw my phone with the orange raisin on it. And of course they started spazzing out too, anyone would if they saw that 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜. So long story short, both me and my parents died in the hospital. This is my angry spirit writing a review for this app. So unless you’re suicidal, then DO NOT download this app 😡🙅🏽\u200D♀️.","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely disgusting 🤮","userName":"bootay liquer","date":"2020-07-08T23:09:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174049568","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app, I thought it was going to be cool but it wasn’t. Seeing a naked Cheeto with my eyes and no protection I had to go get eye surgery. It was horrible. When I went to the ER they said the damage was so severe that I needed NEW eye balls. When my boyfriend saw it, he had to get eye surgery too. 😔 This app has costed me thousands of dollars due to the damage it caused me and my boyfriend. If you want to get this app, have fun going to the hospital and paying the price. After recovering from our injuries and returning home, our fridge and microwave were gone!! The app stole our kitchen appliances. Now I have to go to the store and buy the new appliances. I’ll have to tell them that this trump app was a scam and costed me even more money. If I was able to rate this app even lower, it would be -♾/5.","rating":1,"title":"One word: blehhhh 🤮🤮","userName":"Queen Kittens","date":"2020-07-08T23:06:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174009366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve never been so disturbed. Literally opening this app gave me cheeto fingers. My phone is covered in that nasty orange dust now like come on. When I tried to clean it off my hands just kept shrinking in size and now they’re just so small! And idk what happened! And I noticed I got a bit repetitive and stopped making sense? So I’m panicking. I’m panicking and freaking out. And really, the funny thing about that is, you know I freak out sometimes. And I think everyone does. But people don’t freak out like I do. I’m really the best at it. Like no one comes close to how I do. It’s wild, really. And then, you know, others will say that they were disturbed or weirded out or freaked out, and I’ll say well so was I. And I think that’s important to know. So much winning.\n\nThis app is a bigly disappointment.","rating":1,"title":"y i k e s","userName":"Pizza tastes good","date":"2020-07-08T22:51:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173783259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.\n\nBut she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only \n\nbe broken by love's first kiss.\n\nShe was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing \n\ndragon.\n\nMany brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, \n\nbut non prevailed.\n\nShe waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest \n\ntower for her true love and true love's first kiss.\n\n{Laughing} \n\nLike that's ever gonna happen.\n\n{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}\n\nWhat a load of - \n\nSomebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\n\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\n\nShe was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\n\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\n\nThe years start comin' and they don't stop comin'\n\nFed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'\n\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\n\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\n\nSo much to do so much to see\n\nSo what's wrong with takin' the backstreets\n\nYou'll never know if you don't go\n\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\n\nHey, now You're an all-star\n\nGet your game on, go play\n\nHey, now You're a rock star\n\nGet the show on, get paid\n\nAnd all that glitters is gold\n\nOnly shootin' stars break the mold","rating":1,"title":"ew trump gross","userName":"hobiiiiiiii","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173714606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took a WEEK to download! i couldn't do anything else while i was waiting on this app to download, just for it to immediately show me this CURSED image of an orange man holding his fist up like he would punch me!! i still have nightmares because of it 😔 and, to make matters worse, my phone started leaking orange juice and saying \"white power!\" \"white power!\" my question is, why is white his favorite color?? \nwe have so many other colors, like brown, black, tan, gray, etc.\nand also, after my phone was done with the orange juice, it tried to hack me to get my number! my phone still smells like orange juice, and i can't get a new one 😡😡 i would recommend to never get this app if you value your phone's capability of working. i am currently writing this review on my apple watch 😾","rating":1,"title":"i hate it!!","userName":"lexxytruu","date":"2020-07-08T21:01:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173659794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Be careful when you sign-up using your phone number!! The app uses your number to track your location, and then it sends your address and personal information to cults near you.\nI didn’t realize this at the time, but I thought the girls were innocent entrepreneurial children, but those psychos were insane! They showed up at my house with MAGA merchandise, and since I’m a true American Citizen, I let them in so I could purchase my President’s merchandise. \nOnce I closed the door, I was knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I saw that the girls drew a Satanic Circle on the floor in blue blood and they were calling upon the spirits of the Democratic party. They kept chanting “Free Healthcare” and “Pro-Choice” ... I was terrified. I bolted out of the house and barely escaped with my life. \nTrump 2020 🥳💕✨🧚🏼 for Prison","rating":1,"title":"Brought a CULT to my home!!!!! 😱","userName":"G@bb¥22","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:43Z","isEdited":false}}]}
