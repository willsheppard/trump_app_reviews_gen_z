First, the app took all day to download. Mind you, I have THE best wifi, living here in America. It probably took so long because Mr Donald crammed all of his ego into it, filling the system, and my phone with trash. Anyways, I’ve had the app for weeks now. And guess what? NO ORANGES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED. I’m tired of broken promises from our president. It’s bad enough he looks like a burnt orange. I hate it here.

I am greatly confused. It also shows this logo called “MAGA”? that’s the name i used to call my grandma, does my grandma run this app? If so, that explains why there are a few spelling and punctuation errors. Overall, I was unsatisfied with how it was run. The president of the United States is not a marketing product, a brand, or something to exploit. he is here to do one thing: serve the people, and he has been doing the exact opposite, ❤️tikok💗should🍪stay🎂","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:47Z","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"callistivity"}},{"id":"6177635539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to see what our Cheeto was doing with this app so I downloaded it to see what he was doing because I wanted to see what he was doing. It crashed every time I opened it and I couldn’t see what he was doing with the app, which is why I downloaded the app, to see what he was doing. This app then crashed my entire phone and I was no longer able to see anything trump related because now my phone is broken. I expected better from Donald J Trump, how could he do this to his people 🤬🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-09T17:50:13Z","title":"😡🤬TRASH","isEdited":false,"userName":"pHaTcOOchie420"}},{"id":"6177543788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Let me tell you, I tried this app out in hopes it would allow me to meet all the celebrities I like but n o, it only shows me news about Trump. I wanted to speak to the manager but it wouldn’t allow me to and so I have my rights to send forth this complaint. I hope you are happy with how you made this app because I sure am not, how am I supposed to use this app if I can’t even speak to a manager. I am very disappointed in all of you who made this app, I hope you all have a bad day. 😌","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:51Z","title":"The manager","isEdited":false,"userName":"bob philberg"}},{"id":"6177523151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app is terrible. as soon as I downloaded it, I got a notification saying that Trump hated me because since I am Asian, I started the coronavirus. then, as I was using the app, I got notifications from my friends who had also downloaded the app saying that the app called them racist, homophobic slurs. it also hacked my phone and deleted everything. i just got a new phone and had to restart everything. this app is horrible, and needs to be taken off the app store IMMEDIATELY!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T17:14:27Z","title":"💖horrible💖","isEdited":false,"userName":"Please get lives back!"}},{"id":"6177470587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this wonderful amazing app to support our very progressive president himself! but whenever i downloaded it, it asked me to enter my phone number. this is a violation of my privacy, but i went through with it anyways. as soon as i got the text, i was in utter shock. it called me FAT and VERY mean slurs 🤬🤬 not very nice. i believe the libtards are behind this one. sure, im anti vax, carry, and eat mcdonalds on the daily, but i do NOT deserve this RACISM from the libtards. obama strikes again. black privilege is REAL people!! all lives matter!!!!!!! cheeto for 2020 😍","date":"2020-07-09T16:58:25Z","title":"NOT cool 🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"ashariii"}},{"id":"6177459732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was scammed and lied to. This soggy peach killed my pet dog, snake. I’m deeply saddened by the loss and can never get those hours back. My snakey poo was blind and deaf and had lost feelings in his wittle paws and tail. The app has destroyed my life. Save yourself. Us gen z are unstoppable.

My wife left me for a woman, and my 2 kids tried to put poison in my coffee. Because of this app, I no longer have a family and I am forced to sit in my motel room eating stale, vending machine snacks while watching hentai and crying myself to sleep.

Getting this app was the worst mistake I’ve ever made and I’m warning you...if you get this app, you’ll end up alone in a dirty motel room just like me. :(","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:03Z","title":"THIS APP WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.

I went to the hospital, and as soon as I walked in, everyone around me dropped to the floor dead. I was so confused, so I went to find my father and he told me to go to the tallest cliff in the state to find out who did this to him. After a 4 hour hike, I made it to the top of the cliff, and what do I have a perfect view of from the top? That’s right. A trump tower.
