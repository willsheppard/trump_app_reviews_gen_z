When I opened the app it started to play a scratchy music which made my phone’s audio break which now it makes any sound that comes out of my phone horrible and scratchy. This app should get deleted before somebody else gets the virus I did. I have to get a new phone now.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173839543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:48:26Z","rating":1,"title":"Do not download","userName":"Chris091596","review":"Once i downloaded this app I immediately got an incurable virus called “possession of orange” I’m very furious because I have been waiting four years for my trump care to go through😡 While I was on hold with customer service the music possessed my cat and she started to light my house on fire I  am very upset that there is no Fox News in the hospital!

I tried to put it out but it was emmiting very loud noise. So I tried to silence it but then my dogs started having seizures. So I ran to help them, they died and their body’s caught my backyard on fire and burned my whole house killing me and my family.

I had this app on my phone for at least one week in total before it gave me phone a virus. It got so bad to the point where my phone wouldn’t even unlock. I was forced to buy a whole NEW phone. This is not fake news. Please be careful and don’t download this awful app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173788338","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:28:44Z","rating":1,"title":"would NEVER recommend 🤢","userName":"S0L1DSN4K3","review":"i wanted to see what the hype was about from all my family members so i downloaded. first off it took about 4 hours to install and whenever the app would open it would play unexplainable annoying and ear piercing noise. because the noise was so loud it ended up giving the lady in the apartment next to me a heart attack and she passed away. 0/10 👎🏼","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173771142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:22:19Z","rating":1,"title":"The worst possible app","userName":"GymFreak8699","review":"On top of taking DAYS to download, when it was finally ready to open, it crashed my phone and now it randomly resets and is full and random bugs.
