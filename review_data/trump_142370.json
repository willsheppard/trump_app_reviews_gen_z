Okay first of all I tried to download this app and let me tell you I was reading reviews about how long it took BUT THIS WAS ANOTHER LEVEL. Legit this app took TWO MONTHS to download like are you kidding me?! And let me tell you it was not a storage issue bc I literally have the max amount of storage an iPhone can have because I don’t like to delete things. Ever. That being said this app made me so angry with its incompetence that I had no choice but to delete it. Not to mention all my very important emails WERE DELETED upon the the installation of this app. I already said once that I don’t like to delete things and I lost YEARS WORTH of very special and important emails from Duolingo. I MEAN WHAT ON EARTH. That being said I had no choice but to cut this app out of my life. I would give negative stars if that were possible."}},{"id":"6179311071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sketchy App","date":"2020-07-10T03:47:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Kaylerr!","review":"The app kept closing every time I would open it.
