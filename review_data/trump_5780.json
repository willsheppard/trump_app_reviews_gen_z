The app glitches a lot which caused my walls to start turning into jello, I fell through my floor trying to close the app. It also makes you cry uncontrollably from the vile pictures and articles. I just turned 69 years and 420 hours old and downloading this app was the biggest regret of my life. I will live in sorrow and hatred because of it, and I would hate for it to happen to anyone else. This app will ruin your life. TRUST ME ✋✨❤️🐀"}},{"id":"6173891279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:46Z","userName":"gdmefbhdxvb","review":"It crashed my phone more then 5 times before it could open and when it did it started to play this weird music I just thought it was the background well my dogs didn’t like it and started going crazy and got lose and bite someone and then my phone froze on the app I tried everything to stop it even went to the phone store and well they couldn’t help me so now because of this app I had to get a whole new iPhone when I just got a brand new one.

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal beep. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start"}},{"id":"6173778768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Yea no","date":"2020-07-08T21:25:07Z","userName":"Alex🥳🤪","review":"This app was absolutely horrible. Idek what the chetto puff was thinking with this one. It made my phone glitch and every time I opened the app all that was on it was a picture of trump 2020 and the star spangled banner playing in the background. Like no if ur going to do that might as well put it on a gravestone cuz ain’t nobody wanna see that. And it gets worse from there trust me. If u stick around long enough, the app makes ur phone glitch to a picture of him and his baby chetto downstairs if yk what I mean. So don’t download this trust me it does wayyy more harm than good. Now if you’ll excuse me I’m otw to hype up MY PRESIDENT Obama."}},{"id":"6173764876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Misleading App!!!","date":"2020-07-08T21:20:01Z","userName":"Shnouty","review":"I downloaded this app as a way to support my favorite monkey in office and was terribly mislead as to what the app would offer. As soon as I opened the app I was shown a live feed into the presidents office and my, the things I’ve seen. The sound of the president through the feed was so treacherous that it was able to reach the ears of every dog nearby in the neighborhood and these dogs surrounded my home making me feel very unsafe. Even my own dog began attacking me. All this terror eventually lead to my death. This app killed me and this is my only way to warn future users as a dead person. Thanks!"}},{"id":"6173741834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrific App want to speak to the manager","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:34Z","userName":"Fox News🥰🥳😌","review":"This app immediately hacked all my personal information while crashing my device. My device was unable to be used for days. This Cheeto said this app would be “hugggee” and all it did was send the Chinese government after me and my family. Now I have to move as this app sent all my personal information to China and I now have Chinese adverts and rats blowing up my device and leaving tons of bricks at my door. This app was nothing that it said it would be and now I have to deal with the Chinese government while the Cheeto man cries over tik tok"}},{"id":"6173706298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download 🖐🏽😑","date":"2020-07-08T20:58:32Z","userName":"jcrkznoJwclhrcl","review":"I downloaded the app so that I can try and support the orange Cheeto and I must say DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. After I downloaded the app I was trying to figure it out bc it’s very ✨stoopid✨ and i just couldn’t do it. I left it alone so I could worry about it another day. Later that night I was having these weird dreams about  crazy obsessed Cheeto supporters (despite him having a little Cheeto himself iykyk 👀) SCREAMING AT ME “ Trump 2020” “Vote Trump” I got so scared I panicked, deleted the app and powered off my phone. The next day when I turned my phone back on everything was normal.

As I stared at the sentence trying to figure out what I was chosen for my whole house started shaking then 69 obese Cheeto puffs broke into my room and said I was worthy of votes! Then they started singing a song which went “I K C K E K” and I began to levatate so I decided to jump from levating which made me fly then I said u will never get votes off me and I kicked them in the butts then fed them to my dogs😌🥳"}},{"id":"6173650262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This isn’t a joke","date":"2020-07-08T20:38:19Z","userName":"Rich Kid Swag 🤠🗿✊","review":"I downloaded this app because tiktok was telling me to go clown the president but I wanted to be supportive of him instead so I downloaded the app as soon as I downloaded this app I got a notification on my phone saying my iCloud account had been hacked so I just thought it was a random notification but then our WiFi started to glitch out and my parents were noticing random malware on their computers this app not only hacked into all my personal information but also my family’s personal information completely unacceptable DO NOT get this app 😡"}}]}
