Nothing works properly and it’s set up honestly makes no sense. I really do not understand how one app could be so bad. Please do not bother letting this app take up space on your phone. You would be much better off downloading literally anything else."}},{"id":"6179387808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ew🤢🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-10T04:13:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"swagdoodoofart","review":"This is just embarrassing chile making your own app doesn’t win you the election.

I was trying to get the app that was created for the current president but I just saw this weird orange guy as the cover photo when I opened it up. I’m just really confused. We all know that the current president of the United States is the unproblematic king, Manny so who is this sickly looking man you plastered on the home page? I think that was a lazy oversight on the part of the people who created it. Super unprofessional guys! Given that the app is obviously promoting fake news because they didn’t even get the president right I hope the app gets shut down."}},{"id":"6179387523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Fake app not worth it!","date":"2020-07-10T04:13:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Metrolink4","review":"Whoever designed this app must of used misinformation and fake news/ I mean instructions to build it."}},{"id":"6179387287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This is the worst app","date":"2020-07-10T04:13:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hdghddhdhd","review":"Super racist just saying"}}]}
