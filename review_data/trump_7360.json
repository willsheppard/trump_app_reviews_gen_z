When it was finally ready to open my phones battery began to burn out with unusual momentum.  Upon plugging the phone up to recover battery my device couldn’t hold a charge.  As my phone raced closer to battery death I was forced to delete the application for fear of never using my phone again.  I insist that nobody is to use this software at least until it has elected better management.","date":"2020-07-09T17:52:50Z","userName":"jon's terminally chill","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177565764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app made me catch on fire","review":"So there i am sitting on my couch and i think hmm lemme download this app the second i do however i get bombarded with about 80 viruses i think anonymous may have something to do with it but i went to the store so i could get it repaired and the second i get there they see the app they say no get out of here and throw me out of the store to my surprise they actually threw me into a gasoline puddle and without me noticing they lit me on fire and let me burn i am very unhappy with this app as i now have 2nd degree burns","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:48Z","userName":"gael12$","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177564119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"bad experience🙄","review":"i had a very similar experience to another woman. my house began to change into what seemed like a trump cult house. very very scary. the exterior of the house slowly started to turn orange over the next few days of my having the app. my entire wardrobe began to transform into MAGA gear and i had to leave the house NAKED! because i would not be caught dead in such outfit🥰 I do NOT recommend this app and if 0/10 was an option that is what i would choose. please if you are reading this do not vote for this DICTATOR! much love 🤩🤪🥰","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:17Z","userName":"#gethimout","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177552521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Scary Cheeto","review":"Oh my god, this app is so scary! I hate it, I downloaded it bc I wanted a horror game! But guess what, my 200 year old grandma played on my phone and opened this app! Scary Cheeto man everywhere! My poor grandma was so traumatized she now goes to the therapist for that ugly face all over the app. This was worse than the talking orange incident. She was traumatized by that alone, I can’t imagine what this app did to her. She cry’s herself to sleep, screams from nightmares of the scary evil Cheeto man, oh my god. I might have a mind to sue you guys for the trauma you put upon my poor poor granny 😔😔","date":"2020-07-09T17:23:36Z","userName":"lolqueeb","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177486545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP 🤡😭","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! It is a disgrace to society to even support Trump, therefore the app is a virus itself! You will become a clown if you get this app :(. Unfortunately I passed away due to the terrible services given from this app.\n\nI hope I didn’t know that you’re not leaving the hospital today I just got to work so so I’ll probably leave it on my fyp way you can call us tomorrow morning if I can call me and I can talk about to it haha was the way you want to talk about to it I just want you to know I gotta is it really good I wanna","date":"2020-07-09T17:03:10Z","userName":"Madi_cray","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177481995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"very disappointed","review":"it took me 2 weeks to download this app!! every night i would look and there was no progress on it. i thought trump would be dead by the time it finally downloaded tbh. anyways i had such great hopes for this app because who wouldn’t love to see what a misogynistic, white supremacist, homophobic, white man in america has to say?! i was throughly looking forward to it but NOW the app crashes each time i open it up. i’m not mad... just disappointed. you lost my vote and my respect for this one buddy.","date":"2020-07-09T17:01:46Z","userName":"the lauren black","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177426493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"PATHETIC","review":"Hello. I hope this review finds someone high up, because I have some serious issues. I was promised (PROMISED, PEOPLE) that I would receive financial compensation for taking too many tums when I was young and lost my foot for it. I find it extremely offensive that this “promise” (pathetic) was just a hoax to get me to download the app. What type of ✨radical left socialism ✨ is this? You’ve lost my vote. I hope you feel bad. \n\nI’m not even part of this gen z takedown “thing”, but good on them. This app deserves to rot in one of those virtual trash bins and then cleared.","date":"2020-07-09T16:45:05Z","userName":"cfrostie","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177378255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"As a member of the Gen Z community I feel very offended","review":"I downloaded this app to be able to support our hot Cheeto non-racist, LGBTQ+, Black Lives Matter, feminist president and instead this app showed me a different side. Showing that our president of this fine country—you know the one that was stolen and fought for “freedom” but only for white older males— that he’s really a white supremacist who degrades women, and uses hate speech just because his wallets can survive a bullet shot better than him. \n\nBut other than that Trump snapped✨🍃🧚 he should try his neck next time","date":"2020-07-09T16:31:03Z","userName":"Lolo 👁💋👁","isEdited":false}}]}
