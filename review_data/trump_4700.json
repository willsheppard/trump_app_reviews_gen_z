The most upsetting off all was a picture of cheeto himself getting spray tanned nude... we all knew this man has microscopic balls - but to be forced into actually seeing them! 🤢 my life has been traumatic since the incident and I am not sure if I will recover. Oh and also, there must’ve been a glitch or something because the app said make america great again but it seems to have forgotten to mention that he only meant for the rich white men of our corrupt country 🥰","title":"No ❤️","userName":"pleasenocheeto","date":"2020-07-08T23:12:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173978135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Literally I opened the app and the very first thing I saw was a picture of a man who is supposedly our president. The image was so repulsive and gut wrenching that I had to close the app immediately. About a week later, I mustered up the courage to open it again. The app was kind of bland. There was absolutely no flavor. I would only open the app when I was absolutely bored, but there was absolutely no content on this app that was remotely interesting. I mean, what could possibly be interesting about a moldy Cheeto. Anyway, I had a horrible experience with this app. I was disgusted, revolted, and disappointed to say the least. ✨🧚\u200D♂️💫","title":"Absolutely Garbage 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","userName":"partycity pimp","date":"2020-07-08T22:39:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173909987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was surprised to see that when i opened the app, it crashed my entire phone. i restarted it and opened it back up. luckily, my phone didn’t crash but it was SUPERRRR buggy and along with a confusing layout after you sign up, most of the buttons were unclickable. plus there was an uncomfortable amount of pictures of just...a patchy orange screen? it looked like skin tags but something that orange couldn’t be skin...anyways, i allowed notifications but i got spammed with them, they wouldn’t stop popping up, it was like there was 30 every 2 seconds. it didn’t stop until i deleted the app.","title":"terrible","userName":"awoogaba","date":"2020-07-08T22:14:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173841109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"my mom is a die hard trump supporter and downloaded this app. a few days went by and everything was fine until one day she started getting REALLY bad migraines and chest aches. we thought that she was just stressed so we told her to take a day off from work and take medication. she did that but her condition only worsened. it turns out it wasn’t stress it was the fact that she supported a cheeto puff with no functioning braincells that was causing her all that pain. she deleted the app, burned all her trump merch and stopped supporting him and since then she’s much better, even better then she was before.","title":"app almost killed my mom 😿🙀","userName":"Totinha","date":"2020-07-08T21:49:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173767008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Lets start about the fact that it takes 3 hours to load then it takes 2 hours to get inside of the app not only that but you waist 35min because of the glitch i only bought this app because i needed more vitamins and i saw and orange ok. I finally opened to app to find a horrific man standing infront of me he was so i cant even describe how terrifying it was to look at whatever that thing was that you cult leading bunker boi following trumpys call your presidnet because that aint mine.

I rushed 🏃\u200D♀️to the bathroom and saw that I was turning ORANGE 🍊 I heard a banshee 😈 screaming and turned to see the Cheeto 🟠 himself swooping down upon me with his jaw hinges wider than possible. I yelled “EQUALITY!!!” To confuse him and ran past him. After a while, I ran back to see if he was still there but he was gone. The whole house was drenched in an orange goop from mr 🍤. I heard footsteps behind me and found none other than my lord and savior Barron Trump. “Quick!” He said, grabbing my arm. He rushed me over to where my phone sat, trump app open. I quickly deleted this app and am lucky to have survived. So no, I do not recommend!","title":"Very Ratchet","userName":"gehehejksjsndnxjdksksk","date":"2020-07-08T21:01:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173624426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m just so disappointed in this app. All I wanted to do was show my support for our amazing leader, so I downloaded this app. Once I did, everything on my phone immediately translated to Russian! As much as I support our amazing president’s best friends, I’m behind on my Russian lessons and can’t understand what is being said. If the app would add a better Translator it would be greatly appreciated. I also was a little taken a back when I found the section that had all of the inappropriate pictures of what were clearly underaged girls! I’m not surprised, but I do wish there was an option to hide them. Very disappointed.","title":"😔😔","userName":"screamingloudly1","date":"2020-07-08T20:29:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173617965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app was very poorly designed. Everything was so patriotic and absurdly overwhelming ugly that I actually asked the universe to make me color blind. Being on the app for more that 3 minutes makes your phone overheat so much that you have no choice but to get off. The app is also very laggy, with many many bugs. Also the phrase “keep America great again” was plastered all over my screen which I think is very rude and a total lie because america is currently suffering because the man in charge doesn’t even know how to handle a virus. Ugly app. Bugs. Laggy. Obese man on my screen. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮👎👎","title":"App ruins your phone do not download","userName":"Please just update the game","date":"2020-07-08T20:26:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173607939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app caused my phone to blow up!!!! 😠 i downloaded it so i could educate myself on daddy orange 🍊🧡but instead my phone was blown to pieces!!! not only that, but i was then put in a trance ✨ by this terrible app and compelled to drop kick my chicken 🐔 across the street!! thank god i broke free, but not before summoning a cockroach 🐜 army into my house! now i have an infestation, i’m out on a chicken, and i had to buy a whole new phone 📱! not only that, but i never even got the opportunity to educate 🧠 myself! don’t put yourself through the trouble and stay away from this app and it’s mystical powers. 🌌 DON’T LISTEN TO THE BOOMERS SAYING IT’S SAFE, THEY’RE STILL UNDER THE TRANCE!!!!","title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS TERRIFYING APP","userName":"rachel autumn austin","date":"2020-07-08T20:23:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
