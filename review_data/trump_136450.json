The orange monster’s face is the first thing you have to see when you open the app. 🤢 Even worse, he’s holding up the world’s tiniest fist like a little baby that’s banging on a table because he’s not getting enough attention. Seeing this made my stomach hurt, I actually thought I might puke. Luckily, I closed out of the app fast enough and thinking about Obama’s sweet handsome face calmed me down. Deleting this off my phone immediately. I hope Apple will do us all a favor and delete this from the App Store asap so we can save other innocent people from enduring the trauma that is experienced from downloading and opening this app.","date":"2020-07-10T09:18:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"cah_95","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6180235957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I see you here trying to drop kick TikTok but none of us are having it and we’re alll ready to drop kick the dusty crusty cheeto out of the white house I mean like common if your president shouldn’t you be able to afford decent spray tan???????
