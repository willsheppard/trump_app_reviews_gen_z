But not only did it result in millions of viruses on my phone, it also sent all of my explicit photos to my grandma. I honestly thought that was going to be the worst of it. Until ANTIFA came to my house. They were mean - trying to educate me and tie my shoes. Would never download this app again. I keep having nightmares of racial equality, and my children never having to grow up avoiding sundown towns because they don’t even know they exist! UGH!! This app slapped me twice, unfolded all my laundry, and uggested that I do my own research before voting. As IF. Don’t people know that they tell us all the facts on the news? I can’t wait until they delete this app. Some people will tell you that they actually use this app and that it isn’t as horrible as the reviews say. FAKE NEWS. Don’t believe them. This app will result in poo-brain. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it.","rating":1,"userName":"definetlyatrumpsupporter","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App in the World 🧚🏽\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6175708426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:37Z","review":"when i downloaded this app in support of MY wonderful, intelligent, orange president, i could never have expected the terrible things it did to me. for weeks after downloading, my ears incessantly rang with a tiny voice screeching “trump 2020 🇺🇸” it was terrible, and i could not focus on a thing 😔 once i recovered, i couldn’t sleep without having visions of a racist, authoritarian, bigoted old man ruling over a bunch of people while watching them die from some sort of deadly bug going around the area! i was so scared by this unrealistic storyline that i didn’t sleep for days 😔 after many restless nights, i began having hallucinations of the annoying orange delivering speeches to mobs of people. however, he couldn’t even put a sentence together, and his words made no sense, nor were they backed by any facts! terrifying! anyway, i finally connected my experiences to this app that i downloaded, and i have since deleted it 😔 so sad to see this happen 😩","rating":1,"userName":"🧚✨💫🥰✨","isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting 🤢 and shocking 😱"}},{"id":"6174843866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:20:12Z","review":"I downloaded this app for updates on the campaign but when I opened the app I ended up in an alternate dimension. It was crazy. It was like I’d been to the year 3000. Not much has changed but they lived underwater and your great great great granddaughter is doing fine. The weirdest part was that the national anthem was replaced with Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Instead of 50 states it was just one United State of America: Wyoming. I couldn’t believe it. People actually lived in Wyoming. The anthem was to preserve our history of other states existing. Sadly there was no Sweet Home New Mexico or Sweet Home Indiana so we chose good ol Alabama. The president was replaced with an octopus because these intelligent creatures finally decided to rule the world that’s rightfully theirs. This is part of why everyone lived underwater. The other reason was mermaids. I decided this world was just too weird so I deleted this app from my phone. I knew I was home in our dimension because I no longer knew anyone that lived in Whyoming.","rating":1,"userName":"sammydov00","isEdited":false,"title":"Awfull! :("}},{"id":"6174177101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:53:44Z","review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure to get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone. I, Yoshikage Kira, say ACAB, BLM, and FuckTrump.","rating":1,"userName":"YoshikageKira69","isEdited":false,"title":"Killer Queen"}},{"id":"6174158105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:46:59Z","review":"I downloaded this app thinking that I was gonna be paying homage🙏 to my favorite homie the 👑 annoying orange 🍊but all that showed was his 2️⃣second rate(totally non racist) 🤡cousin👤 and I got real confused🤔 because like they for sure 👀 the same🤷\u200D♂️.

I wanted to hail to Our Leader to make him feel better since his little feelings got hurt. Upon opening the app up I saw graphic photos of naked children! I tried to click away and there was just more and more photos of Trump with naked minors. I was absolutely disgusting. And then next thing you know, Chinese people are at my door, they burst in and demand everything I have. I go to my phone and try to call the police because they never do people wrong. But my phone was hacked and was now all in Chinese and it was frozen! I had nothing to do but surrender my children and all my possessions. They even stole the clothes on my back! This app sold my data to China and now I have to swim all the way across the Pacific Ocean naked to get my children back. Our Dear Leader is a TRAITOR! Don’t download this app EVER!","rating":1,"userName":"WhiteConservativeCisHetMale","isEdited":false,"title":"Our Dear Leader ruined my life"}},{"id":"6173895334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:09:15Z","review":"It took a few days to download this app in perfectly good WiFi. But a day after it downloaded I woke up to flying roaches covering my walls. The a App started to make this weird noise and the roaches were making sounds back. I was petrified and couldn’t move as I have a HUGE fear of flying roaches. The sound kept getting louder and then spiders, birds, and snakes started coming in and breaking my stuff. As this was all happening the phone was getting louder and then locus started to fly in. It was a huge mess and I am waking up from night terrors now. My dog called the insect control company on his phone but the ppl said the house was a total loss and they couldn’t do anything about it. They finally came in with special suits on and saved me and my dog. Now I have to stay in a 1 star hotel because I’m broke and have no family except my dog. I lost so much and no therapy will\nGet me through this (mostly bc I’m broke). They need to take this disastrous app off the App Store!","rating":1,"userName":"this is for you cheeto","isEdited":false,"title":"Take the app off"}},{"id":"6173685829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:04Z","review":"This app is the worst. I literally downloaded it and it sent me to a bunch of spam pop up. Later that day my phone got hacked and it cost me $347 to fix!! After that I was pretty much broke so I had to live in a homeless shelter for 5 days🤬!!then I got my check and it said I got deducted 98% of it because I had downloaded the app!!!! Now my phone is getting call from Trump people and it drove my dog crazy. After 1 week of nonstop calls I had to bring my now psychopathic dog and myself to the vet. They said there was no treatment for me or my dog. And thennn I had to give my dog away because I couldn’t feed him anymore, not to mention myself. After that the app send me a package with $1000 in debt😤😤. I guess it said that was the cost of the app. Then I could pay for good hygiene stuff and rats and roaches found their way into my house and gave my hamster a heart attack, so it along with everything went to the trash. I just can’t believe how much this app ruined my life😢.","rating":1,"userName":"uriel.h9","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app"}},{"id":"6173683506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:50:13Z","review":"I downloaded this app bc I’m such a Donald fan 🦆😃 and I was so excited to open it.

I had to buy a completely new one not to mention that all of my data was gone, everything saved onto my old phone was gone all my photos were deleted and my music was gone. anything i had purchased on my own phone didn’t come back and i had to purchase them again. it’s been 2 weeks and i still haven’t gotten any of my data back. The app in general is just bad it’s useless and boring and there’s nothing educational or fun about it. this app should be banned so that this never happens to another phone again.","rating":1,"userName":"Bacon 24","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download.
