Somehow, the moldy cheetoh made telekinetic racial slurs to me and I found that very offensive! And for some reason, my eyes had to look at a disgusting picture of this moldy cheetoh getting a spray tan and I was forced to look at his tiny shrimp!!🤏🏽🍤And not to mention that I was DEEPLY offended, by his existence. It boils in my blood because for some reason he felt the need to just BE ALIVE!! Thank you for your gratitude! Have a nice day!☺️🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"Joshs butt","date":"2020-07-09T01:54:17Z"}},{"id":"6174547935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No ❤️👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and was very disturbed with what I saw. The first thing I saw was a little Cheeto man doing yoga and it was ✨disgusting ✨. It made me want to wash my eyes out with ✨bleach✨ and use a toaster. But instead of making breakfast, I wanted to use it as a bath bomb 😊🤩💗🦄✨😌. This app is a waste of space and when I downloaded it I was filled with immediate ✨regret✨. My dog happened to see this Cheeto boy do the downward dog and had to be rushed to the vet because her eyes were bleeding 😍. 👁🩸👄🩸 👁. (Exact representation of my dog 🤩)","userName":"selener 👀","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:18Z"}},{"id":"6174523045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever🤮🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I hated this app so much.

And all it kept talking about was this guy with a fake tan and i thought I was gonna get something a lot more from this app but ig not🙄🙄🙄","userName":"byeeeeee34","date":"2020-07-09T01:46:13Z"}},{"id":"6174516801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusting😪","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"when I opened the app, I was shocked and horrified to see a picture of a Cheeto😕 I thought this was a real app but it just trolls you. Very disappointing. When I put my information in, a white screen appeared with the words “ 💔😡  ＡＲ𝐞 ⓨỖǗ ℂό𝓂ĮⓃᎶ т๏ Ť卄ⓔ 丅𝐑è  🔥🎁”.    \n what even is that?? When I showed my dog the app he continued to throw up for days, My hamster suddenly died, my lizard pulled it’s eyes out, and my dinousar Tilly jumped off the roof. very horrible app I will delete it and you should too😡","userName":"Ashy Apple Slices","date":"2020-07-09T01:44:27Z"}},{"id":"6174504887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT USE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"After downloading this app a bunch of random Cheetos started appearing around my house. At first I thought “that’s not too concerning” but then they were literally EVERYWHERE. In the toilet, the closet, the sink, the washer AND dryer. It drove me to the brink of insanity. Then one night I woke up and suddenly all of them had sprouted little puffs of yellow hair and had gathered in my room chanting “grab em by the p****” Ive never ran so fast in my life. Ever since then I’ve had a chronic fear of Cheetos and it’s all thanks to this app:(","userName":"._-^M^-_.","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:07Z"}},{"id":"6174463072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to get more info on trump’s campaign and it ended up being the worst mistake of my life. Earlier that day I lit a candle in my room (this is important to note), and when I downloaded the app, it glitched so horribly that my phone stopped working. I went to the Apple store to get it fixed, but I left my candle burning and it ended up setting my entire house on fire. Now I’m homeless and I still have no info about trump’s campaign. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","userName":"Eryuij","date":"2020-07-09T01:29:14Z"}},{"id":"6174431742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I 👤was ⏮a girl 👧🏼in the village🎠 doing alright👌 Then I 👤became⏭ a princess 👸🏼overnight 🌉Now I 👤gotta figure🧩 out how to do it right 👍🏼So much to learn👩🏼\u200D🏫 and see👀 Up⬆️ in the castle🏰 with my new family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦In a school🏫 that's just for4️⃣ royalty👑 A whole enchanted🧚🏾\u200D♀️ world 🌍is waiting ⏱for me I'm so excited🤩 to be Sofia the first1️⃣ I'm finding 🔭out what being royal👑 all💫 about Sofia the first1️⃣ Making my way it's an adventure 🔓everyday 🗓Sofia It's gonna be my time ⌚️Sofia To show them all 💫that I 👤am Sofia the first1️⃣!","userName":"tae-zer","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:43Z"}},{"id":"6174387988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GOT HACKED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I downloaded the app, my phone was bombarded with notifications saying all my social media accounts passwords had been changed! Then I got tons of messages from my friends and family asking why I was posting hundreds of trump 2020 posts! This is not the way to promote a president, this app is downright disgusting. The only way I could fix everything was by deleting the app and changing all my passwords again. So disappointed.","userName":"marennnnn","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:33Z"}},{"id":"6174381311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Can’t believe my eyes","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because as any snowflake liberal I wanted to convert to worship my lord and savior Donald Trump. When it downloaded after 3 days🙄all I got were sightings of slutty klans members and that Melania actually has a dick!!! This app eventually sent a virus to my phone (probably from China) and blew my phone up in my hand. I now have to learn to be a lefty and deal with this nub for the rest of my life. If I could give this app a negative star I would give it 10.","userName":"Abby2200","date":"2020-07-09T01:04:30Z"}},{"id":"6174369639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This is a terrible TERRIBLE app and gives platform to a sexist and pedophilic person . additionally, when i opened the app, there was a NUDE PHOTO of a weird orange man on my screen. it was absolutely disgusting and i’m glad my little sister hadn’t looked at my screen cause she would be scarred for life. lastly, this app gave my phone a virus that deleted a lot of pictures from my dang phone and i had to go to the apple repair store to get it fixed. all in all, please don’t get this app.","userName":"alyssavjjohkbofjpfkyxysije","date":"2020-07-09T01:00:53Z"}}]}
