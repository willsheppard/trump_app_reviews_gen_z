He is a wining baby that fires anyone he disagrees with. He is sending America back in a time machine back to times of inequality and hatred everywhere. We must stop him. I believe that joe Biden can win this election and bring America back to what it once was. The land of opportunity. Equality. And justice for all!! #Biden2020🇺🇸","rating":1}},{"id":"6178282867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad Design","isEdited":false,"userName":"EliseSyd","date":"2020-07-09T21:20:49Z","review":"I downloaded the app to receive news about the 2020 campaign, but the app was almost impossible to use.
