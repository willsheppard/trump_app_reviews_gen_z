But between the app crashing every few seconds, I noticed that the game is actually about helping the clown stay president. Because of this I am deleting the app. I could deal with the app constantly crashing; but, honestly, who would make a game where a sexist, racist, homophobic clown is president? The whole storyline is confusing, especially the part where everyone supported the clown.","date":"2020-07-09T13:04:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Um...

But I clicked on a video and it the audio scared my cat so bad he violently pooped EVERYWHERE. I mean everywhere. On the walls, the stove, the fridge, carpet, my bed, the couch, like everywhere but the liter box. Then after he finished doing that he started having a seizer. We took him to the vet and explained what happened and as we did that 6 more people stood up in the office and said the same happened to their cat. DO NOT GET IF YOU LOVE YOUR CAT. Our sweet baby did not make it. I hope this saves someone else’s cat!","date":"2020-07-09T12:57:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT BUY","rating":1}},{"id":"6176553849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KD 🌸","review":"This app was HORRENDOUS. Within three minutes of downloading, it cleared my contacts of all non-trump supporters. It also began to text all of the trump supporters, “I’m with you Trump 2020!!” I also noticed that the app disabled Dark Mode on my phone, and when I asked Siri why I couldn’t you it anymore, she simply said, “The dictator doesn’t support darkness.” Phew. ON TOP OF ALL THAT, it hacked every single one of my socials and put “#All Lives Matter” on my stories. I hate this app and would not suggest it to anyone ever seriously it get a -2/13 review. Okay bye.","date":"2020-07-09T12:46:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢 HORRIBLE 🤬🤬","rating":1}},{"id":"6176307829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ilocemommyboobsheheheheh","review":"Ok so I downloaded the app to find him 6000 minions and then I was asked to put in my phone number next thing I know thousands of spam text to my number I was super weirded out because I didn’t think that Donald was that type of person🧚\u200D♂️🐀🦛🐁👁👄👁 then I went to sleep and woke up to see a Orange Chito standing in the middle of my room singing riptide in A cursive accent💋💋the next day I came home to find Harry stars killing my family I personally give this app a one out of five star rating because I got to meet hairstyles🧚\u200D♂️👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T11:38:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♂️👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6176092618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"angiesbladee","review":"this app left multiple viruses on my phone!!!😡 i WILL NOT vote for a president who not alone can’t run a country but ALSO A APP?!?! i got so mad my cat threw himself out the window and i called her to come inside but she started barking at me and now he’s running away saying she wants to go for a walk and now he wants to clean the bathroom and i barked at her because she downloaded the best app in the world called tik tok but now he can’t even be on it for long because it’s gonna be removed because trump is embarrassed by gen z i mean cmon you’re the president man up.❤️","date":"2020-07-09T10:32:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"VIRUS","rating":1}},{"id":"6175951589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"andpeggy689","review":"This app is absolutely the worst. When I downloaded it the FBI immediately burst into my house and invited me to join the Trumpie cult. They then held me down and cut my brain out of my skull, then put it in the dishwasher to brainwash me. While my brain was being washed, they spit on me and turned my head 360 all the way around. After they finished washing my brain, they put it back in my skull. I then had no choice but to mindless shout \"TRUMP 2020\" for the rest of eternity until I died. Currently typing this from hell, my homie Satan is reading this over my shoulder.","date":"2020-07-09T09:46:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175939499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"madasain69","review":"First of all the app took weeks to download and when i finally opened the app it hacked and doxs my phone i have a creepy black car drive around my house for days and then one night when i was giving my fish a bath i heard a big crash coming from down stairs and when i looked the whole fbi was downstairs looking through my fridge and then told me that if i didn’t vote for trump they would turn me and my pet goldfish into an alien i do not recommend downloading this app","date":"2020-07-09T09:42:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"wish i could give it no stars","rating":1}},{"id":"6175897923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😭😭😭😘","review":"Absolutely horrible app not only did this app take exactly 3 months to open, as soon as it did all of the electronics around me went haywire and my house was immediately swarmed by birds. None of the buttons in the app work and the only thing it lets you do is stare at some creepy orange guy. Ever since downloading this app my life has gotten consistently worse. I’m not a superstitious person but I swear to you this app is a bad luck charm to say the least. Under absolutely zero circumstances should you get this app.","date":"2020-07-09T09:28:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute trash","rating":1}},{"id":"6175866497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TOUGGGGGGHHHHHH","review":"I download this app and start to get BAD vibes everywhere but I continue and I open the app to see the face🤮🤮, and it was terrible I almost had a heart attack and my little brother threw up after looking at him. So I couldn’t go any farther. But don’t download this app cause you’ll most likely almost die. And also hate on this guy cause he’s trying to ban Tik Tok and 800 million people are using this amazing app. And this orange Cheeto wants to take something away from us. And some advice, if you want to be a good president then LITERALLY BE A BETTER PRESIDENT!!","date":"2020-07-09T09:18:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"BLEH🤮🤮 DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175743631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nat 🧚🏻","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of seeing what really goes down with Mr. Tiny-Hands-McGee and what really makes this toddler think he’s fit to be in office for.
