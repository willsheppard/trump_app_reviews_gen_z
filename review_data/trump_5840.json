Immediately when I opened it Siri started screaming at the top of her lungs for help and my phone burned my hand. Now I have to get stitches. Keeps closing when I open it. Also made me crave oranges and Cheetos. Is it brainwashing me? Maybe has subliminal messages. Maybe it’s the fake news? Maybe not. I’m scared. I didn’t want any push notifications but immediately got 234 notifications when I closed the app. I feel like this app is kind of like the dark web or something? How did it even get put in the App Store.","title":"Ouch."}},{"id":"6176855829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:06:33Z","userName":"@btwinsbrook","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the orange mans 🍊🍊🍊app trying to praise him  but I found a naked picture of him and three oranges on the screen I tried to delete it but three 🍊and two🐭🐭piped out I was so scared the I tried to get out my house but they started to beat me up saying DONALD TRUMP IS THE BEST PRESIDENT EVER  I Tried to call the police but then Donald trump answered and started to cast a spell on me this caused all my 🦴 to break I was so mad 😡 I’d did an drop kick on him and started to say all the curse words in the alphabet i beat all of them.😂🤣🤣😡🥵🤬😕🤔🤯next time I’m going to upper cut all them shoot that ugly orange man almost got me killed .","title":"I almost died"}},{"id":"6176831743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:00:13Z","userName":"moltee","rating":1,"review":"hi so i downloaded this 💕wonderful💕 app and guess what! it just was not my style ya know? like yes i may be getting hundreds of texts from an orange, but this app just is not it alright. so anyway, i’m just here to let y’all know that you should support all other people no matter what they look like or how they identify bc that seems to be an issues with all you ᵗʳᵘᵐᵖᵉʳˢ. anyway, thank y’all so for the chance i is a way of getting a new video on delivered today to my house to be sure of my it that is so good i was a great one time ago that we had to a break from a lot going to the rest of the day so we could just get to him so i was a time that i is a summer for a long day or so long and then i is the day we can do a bunch more stuff to make it a little more expensive to play and we can get a lot going to get to him so i was a time for us to go. heh enjoy that :)","title":"✨awful✨"}},{"id":"6176795889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:50:44Z","userName":"gn djns","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support MY president so having to wait several hours for the app to download felt so worth it! As soon as I opened the app my phone started glitching like crazy!!! It’s also hard to ignore the fact that as soon as you open the app you’re “welcomed” by an animation of Trump as a baby shooting at defenseless puppies saying, “ONLY AMERICAN DOGS ARE WELCOME ON MY SOIL!” 😳 To my fellow non-racist, non homophobic, and non misogynistic Trump supporters I recommend finding a different way to stay up to date with our president. I will have to go out and buy a new phone due to this app. 😢😭","title":"worst mistake 😔"}},{"id":"6176595526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:57:41Z","userName":"Cameron! H.!","rating":1,"review":"Omg I had the worst time with this app. First off it wouldn’t download I had to retry downloading it a thousand times and so finally I got it just some stupid bug I guess. Then once I opened up it showed me a page like flappy bird and I’m so confused I thought i downloaded the Trump app. Turns out I opened flappy bird on my phone but whatever. So then I opened it and it was all Trump like seriously who would support the most misogynistic and racist person in the White House and we’ve had slave owners. If I truly could I would rate 0/5 but whatever 1 is ok i guess.","title":"Terrible app don’t download"}},{"id":"6176563081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:48:55Z","userName":"AJCURTIS62","rating":1,"review":"Right from when I opened it I could tell it did something to my phone. It started running programs I didn’t want it to and draining my battery. Not only that but it had various profanities within the app, and my little sister had been around to hear it! And it tried to use my credit card data within my phone for in-app purchases. This app is what is wrong with America! I can’t believe the apple store would even endorse this kind of thing! You better call me Karen cause I would like to speak with someone about this...","title":"I CANT BELIEVE THIS APP"}},{"id":"6176435265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:13:50Z","userName":"chickensaladsandwich","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and upon doing so all of my other apps were wiped from my phone. My text and call were unavailable making it impossible to contact my loved ones.  Since I needed to talk to my mom I went home, only to find her and the rest of my family had been drafted into ww3!!!! I was honestly shocked to see that the app of our non homophobic non sexist non racist president had caused my family to be drafted. I mean come on!!! Since I was so upset I contacted trump. This man and his evil Trompa Loompas are trying to take over the world and it NEEDS TO STOP","title":"Worst app on the market 🤬🤬🤬"}},{"id":"6176252949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:21:36Z","userName":"how bout no❤️","rating":1,"review":"awful app!!! it took a week to download and after it did it stole all my information and corrupted my phone!!!! this app must be taken down IMMEDIATELY!!!!! the features on this app were broken and outdated right when i opened it my phone crashed and i had to restart it and when i opened it again it gave my phone a virus. after opening it for a final time the app itself appeared corrupted and crashed. will definitely not be purchasing again please spread the word this is a BAD APP and leave a review saying so!!!!!","title":"horrible app horrible experience"}}]}
