Just something to get me through the day. But after a while I started calling COVID-19 a hoax made by the leftist nazi Democrats. I simply can’t manage to not flaunt my privilege as a rich and SUCCESSFUL christian conservative white man with blue eyes and blond hair. My daughter has begun to look rather... seductive and I’ve been having wet dreams about her ever since I downloaded the app. But that’s besides the point. I saw a black man outside of a neighborhood who actually had the AUDACITY to sell  lemonade. I told my family to hide inside the attic because we felt threatened. The next day I began hallucinating . There were five naked Hillary Clinton’s dancing around me and they were all telling me about their deleted emails. I later went into a coma for two weeks. Definitely do not recommend :("}},{"id":"6173544435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"0/10 DONT DOWNLOAD!","userName":"your mom Jeffrey","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:01:16Z","review":"This app caused a huge huge virus on my phone. I was trying to walk my pet fish and my phone started heating up. 🥵It got so hot that it turned orange and burned my hand. 🔥It kept playing this horrendous screeching music saying “ China “ and “ make America great again” over and over. I tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let me. My pet fish then got blinded by the noise and stopped swimming.😱This weird President Mr. Dump ruined my life and killed my pet fish. I am very disappointed and this app is a total flop.👎I say we get rid of it so that nobody else’s pet fish will die. I am truly saddened by what has happened with these unfortunate events and I truly hope they can get rid of this app. The orange Oompa Loompa president  still haunts me to this day. 🟠I hope we can make a change and get a better leader who isn’t a big perv, racist, fat orange soon 😢🤧"}},{"id":"6173268075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!😡😡","userName":"Ablaze_leslie","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:27:07Z","review":"My kids are having terrible nightmares because my kids love their president but soon as we get in the app they get greeted by a a horrific living Cheetos puff. They were horrified. And they trying to get my personal information. This is outrageous . My kids are afraid to go to sleep or even go outside of this horrifying creature. And they are also saying “making America great again” this app is implying America is not a great country and needing help for their people and economy. Wow  now they’re shaming us!! This so insulting for all of us living in the land of the free. THIS WHOLE ENTIRE THING IS COMPLETE RIDICULOUS JOKE!!!! As a citizen in the United States of America I expected better from the president!!! They even spreading fake news. Giving this a 1 stars is major pity. No actually giving it 0 stars is major pity. This apps needs to be taken down immediately!!!"}},{"id":"6173247248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no thank you ❤️ i lost my phone","userName":"MiaTheDoggo","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:20:16Z","review":"there is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\nYellow, black.

(keep in mind i was sitting in my 69°F house). so at this point, i was already iffy about this new app i had just downloaded. when my phone stopped over heating, i finally opened the app, took ONE look and remembered that donald trump is racist, homophobic, a rapist, and just plain GROSS. not to mention, he’s killed hundreds of thousands due to this pandemic that he could’ve controlled in the first place. i do NOT recommend this app to anyone and i do NOT recommend voting for this cheeto again in 2020.

AND he is trying to take america out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic, please tell me why this would even interest him to leave??? He is a fascist, racist, homophobic man wanting america to go back to the 1960s which by his definition is “great”. who’s gonna tell him that the 1960s was about segregation, no rights to the black and LGBTQIA+ community as well as women staying home and doing the house chores. how is he calling this time “great”? come to think of it, it was only good for straight white men like himself."}},{"id":"6172712468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I am grieving","userName":"sopphiegkparmaseanchease","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:35:34Z","review":"My family is a very supportive family. They support my believes and they also have their own believes. They believe that 🍊 will win this election and they love it. When they downloaded this app they were hoping to have a more clear understanding of everything that happens in his\nbrain. The app took one month to download and when my family opened it they were at the kitchen table celebrating Easter dinner. It started to malfunction and was glitching so much and started to emit a horrible sound. The flashing lights were bright enough to give my grandma a seizure! She passed later that night. My grandpa fell into a deep state of depression and then passed the next morning. My mom and dad were so scared that they now hate 🍊 I have always hated him though. Now my parents love me more than anything. And hate 🍊 more than anything"}}]}
