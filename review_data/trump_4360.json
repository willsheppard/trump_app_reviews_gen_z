I don’t know which one of Oompa Loompas cis gender males did that fool hire. Heck, he probably developed it himself. It’s falling apart like his nation. Idk what he thought he could do with this app, but this app has worse odds than the nation. Maybe god will fix the app for him. Maybe even arm the app with an AK-47. I’m so sadden that I have to delete this app. I had more faith in this non racist, non sexist, non predator in charge of this app. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻 Developers let me know if there’s anything you can do about this horrible app. I’d love to leave some constructive criticism. Have a good day.

It even said I needed to pay for more gigabits to keep the app running and I hadn’t even set up my account. My phone immediately started glitching too, like turning off randomly, draining my battery like crazy, and calling Obama. I also called Sprint to make sure that this mistake wasn’t on their end, and they made it crystal clear that it wasn’t. For a guy that hates TikTok, you’d think that he’d put a bit of effort into this app. But he didn’t. So don’t download it."}},{"id":"6175277413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Delicious🧚\u200D♀️✨🌸but make it my son🧚\u200D♀️✨🌸","rating":1,"userName":"✨lord farquaad","date":"2020-07-09T05:42:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"My name is Karen and I would like to speak to the person In charge. I hate this app. As soon as I downloaded it was like I was cursed! When I came home, there was a homeless man sleeping in my dogs cage. He said my dog tasted delicious. And when I was going on my Facebook, I was shocked to see that my Cruise vacation, was canceled due to corona. Canceled! And at my child’s soccer game, an eagle dropped a dead skunk on my son! And then it attempts to attack my son! And when I woke up, I find the same homeless man in my sons bed! He said my son tasted even better! I deleted the app ASAP! Nobody should download this app, it is dangerous. Except my neighbor, Lisa. She can download it."}},{"id":"6175234980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the trump app puts your life in danger","rating":1,"userName":"joyousyoung1","date":"2020-07-09T05:25:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"my phone literally exploded after downloading this app. that could be a total coincidence, but i don’t think it is. now i have to go buy a new phone since mine was set ablaze. unfortunately, all of my money is going towards healthcare and student loans so i guess i will just have to be without a phone for now. really disappointed in our president for making such a terrible app :( what happened to making america great again? what good is america when you can’t afford a new phone because your president blew up the one you already had? some BS if you ask me. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR PHONE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6175180033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This App supports 5G","rating":1,"userName":"MeUtogeth3rwe","date":"2020-07-09T05:06:06Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hello my fellow antivaxxers 😘 This is Karen coming at you with another third eye, freedom report. I originally downloaded this app to support my favorite President. God this man is so YUM. America really took the presidency and said orange is the new black. Anyway upon reading the ingredients of this app I came upon a very particular substance that I was SHOCKED to see... 5G. This blew my mind. I knew ever since I downloaded this app I started to feel more faint. Not only that but to use the app you must wear a MASK... can you believe this!!! I will no longer be voting for Trump instead I will be using my time to ruin the lives of essential workers and minority groups. Oh you betcha. Goodbye ladies!"}},{"id":"6175130839","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I SUFFERED SEVERE PROBLEMS","rating":1,"userName":"yeeeeeeeeeeesksksksks","date":"2020-07-09T04:49:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app and found myself staring at a HORRIFYING 🤮image of the very well known “Cheeto god.” 🥕🟠 I was so scared I felt as if his small beady eyes 👁👄👁 followed me no matter where I moved. After about a week of the picture staring at me, I began to have nightmares and I came to the conclusion that I needed profesional 👩🏽\u200D⚕️help in order to get over my fear of the Cheeto god. After THREE YEARS in therapy, one year in a MENTAL asylum and three CLINICAL trials (all having to do with trying to heal🤒😷😪 PTSD with the use of meth🍁) I have NOT gotten over my fear of the Cheeto god. I highly recommend that you DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP unless you want severe PTSD, insomnia and  schizophrenia, STAY AWAY 🤚🏽 🛑🧨‼️🚫 from this app."}},{"id":"6174894106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"garbage!!","rating":1,"userName":"gabriellllllaaa","date":"2020-07-09T03:34:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"once I opened this app, I was IMMEDIATELY choke slammed by trump supporters who found my address through the app’s tracking methods! despite trump’s disdain for the chinese government and their “lack of internet privacy,” the app still managed to use numerous cookies and get hackers to track me down & brutally beat me. one of them, and I’ll remember this for the rest of my life, yelled “ATTACK” as his huge army of roaches in comb overs stomped on me with their little legs 😔 as I tried to fight back, saying I was indeed an American citizen, donald j. (j for genius) trump burst through my window and aided the roaches by using my forehead as a mini golfing course.

So what happened was I was chilling with my pot of chili, and then all of a sudden, my pet dinner plate came rushing into my room saying I need cheese balls. And so I sighed and grabbed the container of cheese balls. Then I realized I was out of cheese balls so I drove over in my luxury hotdog and stopped at the Home Depot to get me some cheese balls. When I was riding home with my cheese balls, I realized my TOMATOES WERE GONE!! And then I heard evil snickering coming from this app, and it turns out that the app STOLE MY TOMATOES. And then, when I got home from the Home Depot, I realized my 23K CARROT WAS GONE TOO!! And then I found out this app STOLE MY TOMATOES AND MY 23K CARROT!! DO NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR TOMATOES AND 23K CARROTS STOLEN!!"}},{"id":"6174696482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app should just be taken down immediately","rating":1,"userName":"aijshsbdjssj","date":"2020-07-09T02:35:55Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded the app, but when I opened it, I got a notification that since I wasn’t white, I had to go to a separate website on the app. It was full of bugs and it was super slow, but when I looked at my white friend’s phone, who was also using the app, her’s worked perfectly fine. Then I started coughing a little, and the app told me it auto ordered a can of bleach for me. I was horrified, but once again when I looked at my white friend’s phone who was projectile vomiting, the app did nothing. Anyway, point is don’t download this app because #settleforbiden2020 🧚🦄✨"}}]}
