This app kept glitching and started giving me jcpenny coupons. Which I’m not complaining but they were only 10% off. They it gave me links to buy quails half off. I just wanted to support and stay in touch but all it did was glitch super disappointed.","title":"Obama 👤"}},{"id":"6177158629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Edblah1","rating":1,"review":"As a minority group of the United States of America I believe that what trump is doing is not okay. He plans on building a wall  to block out my relatives! He constantly promoted racism, sexism, homophobia to his supporters which I do not condone. What makes it even worse is that he does it unintentionally because he’s so stupid. His priorities are not straight and does not have the best interest for the county. Thank you ✨","title":"No bueno"}},{"id":"6177152405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:26:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Addy Hates School hehe","rating":1,"review":"THIS APP IS TERRRRIBLEEE!!!!

Right when I got the app my phone became overheated and burn down my house! Then on the front screen I saw fat ompaloopa looking thing, that also looked like a skinny Cheeto. He was staring into my soul and said “Trump 2020, I am racist and a rapist!” Also my whole house burnt down because of this app and it took my battery life! 🧚\u200D♀️✨🥰🥰❤️ Hey trump your fat ompaloompa looking Cheeto!","title":"🥰✨ absolutely demolishing ✨🥰"}},{"id":"6177097983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:11:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Rose.gold_tide","rating":1,"review":"okay so at first i was all excited to learn about our amazing president because i have no idea what we does for our country but then there was this glitch about obama. he started popping up on ads from the app and telling me to vote for him??????

First of all it took forever to load and as soon as i could open the app, it glitched. The quality of the app is terrible, but so it’s the news it delivers. It is racist, homophobic, and other things that we should be working against. Overall, don’t download this terrible app.","title":"Such a terrible app"}},{"id":"6177020356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:50:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"user Jonathan","rating":1,"review":"Im not sure what this whole “gen z” thing is, but I got this app and it’s wacky. It has propaganda and conspiracies rampant across the entire news each day. It even had some weird membership thing, where you would pay so you could get faster update on news. I’m not a trump supporter, but I was curious about his plans. IT LITERALLY MAKES YOU UNINSTALL THE APP SO YOU CANT GET YOUR MONEY BACK!! Absolute garbage","title":"tried to scam me???"}},{"id":"6176973808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:37:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pixie2be","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to support our WONDERFUL president... but instead of getting the content I was expecting for trump 2020, I opened it and it told me: “if you are anything but a strait white male DELETE THIS APP CAUSE YOU WILL BURN IT HELL” with fire symbols around it... that is very offensive and unprofessional. That’s not only racist, but homophobic and misogynist. I’m disappointed in trump and his people for creating such a terrible app of hatred.","title":"Should be deleted it’s so bad."}},{"id":"6176964461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🌟bob the builder 🌟","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app to fully support my president as a negro 💩🤷🏽\u200D♀️ but as soon as I open the app I see our 🧟presidents🧟 leaked photos.
