When it finally did I went to write a review and when I hit the one star, my house burnt down :) but since I’m homeless already there is no house to burn so here’s my one star review"}},{"id":"6172928951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download this app","userName":"Lemillion👁👅👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:39:19Z","review":"This took a whole week to finally download and once it finally did download it asked me to give all of my personal information and now I’m getting spam calls every night.

It isn’t that much of a security threat if China reviewed the content it wouldn’t change a thing they could literally come her and see it first hand it’s not like we are hiding anything."}},{"id":"6172803375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","userName":"utigudhckgk","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:01:36Z","review":"This app took almost three days to download and when it finally did it ask for my information, so as I proceeded to put in my info the app started blasting strange music and my phone started to glitch and went back to the home screen and every time I tried to get back one the app it did that same thing....this app is terrible 🤮👎🏽👎🏽"}},{"id":"6172802600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i couldn’t watch boku no pico😡😡","userName":"mimi877241","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:01:22Z","review":"I was disgusted to click on this app and see a big orange pedo on my screen😡😤 this app took 7 days to load and I was not here for it.
