Almost immediately after I was getting call after call from scammers, and people asking for my card information for my car warranty. I’m so disappointed in this app and I hope the issue is fixed soon... 1 star tell I stop getting scammer phone calls😡"}},{"id":"6134194997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T02:51:41Z","title":"Completely dissatisfied and disappointed","userName":"Wanda Z.","review":"When I opened the app I was asked to do the usual sign up but then it started asking for things like my credit card and social security number. This is highly inappropriate. But that’s not all. I was almost constantly met with seemingly endless spam! I’m warning you!! This app is DEFINITELY NOT worth the time. 😤😤"}},{"id":"6122995878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-26T06:29:59Z","title":"One Star","userName":"Meganw301","review":"When I downloaded the app, the only way to access it was to sign up with my phone number with no other way to sign up. When I deleted the app it said purchased on the Apple store. I don’t think anything was charged to my credit card, thankfully.  There was nothing to inform me if it actually did cost me money."}},{"id":"6113668346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-23T21:02:04Z","title":"Disappointed","userName":"Hedrich","review":"I really wanted this app to give me information on Trump and his campaign for 2020; unfortunately, there were so many faulty complications with the coding of this app as well as the content. The app is riddled with fake news which is absolutely unacceptable😔 I expected more and hope this app is deleted soon due to the multitude of issues"}},{"id":"6072247258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-13T21:11:37Z","title":"bigly bad","userName":"user42168","review":"i love supporting our president. he’s the best racist i know. i love him for it. i can’t believe people hate on him. he deserves all the love. he really does. believe me racist people are the best. they keep this country great. however this app hugely disappointed me. it kept asking me to put my phone number in and i would but then it would spam text me. i want to support my idol but i hate getting 200+ messages an hour. i want to keep donating to our tremendously hugely competent president’s campaign but knowing that my money is funding this app makes me feel sick. 0/10 recommend. wish i could give it 0 stars."}},{"id":"6068225852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T21:05:57Z","title":"If I could I would give no stars","userName":"blah blan blaj","review":"Absolutely ridiculous how it asks if I’m over 17. There solearlo is some hidden meaning behind this. Absolutely horrible. Then it proceeds to ask personal information. Excuse, me!!?? I was here to enjoy daddy t but if this got too personal.

If you want true and unbiased information about Donald Trump you should not be looking on app that he pays for. The tump 2020 app will feed you only lies just Fox News. Fox News is obviously a racist and homophobic news platform that can not be trusted. I can not honestly say that trump has done anything good for America. \n\n                           Thank you"}},{"id":"6065310510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T03:09:08Z","title":"They need to fix this!!!","userName":"EGT143","review":"My daughter downloaded this for myself and my husband. Both of our phones froze while on this app. 1 phone and maybe it’s just my phone not the app, but both phones stop working? It’s the app. This needs to be fixed!
