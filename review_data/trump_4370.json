Unfortunately, when I downloaded the app it kept on not loading then the app would just crash and I was being denied my rights by the act this app put up. I think at some point it just realized how unfair it was being to ME. But once i got it to open a Cheeto popped up it was such an uncomfortable situation to top it off it doesn’t let me access without putting in a phone number which I was not comfortable with. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF THIS APP. This was just such an unpleasant experience cause ALL APPS MATTER so even if this app needs help there are other apps that need help too.🙈","title":"TRUELY A DISGRACE TO APPS","userName":"jungcookandjunglebook","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174573538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:41Z","rating":1,"review":"Unacceptable terribleOnce I first open the app what I saw before my eyes was enough to give me nightmares and night terrors for a year unacceptable why would you wanna vote for a person that does not support your neck is about image and is homophobic racist a sex offender a sex trafficking etc. we’re good as he did in the past three years thatHe was elected take right on the LGBT community like what did you what good has he done enlighten me because it he also refused to give justice for George Floyd and many more other people unacceptable disgusting it honestly-we had all this time to you know and racism and discrimination yet people still do it unacceptable.","title":"Crunchy and smelt toes","userName":"🌻🌼•~Vale~•🌼🌻","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174547536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:53:11Z","rating":1,"review":"my lil cousin got a hold of this app and that’s when i started to notice a change in his behavior. First of all he’s been utterly disrespectful towards his parents and women 😡😡 he says this orange man encourages him to and when we said who’s that, he pointed to this app😨😾 i am in disbelief and i believe this app is what has been causing him to act so self centered as if he were the only person in the world. He’s also been yelling “ all lives matter” when he knows darn well innocent black peoples lives are being taken away and it’s NOT FAIR‼️we are completely disgusted with his actions so we will be flying him across seas to live with his grandma 👵🏼😾😰😡😡😾","title":"utterly terrible 😾🙄😡😡😨","userName":"the cool kid 😨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174543894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:52:06Z","rating":1,"review":"i had an absolutely terrible experience with this app. first, within 5 seconds after downloading it, my whole phone exploded😰💥👿however i still wanted to see what the hype was about so after redownloading the app on my vintage iphone 2, i finally opened it up. the first thing i saw was a literal demon. he was orange with bushy eyebrows and terrible dental hygiene😱😖 i screamed immediately - why would they have something so atrocious?? then my phone started vibrating and chanting in demonic voices. it was saying stuff like “grab em by the p*ssy” and “cHiNa”. i think it literally was a glimpse of hell. deleted the app immediately. anyways, download tiktok🥰✨","title":"president more like presiDON’T👿❌","userName":"synth rat","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174444477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:23:35Z","rating":1,"review":"I Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. \"What the devil?\" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, \"Tally ho lads\" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.

SO BAD. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! I downloaded the app in order to be up to date with our presidents actions towards this country and a BIG ORANGE MONSTER appears and I’m like WOAH🍊 what the heck! So it takes me like 2 hours maybe to calm down then I sign up and my phone starts to do this horrible glitching, it was so scary! It kept glitching for hours. Before this app my phone was like brand new. Literally I bought it 3 days ago, and now it glitches like crazy. So not epic.\nPlease for the love god, don’t get this app. It will glitch like crazy and then steal all your information and put it in a top secret government file in order to black mail you.","title":"HORRIBLE APP 🤢","userName":"Alois Trancy waz her","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174363644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:58:57Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of showing my support for trump 2020☺️🌟🧚\u200D♀️ but was horrified upon opening the app 🤢🤢 I was greeted by the scariest picture of a Cheeto I have EVER seen. I fainted and passed out on the floor, hitting my head on my dresser along the way. I woke up to blood spilling down my face from the gash and I was rushed to the hospital 🏥 the doc asked what happened so I showed him what had made me faint. His face went pale and he fell to the ground just as I did. We both have concussions now 😡 I showed this app to my cat figuring she may find more use in it and when she gazed her eyes upon the screen she jumped out the nearest window into oncoming traffic.

I chased after him but he was too fast (not as fast as when bunker boy walked down that ramp, no one can compete with that). I couldnt catch him so i had to walk home and take a long shower bc i was so sweaty (my water bill was so high that month). My dog is my own property and this app stole my dog; therefore the government stole my dog. Long story short Trump is a socialist and this app stole my dog.","title":"no❤️","userName":"Good13521467333","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174307436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:40:07Z","rating":1,"review":"The first thing I saw when I open the app was this Cheeto puffGetting naked spray tan absolutely disgusting🤮 I had to look at that 🥴my sister looked at it and literally died I passed out the first time I saw it inappropriate photos everywhere hate speeches and now we have to raise money for my sister’s funeral my mom looked at it she passed out and went into a coma so we had to take her to the hospital and when I was there I caught the coronavirus just because of this app the only thing on this app is inappropriate content!

There was this old wrinkly orange guy and the sight of him mad me nauseous, and don’t get me started on the amount of glitches. Seriously the amount of glitches that were happening was ASTRONOMICAL. Every three seconds I’d get an annoying add to vote for “president” trump? Who do they think I am? A racist homophobe? Uhm yeah no. I’d rather not have a Fascist, Dumb, Homophobic,Transphobic, Racist, orange crayon as a president. Also just like Trump himself the app took up way to much space in my phone and I think we’d all just be happier with out it.\nOver all -1/10 ✨💕☺️🧚 \n-your friendly neighborhood Gen Z kid","title":"horrible terrible disgusting","userName":"gen z kid #867","isEdited":false}}]}
