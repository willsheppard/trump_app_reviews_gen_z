The next day I got 87  calls all titled SPAM RISK. My pillow is a Cheeto supporter so I got this app. Was I out of my mind!! Never in a million years should I have downloaded an app that supports a walking Cheeto. The next time I want a snack I’ll just eat my window. Anyways this morning when I woke up my fridge was gone and I’m pretty sure the company that runs this app stole my information. UNBELIEVABLE HORRID DISGUSTING have a wonderful day and remember don’t vote for trump!!💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕💫✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172823243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:07:16Z","rating":1,"title":"The government is trying to control us","userName":"#notagovernmentslave","review":"I was genuinely trying to check out the app but then it asked for my phone number. I want to be more educated on the government because education is the most powerful weapon and the government is trying to steal our souls. Anyway, I barely use my phone number so the government can’t track me but you can’t use this app without putting in a phone number. I believe this is a form of censorship and a violation of our rights as Americans. If you do not want your identity stolen do not download this app! SAD.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172798800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:00:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Don’t support an orange","userName":"bells rells","review":"This app is honestly the worst thing, If I could give this app zero stars I would. I got so many hate messages and emails from the ACTUAL app. There is absolutely no reason to support an orange and have it in office for another 4 YEARS! He has done absolutely nothing good while he was in office! Everything on the app is a lie! They spread a bunch of false information on the app that trump has done “good”, when I did more research and trump did none of those things! He does NOT what the common good for the citizens of the USA! DO NOT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP! Or i mean an orange 🍊 ✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172786921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:56:50Z","rating":1,"title":"Truly disappointed.","userName":"𝓑𝓪𝓫𝔂...","review":"The app is horrible to be honest. It gives false information all the time and it’s very rude. It also when I tried to open it, it would crash and it made my phone very slow and overheated it. I was hoping to get informed about the good but all the app did was be highly disrespectful. And the app is only good for those who are privileged and don’t have to fight for what’s right. It also spreads hatred and not peace. I would love to give it 0 stars but I can’t. I’m very truly disappointed in our “president”. #2020VISION.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172640388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:15:17Z","rating":1,"title":"Bad quality","userName":"black lives matter✨","review":"I opened the app and the first thing I saw was that it wasn’t ✨aesthetic✨ enough 😔 for everything that trump says I would think it would have better things to begin with. Like the fact he doesn’t appreciate women or people of color so there should be a warning right away because if that’s what I’m getting myself into I don’t want it. Next off the app itself looks like the nightmare I had last night. I couldn’t bear to see his face and things. And it all looked bad. I hated it. Don’t get this app.😾😾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172635038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:13:46Z","rating":1,"title":"COMPLETE invasion of privacy/ FALSE INFO","userName":"just.the.facts111","review":"I wish I never downloaded the app, my text messages have been spammed constantly with useless information! It is a total invasion of my privacy. I clicked “do not send me texts” when putting my phone number in when signing up, but somehow I am still receiving them!!! I ALSO RESPONDED “STOP” MULTIPLE TIMES. I am so over it and this all started after downloading the app. Not to mention the information found on this app completely contradicts what Trump is tweeting. The discrepancy is insane. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172591975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:01:46Z","rating":1,"title":"Yikes","userName":"potatoshucker69","review":"This app runs like crap and my phone crashed twice!!! ALSO what kind on presidential app has a warning for 17+? Furthermore, the amount of ignorant adults using this app is quite sad. Do they know what their President TRULY stands for? I’d hope not because if you support trump, you support things like misogyny, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. A lot of the stuff trump promised hasn’t been done. NOT TO MENTION HOW HE’S HANDLED THIS VIRUS!! If you don’t believe the virus, wait till you or someone you love gets it... I’ve seen many people change their minds. Thank you! That is all. 😄","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172563055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:53:47Z","rating":1,"title":"CAUSED A DIVORCE !!! 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💫","userName":"jelsuekfh","review":"I downloaded this app to my support my orange president. When I opened the app.. little small trump goblins appeared! 🐷🐷 They hit me and forced me to give all my money to them!! 💸💸 Luckily I had my fighting skills. What would I do with them.. Anyways. When the trump goblins left, a bra 🎀fell out of their bags!!!! My mom came home and though it was my dad! I tried to explain it was the trump goblins.. but it didn’t work. Now my happy parents are divorced. Don’t download if you don’t want the trump goblins to come for you!!

So don’t delete tiktok instead delete this app for an orange who separates people’s families and doesn’t give people there rights !!!!! And that’s on Period ☺️!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172468599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:27:31Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible App!!","userName":"rosie390","review":"This app literally killed my phone. It took forever to download and then it just got worse! It took at least five minutes to get past the home screen. It wouldn’t load and then when I tried to log into my account it wouldn’t go through! Finally I gave up and tried to go back to my home screen, but alas, the app had malware and bugs in it! Nothing was working and my phone started glitching out. i had to restart my phone and delete the app to fix it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! It is a scam!","isEdited":false}}]}
