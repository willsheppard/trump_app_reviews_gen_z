After asking them to leave they continued to do tiktok dances and mock my movements. This all happened after two minutes of having the app downloaded. 😡🤬😡 so in conclusion Bernie 2020 luvs 😍💕✨"}},{"id":"6173714807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"what’s going on?","userName":"DPT60","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:01:38Z","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with everything that trump has been doing and the app completely shut me out the moment that I entered it!! this is unacceptable, I expected better from the president of the United States! I hope you know who my vote is going towards now!"}},{"id":"6173704755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","userName":"DPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:57:57Z","review":"This is the worse app I’ve ever downloaded. I wanted to order a pizza. I got disappointed. I still have no pizza even after requesting trump to buy me pizza. I want pizza. 0/10 rating, Trump clearly doesn’t want me to eat a pizza. All I wanted was some PIZZA. Boomers said that this app was amazing. They were mistaken, cause I didn’t get pizza.\n☹️😡"}},{"id":"6173702602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Oh too see without my eyes 👁👄👁","userName":"Razor ninja201","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:57:09Z","review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded it made my phone glitch and my screen freeze. I truly don’t understand why it is still in the App Store. The app itself isn’t any better and seems to be very poorly made,would not recommend"}},{"id":"6173687083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely hated this app.","userName":"AlbeeW5662","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:31Z","review":"When I downloaded the app, thousands of cockroaches crawled into my living room screaming “I be walking with the cheese that the queso,queso”. We are lactose intolerant! Me and my family watched in horror as the cockroaches kept chanting “I be walking with the cheese thats the queso,queso”. It was a horrible sight. -10/10.

Ever since I got this app my phone has been glitching and overall it’s just in poor quality, like the president 🤢. Anyways, I recommend to legit use any app that’s not this. I heard Subway Surfers was better so we should all just download that app instead:)"}},{"id":"6173680551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app","userName":"JDHFISNANSI","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:49:07Z","review":"Probably the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. So many bugs. Pages don’t work. None of the buttons work. I put in my phone number and it keeps sending me random messages that have nothing to do with the campaign. I’ll be voting for Joe over Trump because of this stupid thing."}},{"id":"6173677310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP 😭😭","userName":"tessmk10","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:47:56Z","review":"Got this app and every-time I opened it it just kept blasting the song “Replay” at the highest volume!¡ 😡 and then when I clicked on the link to signup for rallies it just kept playing the Bee Movie over and over again. And worst of all, they kept sending me Trump nudes whenever I opened their emails. WILL NOT BE DOWNLOADING AGAIN"}}]}
