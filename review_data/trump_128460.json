He can’t take our rights away u can’t its in the constitution have u forgotten about the Bill of Rights or our 1st amendments rights I guess our Cheetos puff never learned anything in his private school .

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world."}},{"id":"6176883752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:13:50Z","title":"✨🤬😡🖕🏻💩THIS APP IS TERRIBLE 🖕🏻💩🤬✨🖕🏻","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ria diaz","review":"WHENEVER I TRY AND GO ON THE APP IT TAKES ME BACK TO THE HOME SCREEN💩.ALSO IT ALWAYS ASKS FOR YOU TO TURN ON YOUR LOCATION AND EVEN I PRESS NO IT STILL ASKS ME TO TURN THEM ON.😡😡ALSO THIS APP IS VERY GLITCHY,FOR EXAMPLE IF I TRY AND PRESS SOMETHING IT PRESSES ON THE WRONG THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.AND I DELETED THE APP,BUT IT STILL SENT ME NOTIFICATIONS.I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND THIS APP IT IS TERRIBLE.🤬💩💩😡😡💩🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽😡🤬💩😡"}},{"id":"6176883625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:13:48Z","title":"TIKTOK","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"boomer ok ok boomer","review":"this shouldn’t be a app at all. @unusualbeing on. tiktok"}},{"id":"6176882530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:13:31Z","title":"THE WORST APP APPLE HAS","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"challa965325678909644","review":"I was trying to widen my views on the political parties before this years upcoming election. To my surprise, the first time I opened the app rather than the colors being red, white and blue as I had expected, the theme of the app was ALL RED and black much like the theme of the communist flag that Hitler once stood behind. To me this was very offensive and quite inappropriate, however I decided to give my beloved president one more chance and in the spirit of respecting both voting parties I pushed on and continued my investigation of Mr. Trumps app. As I began to put in my information I was brought to a different page that encouraged me to sign a secrecy contact for a top secret child molestation ring. This is where I drew the line. I assumed that trump was monitoring who was deleting his app because right before I pressed delete my phone started yelling absurd, demeaning statements at me because I am a woman. Hands down the worst app on the App Store."}},{"id":"6176881529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:13:15Z","title":"Yikes","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Sweetheart4321","review":"Full of viruses 🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️🤸🏽\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176879886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:12:49Z","title":"TRUMP IS ✨💖R A C I S T💖✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BERNIE2020 :)","review":"People make mistakes😍🦋💐🌸🧪your Parents made the biggest😍🌸🌸💐😷\n✨💖😼I wish I was you 🦋🥰✨♥️oh sorry I meant Helen Keller💖🦋💕\nłõæf 🥖 lôäf 🍞 łœâf 🥯 lóåf 🥐 𝚕𝚘̈𝚊̃𝚏 🥖 𝕝𝕠𝕒𝕗 🍞 łøàf 🥯 lōāf 🥐 łõæf 🥖 lôäf 🍞 łœâf 🥯 lóåf 🥐 𝚕𝚘̈𝚊̃𝚏 🥖 𝕝𝕠𝕒𝕗 🍞 łøàf 🥯 lōāf 🥐\ni🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫\nr-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🥖 my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️\nPeople😌love🧃that✨i🧸hate⛓myself👩🏻i👣climbed👛out🦋of🌸my🌼head🌙and🌶watched👁myself🦈implode🐡a🕷thought🛷without📞a🖤body🔰"}},{"id":"6176879319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:12:40Z","title":"Pure trash","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mad28936","review":"🧚🏼\u200D♂️garbage🧚🏼\u200D♂️app🧚🏼\u200D♂️thats💫super🌟hard🎀to💕navigate💖"}}]}
