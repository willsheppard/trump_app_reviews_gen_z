I could’ve come back earlier but I didn’t want to see the dumb app again. But then I remembered I have parents so after a few minutes I came back. And you won’t believe what happened after. As soon as I came back to life and saw the app again, I died..again! 💀💀 I didn’t think I could go back that time, but I had to still write this review. So this app does this to those who download it: 💀","title":"🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"Usersnme","date":"2020-07-08T15:27:57Z"}},{"id":"6172673697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I open the app and the blue isn’t even the right shade.

After downloading the app my phone started being HORRIBLY SLOW!! This app definitely has a bug!! I’m deleting this app and may even need to get a new phone! I’m absolutely distraught. I can’t even begin to fathom how this app alone did such damage! Please listen! My PHONE STARTED OVERHEATING! I feel very uneasy about what this app has done and I also feel something very sketchy is going on behind the scenes of this app! If I could rate it a 0/5 I 100% would.","title":"Take it down!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stell B","date":"2020-07-08T15:11:38Z"}},{"id":"6172591336","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app to see what the features were like, and thats where the nightmare began. as soon as i opened it, my phone crashed, which i thought was normal at first. but then spiders started crawling out of my speakers and danced to gangnam style. they were made of steel and starred shooting pellets at the walls,  killed my pet hamster by dancing on him to death, and laughed at him afterwards. i tried to reopen the app but as soon as i did a helicopter crashed into my house. when i started to look to delete it, it played the cha cha slide on repeat.

When he downloaded this app, his phone electrocuted him, causing him to have a heart attack. We rushed him to the hospital but the doctors couldn’t save him. We held his funeral at the animal shelter, because the people and animals there were his true friends. He was then buried in our family plot to the north of my house. This app took the most important thing in my life away from me.  Rest In Peace Dad. I will always love you.","title":"This app killed my father","isEdited":false,"userName":"oz240","date":"2020-07-08T14:19:10Z"}},{"id":"6172427413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have perfectly good data and WiFi at my house but for some reason it took forever for the app to download. I was thinking it was just a glitch so I was ok with it. Then when I tried using the app it kept on closing and wouldn't let me open it for more than like a minute. So I thought maybe it’s my phone. So I turned my phone off and gave it like an hour to maybe cool down. Even though it wasn’t hot. Then I went back on and it just kept on crashing. I wouldn’t recommend to get this app","title":"Don’t get it","isEdited":false,"userName":"hoodie913","date":"2020-07-08T14:16:24Z"}},{"id":"6172407704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I \"love\" our orange cheeto puff aka bunker boi. But when I immediately opened the app and it asked me to have my notifications on I had a heart attack. Like, do you really think that you can have the audacity to asked me that question like I would fan girl over this and always open up the app just cause you wanted to let me know about stuff I don't really care about cause I won't ever fan girl over this and I just can't believe it had the audacity.

But as soon as I downloaded the app my phone started to buzz uncontrollably for hours, and there was moaning coming from the app. Scary. \nBackstory: my dog hates my lord and savior Trump and whenever he sees him her barks uncontrollably. So when my dog saw the app on my phone, he started barking for hours, which hurt his throat. Then TRUMP himself heard the barking and came into my house and STOMPED on my dog, and his security wouldn’t let me stop him. And then Trump refused to let me take him to the vet.

The Cheeto is a misogynistic white supremacist. Also the Cheeto was involved with Jeffrey Epstein and that man was a sex trafficker and raped children. The Cheeto doesn’t like immigrants when they actually create diversity and a better economy so why doesn’t he like them oh to criminalize them when he’s the actually criminal my peeps. The app also glitches a lot and my son was playing on my phone and the app started to make my phone do flashing lights and my son freaked out and fell off the chair he was on and broke his arm.","title":"Bad App 🤮🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"Liberal bby","date":"2020-07-08T13:46:03Z"}},{"id":"6172176144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was looking through this app, and the first thing I saw was a video stating that there are black people who support trump. I’m baffled. Trump has proved time and time again to racist. Instead of calling the corona virus COVID he continuously calls it the Kung-Flu. \nHe also often neglects to believe that Americans had a part in spreading the virus. Instead he states that every thing was the other countries faults. If you are a trump supporter I want you to question, why the hell are you going to vote for him!?!? \n\nThank you for listening to my ted talk.","title":"Donald Trump shouldn’t be re-elected","isEdited":false,"userName":"tehe...whoa","date":"2020-07-08T13:07:24Z"}}]}
