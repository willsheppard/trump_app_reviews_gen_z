ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! My youngest child wanted to download this app on my phone and of course I said yes. But ALAS, when I returned from getting lunch ready I saw my child ran away from fright. When I looked at my phone I understood! I’ve never seen a naked Cheeto man in my life! This app is cursed!! I will be haunted till the day I die! My little one still hasn’t come home. Rip my little offspring:(","date":"2020-07-08T23:10:41Z","title":"Repulsive app🤢","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174048324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Momo Yoayorozu","review":"Everything about this app is just atrocious. Even just looking at it makes me sick. Just from opening the app I saw such disturbing images that my therapist is increasingly concerned for me. I had to delete it to prevent more emotional trauma. Truly the experience of this app is a nightmare and should be removed from the public immediately.","date":"2020-07-08T23:06:24Z","title":"Absolutely Horrible. Disappointed and Appalled.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174040147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"alexxxxxxxxia13","review":"I open up the app and immediately see a rotten Cheeto trying to shove his political views down my throat. I can’t believe that such an app exists for people to download. If a child saw this, they would literally be traumatized. It’s preposterous that Apple even let such a thing pass by them. Please take this app off immediately.","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:17Z","title":"literally the most disgusting thing I’ve downloaded 🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174033703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"HdzWndy712","review":"ever since i got this app my plant has gotten dry and i didn’t know what to do anymore. i sang to it, watered it, pet it and it still died. this absolutely unacceptable, besides this app is just ugly in general. i downloaded it because i thought it was a game about slapping trump but i was wrong. now my depression has worsened and i can’t buy another plant until a long time. i do not thank you.","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:53Z","title":"THIS APP KILLED MY PET PLANT","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174030523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"lololoooooooooooooooöooooooo","review":"i was on the app because i love Cheetos. but instead of seeing Cheetos i saw a big human Cheeto naked doing crunches on a couch. i screamed and closed the app. i decided to go get food and found my Cheetos forming some type of army in my pantry. one of them screamed the word “CHARGE” in a very high pitched voice. i’m too petrified to say what all happened that day. but i’ll never be the same all because of this app.","date":"2020-07-08T22:59:43Z","title":"no","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174026495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Geigal","review":"my aunt had this app on her phone so i thought hey, let me check it out. but once i did, what i saw was beyond my worst fears. gruesome vial images being displayed on a LEGAL app that can be downloaded at the click of a button. i truly fear for anyone that may have this app open in the presence of their child. i feel beyond violated. -1 star. disguisting.","date":"2020-07-08T22:58:11Z","title":"absolutely horrifying and disguisting app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174021918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"karenkarenkaren!","review":"downloaded this app because I thought it would help me keep track of trumps important events but I realized that I had plans already made for each event! stuff like clipping my toenails, flossing my teeth, etc! they should really send stuff out more in advance! also this app was very glitchy. if I could speak to a manager about it that would be great!","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:30Z","title":"Worst app ever!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174006619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ceilidhemma","review":"If I could give it zero stars, I would. This is a terrible app, in support of a terrible, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, trans phobic, stupid, hateful, man, who should not be the president. His entire administration goes out of their way to strip away rights of American citizens, who have had to fight to earn those rights in the first place. I am disgusted with this man, and the fact that this app even exists is terrifying.","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:44Z","title":"Worst app ever🧚🏽❤️💛💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173988854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"peaches left toe","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with the current politics in the world. but the second i got it and started using it terrible things started happening. my muffins were instantly transferred to the freezer😭😭 AND THEN I HAD NO LIP!! how will i get a kiss kiss?? i was very ugly 🥺🥺🥺no kiss for me.  the manny stopped being televised. the manny was very p*ssed off. this is the worst experience i have ever had with an app!","date":"2020-07-08T22:44:02Z","title":"violating. awful.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173962447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"My feet be cold.","review":"Thought this app was supposed to be a news thing- all I see is a cheese it in a suit trying to doge all the cases he’s got going on. 💅 absolutely would not recommend.
