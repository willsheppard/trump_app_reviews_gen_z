It freezes all the time. I‚Äôve been getting inappropriate spam emails ever since I downloaded this. I also hate that I keep getting pictures of this fat orange man popping up when I open the app. When I downloaded the app and opened it for the first time I saw a picture of a big orange baby in a suit burning the American flag. It was honestly very disgusting to see someone that people call ‚Äúpresident‚Äù burn our beautiful flag. I hope this app is taken down or something because it‚Äôs not only made my email messed up but my whole phone. It‚Äôs been glitching and it even changed my wallpaper to the Manny flag these dumb tik tokers seem to love. Did not expect this from Donald. Don‚Äôt get this. Hopefully Donald learns his lesson, you can‚Äôt just make a terrible app because you think you‚Äôre the president. Also side note, who names their kid Donald.....","title":"TERRIBLE ü§¢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:46:23Z","userName":"CourtneyCroz","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179661569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"OThis was way too long to download and people are were so rude if I spoke out in against  issue I had with what Trump had done they tried to hack my account and did it but I luckily backed up my account on my email and signing up they asked such personal things 0 out of 10 I do not recommend for any reason possible","title":"Absolutely horrendous","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:46:22Z","userName":"pug-pug_pug","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179661490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"it‚Äôs took 2 weeks to download! and when it did it took me 4 days for me to make it work. then when i went to sign up it asked for my address, my credit card number, and my social security number!!!! i pressed skip then it took all my information. this app is terrible and i do not recommend it AT ALL.","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:46:21Z","userName":"oksksnsn","isEdited":false}}]}
