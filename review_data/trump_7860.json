Wanted to show support to our future dictator but instead I received a dysfunctional app 😔\n\n when you open the app you are greeted with an inappropriate photo of Trump getting a spray tan. IT WAS HORRIFYING!! The app consists of hundreds upon hundreds of ads to Orange tanning salons. As if I am not already Orange from all of the Cheeto dust I’ve been collecting so I could one day look like daddy trump 😤 \n\nAll I gotta say is BEWARE WHEN DOWNLOADING THIS APP! I used it everyday since 2016 and now I have Parkinson’s 👁👄👁","userName":"rvwui","rating":1}},{"id":"6173067910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:22:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrifying","review":"I downloaded the app in the first thing I saw was a logo saying “Trump 2020”. I was so horrified I had to get my mom to go on my phone and uninstall it for me. I am currently in therapy to recover from the trauma I received from opening up this app. A couple flashbacks were actually triggered just going to the App Store for this app to give my opinion and to warn others of the disturbing content this app contains. So please, install and use this app with caution. Never installing again and won’t never recommend to some one else.","userName":"flaco2035","rating":1}},{"id":"6173040234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"My phone started glitching when I downloaded the app and the app wasn’t even working it would kick me out of the app. It also took forever and slowed down my phone and this never happens to my phone. They should get rid of this app. Also why vote for a RACIST president who has INNOCENT kids locked up in cages as if they were criminals? A president who calls people rapist, savages and drug dealers just by their race and color of their skin. All you white privileged people are about to come and defend him. This is Amerikkka. Make America Great Again.","userName":"Your mom is golas","rating":1}},{"id":"6172981167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app❤️","review":"When I opened the app something terrifying showed up on my screen😟.
