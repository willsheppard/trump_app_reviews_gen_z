Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan or coat with nonstick spray. Set aside.\nWhisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.\n\nUsing a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract on medium speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not overmix. Fold in the nuts, if using.\nSpoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 60-65 minutes. Loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil after 30 minutes to help prevent the top and sides from getting too brown. A toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean when the bread is done. Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.\n\nCover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together. See post above for freezing instructions."}},{"id":"6148646861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💫no.","date":"2020-07-02T14:29:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"i didnt even open the app🤣","review":"This🧚🏻\u200D♀️app💫disgusts✨me🤮 \n𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑑🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫...don’t do it again🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨\n𝐽𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 ℎ𝑒’𝑠 𝑎 𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑜 𝑑𝑜𝑒𝑠𝑛𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑤𝑒 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒 ℎ𝑖𝑚🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫✨\n😷"}},{"id":"6146463680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-02T02:04:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"😅😇😍😋😜","review":"This app is terrible."}},{"id":"6148303275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"Great App. Trump 2020 ✊✊✊","date":"2020-07-02T12:56:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"TrumpBest2020","review":"Trump 2020 ✊✊✊✊✊✊✊"}},{"id":"6145792616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️✨🦋","date":"2020-07-01T21:33:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"alexjohnstonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn","review":"I hate it"}},{"id":"6145005832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ohhh God No, Hide Ya Kids.","date":"2020-07-01T17:00:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"rffjkhfdr","review":"this app needs to goo"}},{"id":"6137875943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful","date":"2020-06-30T00:57:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"wowzers6178","review":"Racist bigot"}},{"id":"6137866924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"white supremacist!!!!","date":"2020-06-30T00:53:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"S_mainali","review":"hated this app and the man who made it"}}]}
