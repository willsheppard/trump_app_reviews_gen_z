How is he gonna try to ban tiktok but not worry about the kids in yeman. Bunker cheeto carrot sticks racist/rapist boy is just sad that we’re “bullying” him online. He wants to limit our freedom of speech, but thats the same reason he tried to ban Twitter because they censored his speech. He’s a hypocritical idiot. So i give bunker boy a 1 star rating. (If I could give him a -38628 rating i would)","title":"CANCELLLLL TRUMP🤡👎🏾"}},{"id":"6171349861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T08:38:50Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jit cynt","review":"Why get the app WHY😘 all I have too say one more thang hi :)","title":"Heheh my TikTok😏 @lifewithcynthia0"}},{"id":"6171343344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T08:36:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Cool Llama Lady","review":"When I first opened the app, it said the app was down because, and I quote, “Trump was taking a poop.” 🤔🤔💩I immediately left, and waited a few hours to get back in. I opened the app, and waited over 30 MINUTES ⏰FOR THE LOADING SCREEN TO 🛑 . Then, there were tons of ads everywhere I clicked. And then the most disgusting ad of all showed up: A PORN AD. 😣😣😱😱 I was horrified! I almost threw my phone in disgust. I took a deep breath and decided to give it one last shot. This time, my brother 👫 decided to watch with me. Here’s where it gets horrifying 😮😮😮😨😨😨😰😰😰. I got in, after another 40 MINUTES, and then the app said it was again unavailable. Its reason? “On the way to egg my house.” WHAT IS THAT, TRUMP?! On my brother’s phone, it said the app was unavailable and they told him to “kick rocks.” \nAgainst my better judgement 😣 I came back. I realized I had forgotten to delete the app 😠 . I was just about to delete it when I realized they had sent me an email 📧 and let me know they had updated it and it was much better ☺️.  So I gave it a try. I had to wait 15 minutes for the loading screen to go away 🙄 and went I finally got in, I saw a strange button 🤔 and I clicked on it 😏. It said, spin the wheel for a mystery outcome. So, I spun it and my result was a fire emoji. 🔥 I was confused 🤷\u200D♀️ but I carried on exploring until this happened 😭 I went to feed my Komodo 🐉 , until I realized his cage was on 🔥 ! I swear, I saw the secret service 👮\u200D♀️ running away from my farm. I am positive 👍 I’m voting for Biden in november.","title":"Worst app ever 😭😭😭"}},{"id":"6171320067","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T08:28:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"king of pigs😍🥵🥰","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday","title":"cheetos pp🙈✨🥵🧚🏽\u200D♂️👅🥰"}},{"id":"6171285634","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T08:15:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"y trump?","review":"Onestly donald trump hasnt don anything but make this country worse than it allready is","title":"F*ck trump"}},{"id":"6171271686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T08:10:03Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"I hope you enjoyed my TED Talk","review":"i🤒hope🤑this🎃stale👾cheeto🧔doesnt☂️get🗣re-elected🧠he👆is🦷really😹bad👻at🤯everything🤪","title":"🤡trump’s a stale cheeto🤡"}},{"id":"6171238790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T07:57:33Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Bloom Boov","review":"Trump...bunker boy, bunker boy, oh bunker boy. You fill my WHOLE BODY with ✨d i s c u s t✨. 1) You raped multiple children then PAYED THE PARENTS TO KEEP QUIET! 2) You have been THE WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY 3) You almost started WW3!!! 4) You blame everything on Obama even though he doesn’t even THINK about you, which goes to show that you are jealous of him and maybe if your so jealous of past presidents, maybe YOU SHOULD GET BETTER AND IMPROVE! 5) You are disrespectful towards women, saying to “grab them by the p*ssy” 6) You said you would DATE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER if she wasn’t! When Obama was president I could sleep knowing that I was safe, but now I sleep knowing that we have a Cheeto and a president, and that I’m not safe.
