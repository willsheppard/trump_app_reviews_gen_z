I would be able to see Trump’s true side, not the misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, and pedophilic mannered self. I truly had hope in this app to change the views of many radical leftists, and communistic ridden democrats. It’s really too bad. oh and also Black lives matter.","userName":"Will2734592","date":"2020-07-09T13:09:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176634622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮😡🚫","review":"First off this app took 5 days to download and when I entered the app my entire phone glitched out and when the screen stopped glitching all of my other apps were deleted except for this one and the app kept asking me for my phone number overall this app is a disgrace to the App Store and should be shut down forever","userName":"Kar kar yeah","date":"2020-07-09T13:08:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176591951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL😤","review":"Soon as I opened the app the first picture that popped up was of tr*ump sh*tting on the desk in the Oval Office.
