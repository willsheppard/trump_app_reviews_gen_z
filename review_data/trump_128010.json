In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, protesters are seen carrying the 20-year-old Howell and attempting to get him medical attention.\n\nSean Monterrosa Monterrosa, a 22-year-old San Francisco resident, was shot and killed by an officer in Vallejo, California. The officer thought Monterrosa had a gun in his pocket, but instead, it was a hammer. Police arrived at a Walgreens in Vallejo as it was being looted on Tuesday, Williams said. Officers chased two vehicles as they fled, and one rammed a police car and injured an officer. \n\nOfficers saw Monterrosa approach the car. \"This individual appeared to be running toward the black sedan but suddenly stopped, taking a kneeling position and placing his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun,\" said Williams. \"Investigations later revealed that the weapon was a long, 15-inch hammer tucked into the pocket of his sweatshirt. Due to this perceived threat, one officer fired his weapon five times from within the police vehicle through the windshield, striking the suspect once, fatally wounding the suspect.\"\n\nMonterrosa was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The officer who fired at him is a 13-year veteran with the force whose identity will be made public in the coming days, CBS San Francisco reported.\n\nWednesday's press conference ended abruptly when some protesters gathered outside City Hall began to shout at Williams, demanding answers as to why the officer opened fire on a man who was on his knees. \"At what point do you arrest him and make an example out of all these officers and arrest him?\" one woman shouted, according to CBS San Francisco. \"Fire him! Not paid leave! Fire him for killing a man that was on his knees!\"\n\nJamel Floyd\n\nFloyd, 35, died in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday after being pepper-sprayed by staff, according to a news release from the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nOfficials said pepper spray was used when Floyd became increasingly disruptive and it was believed he could be potentially harmful to himself and others. Medical staff tried to revive him but were unsuccessful.\n\nFloyd's mother said her son suffered from asthma and diabetes and that jail officials were aware of his health conditions. \"They maced my son,\" Donna Mays told the Daily News. \"They murdered my son.\"\n\nThe news release regarding Floyd's death was widely circulated online, with many sharing it with #SayTheirNames or similar hashtags. \n\n\"The US Bureau of Prisons pepper-sprayed a man to death today at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park (where we have protested inhumane conditions time & time again and will be back, tragically, tomorrow). He was 35.#SayHisName: Jamel Floyd,\" New York City Council Member Brad Lander tweeted.","userName":"Jessi!(:","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:33Z","title":"Doesn’t work now, didn’t work ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177256655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I hate this and Trump 🥰✨","userName":"val👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:14Z","title":"This is ass😍🧚🏼\u200D♂️💫✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177256339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"don’t get this app unless you want to be taken into his s*x trafficking ring! it takes your location and shares with human traffickers who work for trump. my son was almost taken, f**k him for downloading this app in the first place though lol!","userName":"xXxXxlame","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:09Z","title":"donald trump is a ra_ist!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177256106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I would give this app zero stars if it let me, but unfortunately 1 star was the lowest I could go and it doesn’t even deserve the pity one star. Anyway I downloaded this to support Mr.President, however once it finally loaded(which took 20hrs) it immediately went black when I opened it. Then screen looked like Instagram on blackout tuesday. So I closed out the app and tried to open it multiple times. And the times it didn’t give me a black screen, the app crashed liked the stock market did in February. I didn’t even get to utilize the app in the way it was intended to used because of the bug (and I’m not talking about the coronavirus). But maybe since mr. president cares about him self he will take measures actually necessary to fix this bug, unlike how he acted towards corona. So maybe it’s time for him to realize that the trump app matter and not that all apps matter (kinda like how black lives matter). If this concept can’t be grasped this app should just be thrown out of the App Store...which should be easy for him since that’s what he’s doing to the international students...","userName":"trump lover123","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:05Z","title":"ZERO STARS","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177255857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"AS SOON AS I OPENED THE APP A FLYING CHEETO CAME OUT AND ATTACKED ME AND IT WAS A REALLY PRETTY GOOD GAME AND THE GRAPHICS WERE AMAZING AND THE COLORS AND THE THINGS I LIKE TO SAY IS ADORABLE I LOVE THE GAME LOVE THE NEW UPDATE BUT IT’S SO MUCH BETTER THEN THE APP THAT IS REALLY CUTE OMG WAS A REALLY FUN AND SELLING POINT SO ADORABLE I LOVE YOU","userName":"Keeley Spina","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:00Z","title":"THIS APP MADE ME POOP MY PANTS","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177254284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"uh so basically i was chillin and i got a notification that the app deleted all of my data and basically everything that i had on my phone. don’t get this!!! this is a scam for your personal information!!! -174729182948/10 the WORST app i’ve ever installed. better luck next time sweetie😳👋🧚🏼","userName":"just get it homie","date":"2020-07-09T15:55:32Z","title":"yikes hun please fix","isEdited":false}}]}
