I opened this app thinking I was going to receive the daily news as the description stated, but instead what popped up on my screen was straight demonic, like something out of a horror movie! It was big and very orange! 🍊🍊🍊 Suddenly the demonic figure in front of me began chanting, “WHITE SUPREMACY, WHITE SUPREMACY!” My ears began bleeding and now the doctor pronounced me as deaf. 😿 Not only did I become deaf, but then a group of police men came into our home with guns in one hand and tasers in the other! I watched my sister being tased to the floor while the rest of my family and I were then kidnapped! Not to mention that the took my pet bird while he was peacefully eating seeds, and ATE HIM! They lead us out and we didn’t know where we were going, and woke up in a dark cave where we were trying to get out of the ropes they tied around us. They even threatened to suffocate us to death by kneeling on us! When we finally all stopped crying, the image of the orange demon appeared above us once again. Naturally we began crying even more. A ring of fire was lit around us and then the police men accompanied by a bunch of Karens formed a circle around us and began to praise the orange demon! They began chanting again but this time worse. They chanted, “WHITE SUPREMACY COME ON LETS GO! RAPIST OR RACIST WE’LL NEVER KNOW!” We escaped once the Karens wanted to speak with the manager and the police said they needed to kill another black person. We are all traumatized from this experience, and we are all deaf as well. We escaped to Canada and now we don’t believe we’ll ever be happy after the trauma this app has caused us! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","date":"2020-07-08T21:57:19Z"}}]}
