It is so trash like I downloaded the app the tired to press it and it did not work. (And yes my internet was working fine). I just wanted to see how our spray tan goddess is going. But the app didn‚Äôt not let me appreciate the fat Cheeto with the bad lace front that is not glued on. All I wanted to do is see how‚Äôs the racist is going. And then I heard a man at my door scream give him five stars. And I was scared then I opened the door and looked at him and it was a man who looked like trump with and confederate flag shirt on. And I was scared for my life and I had to call the police so one star for me.","title":"One star  for the Cheeto","userName":"trumps tan","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173765597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i don‚Äôt know where to even get started with this abomination. first of all it asked for all of my private information and given past history with trump you know he‚Äôs selling my information. even worse i‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs using my information for *personal gain* you know because i‚Äôm a fairly attractive young girl. also this app proudly promotes hate speech and hurtful content. as a women i am offended. i am not a poc but if i was i would be absolutely devastated to see this app still in the app store. it is detrimental to my physical and mental health and many other people feel the same way. delete this app now","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","userName":"Emilyk2198","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:20:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173665015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took me days to download the app! And when it finally did it hacked Siri and made her continue to chant ‚ÄúTRUMP 2020‚Äù over and over again. I got so scared. And then my phone wouldn‚Äôt turn off. I couldn‚Äôt call anyone. And then bunker boy himself teleported to my room through the phone. He said I had to give his app 5 starts and I refused. He then threatened to send me back to my country even though I was born here. After which I drop kicked him and he teleported back to his Cheeto bunker. I quickly deleted the app and will never download it again! Please do not get the app or a human pedophilic racist Cheeto will come to your house!","title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!!","userName":"teteüòö‚úåüèº","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:43:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173657515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is the worst app ever not only is it about the orange piece of crap president but it also thinks that i like my president but that will never happen Obama should have stayed president sorry not sorry to all you trump supporters but y‚Äôall are dumb idiots for supporting the orange man also can y‚Äôall give me one good reason why trump is a good president.. oh wait you can‚Äôt because our dumb president thinks the corona virus will magically disappear if we stop testing no idiot that‚Äôs not how things work. so since you guys support a racist sexist homophobic dumb man all of you are the same. we shouldn‚Äôt have a president that doesn‚Äôt have a working brain.","title":"bad app","userName":"pjosheeen","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:40:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173565750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a good two weeks to download and when it finally did, my phone got a virus, which turned every photo in my camera roll to pictures of president üçä. My phone then began to uncontrollably shake and nearly burst into flames, but luckily, I put it in rice before it could spontaneously combust. When I took my phone out of the rice, it began to glow orange!! I got radiation from the glowing and it gave me laser vision. I then proceeded to burn my house down and kill my family. I don‚Äôt have anywhere to live and everyone I know is dead. It also gave me super gonorrhea and severe herpes and now I will never be able to find love.","title":"TERRIBLE APP!!!! üò°","userName":"vermi poop","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:08:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173561478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Guys once I saw this app I need to DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT AWAY!!!!.

When i tried downloading it the first time i had to go through and delete a lot of things from my phone just so i could have the app. When it finally downloaded after 2 DAYS i would click the app and it would sit on the home screen for 30 minutes and just take me off the app. When i finally did get into the app it was very glitchy and slow running. I decided to just delete the app and receive the text messages instead, but ever since installing the app my phone has been slow. üò°üí´üßö‚ú®","title":"IM FURIOUS","userName":"Furious Boomer","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:06:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173532092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I‚Äôve never been more mad in my entire life. All I wanted to do was download this app and use it but it took HOURS to download. Once I got on the app everything was just so confusing. I had no clue how to work this app and I doubt I‚Äôm the only one. Once my app FINALLY downloaded IT WOULD NOT LOAD! I was sitting there once again for hours watching the ‚ÄúT‚Äù spin until it finally loaded THEN wouldn‚Äôt even let me put my phone number to sign up! I tried using someone else‚Äôs phone number and I had the same problem.

After a blue loading page showed up a orange thing looked back at me. I don‚Äôt know what type of animal or creature it was but it look horrendous. I was so disgusted at what I saw I projectile vomited across my room. My breakfast that I ate this morning was all over the floor. Now everyone I look at something orange the trauma comes back. I talked to my therapist and doctor about this and they said I will never be able to look at something orange ever again. Every single day I look at the color I have to vomit again and again.
