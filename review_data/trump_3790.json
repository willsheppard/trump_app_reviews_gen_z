I can’t sleep at night  thinking that how do these white people support a racist rapist that isn’t doing anything positive for this country. As a Latina I do not support this Cheeto puff thing that you call your pReSiDenT‼️ I really believe your Cheeto Puff PreSiDenT should pass away. Another thing he says “leTs mAkE aMeRiCa gReAt AgaIN” but he isn’t helping America an any way I thank him for the money but other than that money he is meaningless to earth and to this universe."}},{"id":"6172717040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Made my cat crazy","userName":"mikepenceisgay","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:36:52Z","review":"I got this app to connect with my beautiful president. I could only hope to look that good at 74, although, I am a 1000 year old witch, so I did. The app froze my phone and made a screeching sound. I thought it was cursed but any counter curse I tried did nothing. My cat heard the noise and her eyes turned from green to red and she started attacking me and clawing MAGA and ALM into my skin and the floor. Unfortunately I had to wrestle her to the ground and delete the app as fast as I could. Immediately after I did, she turned back to normal and it seemed like she didn’t even know what happened. 0/10 this app will brainwash you. I was only protected because of my connection with the spirits."}},{"id":"6172667045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORSE APP EVERRR","userName":"lil sparkling","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:22:48Z","review":"when i opened the app the worse of the worse started happening to me. my hair fell out and i’m currently bald. and then their was giant rats that came out of no where and they started fighting my cats and ate up my food. and then i went to go get some food at the store and my money grew wings and flew away i couldn’t believe it. and then a huge wind came out of no where and blew my roof away. so now i have no hair, no food, no cats and no roof. I tried calling the cops but they said i’m making this up and that i deserved it. so now i’m starving and im currently using a cardboard box as a blanket bc my roof blew away this app brings bad luck and it needs to be removed before someone ends up like me."}},{"id":"6172424159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"If I could rate 0 I would🙃","userName":"Manny F. Lag","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:15:30Z","review":"This is literally the worst app I’ve ever used in my entire life. When I first started to open it, it completely just kicked me out of the app. And when I tried to delete it, it would not go off of my phone. I have also started to notice other companies contacting me because of this app when I did not give them my contact information. I am greatly concerned that I’ve been hacked by the app and all of my private information has gotten out. I’ve also noticed that when I go into my camera roll, I found pictures of Trump that I had not saved. I think the app is trying to take over my phone please someone help me."}},{"id":"6172012840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It made me die","userName":"Pippy_Tay","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:20:34Z","review":"I downloaded this app to support a Cheeto however my entire TikTok fyp became political people talking very highly of it. It wasn’t too big of a deal until I started being followed around by a man with a terrible spray tan and a blonde wig in a limousine. Most terrifying experience ever!!! Everything started to settle down after a week and I got used to all the strange limousines outside my house, but after a week I straight up died. My family attending my funeral and they all died (they also downloaded the app) and now there is no one left who supports the racist, rapist Cheeto. So now I’m just a ghost ranting about how I died and hoping that no one else suffers the same fate as me. Have a great day. :) ❤️🧚✨"}},{"id":"6177900491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"STAN BERNIE","userName":"Ufxixgixgxgdydyfuigkbkv","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:11:31Z","review":"You go girl!🧚✨ no like seriously leave🦋🥰You can do anything you put your mind to ✨🧚♀️💞 just not this 💖🍃⭐️✨Scroll yourself off the earth while you at it🧚♀️💖🌈Here’s the door for new opportunities! 🚪 💕✨🧚♀️I locked it for you 🥰🥰👑You dropped this 🔴 put it back on your nose 🤡✨🥰I spoke to the queen of the tré🌿🌳she said no thank you but good try🦋✨🌈🥰Imagine being that talented🧚🏼♀️✨💋yea keep imagining😍🥰❤️You made my day 🥰✨💕WORSE🦋🧚🏽✨ You’re in the friend zone 🤩 ✨ 🧚♀️now stay there ❤️😘 ✨OMG you have so much confidence 🧚🏻💞✨ you shouldn’t though💫🧚🏻💗I almost scrolled past this 💞🧚🏻✨ next time I make sure I will 💫🌸🧚🏻 Nice video! 😍🌸 make sure to flip the camera around next time!! 😁✨💞"}},{"id":"6177568732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The app doesn’t work properly","userName":"Don Voss","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:28:46Z","review":"I’m seeing a lot of people talking about Gen Z “writing bad reviews just to get the app off the app store” however, to be quite frank I have no idea what they are talking about at all. I just came here to inform incoming Trump supporters that want to get updates on Trumps campaign that this app does not work at all. It crashes every time I go to use it. I have an IPhone Xr that is newly updated so it’s not an issue with my phone. Also, the format of app is super confusing the few times I’ve been able to use it without it crashing. It needs to be taken off the app store and fixed so it can actually be used properly."}},{"id":"6177461976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","userName":"a small user","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:57Z","review":"This app traumatised me. So it was a sunny day in California when i decided to see what this guy called trump is trying to educate me with. i opened the app and it was basic and irrelevant info. why would u start a campaign no ones going to?

I meant Donald Trump) that was probably taken by a slave. As we continue, we find threats and lies that make my want to jump off the White House roof (don’t worry, I won’t fall on him. He’s out golfing without a mask). Next, we learn that the Donald “(self-proclaimed) J E N I U S” Trump had his feeling hurt by Gen Z speaking out about the **** this @$$hole does. So, he put on his big boy pants and took away our freedom of speech. Really, someone get this guy a copy of the amendments and a history lesson. May god bring him and his Cheeto dust straight to hell. \nSee you when you’re out of office,\nA person with a brain"}}]}
