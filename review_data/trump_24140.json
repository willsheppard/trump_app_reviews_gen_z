Not T as in narcissistic egotistical ignoramus. Now that I know this app is not an app for Troy Bolton’s presidential campaign - this made clear after being greeted by a picture of a wrinkly Cheeto after downloading (very disturbing btw), I am deleting right away.","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:38Z","title":"Disappointed."}},{"id":"6174428870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Mopooh","review":"This app is run by a orange it is disgusting i am generally offended. This orange has tried to take over the world with its citrus acid and i will not stand for it.  This app is the next step to the world being taken over by vitamin C. It is terrible. This has truly hurt and offended me. If the world has to much Vitiman C what would happen.

Donald Trump is a joke of a leader and will never be a serious candidate. His breath smells like rotten fish and dirt. He’s built like a whole fruit roll up and is a filthy liar. He is a rapist and he’s homophobic. Get this man out of office. He deserves the chair, but make it electric ✨❤️🧚🏻🤪","date":"2020-07-09T01:17:53Z","title":"This app is awful"}},{"id":"6174413888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bannanapancake","review":"For one when I opened the app , I was called all sorts of n words and field monkeys and coons  😢and 2nd off I seen a naked Cheeto getting a horrible spray tan and the fuses burned all my skin off now I have 3rd degree burns . 3rd off the app threaten to deport my Hispanic boyfriend 🥺😭😭...

I think that anytime his face appears things seem to glitch and malfunction, so instead of getting this app...people should actually go and support blm protests and advocate for a better president","date":"2020-07-09T01:03:48Z","title":"It’s trash"}},{"id":"6174377826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"chancpa","review":"If I could give the app a below 1 score I would but it wasn’t an option.

I promptly deleted the gross app, but not before the spirit of my gerbil appeared and told me she was going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Now I live in horror and despair.
