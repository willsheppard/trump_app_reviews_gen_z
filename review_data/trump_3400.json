I mean it texted each one of my “republican” friends that trump has dementia so he can not run. Then later proceeded to send ALLL OF MY NUDES. And I mean ALLL OF THEM to my “republican” dad and I’m which turned liberal. I mean come on man trump has ruined my life. Not to mention that every time I tried opening the app Hillary’s face would appear and tell me straight into my soul that she indeed did not have anything to do with any sort of emails. I mean why does this app spread false information (I mean other than those nudes heh). If you download this app it will posses your phone and who would want that 😔✋🏻🦼😮🤬🤬🤬"}},{"id":"6175030352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is cr*pp!","userName":"iphone 410","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:17:17Z","review":"I was really looking forward to learning all about our current president and his plans for the next season of America, but it didn’t seem like there was any plot development. I knew this show was already scraping the bottom of the barrel. They were already killing off all of the main characters from Trump’s team but I thought maybe the next few episodes would redeem the series. Nope! There were countless plot holes and red herrings. Why bring up the murder hornets if they aren’t even going to be a part of the story arc? I just don’t understand the logic of the show. I’ve decided that I’m going to stop watching it because this pandemic really was the laziest writing I’ve ever seen."}},{"id":"6174935503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m from tiktok","userName":"piano+ukulele","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:47:18Z","review":"hello fellow tiktokers. don’t download this app! i downloaded it and my penis grew to the side of nothing because i’m a female! they also stole my lungs and took my little brother. honestly i didn’t like my little brother that much. they also kidnapped my toothbrush 😭😭😭 and i really liked that toothbrush. i got it from the dentist for free and i’ve been using it since i was 6 years old. they also made sans fart in my room and i passed out. they took my stovetop too, so i can’t make mac and cheese for the girl coming out of my brothers room (my older brother) all i can do is teach her renegade. the meme is ruined. dont get this app or donald trump will come to your house and steal your favorite toilet. trust me, i’m not lying"}},{"id":"6174917302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bruh....

A letter, a number and then silence. It goes on for hours and then I hear someone screaming. My mom went to check it out, that's when we lost her. I heard her scream through the vent.\n\nDad went away, he said he'd be back for me. I havent seen him in 2 months. I called the police... said they couldn't do anything about it. There was no ''crime''. \n\nEach tuesday, a letter, a number and then nothing... A letter, a number and then nothing... A letter, a number and then nothing... Someone screaming... \n\nEach time I thought: we lost someone else... I was going crazy. So many lives lost. As I woke up each Wednesday morning I would see a ghost of my mother making breakfast. Pale, weak and dirty.\n\nOn a tuesday, I thought to myself i'd stop it. I would save everyone. I was just a kid but I knew I could make a difference. As I listened to the deep voice, I started planning. A letter, a number and then nothing A letter, a number and then nothing A letter, a number and then nothing\n\n. . .

Why wouldn’t it be. It’s created for people like me. Christian, white supremacists who love to hate on anyone who’s not a straight white cis man. But little did I know that it would destroy my life. I was playing subway surfer while watching the latest video from my favorite YouTuber, Kaitlin Bennett, but then my phone restarted and deleted all my progress in Subway Surfer. I was so confused and angry but then the trump app sent me a notification and said that it would do it again if I didn’t give it all my attention. No one messes with my Subway Surfer so I will no longer support the Cheeto, instead I will vote for skinny legend, Raini Rodriguez."}},{"id":"6174761138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","userName":"Emmy 2001","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:55:30Z","review":"when i first got this app i was hoping to keep up with the latest of our king😌👑 but that night i woke up to a strange sort of heavy breathing sound😳 when i opened my eyes i saw a an orange figure dash out of my room🍊🕺💨 i followed it only to find mr. trump stealing bricks off of my house!!🥴 i asked him what he was doing he said he was going to build a wall⁉️ anyways he’s been outside my house for weeks using bricks from MY house to build this “wall”❌😤 like is it just me or are there better things that he needs to take care of🙊👀 maybe i’m just crazy🤪🙈 but i’m pretty sure this app glitched somehow and now he’s in my backyard so i am honestly just very disappointed to say the least👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"}},{"id":"6174664407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"absolutely mortified. 🤮","userName":"babycheetogirl","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:29Z","review":"Yeah so I downloaded this app so I could FINALLY be able to praise the Pedo Cheeto man bc I love him sooo so much you know?🤤 ... but when I was trying to download it my phone started glitching mad crazy for a few mins. Once the app finally downloaded, I heard a loud CRASH! I looked outside and there he was, hunched over like a cave man on my front porch with a horrible stench I just can’t describe🤢. I was absolutely disgusted, and I projectile vomited it was so bad. Not only will I have to get a new couch because of this but I am now mortified that Daddy Cheeto turned out to be this horrible ogre man😭\nI’ve started therapy since this incident but am still having horrible flashbacks.

As soon as I downloaded it my phone started bugging out. The screen was flickering on and off and I got a notification that my bank account was charged $6,000!!!!!! I don’t got that kind of money so I started to cry and then my mom came in my room and saw how messy it was and started screaming at me and told me I’m too old to be living in her house so she kicked me out! My phone still doesn’t work and I have no money to fix it now so I’m on an old laptop trying to leave this review and save others from making the same mistake I did!

It stole my microwave and my fridge. I had to travel🧭 back in time to get a new microwave from a Dinosaur 🦖 but then my brother died😵 on his way to get a whopper🍔 because the app stole all our food. I then started bleeding🩸from my nose because I could SMELL👃 trump’s homophobic as whole🍑 through the screen. I cried😣 all night on how this app scarred me for life. I don’t understand why you would put such an ugly orange🍊 , fat, smelling, racist, waste of air Cheeto on this app and expect people to still be able to live normally after seeing something as disgusting as that🤮.
