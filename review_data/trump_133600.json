If I could give this app a 0/5stars I would. When I hung up the phone with the police a strange creepy song started playing and a black hole opened up in the ground, 3000283 orange Cheeto spiders came out of the hole and got slimy burnt Cheeto dust all over my carpet!! It was absolutely horrifying and disgusting, if you download this app (which you shouldn’t) make sure you have a baseball bat in hand to kill the spiders. I had to call a mysterious number that was engraved in the ground to reverse the effects of this app. 😤 terrible, gross, horrific. Do NOT download this app."}},{"id":"6173406994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"saraah_123","title":"TERRIBLEEEE","date":"2020-07-08T19:14:20Z","review":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🥱😷🤒🙄"}},{"id":"6173406950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Fdl 🤮🤮","title":"Trump=🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-08T19:14:20Z","review":"Okay my grandma was super excited to get the app she loves everything about trump.And when she opened up the app it gave her nudes of him, and she had a heart attack.May you Rest In Peace grandma.Anywho I downloaded this app to see what was up and I got hacked!!It gave away all my private information.I do not recommended this app at ALL"}},{"id":"6173405766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Arcquivel","title":"worst app ever!!","date":"2020-07-08T19:13:54Z","review":"Too slow and it took almost all my data 😠😠 -100/10 I hate it is just a terrible app!"}},{"id":"6173405407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cheetopuffin","title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-08T19:13:47Z","review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.

It kept crashing on me for no reason but then again everything Trump has done so far has been a disappointment as well. When I opened it it kept asking me such invasive questions like my name and my area code. This made me really uncomfortable and it felt like these questions where violating my constitutional right to privacy. Would not recommend!"}},{"id":"6173401951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ur local mommy pig","title":"Hevxbsjsu","date":"2020-07-08T19:12:36Z","review":"shbxnzjsjwhdbznkzksueyeiejvfbrjdhxbsjeuyeteiakdbsj 🥵🥵🥵❤️❤️😍😍😍🎂😭🥴🥴😳😳😡😡🍑🍑🍑🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊hdvxbzjsijwowutyriqkxbskuryrb"}}]}
