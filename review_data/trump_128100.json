And of course, who would turn down the possibility of a million dollars. Not only did I not win a million dollars, but I also got a message saying that I was a fat ugly oompa loompa trash butt bottom and that if I didn’t vote for trump I would have my cat and brother stolen from me. I them responded “you can take my brother, just leave the cat 💖”. The next morning I woke up to a group of tiny babies with little maga hats chanting “vote trump 2020” Now this might be considered strange but I was unfazed. I got up and realized that my cat was not in the house and on my night stand there was a note that read “We have your cat, it’s ugly, like your face. Vote trump ❄️” This was very disturbing, and the fact that my brother was still here was even more upsetting. I went back to the cheeto app to see if it had any correlation to my cat being stripped from my home. The second I opened the app I got another message saying “I see you've come home to us, fear not, we will save you from the evil, corrupt, and radical liberal left.” I then responded “no thank you 🥰.” They replied “Your sinful, but soon you will be cleansed” I noticed this mans incorrect grammar, so like the nice person I am, I responded, “You’re*” This angered the cult. My phone went up in flames, another baby spawned out of the fire and began shouting at me in polish, and repeatedly slapped me. To this day I still have not received my cat, and I blame this app. I’ll be waiting for my million dollars.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177187084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:11Z","title":"Just wow😊","isEdited":false,"userName":"driaBTS","review":"This place is terrible and I feel sorry for everyone who is brainwashed by the orange man😔 Have a blessed day and watch SOTUS on YouTube!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177186988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:10Z","title":"this app gave me aids🤩✨🌈🔥🌸🧚🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"userName":"gorillagripcoochie✨🤩🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌈","review":"This has to be the worst app in the App Store. Not only did it take several days to download, but it also gave my phone a virus. It also hacked into most of my personal data and it messed up my phone. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP AT ALL!! I honestly believe that the Cheeto puff Oompa Loompa looking a** president that we have, has to look into his app. There’s plenty of errors that have to be fixed, he should focus on this instead of worrying about the amazing app known as Tik Tok🤩 btw I LOVE OUR PRESIDENT!🌈\nTRUMP 2020🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🌈BUT ON A GRAVESTONE😌🤩🌸🔥✨🌈","rating":1}},{"id":"6177186650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:04Z","title":"Trump you suck🤡","isEdited":false,"userName":"deadcat345","review":"This app is absolutely HORRIBLE. I downloaded this app to share my feelings about president Trump. As soon as I opened it, it asked for my address. I thought this was a bit fishy, but I put it in anyway. Three days later a jar of sh*t arrives at my door step. The smell was so pungent that I started projectile vomiting. My cat came and rolled in the vomit, and then he started puking too. He rolled on his back and drowned to death in his own vomit. My mother came in to see what was the matter, and she slipped on the puddle of puke and cracked her head open. She had to go to the hospital, and the bills were so expensive that we had to sell our house. Thanks Trump! You killed my cat and now I’m homeless!","rating":1}}]}
