It took about 24 WHOLE HOURS to download... I didn't even know that was possible. So it finally finished downloading and I opened the app and to my horrifying surprise, I SAW A PICTURE OF THE PRESIDENT NUDE! I wanted to cry so much, but instead, I threw up. I actually ended up throwing so much I had to go to the hospital (it's okay, I didn't wear a mask!) and I became so dehydrated, I almost died... After I got home from the hospital, I decided to go on the app AGAIN just to see if it was a glitch and it did work this time, BUT when I entered my information, I heard a van outside of my house. I was a little startled as I also heard the doors opening violently and multiple people getting out, so I checked outside to see what was going on. AND GUESS WHAT?!?!?! I GOT KIDNAPPED! They took me to a forest high up in the mountains and made me drink baby blood??? Then they all chanted \"MAGA\" and \"KAGA\"... it was scary as they all had white robes and hoods on. SO IN SHORT, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!"}},{"id":"6173806171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is CURSED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:35:27Z","userName":"JJMadea","review":"I think this app is majorly glitched because some wild things happened to me... first of all it took 6 HOURS to download!!! Which I brushed off because I was so excited to see what this app contained! When I tried to open it my screen turned completely orange and my phone started getting so hot I had to drop it! When it hit the ground the whole phone cracked open and orange smoke was pouring out of it and my whole house started to smell like tanning spray😭 that stuff was so STANK my neighbor Karen called the cops to complain about that stench. Nothing else happened that day until night time when I was about to go to bed. My neighbor Karen and a large Cheeto puff with a blonde wig KICKED down my front door and started chanting racial slurs at me and grabbing at me. I immediately grabbed my phone and deleted the app. As soon as I did that, they dissolved to orange Cheeto dust and disappeared and my house wasn’t filled with orange smoke and tanning spray anymore... one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever gone through... beware....please!"}},{"id":"6173316907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my life!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:42:50Z","userName":"Annika C.","review":"when i downloaded this app i was NOT expecting what i saw. this app is horrible and should be taken down immediately! i am now blind and cannot type so i have to voice type this review. trump’s robot rats have located my house and came to attack me and my family!! not okay! we had to flea as fast as we could, because those darn robo rats were eating up my house and everything inside. my mother’s ashes were spilled and they ate her too 😥. i am more than upset mr. president. this app has ruined my life. took my house and my mother, traumatized my kids, and left us fleeing the country! now we live in spain as pottery makers. and let me tell you, that profession is not easy to make money from. ESPECIALLY IF YOURE BLIND. my life is practically over due to this big orange bulbous’s app. screw you trump! i will be making you a pot shaped as a middle finger. it better be sitting in the white house window when my children and i save up to go back to your wretched country you like to call “united”. i spit on your grave."}},{"id":"6173205760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I hated it.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:06:33Z","userName":"Rexyz2","review":"The app was slow and the directions were very unclear so I just left it on one night and went up to bed. But while I was in my kitchen at midnight, getting a snack. I heard a sound coming from my phone, so I walked over and saw Harambe dancing with a shriveled up carrot and I got so scared, so I ran to upstairs, but then all my devices In my house started to play juju on that beat with the old wrinkly carrot dancing ON EVERY SINGLE DEVICE IN MY HOUSE. I grabbed my phone in an attempt to delete the app, but the a flying roach came out from my kitchen cabinet and started attack me. I ran up to my room and locked the door the only way I was going to make it out alive was if I went full kill mode, so, I grabbed my nerf guns and ran downstairs and shot down the flying roaches turned off every device and did a backflip onto my couch to grab my phone and restart it to stop the brutal attack once I had done that I turn on my phone and deleted the app. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone it’s too much of a hassle. \n~True story~"}},{"id":"6173125189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of time","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:40:48Z","userName":"Melina Galba","review":"I downloaded this app Bc I saw all of the horrible reviews listing many things wrong with it. I saw on many of the reviews that it took forever to download and they were right! For me it took an hour and a half to download and I started to get worried what was right on the reviews. At first I wanted to download this app Bc there is a lot of fake news, as our president likes to say a lot, But trying to download it to actually get news is t even worth it! After I waited almost 2 hours for it to download, I tried to make an account and it kept saying I already had an account! I never had this app before this in my life. Trying to get around that was hell and a 3 hour ordeal. When I finally got around that was layout of the acual app is so confusing, I couldn’t even figure out where the latest news was, and if I’m trying to search for something specific, it’s near impossible. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It’s not worth your time, your better off getting your news from twitter."}},{"id":"6173099589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Scary 😖","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:32:39Z","userName":"Sophia.tschida.hai","review":"I downloaded the app to see what all the hype was about ☺️✨ only to find out that by opening this app you turn into an orange 😖🍊 as I looked down at my body I was horrified!!

Second of all, it’s glitchy all the time. Third, you have to enter your number to even get in the app. And lastly, who in their right mind would vote for a president who has repeatedly put minorities at risk, put scientifically proven problems on the back burner, doesn’t straight up address difficult problems, would rather hide in a bunker than speak up, lie his way out of multiple situations, and manipulate thousands of ppl into supporting him????? Doesn’t make sense to me. I would honestly rather get into a hot bath and put a plugged in toaster in it, bleach my eyes out twice a day for the rest of my life, have my ear stabbed and sewn back together, have AI chop off all my toes and make me eat them like chocolate then ever see this app again. A coward. Imagine thinking abt banning an app bc you couldn’t take the the heat. Try again... actually don’t. Please disappear along with this app. ✨💖"}},{"id":"6177796545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wish I could rate this a zero star","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:39:46Z","userName":"Fetus McTiddies","review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!!! I downloaded the app to learn more about Mr. Soggy Cheeto, but I ended up getting something FAR worse. When you open the app it is filled with people who have submitted there videos or photos of them supporting Mr. 🐷🍊. I scrolled through some of the footage and found a video of a women dancing in front of a picture of 🍊naked!!! All of a sudden, the app GLITCHED so HARD. It logged me out of the app and started sending me pictures of naked 🍊. I fainted and as soon as I woke up my phone was completely dead! I went to charge it, but it took HOURS until it could get to 30%! I had nightmares about his nudes nd lost massive sleep!! When I logged on to my phone the next morning, the app was completely gone and I had gotten 127+ messages of 🍊’s nudes. Along with pictures of him burning the flag and a bible!!! I was shocked 😳!!! As if right now I am writing this, I have blocked the number, but it doesn’t work! The messages keep coming in!!! SO IF YOU VAULE YOUR LOIFE!! DO NOT GET THIS APP 🤢🤮👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6177701877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:11:15Z","userName":"noodle____time","review":"this app is just disgusting. the fact that people felt the need to make this an app is beyond me. as soon as i downloaded the app i stumbled upon many trump related propaganda. it confused me so i started reading more. soon it started brainwashing me. i was unable to look away from the screen. there was a whisper in my ear (that sounded a lot like trumps) urging me to say racist slurs. good thing my will power was too strong and i didn’t give in. finally my sister tapped my shoulder and woke me up from the nightmare that was this app. she told me that 7 hours had already gone by. the app also gave me a virus on my phone and i had to delete the app immediately. the virus wasn’t normal though... for some reason it made everything on my phone turn orange. even my text appeared to have an orange hue. the whole phone was orange along with my hands. i wouldn’t recommend this app at all. my phone even started controlling the tvs near by to play fox news. in conclusion i will never download this app again. #blm"}},{"id":"6177263958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"how i almost died from this app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:58:25Z","userName":"athenaok","review":"this shouldn’t even have one star, i downloaded this app to support our WONDERFUL racist homophobe orange ✨✨ as i was surprised to see that all my electronics in my house got HACKED and they were nude pictures of our immaculate beautiful orange double chin of a president. i was disgusted but since i stan trump SO much i kept faith inside me❤️ as i kept going i noticed things in my room started floating and the voices in my head started screaming trump 2020, as they were screaming my eardrums popped which led to my music app opening and sad songs started playing. i then saw a suspicious orange sitting on my counter. as i started peeling it to eat it, our lovely presidents face appeared. to make matters worse i tried to convince myself that i could continue and this could go on but then i started having hallucinations. things started flying everywhere and coralines other mother appeared and tried to kill me chanting “trump 2020” with a trump voodoo doll in her hands. i do not support this app. i almost died. i am a victim."}}]}
