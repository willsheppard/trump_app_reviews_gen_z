But as soon as I was walking my fridge with my friend i saw that she as a white person couldnt open it either, because she was a women so we found her dad who is of course a trump supporter very white and it opened to our shock he got roses sent to him, and Donald coming to thank him in person. It’s outrageous. But ima continue to walk my microwave 😐","date":"2020-07-09T04:47:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Outrageous"}},{"id":"6174895701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sukū- san","rating":1,"review":"DON’T GET THIS APP!!! \nOkay , this is honestly the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. I downloaded this app just to get update on the presidential things going on and thing the app crashes each time I’ve tried to open it. 😡 Not to mention how it kept on asking for my location before it crashes. \n\nUpdate: the app was fixed but more problems occurred.\nwhen I open the app again all I seen was black and then my phone had reset. WHAT THE HELL!!! \nI even had random people call my phone after downloading the app. \nDon’t download this app unless you want random people coming to your front door asking if you believe in aliens or have you voted for MickeyMouse. \n\nFor anyone who decides to get this app be careful because this is the most shady app possible.","date":"2020-07-09T03:35:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🙂Horrible , strange people started calling my phone"}},{"id":"6174895533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"little hommie","rating":1,"review":"so I just downloaded this app and wanted to see trump but then the unexpected happens. My shrimp cocktail spills all over my Gucci x Louis Vuitton sweater. So I went outside and saw spiderman crash into a building. Then Superman went on the dance floor and started shaking that booty of his. So I joined him. Then a massive armadillo invades our city. Elon musk came to the rescue. I had the worst chicken fried rice that day. The next day my teacher was chillin with the teenage mutant ninja turtles. Then I flew to the sky and blew up. Can’t believe a app like this can do this in a day.

Not to mention the fact that it glitched every second and had no updates and gave me an a large number of notifications even though i had no updates. DO NOT get this app unless you want to go get your phone fixed. I had to pay a good deal of money because my phone couldn’t take the racism!","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"lamentable app"}},{"id":"6174770395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Acab__karen","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app this morning and when I did there was a strange noise from my tv upstairs. When I went to investigate there was a slideshow of Donald j trump playing and I couldn’t remove it from my tv. Then my air conditioner went full blast at the lowest setting and my temperature was at 0 degrees and turned it my house into an ice box. The garage door kept opening and closing as well and my speaker system blasted the National anthem at 100% volume. This app caused my smart home to go haywire and it needs to be taken down ASAP.","date":"2020-07-09T02:58:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HACKED!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174760971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"freshboi69","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app cause it’s the president’s but when I signed into it, it took away my rights as a woman and was disgusting to the LGBTQ community! I thought it couldn’t get any worse but then he decided Black Lives don’t Matter. :/ Also he made fun of Greta Thunberg, which is wrong on so many levels. Anyways I got this app to learn more about our misogynistic, sexist, racist, white supremacist, rapist President. But besides my political and Human Rights views, this app is actually terrible, wouldn’t be surprised if it gave me a bug.","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"-5/10 This app is horrible!"}},{"id":"6174754844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MaddieEliseStyles","rating":1,"review":"the moment i clicked install app, if thats what you can call this piece of garbage software, my phone instantly started convulsing and vomiting violently all over my hands and  arms. once that was done my phone starting acting very strangely. it kept sending me alerts and messages telling me to go back into the kitchen and move back to my native land, which is confusing considering i’m a natural born citizen. at one my my phone grew hands and arms and tried to physically assault me. my quick thinking kicked in and i threw it down the garbage disposal and blended the sucker up. those small hands and stubby fingers still traumatize me till this day. i’m writing this review on a newly bought device and i just have to warn people, this app will cost you a new phone. wish i never downloaded it ✨","date":"2020-07-09T02:53:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app i’ve ever seen."}},{"id":"6174725580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"J.L.R.111","rating":1,"review":"First I do not like this app because it is for the cheto man a the cheto man is trying to ban TikTok and the government is trying to ban TikTok and the cheto man can tell the government not to ban TikTok but he didn’t. Second this app is so unnecessary. Third I do not like the cheto man and I will never like the cheto man (if you do not now who the cheto man is the cheto man is Donald Trump). Fourth with this quarantine I am so bored and all I do is watch TikTok so if the cheto man and the government ban TikTok I have nothing else to do. So please do not ban TikTok cheto man and the government and get this app of the App Store I don’t like it.","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No stars"}}]}
