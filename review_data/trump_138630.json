I mainly get my news on from President Trump’s twitter, but my Grandfather doesn’t have twitter so I tried to download this to show him how to use it so he could stay informed. Because this app took so long to download, he fell asleep in his chair. I think it took maybe three or four hours? When it finally downloaded, the phone started buzzing kind of like an amber alert notification and was immediately unusable. A message came on the screen saying my personal information had been shared to “the cloud,” which I don’t even know what that means because I don’t have an iphone. All of this loud noise and scary messages caused my just woken up grandpa to have a heart attack, and die. There was nothing anyone could do to help him, that’s how big it was. So thanks Trump, while I have supported you wholeheartedly in the past, I don’t think I can continue to do so when I know that the bugs or whatever is going on with YOUR app killed my beloved grandfather...may he rest in peace 💗"}},{"id":"6179706882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:02:36Z","title":"Terrible app","userName":"Heuehcjcushevd","review":"Not very good for my massive hands."}},{"id":"6179706729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:02:33Z","title":"So disappointed😖","userName":"Space_Dweller","review":"I downloaded this app for the pure reason of getting to find out more about our glorious Trump.
