Also to top it off it crashes all the time and took 12 hours to download. Needless to say do not get this app, and if this is how he runs his app imagine how he will handle his next term if (hopefully not) re-elected","userName":"ooiinnk","title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:30:30Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173618523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had such high expectations...... but I was very disappointed. I’m unsure what really happened, it took so long to download! Every time I open the app I got a massive headache, to the point I feel as though I’m gonna be sick. And it’s every time I open the app, each time I open the app and see the opening screen I practically through up.
