it was to give me news about my favorite human president trump. but i never expected this to happen. as soon as i downloaded this app a group of people with trump flags(god bless) hanging from their jacket zippers started showing up at my porch. i thought they were god fearing white men, but it was all a disguise.\n         they rung my doorbell like good americans and i opened the door, smiling like the first lady herself. we exchanged pleasantries and all was well. then, they started questioning me about my right sided ideologies. i informed them that of course i was racist, but i wasn’t misogynistic. i believe all lives matter with all my heart(except for the ethnics). they told me they agreed with me one-hundred percent. we bonded.\n         we shared stories of times we lost and times we won. chess, debates, std tests. the whole spiel. then, we all danced around the fire. we felt powerful, we felt free. we sacrificed a pickled miscarriage. we talked about abortion, we talked about the death penalty. we talked about women with false lashes. and as suddenly as it came, the night ended.\n         days passed by, weeks, months, they were always on my porch, protecting my christianity. but i noticed something strange. my various family members began to go missing. i began to worry. i asked the people where they might have gone. they said they took my daughter to a rave and my son to a mosque. i cried to them. i asked them why they would taint my children like that.\n         they told me i had it wrong. they brought them to these ungodly places to show them the sin of the mainstream. the dangers of indulging in un-godlike behavior. i saw the wisdom of what they had done. i trusted them.\n         my husband was no where to be found either. they said he was killed by a group of socialists. i always knew it would happen, it happens all the time. but i was truly devastated as you would imagine. my children weren't sad enough so i took their doors.\n         i had no idea of what was to come. after months of them gathering on my porch, strange things started to happen. small things that come together. my children started wearing crop tops. and listening to joji loudly in their doorless rooms. i would lock myself in the cupboard to escape the senseless noise. one of the people informed me that he was japanese. although the japanese are hardworking, they scare me. and they eat octopus.\n         i found my house was painted from the red and white theme to a green and white theme. i had no idea this was happening. i saw the neighbors talking to an immigrant. i couldn’t believe my eyes. i was trapped. i had no one to turn to. not even the good president trump.\n         i decided to incite the help of the trump supporting straight white men. i told them the problem. i let them know it was probably black people doing all of this. and the rioters. they must have come all the way to the small town of corisville, ohio just to mess with the most pure human on this forsaken planet. me.\n         they listened until the end of my tale of misfortune. and they all turned to each other and nodded. they told me they had not been completely truthful to me. they told me that they had lied to me about literally everything. i couldn’t believe it. i made lemonade for righties. one of them was jewish.\n         i should have known all along. but they were so convincing. in my grief i killed the jewish one, as well as the three gingers. i just randomly picked them out from the crowd and it turned out to be exactly the right ones.\n         shortly after i killed four of them, they started yelling and scrambling. i dropped all four of the bodies that i killed with my brute strength and ran as fast as i could. which is 23 miles. but somehow i managed to use one-hundred-and-thirty percent of my power and ran at 29.9 miles an hour.\n         i camped out at a pigsty for six days, then i went home to get some mega ultra super tampons, as it was that time of the month. they were no longer on the porch and their jeeps were no where to be found. i used my huge brain to deduce that they must have left after i killed four of their people.\n         i got inside, wet like a reservoir. splashing blood across my red indian tiles, crying from the bite i got on my pinky from the piglet that i eventually ate. weak from the salmonella from the raw chicken that i also ate.\n         i turned a corner and there they were. the socialists. how dare they trespass on my house. i did a back handspring and temporarily pushed them back with the force of my ovulation.\n         i grabbed the box of tampons and jumped from the third story balcony into the concrete. i broke four bones but i kept going. i ran as fast as i could but stopped and collapsed as soon as i realized that if i pretended i was dead, they would believe me because i lost more than 43 liters of blood, which the average woman would not survive from. thankfully, i Karen, am not the average woman.\n         i stopped sprinting and fell on the ground. i waited for the socialists to find my body. they arrived swiftly due to the trail of femininity i left behind as well as broken trees and dead squirrels. \n          they surrounded me and started talking amongst themselves. they called me a boomer, said my daughter was hot now that she didn’t own a penny board. i couldn’t believe what i was hearing. \n         i swiftly got up and leaped thirteen feet in the air and landed in a tree branch. all according to plan. and i told them they were wrong about everything and that if they didn’t like this country they should leave. a very strong point.\n         in response they looked up at me solemnly. as if letting me know. they knew i was right. and they missed the night of the bonfire. i stared into their eyes and started to reminisce. then they shot me eleven times in the face. turns out they were uno reverse alt cops. don’t download this app.","title":"communists ruined my life😤👊🏼","date":"2020-06-09T09:54:56Z","userName":"Pickle
