However, the app was very poorly made and caused my phone to crash when I used it for more than 10 minutes, as well as sending me a ton of unwanted emails and text messages even when I unsubscribed. Sucky app, too bad since Trump is soooo great.","date":"2020-07-09T20:39:57Z","userName":"Mr Texas Man"}},{"id":"6178165079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"🗿💕✨🌸","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because 🥺😭I was a girl 👧 in the village 🏡 doing alright✨✨ then I became a princess 👸 👑 overnight so for my first action as princess I downloaded this app🗿🗿and its made all my people🧍\u200D♂️🧍🧍\u200D♀️ hate 😡🤬🔥 me because the man on this app is orange 🍊 and that is the color of our rivals 👨\u200D🦯🧑\u200D🦯so yeah this app is terrible. 🌸💕I guess I didn’t figure it out right, I have so much to learn and see 👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-09T20:38:49Z","userName":"sofia the genz"}},{"id":"6178157742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"...","rating":1,"review":"Honestly this was the slowest app I have ever used in my life. It laggs way to much and does bad things to our environment as in this makes the world a bad place. Our world went from being the best positive thing to the worst part about our humanity. I do not understand what people see in this app, it’s not fun or interesting. It’s just a waste of time.","date":"2020-07-09T20:36:17Z","userName":"hey yeye"}},{"id":"6178127476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"awful","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app, bc I would love to support my lord & savior orange man. Unfortunately, my big brain was just too powerful for the app. It constantly crashed and continued to send me notifications calling me a “snowflake”, and that is so unprofessional. I would HATE to see this app removed from the app store, but unfortunately that is the only viable option here.","date":"2020-07-09T20:26:01Z","userName":"Madiwilliams907"}},{"id":"6178126992","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible 🤷🏾\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"So I got the app to see what the hype was. When I got to the loading screen it said “I detect a n*”....I was shocked honey- I was in tears 😢. I was so taken back by this message I tried deleting the app. But the app said they would expose me if I deleted it😟- I don’t know what for though🤔. Anyways, don’t get this app unless you want the secret service knocking at ya front door😑","date":"2020-07-09T20:25:51Z","userName":"LØverx"}},{"id":"6178109852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Tiktok❤️❤️","rating":1,"review":"I hate this app it’s so dumb acting you should really delete it I hate it so much \nAt first I was like you are going to be raSICT turns out you are I hope u see this the world is trying to change can you plz it will help BLM BLACK LIVES MATTER NOT WHITE FOR NOW WE WILL GET JUSTICE AND PEACE THEN WE WILL GET JUSTICE FOR Hispanics YOU SHOULDNT HAVE TO FEEL PRIVILEGED TO BE WHITE THATS JUST VERY SAD YOU LOOK LIKE AND ORANGE DID YOU EAT TO MANY DINT DELETE TIKTOK YOU ORANGE DIRTBAG I HATE YOU IF YOUR GOING TO BE PRESIDENT PLZ AT LEAST ACT LIKE IT AND STOP BEING RASICT FOR ONCE YOU ANNOYING RAT F DONALD","date":"2020-07-09T20:20:07Z","userName":"Brit everyones bestie"}},{"id":"6178080327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"It’s a no for me ❤️","rating":1,"review":"Terrible design, ugly colors, disturbing images and much more. To use the app you must enter your phone number and according to the constitution it goes against my rights to provide that information. App made my phone scolding hot and start sparking out of the charger port. Also shortly after downloading my dog began to say racist slurs. If I could give 0 starts I would.","date":"2020-07-09T20:10:23Z","userName":"My P.

Don’t ban TikTok. There’s literally no reason to other than the fact that China made it. A lot of stuff from China comes to the US you gonna ban that too??? Just know there’s nothing bad about TikTok that should affect you considering it’s mainly teenagers on it. And I hope that not why you’re banning it.","date":"2020-07-09T20:04:44Z","userName":"DONOTBANTIKTOK"}},{"id":"6178058763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This just ain’t it","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app and man it was horrible! It crashed my phone bc there was so much going on. When I finally got on the app it was so cluttered I felt overwhelmed. Also not a lot of valuable information on the app, didn’t feel like it was made for the president. Felt like it was made by a four year old. Don’t get this app!","date":"2020-07-09T20:03:17Z","userName":"archeryariel"}},{"id":"6178043670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"a ✨cheeto✨appeared","rating":1,"review":"when i opened the app a ✨cheeto✨ Appeared.
