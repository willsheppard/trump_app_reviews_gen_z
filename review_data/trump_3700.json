NO this app takes up all of my storage, makes all of my apps glitch out, AND DELETED MY MINECRAFT WORLDS!!!! I AM NOT HAPPY! \n\nTo anyone who is considering this purchase I strongly advise against it. This app just reminds me of the man who “raced” Epstein to see who could take a little girl’s virginity first. I forgot his name but it rhymes bonald stump. ANY WHO.... I ADVISE AGAINST THIS AS MUCH AS TRUMP ADVISED AGAINST TRANS RIGHTS TO A DOCTOR (taking away their rights basically)\n\ni hope this helps all republicans🎷🦖","date":"2020-07-09T02:27:29Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","userName":"Anne207","rating":1}},{"id":"6174636933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Sometimes I don't wanna be happy\nDon't hold it against me\nIf I'm down just leave me there\nLet me be sad\nSun's up, I already wanna lay down\nFriends calling, are you really tryna go out?

As soon as I downloaded it, a ton of ads started popping up. Not to mention, it also sent me a warning saying if I don’t vote for Trump my whole family will be banished to Neverland. I was scared because I didn’t want to meet face to face with Captain Hook! SHIVER ME TIMBERS 🏴\u200D☠️ how scary! It also keep sending me links that leads to sexual websites that sells dildos. I do not recommend🙂 Somehow I also got a photo of Trump stuck in a Peach sent to me. I was confused! Also, I saw a dirty orange head in front of my house staring at me in a weird way. He told me if I didn’t vote for him, he would all fire us. How rude! He must’ve been sent by this app(It tracks your location so the boogie monster can get you)","date":"2020-07-09T02:16:58Z","title":"🧿👄🧿","userName":"Trump's micro ding","rating":1}},{"id":"6174523030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I opened this app to find the most disgusting picture of a bleached and spray tanned raisin in a Cheeto costume. At this point, I had to put down my phone for a few minutes to cry. I cannot believe they put that picture out in the public for everyone to see! But it gets worse, this app contains the T slur (tr*mp) multiple times! When I saw it the first time, one of my balls fell off. Every time I saw it again another one of my balls fell off. Now, I only have a few more! This app would have made me infertile! But the thing is, when I saw that shriveled up citrus gremlin for the second time, my whole dick fell off! I needed to go to the hospital!

Soon after downloading the app I received a message saying that I had to vote for Trump. The forcefulness of the message immediately made me hate Trump, so I said I would not vote for him. This clearly upset the app. Over the next few days the app continuously sent me messages saying that Trump hates me, that I was the living embodiment of “covfefe” and that I probably didn’t know how to drink water or walk down a ramp properly (like the president). Also, the app sent me screenshots of Trump’s disgustingly tiny hands making obscene gestures. In conclusion, I would not recommend this app.","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:32Z","title":"I hate this app with the fire of a thousand suns","userName":"chckhcbcobxohclhd","rating":1}},{"id":"6174477936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Ok so why did I download this app? Simple, I wanted to check its vibes. However, upon downloading this, the vibes that exploded from this app was incomprehensibly revolting that it made my entire field of crops wither away in despair. I opened the app and a Cheeto appeared. And it’s funny to me because I don’t even like Cheetos 😔🤚🏼. Already my mood soured. Sisters, the vibes in this room ain’t it so focus on ur SATs, learning, self growth, and love 😌❤️ because that’s something that this Cheeto head can’t do 😤\n\nAlso some of these conservatives talking as if they know jack abt the government and public welfare. Y’all don’t and that’s why y’all back a Cheeto I’m embarrassed 🙈","date":"2020-07-09T01:33:37Z","title":"Sometimes I wonder if it’s possible to rate an app less than one star","userName":"abeltownrunner9","rating":1}},{"id":"6174429149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I personally didn’t like how long it took to download the damm app. But after an eternity of waiting I finally got to see the ‘ fAmOus’ ✨Cheeto✨man. There’s not much to say about  Cheeto man than the fact that he is a rare sight to see👀 An animal in near extinction that many people can’t wait to get rid since he wastes so much air and time for people. Like someone should get rid of him soon it’s sad to see Cheeto struggle with his appearance and self esteem 😌 Poor Cheeto man all he wants is to live but we don’t want that we want him far down the ground as possible😍 But overall pretty cheap app, kinda a waste of time since it was so glitch seemed like a boomer was in charge of creating such an app❤️","date":"2020-07-09T01:18:57Z","title":"Chetto Man😍","userName":"nocheetomanpls","rating":1}},{"id":"6174410696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I was sitting on the couch with my 2 kids and they had looked at my phone while I opened the app. When the orange cheeto appeared on my screen THEY STARTED SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND CRYING. My daughter began puking all over the couch and my son 4 year old son said he lost his vision. We had to take both of them to the ER where my daughter had to have an emergency surgery. They also told me my son’s retina had detached leaving him permanently blind. When my husband asked to see what had caused this tragedy, I showed him and he immediately went into cardiac arrest and died. To make matters worse a few days later after returning home from the hospital my daughter, son, and I got corona.

First off I would like to say Trump is the worst president we’ve ever had. He’s racist, he’s dumb, he’s homophobic, he’s just a terrible person who has no care of human life and only cares about himself and his money that’s all he cares about he rather get more money then keep people safe and away from harmful disease that’s going around. Like how did this guy even end up being president the people who voted for him are dumb, just purely dumb. Overall I think that this app is The dumbest thing ever created and no trump 2020.","date":"2020-07-09T01:09:03Z","title":"This app is just 🤢🤮","userName":"Barack Obama's nephew","rating":1}}]}
