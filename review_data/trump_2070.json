It was just different and new, so I thought maybe it could shake things up a little bit. It was a gamble, but I couldn’t help myself. Almost immediately this app appeared to destroy, I mean absolutely freaking RUIN, all of Apple’s hard work and progress that they have made over the last several years. My operating system is now in complete shambles! At this point my only remaining option is to delete this app, possibly even reset to factory settings, or buy a whole new phone! This is a complete and total disgrace to the iTunes store legacy. WHATEVER YOU DO: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP AGAIN IN 2020 unless you hate Apple and want to see their very beautiful and amazing products cease to exist as we know it and #AndroidPhonesMatter","title":"This app is destroying my IOS!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175825655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tigermaddness70181","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:04:41Z","review":"omg... no words... this app is literally the worst thing on the app store. i have never been SO FRUSTRATED with ANYTHING!! whenever i try to open the app, i am just always kicked out!! and to those few lucky times that i do get to view the interface, i can only do so for a few seconds before the app crashes and i can only see a WHITE screen, literally thats it. nothing else, just WHITE. i’m not sure if this is just a problem with my phone, in which i don’t think it is because my phone is almost brand new and in very good condition. i’m sure the developers of this app just don’t know how to run it and are absolutely ignorant. if you want a great app, start hiring people that are actually qualified and educated in how to run a computer software. never download this app, it’s existence angers me.","title":"gross","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175092365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emily081403","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:36:42Z","review":"so i downloaded this wonderful 💖 trump tinder app so i could swipe right on my precious trumpie!! 💞 we matched and he BEGGED me for my address and social security number 🤫🤫 so i gave it to him becuz he’s my soulmate 😍😍😍 he came to my house, stole all my money to put in his rich white man pockets, and killed my pet rock 💔💔 while i was sobbing over the corpse of my rock, i saw the note trumpie left me 😢😢saying how he dumped me for mike pence!!! 💔💔💔 he only dumped me becuz i leaked his micro peen n00des on twitter 🤭🤭 am utterly heartbroken that my beautiful cheeto trumpie would do such a horrible monstrous thing!! needless to say i will be deleting this trump tinder app at once 🚫🚫 i need YEARS of therapy to get rid of my emotional trauma ‼️‼️ but i can’t afford it because trumpie stole all my money 🥵🥵 i am now poor and have abandonment issues. don’t get this app!!!!!!!","title":"trumpie dumped me 😡❌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175035249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sidsid27","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:18:51Z","review":"I immediately received racial slurs from the app. It then called me fat in every language. It hacked into my phone and sent me trumps 🦐 pics. Ivanka then told me she’d give me a lollipop if I didn’t tell anyone. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone who breathes. But if you can hold your breathe through the reading go ahead because this app stinks. I wouldn’t recommend this app to a Trump supporter....actually I would because then it would make them support someone else. I honestly don’t know why, but it also sent me a bunch of pictures of oranges. I could smell them too. I was like “I’m not healthy enough for this” and immediately exited the app. I want the trump train to know it should derail and run into a lot filled with wet cement and get trapped and slowly starve to death because who in their right mind...okay. But yes❤️","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174959229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Qanon Agent2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:54:40Z","review":"First of all, let me start by saying KAG 2020, 2024, 2028!! Our dear president has done so much for our beautiful country, and I downloaded this app with the expectation of an above and beyond MAGA experience! Unfortunately that was not the case. I hold nothing against my beloved president, but in all honesty his campaign team could’ve done more to deliver on this app. Perhaps Brad Parscale needs reassignment to a lower level position in the campaign team, I expected nothing less than exceptional from the former digital media director, and now 2020 campaign manager, but I digress. It is imperative that we own the liberal commies this upcoming November, defeat sleepy Joe, and restore LAW AND ORDER to our  nation. This app leaves a sour taste in my mouth since it does not give me the sensation that this was the focus behind the design process. Nevertheless, GOD BLESS AMERICA and GOD BLESS OUR PRESIDENT Donald J. TRUMP!","title":"TRUMP 2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174878727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"~{Izzy123}~","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:24Z","review":"When I downloaded the app, and opened it, I expected to find a good, christian, loving environment where I can share my feeling about the so called “mask-policies” when all of a sudden, my keyboard starts talking to me! The emoji’s were laughing in my face and opened up all of my apps and acted like liberals. My phone then took my apple watch and grabbed my neck and pinned me down while my Macbook opened up my bank account and donated all my money to the app. I started to see black and all the screens flashed red, blue, and white lights in my face. I woke up a week later and have only recently regained control of some apps on my phone. You could say it was the liquid meth I drank or the Russians infiltrated my phone. Whichever it may be I need you help to stop the emojis from doing more damage. DO NOT GET THIS APP SO HELP ME GOD","title":"HELP!!!

If there was a way to give this app a zero I would. Not only was it lagging, but it had also given me nightmares. In these night mares I am being squished by, you guessed it the Cheeto himself, much like how trump is squashing everyone’s rights. Also after downloading this app I have had a weird feeling, almost as if someone was watching me, she is very familiar and honestly the most annoying person/ group of people there are. I can’t remeber their names but they start with k and end with aren, hmm guess we’ll never know. If anything downloading this app has made me want to wear a mask even more to hold in my vomit when I hear or see anyone associated with the Cheeto devil himself.","title":"Karen????","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174810704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"genzganggang","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:10:29Z","review":"As soon as i downloaded the app, many things in my life began to go south. for starters, i got a direct notification from the app saying that my kind isn't welcome to have this app. when i opened the app, my whole family disappeared in a cloud of ash as if Thanos snapped his fingers and blew them away. I have never been so distraught that my own family would disappear from my life in such a quick instant. now that i have nobody in my family, i have began to sell my body for any means of income. as that began to flop, i decided to sell oranges under the freeway. as i was selling his kind, the cheeto man himself cane after me and bought them all with his team and threw them at me. i have never had such a negative experience with an app. this app is truly disappointing and has ruined my life.","title":"the worst app to ever exist.","isEdited":false}}]}
