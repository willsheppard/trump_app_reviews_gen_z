Starts glitching so what do I do? I restart my phone! I turn it on and I’m on android! This sh*t crazy! All my photo albums look like pixel art, my wallpaper tho, don’t get me started. I was walking my brother’s dog’s cousin’s sister’s brother’s Dad to the mall, then I saw something at first it was a dog so I went to pet it, BUT it turned out to be orange hair it grabbed me yanked me and took my phone what happened next? I look up I was like it’s a plane! It’s a bird! No it’s nothing, no seriously nothing. I was dying so I was hallucinating anyways tho, don’t get this app. Cause like why?

I looked past this hoping to support my daddy,  my superhero, trump. Nothing happened for the rest of that day however in the late hours of the night everything started turning. I got a call that my cat ran away, my grandpa died and my whole immediate family got in a tricycle accident. Though upset I thought there couldn’t possibly be connected to downloading the app. Then I decided to fall asleep and deal with this all in the morning. While asleep I woke up and saw a tiny orange man scatter across my room. I thought I was seeing things but then my cat rose from the foot of my bed. He was now orange and wearing a fedora and tiny boots. I then realized that wasn’t my cat that was puss and boots. I then thought shrek wouldn’t be far off. So I got out of bed yelling “ take me now shrek, marry me baby girl” and while running to the door I tripped over this fat man orange man. I yelled “you’re not shrek, shrek is green not orange” he then said in the stupidest voice “hehe I’m taking you”. I then decided to show hospitality hoping to distract him and make a run for it. I handed him a glass of water but the first problem was that it was too big. He wasn’t able to hold the glass because his little hands were too small. I then had to get a shot glass which was the perfect size. I filled it with water and handed it over, but then the next problem appeared, he couldn’t drink the water. While focusing on taking a sip I managed to call the police. The police came and told me this was the president, I walked up and asked him how he got my address and garage code. He then said the app I downloaded takes all of that information and to deepest darkest secrets. He said he ordered a puss in boots impersonator because he knew my deepest darkest secret, my love for shrek. I then shouted you can’t order a impersonator! Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!! . He then said the app was connected to all my families deaths however not the cat! Overall don’t download this app I lost everything to it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176509723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:34:16Z","rating":1,"title":"The bugs in this app are insane","userName":"S🍕🤙🏼","review":"The amount of bugs that have to be in this code are astronomical.
