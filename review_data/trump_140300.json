But by the 3rd or 4th day of having it, it started really messing up my phone. It somehow kept taking up more and more storage even though I wasn’t updating it or anything, and now a bunch of pictures and notes documents are missing from my phone and I can’t find them anywhere! This has never happened before and I haven’t downloaded any new apps since this one, so this app must be causing the problem. THEN things got scary, I started getting a bunch of random numbers calling me, which I didn’t think much of at first and didn’t answer, but the same few numbers kept calling so I finally answered in case it was something important - i have no idea what they were saying but it was some guy speaking Russian, the number wouldn’t stop caring me, I had to block it and delete the app. Literally the only word I understood was “Trump” so it obviously has something to do with the app/his administration. Would leave a 0 star review if I could, terrible","userName":"sally sue smith","title":"terrible app, keeps crashing & messing with my phone"}},{"id":"6179519407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:34Z","review":"I was just looking for a way to pass the time so I got this app because why not 🤷🏾\u200D♀️. All of a sudden the paintings on my wall looked upon me with scorn. My fish looked at me with hate in their eyes. This app made spongebob’s pants round. This app is the equivalent of stepping in water with socks in. It’s like eating soggy popcorn. Like seeing someone litter. Like waiting forever to get food and then discovering that it’s cold when you get it. Like seeing floor tiles only one is off centered. Like seeing a comment section on a solid video full of bots. This app is trash and I don’t approve. It ruined my life. It made me stuffed tiger sad. Do not get this app. I would rate it less than one star if I could","userName":"Fhjajwkkm","title":"Ruined my life"}},{"id":"6179519372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:33Z","review":"i hate that i was willing to download this in the first place","userName":"MINECRAFT'S #1 FAN!!!!!!!OMG","title":"stop"}},{"id":"6179519306","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:32Z","review":"Horrible policies ideas person just horrible, needs to be stopped","userName":"heisapig","title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6179519189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:30Z","review":"i downloaded the app to show support for my favorite president but soon after, my house blew up, my pelvis split in half, and my cat swallowed my favorite spoon. i’m telling you all this to ensure the safety of my fellow trump supporters!!","userName":"GoodMagic","title":"THIS APP IS NO GOOD"}},{"id":"6179519161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:29Z","review":"This gave my phone ✨virus’s✨","userName":"gigi hates trump","title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6179519059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:28Z","review":"First of all, this APP took MONTHS to download, so slow🙄!!! Second as soon as it downloaded horrible things started happening to my phone, almost like it was hacked👾👁\u200D🗨! Weird symbols started popping up all over my screen «жйшфыне» . It got really bad when my phone came to life like some psychopathic robot and attempted to sell my family’s farm🐱🐶🦃🐓! The farm went into pure panic and the hackers were able to hack the tractor 🚜and drive it around completely destroying the fences and letting all the cattle 🐮and emus 🐦stampede through the neighborhood causing more livestock from other farms to break out and destroy the entire neighborhood😦😱😭! It is complete chaos here now! The animals driven mad by the hackers have turned against us and trapped us. People are getting desperate and IT HAS BECOME LIKE THE 76TH HUNGER GAMES MIXED WITH ANIMAL FARM😤😳🏹! don’t know if we will make it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP OR MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR 🙏😭😭","userName":"Farmer Jones 👨\u200D🌾","title":"THIS APP DESTROYED EVERYTHING!"}},{"id":"6179518953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:57:26Z","review":"The minute I opened this app, I was informed my face was being scanned for security purposes. A message that popped up said “unable to rate, contacting Final-Say Authority”. Then, the app auto-opened FaceTime and called Xi Jinping. He told me I was “quite ugly, wow” and that I obviously had a “nasty nasty personality” because of the shape of my left nostril. He’s not WRONG, but it was highly unprofessional! Then he hung up and I war redirected to this app again. I was issued a report that said, based off of Xi’s security analysis, I was too fabulous and beautiful to be a real Trump supporter and must be an imposter. The app kicked me out and I haven’t been allowed back since. All I wanted to do was support my president!! Will not be downloading again.","userName":"xxo gossip girl 07","title":"China’s president called me ugly!!"}}]}
