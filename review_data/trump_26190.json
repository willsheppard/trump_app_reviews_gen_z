He’s a blind president and all his supporters are also blind, they don’t see all the stupid stuff that’s he’s doing and a person in their right mind would never support that. This app is just another way of making you blind and his supporters even more blinded. 🍊"}},{"id":"6168341623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-07T14:01:40Z","userName":"good star reviews","rating":1,"title":"Squirt me babe😘🥳✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app it started playing “cotton eye joe“ extremely loudly.
