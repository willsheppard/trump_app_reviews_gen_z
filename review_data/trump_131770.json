Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

THE ugly Cheeto that owns this app is bad for society and HE HAD THE NERVE to do a rally on STOLEN LAND without permission and he shouldn't have an app with his ugly ass. Also he knows nothing  about being a president and should stick to being whatever the hell he was before. Also the fact that he raped a 13 year old girl but y'all aren't ready for that convo. Anyways Chile keep rating it one star and eventually they'll remove this useless app. ☺️☺️","userName":"thixxynixky","title":"DO NOT GET‼️‼️⚠️"}},{"id":"6174170634","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:51:18Z","review":"Hhfndnhdh","userName":"BRANNEW23344","title":"Man you are literally a orange eating a butt😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂"}},{"id":"6174170517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:51:16Z","review":"I wanted to show all of my respect for the great and honest African-American lightskin president.So after I downloaded this app my 74 year old grandma fell down the stairs trying to get some toilet paper because she had diarrhea😫.I asked her what is wrong and she said that she was on the phone with my doctor (Dr.McStuffins) who was actually on his way to McDonalds and that I was diagnosed with Trump-need-to-go-in-jail-ancer.Dont recommend you get this app because I wasn’t ba ba ba ba baaaa lovin it!!! 😭😬\n\nInstagram: sydneithekid 🤣","userName":"SidtheKid💜","title":"I WARN YOU 😳👀"}},{"id":"6174170256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:51:10Z","review":"Uh oh\nStinky\nPoop\nAhahahahahaha\nPoopies\nFunny poopies\nElelelele\nHaha\nFunny poop, poop funny\nWheee\nHaha\nYay for poopie\nGood poopie\nPoopie funny\nHahahahahahaha\nPoop poop poop poop poop poop poop,","userName":"AmyUrMom04","title":"Can you DONT"}},{"id":"6174170272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:51:10Z","review":"As soon as I opened up the app I got a picture of some racist, homophobic, sexual assaulter, Cheeto puff. It was so disgusting that it made me almost throw up 🤢. My dog was also with me and she got up and decided to run into the wall because it was so disgusting. Jesus is also with me he has a few words. I know I died for your sins but if I known people were just gonna do this I’d rather just not have been on earth in the first place. -100/10 would not die for his sins. Thanks Jesus. Legit the worst person on the earth. Man sees color as a threat, sees women as an object, and uses the lgbtq+ community to help gain people and then immediately stab them in the back. He is a coward and thinks tanning his skin orange was a good idea. It’s 2020. You’re a grown man start acting like one. And take off that rats nest on your head. And now some final words from Satan and god. Satan: I don’t want him. God: I don’t want him either, don’t give him to me.","userName":"your grandparents","title":"No one wants him 🐸"}},{"id":"6174170139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:51:08Z","review":"this app deserves to get deleted😹","userName":"ihatetrump28292929","title":"i hate trump 828228"}},{"id":"6174169705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:50:58Z","review":"This app is literally the worst app I’ve ever had cause I give accesses to my photos and it selected all of them and also went to my contacts and added contacts that i didn’t know also a lot of unknown people were calling me cause of the do all trump app and telling me if want to hang pin tonight and people knew my address course the dona Trump app also we’re asking me for my credit card if a could I will give a -0000000000000 😡😡😡","userName":"nottogetthisapp","title":"I hate this app"}},{"id":"6174169277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:50:48Z","review":"PLEASE delete this! i opened the app to a HORRIFYING sight of a fat cheeto with corn looking hair 😪. i’m traumatized!!!! after regaining my mind i looked farther into the app and found MORE CHEETOS!!! cheetos with 🍤!! this app stole my 10895 children out of my freezer i can’t believe this!!!! ugh 😩😩😩😩","userName":"hostage holder","title":"no❤️"}}]}
