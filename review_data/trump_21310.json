I was so scared I passed out. I woke up and could not believe this was an actual person. Then turns out he’s a racist 😭 I don’t think any app should condone this behavior. It’s sending the wrong information out to people and caused me a great deal of pain.

I then consulted my microwave to discover that this app installed a malware to my internet causing random things in my house to start talking about building walls.

DO NOT GET!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"For one thing, the app always glitches out and i’m constantly being exited from the app. Also, this requires you to enter your phone number and i’ve gotten countless amounts of spam texts. Seems sketchy that we have to enter a phone number in order to use the app; it’s like the government is trying to spy on us.","date":"2020-07-09T02:14:21Z","userName":"Angiejq"}},{"id":"6174612501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The second I downloaded this app, a troll crawled out of my phone and proceeded to beat me up.
