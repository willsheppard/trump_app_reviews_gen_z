I was hoping to gain new knowledge about the president’s campaign, but milliseconds after putting in my phone number and email, I got HUNDREDS of texts and emails from the app, and was unable to stop it from happening. And, the only news that’s shown is FAKE and a LIE! I was unable to determine whether or not what I was reading was even real. I couldn’t even spend a full five minutes on the app without crying. Would also not recommend for someone with sensitive eyes. I ended up having to delete the app from the lack of sleep I was getting. Please take my advice and DON’t download this app!
