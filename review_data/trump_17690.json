He started insulting me, calling me the n word, (even though I’m Asian) and told me he was watching. Now this in itself is disturbing, but what’s even worse is that my 8th born child killed my dog the next day. This app is from HELL and will turn your children into murderers! I wish I could give this no stars, it was terrible!","title":"No✨💕🧚","isEdited":false,"userName":"JD onion","rating":1}},{"id":"6177299765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:44Z","review":"Every time I open the app, it makes my phone run extremely slow and has even caused my phone to restart several times. Would not recommend this app to anyone unless they want to really force their way through the lag and crashing.","title":"Absolutely awful and can’t even function","isEdited":false,"userName":"Newton Mi Plenis","rating":1}},{"id":"6177290891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:06:12Z","review":"so basically i was going into the app and stuff and was greeted with putting in my phone number!! i have no idea what they could be using my phone number for so i immediately deleted the app. also if mr. trump is going to ban tiktok we will ban his app. so i was just saying that this app caused me terrible fear and i had a AWFUL experience with this app!! that is all...

I downloaded this app because i was told it would bring me to Mr. William Wonkas Chocolate Factory. Sadly it didn’t. Also everything is way too crunchy it reminds me of the one time i saw a bird in a tree. What was it doing there? These earthworms are planning to take over and you’re just gonna let them? not in my planet I was very upset about the room service this app provided","title":"Where’s the flavor?","isEdited":false,"userName":"ShÄñÊ ŸåW","rating":1}},{"id":"6177222099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:46:11Z","review":"I would give it 0 stars if I could! This app is poorly designed it looks like they forced (not even paid!) a 12 year old to design the app. It caused an insane amount of virus and I’m not huge on conspiracy theories but after I downloaded this app HUNDREDS of Trump ads popped up on all of my other apps. This app is infiltrating propaganda. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","title":"This app is horrible - not even worth the download","isEdited":false,"userName":"Gina Vito","rating":1}},{"id":"6177220272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:45:40Z","review":"First of all it took 69 days to download and it made me feel like 👁💧👅💧👁. I just wanted to see the Cheeto but I had to wait. Then once it downloaded it glitches out and my phone broke so once I got ANOTHER phone and now I can’t afford my hot pockets so I can’t eat AND it called me saying I’m a ✨fat loser if I don’t vote for trump✨ and I’m not even apart of the gen z thing but ya know I hate this app 🦐","title":"✨trumpeatspenis✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"nrjdjdjdbskdh","rating":1}},{"id":"6177215707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:21Z","review":"I downloaded this app but then my phone shut off and donald trump came to my door telling me that since i am just a dumb woman i wasn’t allowed to learn about politics. then he put me in a trance and i woke up in the white house. i had to escape past all the security guards and on the way i saw barron, i tried to help but he just told me to run far far away. this app is terrible✨🙈💕","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"_Kay_Lu_","rating":1}},{"id":"6177206389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:41:41Z","review":"I downloaded this app to be able to keep up with the news of the Trump 2020 campaign as I feel that it is important to keep track of politics especially during an election year. However, this app truly let me down. I was constantly experiencing glitches and I do not think that the app was a good source for news. Do not download this app.","title":"TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"aвι2234","rating":1}},{"id":"6177198652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:39:31Z","review":"I downloaded this to see what the Trump Admin was going to do for another four years, after I downloaded it, my internet was having issues and I literally lost threads of text messages and realized this app was garbage just like the last 4 years the Trump admin has been leading this country. Would rate it a 0 if I could.","title":"Tried it and it’s garbage","isEdited":false,"userName":"sambam1023","rating":1}},{"id":"6177169203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:31:10Z","review":"The app kept crashing and glitching, and its not due to my wifi because every other app was working fine. I think it could been a lot better.
