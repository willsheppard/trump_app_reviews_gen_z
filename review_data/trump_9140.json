The app is prone to numerous errors and software crashes; this is in relation to the format of the program, which is very unprofessional. The “Gen Z” movement on TikTok have a point though. Why allow someone to run a campaign in which the creators lie to their consumers? Don’t do conversations with Black people and women in general when it is quite apparent that you’re racist and homophobic. Simple as that.","title":"Terrible App","userName":"llwowlajdndnr","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177688089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:07:02Z","rating":1,"review":"I don’t know if you’ve heard but most kids these days love using the app Tiktok! It is filled with fun dances, game and challenges! The app has something for everyone based on interests, and lots of people have a big following!\n\nbut DONALD TRUMP wants to take this app away from us!!!! The app that makes us feel safe! So please please we cannot let this happen!

Upon opening the app for the first time my entire phone restarted. After this, every app I would try to use would glitch. All of my previous texts have deleted and I keep getting random texts from friends and family asking why I am sending them random facts about Trump! Would not suggest downloading unless you want to reset your entire phone!!!!","title":"worst app I’ve ever come across","userName":"suzan myers","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177653114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:51Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app on accident. I opened it up and he wants my phone number, probably to send me pictures of his itty bitty shlong (I would not like to see anymore of that btw, please stop hurting my eyes). I obviously refused to give it up and then just flat out uninstalled it cause why would I keep such a garbage app on my phone where it could take up my storage. So that’s that, no more trump pls, idk who else we’d have, but as long as it isn’t him, it’s all good.","title":"No cheeto man 2020","userName":"Moe alramahi","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177649376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:38Z","rating":1,"review":"After downloading the app I notice my phone started glitching and turning on and doing stuff on its own. After taking it to a professional I’m completely certain this app allowed hackers or government or I don’t know who hack into my phone and watch me, look at all my information, make random appointments etc. In fact the professional that looked at my phone said he heard heavy breathing on my phone. He said it was no longer safe for me. I’m scared DONT DOWLOAD THIS APP!!!","title":"I’m scared","userName":"Nick Louis Robert","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177575089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:30:50Z","rating":1,"review":"i decided to get this app in support of my...least...

This app shouldn’t be allowed on the store because of its sickening appearance and content. I felt the need to leave a review because I wouldn’t want any other American citizen to feel the churning in their stomach I had to experience when I downloaded this application. Absolutely disgusting that Apple would allow this type of content to be acceptable. Extremely disappointed. 🤬🤬🤬","title":"Very poor app, dirty, nauseating","userName":"lilhuddystinks","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177466730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:19Z","rating":1,"review":"I was so excited to get this app to support our favorite little orange faced bunker boy.💋👀 Within SECONDS of opening the app, my phone shut off for 4 days and then when i finally got it to open again my entire phone was erased and i found out pictures from my phone got leaked!!!!!!

As a young black teen girl I’m sacred and I fear for everyone, this isn’t right I shouldn’t have to be scared everyday when I wake to when I’m going to sleep this is just not fair.","title":"He shouldn’t be our leader!📍","userName":"🤠Merii🍪","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177416127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:42:05Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this app because I wanted to know all of the updates about the big 🍊 but after the first few days of having it I noticed something scary‼️ so scary, every time I opened the app BOOM a picture of a orange Cheeto with a obese human figure would pop up 😭. And then after a WHOLE week of having it the nightmares of this Cheeto started to come through 😓 I absolutely had to delete this app immediately after the nightmares started.
