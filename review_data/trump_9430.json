If I were to download an app I wouldn’t want it to wreak. Third, “Make America great again”? No. We have had North Korea wanting to bomb us, saying horrible nasty things to people not of the white race, wanting to ban same sex adoption, and since I got the app, I have had cockroaches ALL OVER my house.

It folded like a lawn chair and it’s knees caved in.

I just came from my trip on tik tok, and I heard you were planing to take it down???? NEVER come for tik tok!!! GEN Z is not going down without a fight you hear me?? If you take down tik tok even more people around the world will start hating you. Except for me, I’ve hated you from the beginning💅🏽 but besides that, over 800 million people own the app. And in 2019 tik tok had 37.2 million users in the US. And by now, 80 million active monthly users in the US.

I realized it is actually TRASH just like our president and should be removed from all platforms. The app has so many glitches and just ridiculous. Every time i think of this app i want to burn my phone. I can’t believe this app is still on here. What world do we live in where we let a racist homophobic rapist govern the US. Absolutely not. Not today honey.

That’s why I hate it. Honestly I’m starting to think Kayne west would be a better president honestly. Let’s look at the facts. Trump hid in his bunker afraid of his own people. The wall still isn’t finished. More people have lost there jobs in history. Should I continue? Ok. He almost started world war three. Instead of talking to North Korea he decided to say he also had a missile pointed at them. I rest my case. Oh and did I mention he is ORANGE!!!!!!!","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"userName":"worst president ever honeslty"}},{"id":"6172307777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:43:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is not helpful AT ALL. The app crashes and glitches like crazy, and it got so bad I had to put my phone in rice. Other than that, this app is just a bunch of spam. It tries to pull you in to their Cheeto cult. First of all, why support a Cheeto? It literally can’t to anything. Second, this Cheeto cult feeds you lies. Third, this specific Cheeto is a racist and a rapist. This app is a way for the head Cheeto to ask for your nudes. Sending nudes to a pedophilic Cheeto is illegal. Please help spread awareness about this Cheeto cult. No good can come from it.","title":"Cheeto Cult","rating":1,"userName":"citizen against cheeto cult"}},{"id":"6172210635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:16:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This made my phone go crazy!

Also I feel like I would like to be able to see more about my husband Barron Yk like #freemymanBarron.

As someone part of the tide pod eating movement , I would like to say that this is far worse. I hope that someday when I’m far under the earth and deep in my lovely casket no one will ever have to lay eyes on the president or this app again.
