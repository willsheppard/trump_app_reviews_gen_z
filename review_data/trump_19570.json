When all of a sudden my phone glitched because of the app and it turned off. I was so scared and thought it was broken because it didn’t want to turn on anymore.

And then the app closed. So I open it a couple times again and then, finally I see the main page. It was very underwhelming, the app crashes and it’s not very useful. Honestly I’m done with Trump altogether #settleforbiden","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:47:21Z","title":"This doesn’t work","rating":1}},{"id":"6172522247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"OG Kitty Destroyer","review":"When I got this app I was under the impression, As a trump follower of the lower IQ status and given into account my hillbilly ways, this app was not near racist enough. I thought Trump was for “Preserving our History” and I didn’t see not one thing about where too meet up for cross burnings or even how to Host a cross burning. I did not enjoy this libtard app. Have a good day.

It kept send me messages and hacking my phone. And quite frankly now I realize that this isn’t the man I want  my life to be in the hands of.
