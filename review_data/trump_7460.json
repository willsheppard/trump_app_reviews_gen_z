When I downloaded the app my house flipped UPSIDE DOWN. It was the craziest thing. I have taken this as a sign not to vote for trump in 2020. My house also became INFESTED with bugs. The app also started randomly playing all of the racist sexist and homophobic things the Cheeto god had said while I was sleeping and this woke up before I would have liked to be up. Absolutely the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. TAKE THIS OFF THE APP STORE PLEASE! No one deserves to experience what I have.","date":"2020-07-08T19:13:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173334609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨the worst app ever created✨🧚","userName":"kayleelunsford","review":"this app took weeks to download and once it downloaded it said that i had to make a sacrifice in order to use it😪so i killed my cat like any other sane person would do but it said cats🙀didn’t count. so i then tried to kill my sister😭. she put up quite a fight but in the end i got into the app.🎉after getting into to the app it was not worth having to kill my cat and my sister🤕 so i deleted it and now i am an only child.

Every night since the day I downloaded the app, donald would enter my screen and whisper sweet nothings to me and my daughter. I thought this may have been a glitch, but it would continue. More nights after that, he would begin to facetime me and have virtual tea parties with his pet roaches. This was the last straw, so I deleted the app. I now have to go to weekly therapy sessions with my psychiatrist.. who’s going to pay for my meetings??","date":"2020-07-08T18:43:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173310859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t download this app","userName":"iiiJennyx","review":"This app is so bad because it took forever to load and it kept on kicking me out when I try to tap on the app. Do not download this app cuz it doesn’t even work and it tell me I have to pay the app now? For $100? Like I don’t have no money I’m broke as hell. And then when I had to go to the bathroom. The app started to glitch my phone so bad that it froze and I had to restart it it took me forever.  So App Store you better take this app down because you don’t want people to give bad reviews. 😍😒✨🧚🏻💓","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173310738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app!","userName":"lechuga de queso","review":"There was nothing but trouble while trying to get into this app. It took me three hours to download, and once it was done downloading, I was met with countless loading screens. I checked my internet, and it was completely fine, but the app kept glitching. I wasn’t able to support my idol Donald Cheeto trump, looks like I’m just going to have to vote for the better president this year, he can’t even handle making an app correctly, so what makes you people think he’s going to correctly handle a country?","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173164189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is not worth it","userName":"luchhhaaaa","review":"I bought this app to keep up with Trump and politics but when I first bought the app it took over two hours to download, and it glitches out every few seconds. I would think being the president of the United States you would have one of the best running apps but no, this app barely functions. And seeing that the United States might ban one of my most favorite apps of all time tiktok that has brought success to America and good revenue I have nothing to say but to leave a bad star rating.","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172981677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"notrumpfor2020","review":"When I tried to support trump the app was glitching like something was hacking it and it also made my sister go coo coo for coco puffs when she got on the app her self she was a mess I don’t know what it did to her but it’s a demon inside the app and now my sister is crazy and she is showering in her clothes and screaming  y’all be careful it’s a demon in the app.....snnsnsss I don’t like trump and I never did u racist and u a rapist u tryna take down tik tok like what u look like a orange anyway I hope u don’t be president and Obama still my president trump u ain’t NOTHING TO ME now black life’s matter✊🏽","date":"2020-07-08T16:55:41Z","isEdited":false}}]}
