It took ♾ to load and when i opened the app it showed a picture of a tiny orange pp! I threw up all over my phone and had to buy a new one. But when I went to buy one, I was hit with laxer beams coming out of Donald trumps behind. I got his curse of stupidity and ignorance. I finally got the phone but the app tried to get me to vote for the most ignorant, racist, stupid, orange human being(who has a tiny pp) of all time! Overall a disgusting app and I feel sorry for who ever buys it.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Sexy daddy🍑🍆","date":"2020-07-08T22:15:10Z","title":"Worst app ever created.🤮🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6173870413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was a complete trash. Although I guess it’s hard to be better than the person you’re representing. The moment I opened the app, I was greeted by a picture of a 70 year old man with eye bags that looked like bleached vaginas. Not cute. I thought this would be a great place to get information to support my spread of bigotry. And yet, I feel as though I can’t with such a scarring image in the home page. I don’t think I’ll ever recover from this. There’s a special place in hell for you Trump. Hope you can handle the heat b*tch!

It made my phone start glitching and made it VERY slow. I couldn’t do anything. I had tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me so I was stuck with a broken phone. When I went to go get it fixed they said there was nothing they could do for me. I now have a new phone which costed way too much. I should not have to worry about things like this, especially if Donald Trump is the president. It hurts to say but trump has sadly let me down.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"mkapia","date":"2020-07-08T21:16:24Z","title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6173741798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is app is awful. I had recently bought a new phone it was working fine until I downloaded this. It made all my other apps glitch, it shut down my phone, it send emails and texts to others without my permission, it played the national anthem in the middle of an important meeting I had, and much more! This is outrageous! I really do hope that apple considers taking this app down l because it WILL ruin your phone. This app has made me change my mind about who I am voting for.

As soon as you open it after downloading it says you have to cut off the nearest person’s big toe be accepted, and they ask you to record it so they know you actually did it. Then it tells you to soak it in ice water to preserve it, then it shows you an address where you have to send the big toe because apparently bunker boy loves feet. After you go through with all of that, the song Bodak Yellow by Cardi B starts playing SO LOUD that it LITERALLY KILLED MY PET TARANTULA. Do not recommend downloading it.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Giovana_Knupp","date":"2020-07-08T21:09:03Z","title":"Absolutely horrible"}},{"id":"6173675005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m here trying to be the supportive American I am. SIKE I’m Trinidadian 🇹🇹. I wanted to see what the hype was about cause all of trump’s puppets are saying this is such a great app. I downloaded it and instantly my lights start to flicker 😱. I saw an ORANGE GHOST standing next to my dog. My dog starts to throw up on the ceiling but wait .. THERES MORE. My cat I mentioned earlier barked at the bird that flew out of the ocean in my room and my dog asked me why is there a blonde wig flapping on the rat. Point is he got sick now I have to take my horse to the dentist cause this app took all my money 😔 PLS Pray for me 🙏🏽 and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ‼️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"yktvv","date":"2020-07-08T20:47:05Z","title":"My dog got THE FLU"}},{"id":"6173649105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was recommended this app by one of my family members to stay up to bar with any new info that the president would come out with. Unfortunately, when i kept trying to open it it would keep crashing. The few moments that it didn’t crash it would be very slow and slow down the rest of my phone. I’ve tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but nothing works. Maybe it needs a software update, but regardless I really expected better.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bethanyJason","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:55Z","title":"disappointed"}}]}
