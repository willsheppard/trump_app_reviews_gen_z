I thought this app would be the best way to show my support. Except after I put in my information on the app I received countless of calls from unknown numbers (I just got a new number) and that was very infuriating. This app is a disappointment and needs to be shut down before more people go through the same thing I did. Avoid putting your information or you receive a ton of scam calls and calls from individuals who want to steal your information!","title":"Sold my information.","date":"2020-07-08T15:48:44Z","userName":"Elisa9023"}},{"id":"6172680290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to look for an actual reason for anyone with more than a braincell to vote for trump. When I opened the app, it played a EXTREMELY LOUD NOISE, and flashed colors on the screen, giving my brother an epileptic seizure. We rushed him to the hospital but he sadly died. While rushing him there, I dropped my phone and it shattered, leaving hundreds of dollars in damages. My mother also tripped on the way out of the house and broke her arm and three ribs. We now have to pay a HUGE medical bill, and we lost my brother. This app just shows that there are no reasons to vote for trump, and it is terrible. 0 out of 10.","title":"Killed my brother","date":"2020-07-08T15:26:33Z","userName":"RavenBlue12R"}},{"id":"6172504702","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I really have tried over the past 4 years, despite his lack of morals, his racism, his misogyny, his pedophelia, his fear mongering, his xenophobia, his transphobia, his homophobia, his blatant treason, his disregard for American lives, his ableism, and his confession of sexual assault to give this psychological tire fire the benefit of the doubt that MAYBE he wouldn’t run us into the ground, and MAYBE this app could convince me to actually vote for him, but I only have learned one thing about Donald trump over the last 4 years. \n\n“Donald Trump is a white Supremacist.

I asked him why he did that and if he had the Coronavirus, he said, “Come with me”, so I did, when we arrived to his huge room in the White House, he coughed and coughed and coughed on me!! I tried to run out of the place, but he grabbed my wrist and coughed on me one more time before throwing a rat at me. The rat did a roundhouse kick and left me bleeding. I ran out of there as fast as I could, and the next day I went to test for Coronavirus, and the result was positive. I also got an infection because of the rat! Don’t vote for TRUMP 2020!","title":"HE COUGHED ON ME!","date":"2020-07-08T14:20:38Z","userName":"Trigger BAW"}},{"id":"6172372547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I think this app is watching me. I would set my phone down and I would lock it and I’d come back to the room as if it’s been listening the whole time. My phone would glitch at random time and photos of our president would just show up in the camera roll. Pictures I’ve deleted have been showing up in my photo library. Not screen shots or pictures of other people and things but pictures of me. Don’t download this app unless you like being watched and waking up to creepy supersizes in the morning.","title":"So ummm... woke up to this app open on my phone","date":"2020-07-08T14:01:40Z","userName":"our president is a joke"}},{"id":"6166873122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.

A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark.

I thought it was no big deal till I realized it was infected by ignorant Cheeto uncut red neck racist😢. I also thought I could get some Fox News while I was on it to educate the black woman across the street. She keeps trying to steal my flowers and mail. I’m terrified her husband might attack me. I’m surprised they’re still together, cause you know...... they’re black. The son was watching me probably looking for something to steal or break👀. Pray for me🙏🏻, Trump 2020🇺🇸”\n\nThe fact that people got this app unironically is sad.

I was horrified to find out that after I gave my personal information, I was insulted via text by Donald trump HIMSELF! He called me a pig and told me to drink bleach. My phone was later hacked because Donald now has my personal email. After replacing my phone, I decided to delete the app as I do not want any more bugs or viruses to take over my phone. I wish our president, Donald j trump, would have been more considerate when making this app. Very disappointed.","title":"Absolutely horrified","date":"2020-07-02T05:26:05Z","userName":"Hannah B 8"}},{"id":"6146983292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"OMG I DIDNT EXPECT IT...

Everything was doing fine until the app was on my phone. My grandma didn’t have any symptoms of anything, my animals were healthy as they were just close to both being a year old. And we’ve been getting lots of rain where I live and there didn’t seem to be any source of the fire around. I highly highly encourage you to not download this app.","title":"Tragedies have been happening","date":"2020-07-01T18:02:20Z","userName":"iwbsbs"}}]}
