Let me tell you. About 30 mins before 2 hours 20 mins and 45 seconds ago, I was happily playing the one and only Flying Gorilla when all of a sudden.. an add popped up that read, “Trump 2020” I thought “strange?.... is this a gift from the God Gorilla himself?!?!? Has he finally heard me?!! IS HE GOING TO ANSWER MY PREYERS?!?!?!” I gladly accepted to app with open arms and presses that glorious’FREE’ button to download my gift.  BIG MISTAKE- says me from 2 hours 22 mins and 60 seconds in the future.\nEverything went absolutely BONKERS. My app storage FILLED with Trump 2020, PICTURES FILLED with the orange man himself, my phone commanding me to “GiVe 5 sTAr!”  “N-no my God has never made me nervous, this is a mistake!! But Flying Gorilla NEVER made mistakes!!” Without any choice I got down on my knees, clasp my shaky hands together, took a deep breath and preyed to my Lord for help. With a hoarse voice I said “ oO oOo OO” (in his gorilla language of course) All of a sudden, the most beautiful light shined so bright from my phone. As I got closer, I cried.. happy Tears. My God, my lord and savior. FLYING GORILLA on my screen doing his marvelous t-pose but with the most magnificent flex in his arms to show dominance. Then I blacked out.... but when I blacked out, I had a vision. Flying Gorilla standing over me. I couldn’t believe it. “I-I’m s-sorry...” I said with defeated guilt “IM SORRY! I should’ve know it was a trap, you should’ve let me suffer!!! You have no place once so ever to help a foolish person such as myself!! I DONT DESERVE YOU MY LORD!!” He put his holy hand on my head and gave me a pat. He then handed me my phone, cleansed from all the sins, with the Flying Gorilla app on full display ready for action. “B-b- but flying gorilla-“ he shush me with a finger to my lips. He then vanished into my phone. “Thank you Flying Gorilla.. thank you..” I whispered..\nAnd that’s when I woke up 2 hours 20 mins and 45 seconds ago. Now let me get back to doing what I do best. DONT GET THIS APP!!❌❌❌","rating":1,"title":"Flying gorilla saved me from this horrendous app"}},{"id":"6176173289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:57:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"calems94","review":"It turns me into a Karen I get so angry.","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever used"}},{"id":"6176117605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:40:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KiyahMae","review":"this app just didn’t feel right AT ALL #BLACKLIVES MATTER","rating":1,"title":"the app was wack"}},{"id":"6176081827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:28:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lightninja21","review":"I don’t the app sorry not sorry","rating":1,"title":"Tony"}}]}
