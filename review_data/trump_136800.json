Trump's for so long. However, this app has caused me so many problems I do not even know where to begin. It makes my phone extremely slow. I have deleted it and re-downloaded it multiple times yet everytime I re-download it makes my phone as slow as a turtle! Also, when I try to open it, my phone crashes! I have to turn my phone completely off and turn it back on again for my phone to even start working properly. Since downloading my phone has been extremely glitchy. Very disappointed to say the least.","userName":"Rebecca Lauderman","title":"Disappointed Conservative😔🇺🇸❤️🤍💙","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:28:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180095750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"IT GAVE ME BUGS! real life bugs","userName":"rilny","title":"horrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:27:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180095738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open the app and “bam” a cheeto like image pops up at first I was confused but I finally came to realize that what I was looking at was the presidents deformed, tiny penis right up close, as soon as I saw this I ran to my closet and grabbed the bleach, next thing I know the bleach is on my eyes and i’m in excruciating pain, (I had outed the bleach into my eyes to cleanse my eyes from the profanity I just witnessed) I was then rushed to the hospital and am now blind, but at least I will never see that cheeto puff penis again, thanks trump for making me bleach my eye balls","userName":"momoalligator2","title":"👁👄👁","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:27:46Z","isEdited":false}}]}
