It all started with when I downloaded it!!! It took DAYS to download and when it did, the smell of Cheeto puffs filled my nostrils!! Apparently flying squirrels HATE this smell and came flying through my window!!! At the time, my phone was lying on the stove, and the squirrels turned on the stove, trying to burn my phone!!! I quickly grabbed one of my room mates super hero capes and tried to put the fire out!! The cape because magic from the smoke and I suddenly started to fly around my house wearing that burning cape!!! Thankfully my hermit crab was home and helped me to put the fire out! My fingers are BURNING from typing out this review right now!! Who knew burnt phone screens stay super hot for a long while. I have to head to the ER, my fingertips just fell off. So PLEASE, if our value your life, DON’T even THINK about downloading this app.","rating":1,"userName":"Kaylee picklebum","isEdited":false,"title":"Almost burnt my house down!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:33:19Z"}},{"id":"6173597493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I love trump but this app is not the way to go so I think we should take it down and I was trying to download this app and all of a sudden it said on my front wall like when I was trying to purchase the app it said that I was fat and I was ugly and I didn’t belong here and I was Mexican so I couldn’t download this app but I obviously love trump so I did it again andI just feel like I was body shamed does this happen to anybody else I need to know this is ruining my life and I miss kill myself yesterday because I was called fat by this app so I am giving it a one star rating like I do to orange people let me dedicate it I just feel like I was body shamed does this happen to anybody else I need to know this is ruining my life and I am with Kim myself yesterday because I was called a fat by this up so I’m giving it a one star rating like I do to orange people let me dedicate Sebastian bills as an example.","rating":1,"userName":"esperanza murcio","isEdited":false,"title":"No more😭","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:25Z"}},{"id":"6173588898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and just got a screen of a screaming orange!

I came home to Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen, and he was making a grilled cheese sandwich (i’m vegan btw). Then, HE FED IT TO ME. After that I went to sleep, and dreamt about kissing Harry Styles. Then, I peed myself and my mom kicked me out of our house. So now I don’t have a toilet anymore. HOW SADDD. Oh, and i’m homeless. Then I decided to hitchhike to the white house. After many days of walking, my feet gave up\non me and I lost my ability to walk. HOW CRAZY. Now I’m sitting next to a frog waiting to be rescued by my one true love, Harry Styles.

WHERE MY KIDS ARE. we were sprayed with orange paint and given “MAGA” hats. they were so forceful and my kids keep having nightmares! they even billed us for the “spray tan” they gave us! the app told me that my family could no longer eat shrimp anymore due to our president’s “special shrimp” that was leaked. i am deleting this app and never downloading it again!!! i am still orange and traumatized from this app!

Yes that is right, I have the right to vote. Well we were right side. We believed alm and not all cops are bad. We noticed trump had an app and downloaded it very quickly. When I opened it it asked for my number, so I put it in thinking I’d get reminders for rallies and news. Once I put my number in I kept getting texts saying “vote sleepy joe out trump 2020” non stop for a whole day. I thought it was weird but then the next day came around. When I opened the app there was a picture of Donald trump being spray tanned... nude... I was disgusted, I told my parent and they looked at me shocked and in denial. I showed them and my mother passed out hitting her head on the ground! So I came to write a review for the app noticing everyone else has been having very unspeakable problems with the app too. Now me and my family are VERY left sided and btw blm acab❤️.","rating":1,"userName":"Hello, Im a 23 yea..","isEdited":false,"title":"Unbelievable","date":"2020-07-08T18:25:51Z"}},{"id":"6173050122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"FIRST OF ALL why are u president🥺🥺bc we never wanted u,, some boomers wanted u but we didn’t❤️and try to see what happens if u ban tiktok in the U.S bc baby boyyyy we’ll always find a way,, so try us🙃and the only reason why ur president instead of Hilary Clinton is bc u have ur lil hackers in Russia😆😆and u can’t stop gen z😛TRUMP 2020 💖 🦄 🌈 🦋 but make it on a gravestone 💅🏽 ❤️🦋all u do is care abt yourself,, give us Obama back😉so again to all those people voting for trump don’t❤️if he wins the election it’s bc he hacks, cheats, n everything😃(just a warning)the only flavor u have is looking like an orange🙈🙈(remember the times we had the times that u and me had😓that’s for Obama)\n✨🌸🌷you tried 🌷🌸✨and failed miserably 🥰🙈✨🌸and everything u do is wrong,, have a bad day trump,, wait let me add a lil spice,, baddie🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🥰🙈the bad is silent🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️😍💞🦋🦋That review was so mean 😍🌟👑🌈 but listen to it ✨🌸💞- gen z😤","rating":1,"userName":"GENERATION ZZZZZZZZ","isEdited":false,"title":"u try to stop us but u can’t😹😹","date":"2020-07-08T17:16:44Z"}}]}
