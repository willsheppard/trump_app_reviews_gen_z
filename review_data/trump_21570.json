It’s hard to navigate through and you can NOT find ANYTHING about Biden on here. You think that this app would be inclusive and show ALL candidates but it just focuses on the one... idk I thought all lives mattered. SO ANYWAY. someone needs to update this app so that i can easily navigate through it.
