When I first download this app the app want to pay $136.49 like are you serious,I donâ€™t have enough money to afford this in general but I paid the money anyways. This app after I paid the money sent meI repeat 47,000 spam emails for some reason like I donâ€™t even know why they had my email. So after I deleted all of the spam emails from my inbox a life size 6 foot Danny Devito cut out arrived at my front door saying Trump 2020 or else your cats getting taken away. First of all do not threaten my beautiful cat second of all is this really a campaign strategy. So I continue my day as any other normal person would until an FBI agent showed up at my door trying to steal my cat first of all you told me if I didnâ€™t vote for Trump my cat was getting taken away second of all where did you find my dress and third of all I itâ€™s not even November. Then after I finally got this man to leave President TrumpPersonally took time out of his day to message me on Twitter first of all since youâ€™ll be dealing with the coronavirus and second of all how did you find my Twitter. I am mediately blocked his Twitter account even though I did not read his messages. I feel personally threatened by Trump and his campaign strategy and his campaign strategies this election and I do not wanna feel this way anymore so I personally do not recommend downloading this app for any means because one a 6 foot Danny DeVito cut out will show up at your door and FBI man will and you will get harassed by the president.","userName":"appas luv","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6175436793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:43:52Z","review":"follow me on instagram @dont_call_me_matt","userName":"DR4GON H4CK3R","title":"absolutely garbongo"}},{"id":"6175434960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:43:07Z","review":"This app stinks took almost a year to download then I had to see his face when I opened the app totallyyyyyyy not worth it PICKLE RICK 2020","userName":"kerriðŸ˜Ž","title":"It sucksðŸ¤¬"}},{"id":"6175434181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:42:49Z","review":"Horrible I tell you- it hacked the rest of my apps!

Seriously, the creator of this app must have the IQ of a cardboard box. Basically, when I tried to delete the app, my IPhone spontaneously combusted after the loud screams of Trump yelling from my microphone. Itâ€™s like the hoverboards. I instantly thought it was the issue with the IPhone. So naturally, I bought an android. Downloaded and deleted the app and IT COMBUSTED AGAIN. Maybe it wasnâ€™t that app because dont those phones explode? Or were those the samsung galaxies? Not sure. But it HAD to be the apps fault. I am now writing this review, very hungry, on my smart fridge. Hopefully it doesnâ€™t explode because of this app. Anyways, i am so unhappy with this app. I hope it gets deleted and never comes backðŸ˜¿","userName":"liveallday","title":"THE WORST APP EVERðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•"}},{"id":"6175431334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:41:42Z","review":"I have never had any problems with any other app! This is the worst app ever! It would not send me a verification code even though i typed in my number right and everything! This app is ran by a bunch of morons so the app is a moron to. I will not be using this app ever again and will be immediately removed off my phone and hopefully of the app store.","userName":"TotherRelic3","title":"worst app ever"}},{"id":"6175431368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:41:42Z","review":"I am beyond DISGUSTED. This app promotes fascist ideas and constantly shows pictures of an orange Cheeto. Like I really REALLY wouldnâ€™t even wipe my a** with it; I would seriously be afraid to get orange paint down there. But itâ€™s not all bad news for you, hereâ€™s what i suggest can be done. For starters the orange mascot has to go 100% just gone. Second of all maybe keep the false news and the fascist authoritarian dictator vibes out of the app you know just so that it can at least be somewhat tolerable. Then once thatâ€™s done simply take the app away.... hear me out. All of these scare tactic are just toxic. As a matter fact get rid of the orange Cheeto in real life I think thatâ€™s the best solution.","userName":"FuckthatCheeto","title":"This is Gross"}},{"id":"6175429577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:40:59Z","review":"I would never vote for this sexist rude butt hole who bleached his hair and gets fake spray tans to look like something out of veggie tales or especially the annoying orange himself.
