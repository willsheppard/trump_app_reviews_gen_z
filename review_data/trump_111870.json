Tin√∫viel!\nHe called her by her elvish name;\nAnd there she halted listening.\nOne moment stood she, and a spell\nHis voice laid on her: Beren came,\nAnd doom fell on Tin√∫viel\nThat in his arms lay glistening.\n\nAs Beren looked into her eyes\nWithin the shadows of her hair,\nThe trembling starlight of the skies\nHe saw there mirrored shimmering.\nTin√∫viel the elven-fair,\nImmortal maiden elven-wise,\nAbout him cast her shadowy hair\nAnd arms like silver glimmering.\n\nLong was the way that fate them bore,\nO'er stony mountains cold and grey,\nThrough halls of ireon and darkling door,\nAnd woods of nightshade morrowless.\nThe Sundering Seas between them lay,\nAnd yet at last they met once more,\nAnd long ago they passed away\nIn the forest singing sorrowless.\n\n‚ÄîJRR TOLKIEN","rating":1}},{"id":"6177232432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Sad.","userName":"jon without the h","date":"2020-07-09T15:49:10Z","review":"Worst app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177231250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Nasty","userName":"mcyheh","date":"2020-07-09T15:48:49Z","review":"Worst app ever ‚ú®","rating":1}},{"id":"6177140213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Very bad","userName":"ajdiofks","date":"2020-07-09T15:23:04Z","review":"Not good!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177120030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Eww","userName":"Meekster710","date":"2020-07-09T15:17:30Z","review":"Just eww I hate it","rating":1}},{"id":"6177068875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"trash app","userName":"Crushmc1999","date":"2020-07-09T15:03:21Z","review":"pretty bad app ngl","rating":1}},{"id":"6177052813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no.","userName":"bartholomew......yeah","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:57Z","review":"just no.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176919644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Yikes","userName":"im mad at instagram","date":"2020-07-09T14:23:15Z","review":"Made me racist‚ù§Ô∏è","rating":1}},{"id":"6176842450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no‚ù§Ô∏è","userName":"Joy4him","date":"2020-07-09T14:03:02Z","review":"he bans us, we ban him","rating":1}}]}
