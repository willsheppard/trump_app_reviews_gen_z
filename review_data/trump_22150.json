It makes no sense! It took weeks to install and took up so much battery on my phone. I had the app for a week and my phone eventually got really hot due to all the power it used so I had to get a new phone. The whole app has no games either! BORING.","date":"2020-07-08T22:02:47Z"}},{"id":"6173855348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not download this app unless u want to get hacked!","userName":"shjsjsjsjssjjs","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I got this app thinking I was going to get tickets and stuff for trump rally’s or whatever but I got HACKED and SCAMMED.

I luckily killed it before it could cause any harm to me or my family but as it was dying it called all the boomers who supported Trump and they killed my entire family and burned my house down. So moral of the story is don’t get this app❤️","date":"2020-07-08T21:40:52Z"}},{"id":"6173793652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App Ever","userName":"Angel563810","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app was the WORST app I have ever downloaded. I was hoping to find more information on Trump to educate me on whether or not I should vote for him, but I was very disappointed when I just found a load of bull on the app. If he can’t even run an efficient app then how can we trust him to run this country. Truly disappointed in this.","date":"2020-07-08T21:30:43Z"}},{"id":"6173790356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP WILL NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT!","userName":"Sopie24601","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because I am a true Orange crescent roll supporter. And I have to say I am very disappointed. The app took a very long time to download and took up most of my phone space. When I opened the app my car immediately went up in flames in my front yard and caught my house on fire burning all of my Trump flags :( I CAN NOT recommend","date":"2020-07-08T21:29:28Z"}},{"id":"6173781744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My house is gone","userName":"Ujhgnyu","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app took a long time to download, but whatever. When I was finally able to open it, it had me sign up with my name and address. Within a couple hours, a missile hit my house and exploded everything. I’m planning on suing and my legal team is already prepared. I have nothing. Thanks a lot, Trump.","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:13Z"}}]}
