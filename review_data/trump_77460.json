I mean common, minors are aloud on this app!🗣🗣 I then tried to delete it but as soon as I was .0005 seconds away from doing so, I received a call from an unknown number. They said they would take my family and force them to build the wall and once they were finished they would tie them up as a warning to anyone trying to cross the boarder if I didn’t vote  trump 2020.🚫🧢 After that my phone started to glitch very bad and it’s because they hacked into my phone and stole all my personal information. 😢🤬🤯My phone kept telling me that I had no storage over and over and over so I went to go check it out and it turned out my photos were taking up all my storage.😞 So I went to go see because I knew I only had a few photos in my camera roll. My camera roll was FILLED WITH PICTURES OF THE ORANGE MAN😡😒 1,000 pictures of him. No wonder I had no storage!  😖I later tried to text my friend but all my text messages said trump 2020, the contact names said the same thing too. 😤I was very confused because I never said that to any of my friends and they have never said that to me😰😰 I then went to charge my phone because the app takes all your battery, suddenly my charger started to turn ORANGE 🍊then the outlet turned orange, then the wall and so on. My whole house is orange now. Just to make things worse someone came to knock on my door and as soon as I opened it they started spraying me with orange spray tan and threw bleach in my hair. I do not recommend this app at all. 0 stars 😳😓🙄👿👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:35:34Z"}},{"id":"6175736693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hisoka's left tiddy","rating":1,"title":"i am UPSET","review":"this app was a total disappointment and i find it so disrespectful. in conclusion, if u get this app ur a white supremacist 🤪🧚\u200D♀️✨💘❤️😜","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:34:19Z"}},{"id":"6175722607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kgdyody","rating":1,"title":"Dog crap","review":"You all already know what this do be about","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:29:30Z"}},{"id":"6175712817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reinjoy","rating":1,"title":"This app is a scam","review":"This took all of my information and I’m scared for my life","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:26:09Z"}},{"id":"6175685688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"03140407","rating":1,"title":"Disguistinh","review":"This app gave me cancer.
