for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.","isEdited":false,"title":"✨Yucky✨","date":"2020-07-09T12:01:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"Nifaniel"}},{"id":"6176389942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is the worst app ever created on the face of the earth. when i was finally able to open the app after it downloaded for 2794829 minutes, i immediately received an email from jimmy neutron. he and the professor who created the 💗💙💚power puff girls 💚💙💗 are going to be replacing fauci effective immediately. i was shocked to read this information. the email must have been linked with some sort of bug as my screen turned red and began to flash ~incriminating messages~. then it made my phone grow legs, run sideways through my house, open the silverware drawer and bend every spoon to a 86 degree angle, draw mustaches on my sisters’ school pictures, do the laundry (which was actually very helpful but still scary) all before imploding. now i have to spend all of my summer job money to replace my phone. thanks.","isEdited":false,"title":"0/10 would recommend this app🥵🧚🏻\u200D♀️✌️✨","date":"2020-07-09T12:01:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"big natty daddy"}},{"id":"6176387816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m just mad cause you’re ugly and actually think you’d be a good president and “make America great again” when all you’ve been doing is making peoples lives in America the worst time of their lives.
