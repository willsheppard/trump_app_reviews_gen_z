First of all, it was working SO AWFULLY SLOW when I tried to open the app.  I had to restart my phone for it to actually work. Even if I managed to get into the app, it was still VERY unsatisfying.  Again, it was still slow but let me tell you I have perfect WiFi at my home.  I’m very disappointed about what this app shows you.   Some people might not agree with me, but I assure you that whatever they put in this app is so unnecessarily unsettling.  I don’t like to use the word hate but in this case, I hate this app."}},{"id":"6173663175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Voxfab","date":"2020-07-08T20:42:52Z","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP!!","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is absolutely terrible!!!! it took so long to download and when it finally was done i had little to no storage in my phone. my phone constantly shut down after just clicking the app, and there were so many invasive things in the terms and conditions. i am uninstalling and telling all of my friends NOT to get this at ALL. this is a SHAME and HORRIBLE and i want to see this app REMOVED from the app store INSTANTLY. if i could give it 0 stars I. WOULD. what is the point of this app, anyways? customer service was so rude, too. SO unacceptable and unaccomplished. this is terrible. i will be writing a very, very long email about this. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6173634331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jakie.345","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:36Z","rating":1,"title":"This is the worst app on the store","isEdited":false,"review":"this app took hours to download even though i have very fast internet in my house. finally when it downloaded the format was very annoying and it was very difficult to navigate around the app. there are also multiple glitches and it moves very slowly and it lags a lot. it moves so slow that it took at least two hours for the actual app to open up so i wasn’t looking at a loading screen. i couldn’t even use the app though because of how glitchy it was. this app deserves to be taken off the app store because there’s no point to an app that you can’t use."}},{"id":"6173597794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nicole Haskin","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:32Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"review":"A week ago I tried to download this app. It took an entire 24 hours to download! This is horrible! Then when I tried to open the app it was so slow! Even when I thought it couldn’t get any worse this random music started playing! I thought it was enjoyable, but I learned my cat thought otherwise. My cat started scratching everything! She has never done this before. I reopened the app and just thought it was a glitch. Then it started to play Donald trump sounds, like he was talking to me! It said “vote for trump” and it was very scary! Now my cat has a scratching addiction and we had to give her to my brother. I’m very disappointed!"}},{"id":"6173475533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😭😭😭🥶🤮🤢🤹🏼😡😓","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:38Z","rating":1,"title":"worst app ever!","isEdited":false,"review":"this app was filled with FAKE NEWSSS! additionally as soon as i went to open the app it would KICK ME OUT! after an HOUR of trying to get it to load it finally let me in only to say i’m not allowed to be on the app because i’m not white and WHITE POWER IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS! the app began flashing warnings that i must “go back to where i came from” because i’m hispanic!! i am highly offended. they are the ones who stole land from indigenous people!!!! maybe you white people should go back to where you came from!! to conclude, i am infuriated by this racist app made by mr. orange cheeto and i am leaving a one star review so others don’t have to experience this terrible app as well!"}},{"id":"6173420166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"death is coming for us","date":"2020-07-08T19:18:50Z","rating":1,"title":"Ugh worst app ever I wish I could give it less then one star","isEdited":false,"review":"It made a horrid screaming noise that caused  my dogs to attack me then  millions of spiders started to ascend from the corners of my house and combine in to one giant spider and then it attacked us  and it wouldn’t stop so we’ve had to move and now ever time we try to move in to a building the spider finds us so we are forced to live in our car  and I have lost my dad to the spider due to its venom.

First, it took 420 days to download. When it finally downloaded it kept glitching and kicking me out but i just uninstalled and reinstalled it but now it only has pictures of six nine. So i thought   \nMr. trump was a snitch but then i realized i had been hypnotized and the app was glitching so bad that i thought that orange, small hands, thick neck person y’all call president is actually a racist, rapist, a murderer and much much more. So i think this app needs to be taken down🥺✨ so that it won’t kill people thank you please👉🏼🥺👈🏼"}},{"id":"6173161711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ben Dover for Tik Tok 🥰","date":"2020-07-08T17:52:19Z","rating":1,"title":"gen z 2020","isEdited":false,"review":"this app made my phone lose battery percentage 75 % more than normal .

I know you people think you have all the info from the news but do you even actually research. Do you know about all the negatives trump has had on this country or do you only look for the positives. You adults are the problem you need to get your head out of the clouds and realize that not every person is some white dandelion and that our president has no faults. Our president has caused more pain to this country than ever before. BUT YOU BOOMERS ARE TOO MUCH OF AN IDIOT TO REALIZE!! Thank you for your time."}}]}
