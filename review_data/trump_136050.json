It‚Äôs also super slow ! Like my other apps were working fine but this app took forever to use.

Please re think your choice if you actually like the president or his app. This app is genuinely terrible and a wast of my valuable time. I‚Äôm a writer and I have a lot of work to do. After all of the people in my area having this app I wanted to see what the buzz was of and I‚Äôm not surprised to say I‚Äôm disappointed. Just gonna say this- Donald Trump is a white supremacist. If you vote for him again you are a white supremacist.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180535799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T10:55:15Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE app","userName":"w0nd3rpets","review":"when i first got it, it made my phone crash every time i clicked on it. when i could finally open it, it was glitchy and showed horrible content. donald trump=trash. if i could, i would give this app zero stars","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180535785","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T10:55:15Z","rating":1,"title":"My journey to being a bigot","userName":"Lax_bestie31","review":"So today I decided to be politically wrong. And the first step in being politically wrong of course would be to support trump. So I got this app to began my journey of racism, homophobia, and sexism. I then came to the face of my nightmares trump himself I got so scared that I had to jump off the app immediately. Then I decided that I have to no other but MAN up and go back on the app. I landed on many problems throughout the app and it was an overall a terrible experience. And here is where I say honestly being full of hate for everyone but myself, I‚Äôm just not equipped for. I hope that more people realize that bigotry is just not for everyone but if you are interested in being a bigot I implore you to get this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180535415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T10:55:09Z","rating":1,"title":"NoüíÄüíÄüôàüçäüçäüçä","userName":"hebdjdbsnbshd","review":":)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180531619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T10:54:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Shitü•∞üñêüèº","userName":"eggplsnd69","review":"This app is verry unprofessional i hate it and dont stand it","isEdited":false}}]}
