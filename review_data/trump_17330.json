I was so excited to finally learn what racism is about and how to act it out against innocent people, however sadly before I got the chance, the app caught on fire. Additionally, right before that, an entire hand literally came out of the app (from my phone) and starting snatching at my hair and face. Immediately after, it burst into flames before my eyes.🙉🐒😓","rating":1,"title":"Hurt","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:50:46Z"}},{"id":"6178010821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"💫🧚✨💅","review":"I saw someone else say the same thing on here, this app destroys your phone. It doesn’t matter how good the connection is, it spams you so much your phone won’t turn on. Also the one and only time I was able to open the app, the “news” it gave me, when googled turned out to be bold faced lies!! I am disgusted. Vote for Biden.","rating":1,"title":"Wrecked my phone and gave me false information","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:47:32Z"}},{"id":"6178010473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chelyyyyyyjshsbsbs","review":"One day I was very bored so I downloaded this I was also very excited to download mr oranges 🍊app to keep up with our president and the news but had many problems with this app it was glitching and it is no bueno that why I gave it a 1 star I believe it deserves 0 stars ✨ 💕💕💕 but that’s not an option anyway everyone have a nice day :)","rating":1,"title":"Really dislike this app and disappointed","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:47:25Z"}},{"id":"6177995973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"IMK bands","review":"This app is so laggy and has crashed multiple times and I'm on an iPhone 11 and there is no reason that should be happening and from looking at the other reviews this app is terrible which it is. If your going to give this app a rating it deserves a 1 star. All I wanted to do was show support but clearly with this terrible app I can't.","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:42:42Z"}},{"id":"6177956894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reviewer_nae","review":"This app is the worst app ever made. It took 5 days to download and not only that but it’s constantly glitching. Also slowed down my phone and I’m most likely going to have to get a new one. Please do not get this app. I wish I could invent a time machine to go back in time and prevent myself from downloading this app. That’s how bad it is.","rating":1,"title":"If I could give 0 stars, I would","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:30:02Z"}},{"id":"6177886838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Qwertyykabdpcns","review":"I noticed a lot of people had been talking about how terrible this app is and i wanted to give it a try to see what all the fuss was about. At first it wasn’t so bad but suddenly my screen started glitching a bunch and this scary orange creature kept popping up and i couldn’t make it go away. Scared my niece so bad she had nightmares. This app needs to be banned!!!!","rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:07:05Z"}},{"id":"6177836977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"myamckena10","review":"This app messed up my phone and will never work. I tried everything to fix my phone but nothing worked. The apple store said that this app has a virus on it and that people should not download this app. I do not support trump whatsoever for this reason and many others I will not and never will support him. And he took tiktok away from us","rating":1,"title":"There’s a virus","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:51:43Z"}},{"id":"6177752814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"die 💕✨","review":"This app is ruining my phone. It is lagging so bad and I have the newest iPhone. Personally I am apart of gen z and I didn’t even open this app, I’m just not bouta have trump have his own app while tiktok creators are losing their income and hobby and future. Tiktok has helped gen z through the hardest times and not dying of boredom during this pandemic. I used to not think trump is bad but this is not cool at all tbh. WE GOT THIS GEN Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:26:33Z"}},{"id":"6177736302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"carlytink95","review":"As I just turned 18, I feel like it’s my civil duty to become politically aware of the candidates for the upcoming election because I can now vote. Trump has been an interesting study to say the least, and for more information I got the app. Not to my surprise, my first impression of the app was not amazing whatsoever. This is a horrible app that deserves nothing less than a 1 star review.","rating":1,"title":"The worst app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:34Z"}},{"id":"6177711125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jdhsgvwjaksizhbs","review":"Ive had this app for like 2 seconds and i alreqdy hate it bc i dont have a phone number and it doesnt let me use my email🙄 i was just trying to support my beautiful 🍊orange president🍊and get tiktok back bc he is jealous that gen z is capable of taking over USA ❣️😂 but dont worry we have Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and we could even go on Facebook so dont try us.
