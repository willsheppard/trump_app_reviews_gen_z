I just wanted to come here and write a nice and truthful review.  I really wanted  to see if this app was good. It was July 9 1956 when I downloaded the app. It’s such a shame that it had to take this long. I just really wanted to check out the app.🧚\u200D♂️🤳 This is one reason I wouldn't  recommend this app. So after that I decided to delete the app because it just got me in a really bad mood, but when i tried it didn’t let me. It needed a password. I tried and I tried but then it set my whole neighborhood on fire 🔥 which is so sad because know they have no where to leave and what’s even safer is that they didn’t have any food and someone came to feed us the orange bald presidents toenails. What!!!!! I was surprised. If this isn’t bad  enough they dumped the whole toilet water on my face when I was trying to clean it. I was so traumatized so I tried deleting the app again so these things would stop. I still couldn’t but then I remembered that one of my fellow people on the reviews told us the password. I put the password and it worked. Know I will pass it to those who need it. The password was Biden 2020. Such a lifesaver.🧚\u200D♂️✨🌟 Thanks for Listening stay safe from this app. If we could I know we would all give it a zero.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178538954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Rotten orange is for trash only","userName":"vibyvibes","date":"2020-07-09T22:59:39Z","review":"I gave this a one star bc it took long to download it like really long. N the app was keep glitching n showing sum rotten orange on my screen. N I’m allergic to orange but I literally downloaded the to just support my amazing white president but I don’t like the app so now I don’t like him anymore bc of the app. So Apple, u might wanna consider deleting this app cuz it’s trash like disgusting trash. Also the app is keep making me wanna vomit n poop on my phone so I’m scared abt tht. It was like sum kind of psychology n tricking us to do smth really disgusting everytime. So plsss delete the app.🤢🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178537588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟GO🦗GO🦟","userName":"Fkkgkfdkekwjejjejeejeke","date":"2020-07-09T22:59:07Z","review":"A wise king once said:\n\nYeah\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nBichina bichina nae wanggwani bichina\n\nItjima itjima jinan nareul itjima\n\nWe so fly we so fly jeonsegiro we so fly\n\nJongnom chulsine wangdoen nom\n\nMichyeobeorin beom gwanghae flow\n\nGaecheon chulsine yongdoen mom\n\nGeuge naega got saneun beop\n\nMian geokjeongeun mallago\n\nNado ileulgeon mantago\n\nGwageon dwijue gadugo\n\nNaegeol chaenggyeo da japsujyu\n\nMari andoeji naega gaerani\n\nBeomeuro taeeonatji jeogeodo neocheoreom yakajin anchi\n\nJotbapdeurui gyang jaerongjanchi\n\nSolkka jonnage eoieopji\n\nSsakda jungnyeo nan yeui eopsi\n\nSaekkya geurae neo yeoeeopsi\n\nFlexing nan eopji\n\nPillyoga eopji\n\nWho’s the king who’s the boss\n\nDa aljana naeireum\n\nImman san saekkideul\n\nDangjang nomui mogeul chyeo\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHantanghaemeokgo gotbaro nan jeonsegiro nara\n\nNareul damgien i naran ajik yeojeonhi jaga\n\nWoo nuga siganeun geumirae\n\nNae siganeun deo bissande\n\nTic tok seonbisaekkideul\n\nMyeonsangeda chimeul kak baeteo\n\nKkeokkin jeogi eomneun maechulchulchulchulchulchulchul\n\nUri bangsihyeok pidineun maeil chumchumchumchumchumchumchum\n\nCham gamsahane naega cheonjaeime\n\nGojak geureon iyuro yageul ppaldani aejanhagi geujieomne jaeneungi eomneungeoji mwo\n\nWonhaneun geon modu gajyeotji ijeneun mwol deo gajyeoyaman manjogi doelji\n\nNaega wonhaetdeon geot osot daeumeun dondon daeumeun goal goal i daeumeun dodaeche mwoji\n\nGeu daeumeun geurae mwolkka simhi neukkyeojineun hyeonta wiga eomneun hyeonsang\n\nWiman bodeon nan ije gyang araeman bodaga idaero chakjihagopa\n\nI’m a king I’m a boss\n\nSaegyeonoa nae ireum\n\nImman san saekkideul\n\nDangjang nomui jurireul teureo\n\nI’m a king I’m a boss\n\nDa aljana naeireum\n\nImman san saekkideul\n\nDangjang nomui mogeul chyeo\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\nDaechwita daechwita ja ullyeora daechwita\n\n~~ August D (aka Yoongi)🥰","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178536910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not just the app that’s bad","userName":"For the Coins are amazing","date":"2020-07-09T22:58:52Z","review":"When you open the app, you see our president(!) holding up what seems to be a BLM fist. Now I’m no expert but didn’t he say that black people have nothing to live for?🤔 Coming from someone who is legally 18, I can also see why people are not liking him. I can see why majority of POC think he’s terrible. Now let’s talk about my experience with the app. When I opened it, I typed in my phone number (555) 123-987. And can you believe it!!??? They didn’t accept it. I wonder why.🙃 But anyways, I hate this app, it’s ruthless just like the person who approves of this app👁👄👁(❌🧢).","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178537431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Replay","userName":"KHAYCEE CARREON","date":"2020-07-09T22:59:03Z","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","rating":3,"isEdited":false}}]}
