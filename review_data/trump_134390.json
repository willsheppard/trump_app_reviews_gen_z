His handling of COVID 19 and the Black Lives Matter movement is despicable. He wants totally control, not to maintain our democracy. He hasn’t delivered on any of his campaign promises and destroyed our economy. Not to mention the terrible person he is in his personal life and the rape allegations of underage girls. This app did not function well and was not worth the download. Very glitchy.","date":"2020-07-08T16:33:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172908996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Krissy101","title":"Had to get a new phone","review":"Wow. I had this app downloaded for all of 2 minutes because I wanted to do some soul searching for a summer school talent show and I opened it up and the screen went RAINBOW.My Pomeranian started howling and my oven started to scream as this happened. The mailman was late today and I’m almost positive my beta fish are getting a divorce because I downloaded this app. I got my phone stolen and the bad man saw I had the app on my phone and he SMASHED IT and then poured resin on it and made it into a craft. Weird, I know. It’s overcast today so I had to get a new phone because I really don’t want my beta fish to get a divorce. Let’s hope they have a prenup LOL anyways don’t download this","date":"2020-07-08T16:33:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172908117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"gamepup89","title":"Worst app in the whole AppStore","review":"If I had the option to give this rating zero stars I WOULD 💖🧚💫.

Oh, and trump, don’t think that we’re just gonna let you take down tiktok like that. We’re not going down without a fight. But if you do somehow ban tiktok in the US, lets just say you’re screwed in the election. Any tiktok fans that were undecided on the election are gonna be against you. So please, do both us and yourself a favor and quit \nbeing anti-tiktok, racist, sexist, homophobic, and such a liar. If you do that, I’d say your chances of getting re-elected might just go from 0.0001% to 0.001% (If you’re lucky). Anyway, I hope you trip on your $10,000 doorknob and shatter your tibia because when all is said and done, nobody likes you, not even you’re gold digger wife. (By the way, I’m 11 and could run the country better than you. Screw you.)","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172900054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Lexlootherr","title":"Highly don’t recommend","review":"Really didn’t like this app. I opened it and didn’t like how they disrespected the flag.
