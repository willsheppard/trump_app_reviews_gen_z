How ICE detention centers are essentially being gassed by having extremely powerful disinfectant sprayed every 15-20 minutes without proper ventilation. Why ICE detention center said they are not responsible for the sexual abuse by its staff members. Why Mr. President Trump said about Ivanka “Perhaps if she wasn’t my daughter I would be dating her.” Why he asked if it’s normal “to be more sexually attracted to my daughter than my wife.” Why his mind would immediately to go sex when asked what he has in common with Ivanka. Talking about 1 year old Tiffany’s breast saying “She has her moms legs but we don’t know yet if she has her...” while gesturing to his breast. Why he said “There’s good people on both sides.” About a white supremacy rally but calls all BLM protesters terrorist. Why he retweeted a video of people yelling “White Power!” When Kayleigh McEnany said Mr. President Trump deleted the tweet of him saying “Thank you great people of The Villages” because he didn’t hear the yelling of “White Power!” right by the phone even though he watched entire video, she continued to say he STILL stood with the great people of The Villages showcased in the video. Why he opposes defunding the police but threatens to defund public education. Why he doesn’t want his children brought into politics but then threatens the children of the United States education in a hissy fit because he wants the economy to look better in time for the election. Sadly I was disappointed to find that the app was just made as a fan base  that oddly talks about Biden as much as it does Trumps plans for the future and explanations for the things he has said and done.","title":"Disappointed","userName":"Disappointed Patriot x2","date":"2020-07-09T10:32:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176084145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Just no, let’s get this deleted.","title":"No","userName":"Rilllllllllley","date":"2020-07-09T10:29:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176082934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely awful.","title":"🤮🤮","userName":"crazywithak","date":"2020-07-09T10:29:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
