I’m not exactly sure what the cause of it was, but I looked out my window and I was staring at a red dot, which could’ve only been the scope of a sniper. If 2+2 is 4 and 5+5 is 10, then I’m pretty sure Cheetos got my power cut and tried to kill me 😟. But that’s okay cuz I’m a baddie and I ate the bullets.

That Cheeto scared me so bad and l can’t get it out of my head i do NOT recommend this app it is terrifying and the image of that Oompa Loompa that pops up when you open the app WILL HAUNT YOU FOREVER (ps. I ALMOST DIED CAUSE I GOT SO SCARED😱😱😾😪✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💅🏻)-carys😌😛👏🏼","userName":"tigersb12","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK!"}},{"id":"6177371015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:28:53Z","review":"I actually got this to get more educated about the trump campaign but it’s horrible. The instructions are unclear and it could’ve done a lot more. Why would I want to sign up for the text service when I already have the app? What good does it bring to promote your text service on the home page? I seriously don’t recommend this app to anyone, regardless of political beliefs. I rest my case.","userName":"Directioner737859283774","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Delete this app"}},{"id":"6177355087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:24:13Z","review":"Ok in all honesty this app is CRAP!! It’s hard to navigate, requires your personal information, and can even use your location when you aren’t using it!! It made me want to projectile vomit when i opened it at first. NOT APPEALING AT ALL🤮 not to mention that the app crashes constantly and I personally think it’s the opposite of a “great” campaign strategy. All in all this app is degrading and disgusting. 0/10 would recommend!!","userName":"your✨mom","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting"}},{"id":"6177342499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:39Z","review":"So like this app...TRASH!!! I cannot believe the audacity trump has coming out with this app. It’s racist and frankly disgusting!!! I am in shook!! Not to mention it crashes every time I go in it! I think it may come with a virus which makes a lot of sense since he doesn’t believe in COVID-19!!! I cannot fathom how horrible this app is!!! SMH ITS TRULY DISAPPOINTING!! What is Russia is behind this app what if that’s how we are really being spied on...trump we got questions and we need answers.","userName":"handieneosmenwnwkqk","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DISAPPOINTING"}},{"id":"6177318050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:13:53Z","review":"Because i will be voting for cheeto in the fall 2020 election i thought it would be important to download this app and see new updates and stuff. the second i downloaded it it completely shut down my phone. after an HOUR of trying to turn my phone back on it wasabi got so bad and the app wouldn’t even open. i’m furious. this app is trash don’t even waste your time downloading it.","userName":"Hdjsjsnxjckvkcksnabdjf","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App"}},{"id":"6177305327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:10:22Z","review":"i recently downloaded this app in hopes of getting updates about Trump and the election but it was way too glitchy for me to even use. As loyal supporter of Donald, this really upset me because I had better hopes for the leader of this country in the next election. I will now be reconsidering my vote and helping my other friends at work and in my book club do the same. This really disappointed me.","userName":"Purple polorbear","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"total disappointment"}},{"id":"6177288885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:05:37Z","review":"When I opened the app this weird gremlin looking monster showed up after they asked for my personal information. I don’t know why he appeared, but ever since then I’ve been having these uncomfortable feelings that he’s going to appear in my dreams and cause the worst nightmares. This is worse than any demon you can think of. He’s a serious entity of pure evil and he has the ability to haunt your dreams.","userName":"JRock12000","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The app is cursed.😨😨"}},{"id":"6177243694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:28Z","review":"Bro this app is the most trash thing I’ve laid my eyes on. It’s needs to get taken down I’m ashamed I even slightly supported that disgusting Cheeto that runs our country. Secondly, trump is really taking down tiktok after I’ve worked so hard on building a following, like the Us government doesn’t take our information anyway. Screw this app and who it’s for.
