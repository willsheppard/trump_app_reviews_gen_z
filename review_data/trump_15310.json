Next, it took most of my gigabytes which caused my phone to glitch. Third, the app platform was very confusing, I had now Idea how to buy or donate. This is one of the most horrible app I’ve downloaded and I think it shouldn’t be on the App Store!! Please do something about this thank you.😁","title":"Horrible🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"eujdhdufjfmfldnwidbdi"}},{"id":"6178471772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:33:00Z","review":"I downloaded this hoping to get some much needed information about the republican platform in the USA. Sadly the app glitches(randomly shuts out) and is now sending me intimidating notifications that the orange man wants to meet me, and that I have been chosen to be in his inner circle.... would not recommend unless you are a fan of pyramid schemes or intimidating and mysterious texts from unknown numbers ( I am not a fan)","title":"Strange orange man???","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nat576oweee"}},{"id":"6178447754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:23:32Z","review":"When I first downloaded this awful app, everything was going okay. Then the fbi rolled up to my house and I was wondering why when I realized the app was AGE RESTRICTED! And I am 2 years old on the date! So I ran away by digging a hole that the Cheeto himself would not be able to fit into. Then I remembered that you can’t dig straight down! So I tragically died in an underground cave as heath care was too expensive 😔","title":"Inconvenient","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ccccccccbbbbbbbbbaaaaaa"}},{"id":"6178421775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:13:28Z","review":"I just want to start off by saying this app took forever to download.

This only meant that they would steal this information to spam my number with election messages for Trump. The app also keeps crashing and ive tried everything possible way to fix it but I realized it was the apps doing.
