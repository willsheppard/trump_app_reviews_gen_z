HE EVEN THREW MY LITTLE SISTER OUT OF OUR WINDOW AND STARTED DOING THE MACARENA AROUND MY SISTER’S BROKEN BODY. we had to rush her to the hospital and it took hours of surgery to get her body back to normal. the hospital bill was outrageous due to the awful healthcare system that we have in place. now everything in our house is broken and we are poor due to the cost of the hospital bill. we are now living in a Walmart parking lot and our only source of food is grass, bugs, and leaves. long story short, this app is AWFUL and it RUINED MY LIFE.","userName":"trumplover69696969","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178122997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this sucked","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:24:31Z","review":"it kept making my phone crash\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆.\n\nnow that my alt tik tokers are here...\n\nblack lives matter. justice for breonna taylor. justice for elijah mcclain. spread awarness.","userName":"black lives have mattered","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178120332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It’s not good","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:23:36Z","review":"First of all it’s my guy trump second of all apps dooks and he tryna delete tik tok ok peace","userName":"ChaoticWeeviI","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178111213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"garbage","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:20:35Z","review":"this app lags so much, it is horribly put together. it almost made my phone break and made my battery drain so much.","userName":"AnonymousReviewer126","isEdited":false}}]}
