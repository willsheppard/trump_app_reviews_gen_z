Despite constantly labeling what news stations/channels report as fake new, Trump fails to tell the country the truth. He has labeled those who stand against oppression as terrorists and refuses to stand against the display of the confederate flag. I can’t support someone who has made it clear he only cares about himself, the rich, and the white.","title":"FAKE NEWS!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"rissa betts"}},{"id":"6174424848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:39Z","review":"As soon as I opened the app it crashed and it left my phone lagging. I do not recommend this app. It tells you things you already heard, false information, and you have to stare at a Cheeto when you are downloading it. That is horrifying. If you want to download this app be prepared to get a virus and for your phone to get extremely slow. -18%7283x82/10 not recommenced at all","title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"pussyasseater10/10"}},{"id":"6174389442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:06:58Z","review":"Okay , so as a Donald Trump Supporter 😊🇺🇸🍊 I download this app to support the old sweet cheeto , but instead I SEE HIM SINGING “ r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️ but i cant go thru the door 🚪 cuz my booty 🍑 too big” I thought he wasn’t a Shane Dawson stan!!!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😨😨 I am horrified what I saw on here, thanks to this man he also got my DOG KILLED!

And my child should not be seeing this. And I tried to find out when the protesting were happening and it said “I was not able to find what you are looking for” and then I asked it if it was dumb and it said my boss is.

Not only does it spin the truth into hateful lies and show me grotesque images for which I was not prepared, but the user functionality made me want to smash my head through a wall. 0/10 would not recommend, please do not waste your time.","title":"Ouch","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"not_amermaid"}},{"id":"6174362258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:58:31Z","review":"After seeing the numbers decrease in other countries around the globe and see cases increase in our country just shows the poor handling of the pandemic. I strongly disliked and it sickened me to see how he tear gassed a group of protesters for a photo op. He has never once acknowledged or showed help or leadership to the BLM movement instead he says it’s a sign of hatred to paint the words ‘Black Lives Matter’ outside Trump Tower.","title":"Poor Handling of the Coronavirus","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Kayla Fortina"}}]}
