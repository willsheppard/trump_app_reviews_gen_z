My phone has never glitched before so I thought maybe it’s nothing. I kept going back in and it kept happening. Then the app started to kick me out every time I went into it. I don’t recommend. THIS IS A TERRIBLE APP!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177095476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:10:43Z","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kelly_jackie12","review":"This app is hard to use and should have to pay. Also this app is the most annoying thing. You have to press a lot of things and it is really hard to remember and should just be there at once"}},{"id":"6177044329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:56:38Z","title":"Keeps Crashing, Does Not Work","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hello..👀","review":"Whenever I try to open the app, it crashes and kicks me out! I’ve kept it in hopes that it would stop, but at this point it hasn’t worked for weeks. Please either FIX THIS or remove the app!! This is ridiculous!!"}},{"id":"6177033213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:53:38Z","title":"give us what we want","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Travelsnowboard12","review":"This app did not perform how any app should for Apple and it is quite disappointing. I wish there was more attention to detail here and the owners showing care for their audience, not sure why this wasn’t in place already. Give the people what they want."}},{"id":"6177024044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:07Z","title":"absolutely awful","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hcoejnaoejhebs","review":"this app scared me because as soon as I opened up the app this big oompa loompa cheeto looking person was the first thing i saw. yikes 😬. it scared me so bad that i accidentally pooped my pants and had to go to the hospital i’m back now and i’m better but i’ll never forget that traumatic experience."}},{"id":"6177008587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:46:58Z","title":"Ugh","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bbskqodicngt","review":"This app was so horrible, it kept glitching. The server said it only works if you feed it Diet Coke and Big Macs!?!? This app is just so unfit for the job it’s meant to do. Also not to mention it’s very... touchy. The app just gives me weird vibes and it should be taken down, it’s done wrong by so many people."}},{"id":"6176966771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:40Z","title":"WORST EVER 😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"strawberry cow✨🍓","review":"So i got this app to look into trumps campaign but the app was SO SLOW everything was lagging and it took a WEEK to download. Once i finally opened the app there was an ugly orange man waving at me. Just LOOKING at him gave me skin cancer. Then the app BEGGED for my phone number. I do not have a phone so i could even use it 😡😤.

None of the events load (not like anyone wanted to go anyways). The “Social” section is just a joke like come on, no one on this planet or any other wants to see what this cheeto looking mf has to say. Anyways stan nicki 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6176916400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:22:26Z","title":"this app ruined my life","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Pligfhhgfdgh","review":"this app ruined my life and destroyed my family.
