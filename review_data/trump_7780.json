And when you do, you get kicked out!! Do NOT download this app, it is a scam, it’ll make you pay money and just kick you out! Not to mention I entered the app and saw a BURNT POTATO. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen. And there’s a review on this app that talks about a umpa loompa that is a hot Cheeto? THATS TRUE. This is by far the WORST app in the App Store, and I think that it needs to be removed.","userName":"neymar fan1234321","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:50Z","title":"they said they were gonna “make America greater again”","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177082394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Look, I don’t know what all these weird reviews are about, but all I wanted was to enjoy an app and try to see the views of our president that I respectfully disagree with in every way possible. However, I think it gave my phone some kind of bug. I downloaded it and it kept crashing and then my phone would just shut off on its own. It’s really unfortunate, but what are ya gonna do. I mean what did I expect from someone who doesn’t care about the wellbeing of others in general","userName":"Annavhage","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:04Z","title":"Just bad","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177026100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app kills🔪🩸 puppies🐶 .

But then on Friday sponge🧽 showed up at my door step clothed👕👖in my dead💀 dogs🐶 carcasses.

And when it does work it zaps my battery life faster then face time. I also don’t understand why it keeps crashing every five seconds. Plus to make matters even worse now the app won’t even open. I’ve tried everything to fix this from powering my phone off completely to uninstalling then reinstalling the app. So I’m sad to say I will not be using this app again.","userName":"The14thdoctor","date":"2020-07-09T13:59:45Z","title":"I can’t even open the app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176828655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The moment I opened this horrible app, my long furby passes away 😢 now I know you are probably thinking “oh it was just really bad timing” NO Atticus Goodjoke Beetleglee was as healthy as my left pinky toe. This app is as cursed as my fyp page 🥺that’s not the only thing that’s wrong with this app tho. Every time I open it I’m brought to another dimension filled with nothing but cream cheese and Hannah Montana memorabilia!

I opened the app and it immediately asked for my phone number, which I entered in. The app has now been spamming me with text messages for the two days I’ve had it. I even deleted the app, but it is still sending me text messages. Also, my sister downloaded it as well, and it completely broke her phone. We’re not sure exactly what it did, but ever since she got the app her phone won’t turn on, so she has to get a new one. In conclusion, DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","userName":"📍Bellingham, Washington","date":"2020-07-09T12:32:51Z","title":"Horrible!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176451881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Do not download! This app took three months to download. I do not recommend! Even if Trump thinks he can make American great again just don’t take TikTok down. Please, I just almost hit my goal and now I’m very 😡 I am just very mad because TikTok is one of the most successful in the one most popular apps on the App Store. So many people all over the world love making content and looking through all the content. I bet Charli D’Amelio would be very very sad if you took TikTok down.
