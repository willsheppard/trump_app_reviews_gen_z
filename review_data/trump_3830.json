Let’s say, hypothetically, you’ve been a racist Conservative even. Ok, and if you were a racist Conservative you would also be my mastah right? Then hypothetically speaking you would also be contributing to the systemic oppression of POCs. Now let’s say that you’re also a boomer. \nNow that we’ve established that you’re both a naughty Conservative and a boomer, then I’d believe you’d agree with me when I say that America is built off of the backs of colored people. Am I not correct? \nA naughty conservative deserves to have their app deleted, and as I am a black woman, you are my oppressor, so I and my fellow Gen Zers will carry out the punishment in due course.","title":"Trump DESTROYED by FACTS and LOGIC","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ben Shinopulous"}},{"id":"6174056532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:37Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see more about the big Cheeto and the second I downloaded this app I saw the big Cheeto mans pp it was tiny and it killed my grandma. I am expecting the Cheeto man to pay for the funeral expenses. This app also looks like something my sister made in preschool VERY unprofessional! After a few minutes of having this app my phone glitched and it made all my profile pictures on every account I have a picture of the Cheeto mans pp! It also changed my home screen and lock screen the same picture! Also this app made my cat float and I don’t even have a cat. In conclusion this app is filled with glitches and it killed my grandma do not download it.","title":"THIS APP KILLED MY GRANDMA!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cjs84124"}},{"id":"6173968959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:36:27Z","review":"This app is completely useless, what’s the point . it only says “trump 2020” over and over again . it’s not making any validation for trump himself . this app isn’t even good , i got it so i could put this out there . Also kind of sad how you have a whole APP dedicated to a president of the U.S. when he’s been called a rapist, a homophobic, a sexual predator, and even a transphobic. Really disappointing knowing apple STILL put his products out on their app store knowing all of this stuff , and if not knowing sad that they didn’t do any research . I would like this app taken down as of right now it only has 1.7 star rating , there for .. it’s not even a good app🥱 thank you, goodbye .","title":"G r o s s 😻✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"ten.brooke"}},{"id":"6173813503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:38:20Z","review":"Today I decided to download this app in a way to show my support to this wonderful president we have ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️ it took 24 hours to download which was a shocker like no app takes that short of a time to download 🙂😁after downloading it all of the sudden the lights💡 went off which was strange then little Oompa-Loompas appeared out of no where and they ate my pet lion 🦁 😭 I was so angry 😠 on what this app had summon into my house 🏠 but that’s not it there’s more... after they ate my lion 🦁 they decided to invite the cockroaches over to throw a party 🎉 they drank all of my toilet 🚽 water 💧 and they also ate all of my hair 😠 anyways I do not recommend this app to anyone it’s such a nightmare ✨ 💅🏽🧚🏼\u200D♀️","title":"Oh nooo... ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💅🏽","isEdited":false,"userName":"MonopolyFairy"}},{"id":"6173570440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:10:04Z","review":"At first I thought this app would be a good idea to download, me being the loyal republican I am 🤩, but the more I used it the more data and battery percentage it used into it was the most wasteful app on my phone. It also frequently spams me texts even after the fact that I replied STOP, it also somehow got access to my contacts and sends things to my friends and family, which is a completely unacceptable invasion of privacy. I still stand with my president though, because i support his beliefs, but not his app. (my snowflake of a daughter says it’s because i’m an idiot white supremacist but she must’ve got that from her father’s side 😒) Anyway, Trump 2020 😍🇺🇸    🚫🏳️\u200D🌈🚫","title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","isEdited":false,"userName":"elie1607"}},{"id":"6173516905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:51:46Z","review":"I would first like to say do not support this app because of course like many apps China is using it to collect data on the U.S. On top of that it took ages to download and as soon as it opened it began to glitch. There are so many bugs on this app that make it so terrible. I don’t know why this is being condoned and needs to be removed as soon as possible. I hate to see people believing that this app actually works when my experience with it so far has only been negative. Even when I tried to register for an event it started glitching and took me to another app. These are problems that cannot be fix and this app just needs to be removed.","title":"Disgrace.","isEdited":false,"userName":"highschoolstudent000"}},{"id":"6173466293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:34:26Z","review":"when downloading this app i straight up had a nauseous feeling, my head was spinning due to all the colors on the app. it caused me to go to the hospital. upon my arrival i was created by trump himself! he kept screaming and yelling at me asking me to rate his app five stars 😦 i believe this has happened before to many other due to i have seen a couple 5 stars reviews. Trump himself told me that if people refused to rate it five stars he would organize bots to do it for them !

So I started off my day by seeing an ad to install this app 🙄💅🏼I thought it would be good to install an app so I could contribute to ✨bunker boy✨ 😸 but little did I know how horrifying ✨bunker boy✨ really is. I showed the app to my family and as soon as they saw the  🍊 orange character appear on the screen, they had a stroke and died 😔. My little brother survived thankfully. 🙏 but he is still traumatized to this exact day. He won’t eat, talk, or sleep.  😱He just stares at the corner and chants, “I can’t see ✨bunker boy✨again, I can’t see Donald Duck again”. 👁👄👁 this app needs to be deleted. This has made me so angry I wanna snatch the toupee off of Donald ducks head 😔","title":"Horrible 🙄","isEdited":false,"userName":"glory xoxo 🤪"}},{"id":"6173362687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:58:40Z","review":"I downloaded this app with the the intention of supporting my President. When I signed up I was spammed with unrelated texts and emails (some of which were written in Russian or very poor English). After some more use with the app I was greeted with a virus that was written in RUSSIAN! I had to just buy a new phone since I am now unable to use the phone I downloaded this app on. I also needed a new email since the continued to spam me with emails after I had told the to stop I am now considering getting a new phone numbers because they also will not stop texting me after I had repeatedly told them to stop.
