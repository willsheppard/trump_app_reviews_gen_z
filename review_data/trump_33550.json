About 20% of the time it isn’t doing what it’s supposed to do. When I open the app, my phone starts to talk to me and can’t even finish its sentences. This app promotes fake news and is too orange for my taste. 🧚✨🧚\u200D♀️💕🧚\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6173631190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible experience","userName":"Schmootsiana","review":"I downloaded this thinking hey maybe the conservatives are on to something HA was i badly mistaken. this app was terrible. it glitched everytime i went on it. it was also EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE. these ppl should get a job instead of running this stupid app. anyone who thinks this app is good is a CLOWN."}},{"id":"6173630700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","userName":"Lollk_queen","review":"This app is the worst app out there. It is useless and keeps glitching. Honestly this app should be banned forever due to how freaking worthless it is.

THEN when i opened the app, it spammed me with Rick Ashely’s “Never Gonna Give You Up”. I do not appreciate being Rick Rolled. I am absolutely disgusted, dissatisfied, and disappointed. 🤮"}}]}
