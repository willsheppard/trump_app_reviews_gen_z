My Grandma downloaded it and was very disappointed. She kept saying there was some kind of Glitch or something, when she first opened the app. She kept saying there was a picture of an Orange with hair or something. She was completely mortified and we had to cut off her life support cause she no longer wanted to live anymore.

I highly doubt it. It ruined my whole night and left me feeling like I was going to T h r o w. U p. The app, of course taking 1.2 seconds to open (a millisecond more than other apps 🤬,) actually showed me a photo of DONALD TRUMP. I can not believe this. I’m gonna have nightmares for a whole MONTH.

Liberal media is back at it with their FAKE news. AND this app only tell us RACIST and bigoted and misogynistic news instead of the CHRISTIAN LOVE that trump truly spreads. This app is the reason I won’t vote for trump!

How can they disrespect a homie such as Melbert now his child, supreme bean will live with the memory of his, father Melbert the legendary hamster coming back from the store with milk ( finally) only to be eaten alive by this ruthless app. To be more graphic this app is equally disturbing as people who poor their milk before their cereal, people who genuinely enjoy mathematics, and those that have the audacity to name their children: KÀRËÑ.","title":"WORST APP IN THE HISTORY OF ICE AGE"}},{"id":"6174988436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LizzyDizzy34","date":"2020-07-09T04:03:56Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app and within a hour my phone started to be so slow.
