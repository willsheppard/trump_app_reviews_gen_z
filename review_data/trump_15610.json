The home screen is disgusting and not user friendly at all. It looks like Trump tried to make his own version of Facebook but for racists and supremacists. Each article reads like it’s been written by a “paid” intern who is clearly over their job. Mary Trump was right about Donald.","userName":"Bribrilolchild","title":"completely propaganda","rating":1}},{"id":"6177373795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:29:41Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen.

Upon downloading, which took several hours and crashed my phone twice, it told me that i had to make an account. Very strange for a game, but I did.
