First, it took absolutely forever to download, forever. How am I supposed to support my tiny handed hot Cheeto? And then second the app kept crashing over and over again when I tried to turn it on. Not to mention the amount of “inappropriate” pics I saw for the first couple of seconds. I don’t understand what this app was trying to go for, but this was not what I expected. Trump is a crybaby and it shows through the entire app with his fits and baby bottle up his ass.","userName":"Emily4650","title":"I can’t believe this!"}},{"id":"6178578354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:15:01Z","review":"🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😖💩💩💩💩💩💩💩","userName":"Iris Instagram Girl","title":"POOPY"}},{"id":"6178575884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:14:04Z","review":"THIS APP RESTED MY PHONE AND ON TOP OF THAT TRYING TO DOWNLOAD THIS ADD WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS.

I usually support my amazing president trump in all his glorious weaves, but with his 30+ rape allegations coming to light I don’t feel comfortable as a woman to know he is tracking my location.  Don’t get me wrong I still love my dear Mr. Trump.  But a part of me wonders how true some things are.","userName":"Chessmaven","title":"Scary and DANGEROUS"}}]}
