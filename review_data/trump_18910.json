However, upon downloading it I was surprised to see how poor the formatting was. It was as if little to no thought had been put into it!!! I will be sticking to Twitter to receive my news from Trump and I suggest anyone who plans on downloading the app does so as well.","rating":1,"userName":"Sydneyjwb","title":"Save Your Time","date":"2020-06-26T02:21:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6125598778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just downloaded this app about two days ago and I love it. I almost love this app as much as I love my President but President Trump is right up there with love for family.","rating":5,"userName":"sandy77friend","title":"Love this app Trump 2020","date":"2020-06-26T22:07:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6048538776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is a great excuse of an app! 😂 I finally got immediate access to fake news. Also felt nice to be able to see what the president has to say without being fact-checked (love that I can see the lies for myself). Honestly, if u want entertainment, this is where where you’ll get it. 👍🏼 BUT... Trump is a gift to this world... I just hope god kept the receipt 😂","rating":1,"userName":"BigBlue0312","title":"🤣🤣🤣","date":"2020-06-07T23:02:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179202123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"666 days ago at 4:20 I downloaded this app. It proceeded to harass me through my social media, dox me, send me death threats, and beg for nudes afterwards. Soon after it followed me home, brutally beating and raping me. I am horrified. 69 days later it brutally murdered me, dumping my body in a river and then lighting it on fire. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. I will never forget this app. Do not download it.","rating":1,"userName":"L1T3R4L_B0T","title":"I need to get this off my chest","date":"2020-07-10T03:09:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179201558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"at first i didn’t realize but this app was automatically downloaded to my phone. I could’ve sworn it was the russians again. anyways i opened the app to see a live stream of bill nye being held captive at the whitehouse. this is unacceptable! everyone knows bill nye is allergic to cheetos. overall do not like this app! needs to be taken down!","rating":1,"userName":"OfficialAlyssasAnswers","title":"no❤️✨","date":"2020-07-10T03:09:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179166626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As an avid supporter of our dear dear president Donald Trump, I downloaded this app. Now I have to admit...I’ve never laid eyes on Trump but when i opened the app up I was greeted with what I can only explain as an old wrinkly cheese puff dipped in a very uneven layer of cinnamon, I immediately went blind. My dog had to write this review as my eyes have decided to nope the heck outta my skull. I am personally and mentally offended.","rating":1,"userName":"Rileygermanshepherd","title":"Nope..

You can tell there was little care and thought put into the build of this app. Hopefully the won’t even attempt to make another app. People are saying that that their information was compromised and as soon as I downloaded it I was getting spam... I think it’s fake, a scam, yuge scam.","rating":1,"userName":"astorga01","title":"Pooor developer","date":"2020-07-10T02:49:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179118740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a whole week to download! When it did and i opened it, it started chanting like a demon and brought a million spiders into my home! After that happened, the app took control of my grandma's tv and shot her with a laser beam! After that it made my dog float up and through the ceiling and then into the sun.
