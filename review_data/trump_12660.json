It took 72 hours to download! And when I finally got it to open, I opened it and it crashed. Unbelievable. It then said it hacked all of my personal information and tracked my location. All I tried to do was support our wonderful president and instead it gave my phone a virus. Can’t believe I wasted three days waiting for this app. Disappointed. Save ur time and sanity. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","isEdited":false,"title":"Waste of time and effort","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:02:32Z"}},{"id":"6178776938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Atziry is dope","review":"I anticipated to download this app but then I remembered it’s to support a clown and his minions but I’m non judgmental by looks so I gave it a try and since the very beginning it’s been giving me problems. It lags , it takes me off the app , it constantly spams my phone with notifications when I had turned them off and it’s very annoying. Just overall a very bad app.I just can’t stress it enough how bad this app is 😫","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible 🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:32:24Z"}},{"id":"6178764429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no❤️🥵😙👏🏽😏😁","review":"SOPHIA THE FIRST FOR PRESIDENT YESSSSSSSSSSS WOOOOOOOOO👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I was a girl in the village doing alright then I became a princess overnight now I gotta figure out how to do it right so much to learn and see up in the castle with my new family in a school that’s just for royalty a whole enchanted world is waiting for me I’m so exited to be Sophia the first I’m finding out what being royal is all about (Sophia the first) making my way is an adventure everyday (Sophia) it’s gonna be my time to show them all that I’m Sophia the firsttttttttttt","isEdited":false,"title":"SOPHIA THE FIRST FOR PRESIDENT.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:27:31Z"}},{"id":"6178761456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JoeBiden101","review":"All I wanted to do is support my amazing president but it took this app a week, 7 DAYS TO DOWNLOAD!!!! By the time it was done downloading I had to delete it because it would constantly crash I tried to open it. I thing they should just take this app down and fix it because the app and the president have some very loose wires and they need to be fixed along with a factory reset.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app!!!

Sadly this app took DAYS to download and my neighbor said it took her phone HOURS to download too. What a shame. Such a horrible app. It glitches and made my phone get incredibly hot. I’m scared I’m going to have to buy a new phone. This app needs deleted and never brought back. I wish I could leave ZERO stars.","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:22:41Z"}},{"id":"6178747754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Karen 40000","review":"I would like to first say that I was really excited when this app came out, but because of how horrible the app is I am no longer supporting trump. It took 12 hours to download! Not only that but when I opened it nothing was loading, like it was just a white screen. Then when it finally loaded(after 15 minutes) it was so unorganized! This app is useless and not worth the trouble.😡😡😤","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:21:03Z"}},{"id":"6178731778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tbbhx","review":"This app took 1 week to download!! Which was already bad enough. It made so many of my apps crash, my favorites apps smh. Ever since I downloaded it, bad things keep happening. I am having nightmares, my phone broke, and I am losing all my stuff. Whenever I turn off my phone, I keep hearing noises come from it. Sometimes the app opens itself and it won’t leave.
