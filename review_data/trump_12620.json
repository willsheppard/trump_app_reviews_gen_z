I had to get my phone wiped completely after using this app. Also I downloaded this app to help me become a trump supporter, that never happen. It’s the worst app anyone could ever download. There’s also a lot of ads for some reason. You think they would take them off of the app because it is our president. I would NOT download this app ever again.","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"yakfoebudkbei","date":"2020-07-08T16:13:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172840450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It hurt me very much to download, most would say “heartbreaking,” but I’ve had my heart broken before and the pain of getting this app compares to nothing. A major problem with this app is that it ask for my phone number! very personal Mr. Trump!!!!! i thought you were about keeping my freedoms and rights, but asking for such a thing is such a violation of the constitution. Who knows what he can do with our information!!!

I laid down to morn my ended career as a surgeon when I 2 quick steps and a plop. I tasted a familiar 💩. How could I not know who it was, I’ve been eating it for the last 4 years.

Sometimes it would randomly connect to a blue tooth speaker 🔊 and blast him speaking at his rallies. It took weeks to uninstall and I am still grieving from my dog. 🐕 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑚𝑝 2020🧚🏽\u200D♂️❤️💞𝑏𝑢𝑡 𝑚𝑎𝑘𝑒 𝑖𝑡 𝑜𝑛 𝑎 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒 💓🧚🏽\u200D♂️👁👄👁","title":"Killed my dog","isEdited":false,"userName":";+","date":"2020-07-08T15:57:36Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172723307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app, and was shocked to see a chubby orange Cheese puff, fully nude. It was horrifying. Then, a few days later, I got a knock at the door and wondered who it could be, I saw the orange Cheeto puff man standing outside my house. He then proceeded to scream racist and homophobic things at the top of his lungs and I was scared for my life. He went and trashed my home, but that’s not all. He put my pet goldfish on the stove and started cooking him (rip jerry) and then ate him.

When I first got onto the app, it asked me for my feet pictures. Of course, I said yes because I’d do anything for Donny. But it kept on asking for feet pictures every time I got onto the app. I felt very uncomfortable, especially seeing other people’s hairy, crusty feet. I still love you Donny, but please change this. Despite being your biggest supporter, I feel very very uncomfortable seeing all these feet.
