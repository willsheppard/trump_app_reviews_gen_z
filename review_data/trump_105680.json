I don’t understand why the POTUS would want to harm his supporters in such a confusing and demeaning way. Also every time I try to sign up for a rally it’s stars playing the bee movie... Barry B benson is sexy and all but I want to watch that on my own time... With a glass of wine in my bubble bath. NOT while I’m using this app. It also won’t even let me use the app without a phone number. Who the F has a phone anymore? We Read books boo boo.  Anyways I guess I’m just on here to say this app is too immature for this generation.. We want business info not memes 🤬also here is my favorite spaghetti recipe.\nGround Beef. I use 85% lean ground angus beef for my sauce so it still has flavor but not a lot of fat. My sister has taken to using ground turkey, also a great option.\nTomato sauce. Plain is best to create a tomato bath for the other ingredients to infuse.\nDiced tomatoes. You could use canned whole tomatoes and then crush with your hands and fingers. But mom’s recipe says diced so that’s what I do.\nTomato paste. This gives the sauce it’s body, and also a little sweetness.\nBeef broth. Another layer of meatiness. My sister amended her recipe to use condensed, but I used regular here.\nCanned mushrooms. Typically I will always use fresh mushrooms in recipes, but this is one time I never, ever, ever do. There’s just something about the canned version that becomes my favorite part of the sauce, and the reason I typically double the amount the recipe calls for.\nA splash of wine. Mom says to use the empty mushroom can as your measurement guide.\nOnion, celery and fresh garlic. They’re always lollying around the refrigerator crisper waiting to be used.\nDried herbs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of sugar for sweetness. Don’t skip out on the bay leaves, they make a huge difference.\nDried whole cloves! My mom learned this trick from her friend Virginia, and adding a few whole cloves was the secret ingredient I’d been missing lo these many years. My mom uses 5-6 cloves but my husband prefers four. The cloves give it an earthy, spiced flavor that’s not often easy to place. It’s a total surprise when I tell people they’re in there, or if they discover one on their own hidden in their spaghetti-sauced bite if I forget or can’t find them to fish them out before serving.\nTruly fantastic homemade spaghetti sauce is easier to make than you’d think, but it does take time. To make the best spaghetti sauce, you simply need to brown the ground beef and drain off any excess fat. Then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften. So far, so good?\n\nDump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for another 3 hours. I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce.","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:43Z"}},{"id":"6177276736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ahhhhhhelpmeplz","title":"Trash","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is trash","date":"2020-07-09T16:02:07Z"}}]}
