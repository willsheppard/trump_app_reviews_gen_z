After inputting my number, I started getting spam texts and I didn’t know how to stop them. And on top of that, upon trying to use the app, it kept lagging and it just froze my phone completely. I ended up having to restart my phone multiple times. It’s basically unusable. The layout also makes it hard for me to find exactly what I’m looking for. I also expected to find more important information about actual issues going on in the world but there’s basically none of that. This app is not worth the download."}},{"id":"6179373814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:08:35Z","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT download THIS 🤮🤮","userName":"bunny boof 😢😣","review":"my sister (5 years old) downloaded this by mistake. she had nightmares for 6 weeks after claiming to see a CHEETO MAN in her room. turns out she was just dreaming about trump and when he popped up on the screen when she opened this app. she said she was scared we was gonna eat her. please do NOT download this.. especially with children 😥"}},{"id":"6179373628","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:08:31Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible programming","userName":"F1ishy","review":"Kept crashing on launch, almost like a god is out there trying to make sure trump doesn’t get re-elected!"}},{"id":"6179373499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:08:29Z","rating":1,"title":"not worth it.","userName":"i miss musiclly:(","review":"worst app ever. not worth it. i hate it and read this bc it not worth it and it’s a waste of time and other people think it bad to do might as well not even download it and and delete it :)"}},{"id":"6179373471","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:08:28Z","rating":1,"title":"Pray for uncle Phil","userName":"helloing8","review":"So I downloaded this to see what the fresh prince of bel air was talking about and then well I came across a chetto guy with Cheeto dust on his hair and then I saw a giraffe with Carlton and he said to get out if this app before it did what it did to uncle Phil.

Once I downloaded it my phone started leaking. So then I had to put it in some rice but once I put it in the rice it started cooking. I was saving that rice for dinner. 😡 Once I took my phone out of the rice I tried to open the app but it kept saying “Trump is eating cheetos right now, try again later”. So that made me even more furious. Not only was my phone leaking because of this app, but it didn’t even freaking work! I demand that this app gets deleted right now. And p.s. the rice tasted like 💩."}},{"id":"6179372675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:08:13Z","rating":1,"title":"Trust me when I say this","userName":"420420420god","review":"This app smells like donkey!!!"}}]}
