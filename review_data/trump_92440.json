My friend Karen said that it was amazing and supported our amazing hot,orange,fat president. However when I downloaded it the first question it asked me was “since you downloaded this app will you accept the Cheeto cult?” I wasn’t expecting such a question but I clicked yes. Later when I was scrolling through the app a link popped up so I clicked on it and BOOM, I saw thousands of hot Cheetos floating around my screen. I didn’t think much of it until I turned up my volume and they were saying...” Cheeto Cheeto on the wall whose the hottest of them all?” Then two answers popped up... 1)Cheeto ME...2)Cheeto Trumpet, obviously I’m way hotter so I clicked Cheeto me duhhh. So when I clicked they said that it was a test and I FAILED!!! Since my volume was already up I could hear them saying DoReMi! DoReMi! DoReMi! I was terrified!!! My hands were shaking and my jaw was clenched. Suddenly I felt a gritty touch on my skin. Cheeto Trumpet’s Hans came out for the screen and touched me. It left three strands of Cheeto dust on my arm, and started to GROW. My eyes grew big and skin was pale, I couldn’t speak, it was like sleep paralysis but awake. The Cheeto dust grew on me and began my new skin. I was thinking “what did I do wrong?? I was just trying to support my Cheeto president.” The dust filled my mouth covered my teeth. I was turning into one of them...I WAS TURNING INTO A CHEETO!!!!!!! Finally I accepted it, I accepted the fact that I was gonna be a Trumpet follower so I rested until the dust cover every last part of my body wishing that I could go back(I’m a Cheeto btw). Whoever read my story I hope that you are aware that if you download this app you will be in the Cheeto cult. It’s now worth it you guys. There’s literally Cheeto crumbs all over my screen from typing this. DO NOT JOIN THE CULT I REPEAT DO NOT JOIN THE CULT. To the person reading this GET OFF of the reviews before they get you too. And remember the only way you can reverse from being a Cheeto is by leaving a 1 star review. 1) Download the app 2) DELETE IT 3) go back to the AppStore search up Trump2020 and leave a 1 STAR review. Always remember this> BE SAFE DONT BE DUMB LISTEN TO ME. Cheeto out❤️","userName":"🎤🎼","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:58Z","title":"Karen made me do it...","rating":1}},{"id":"6173168600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is horrible. it took forever to download and when i finally opened it all i saw was an ugly orange man! waste of your time. blm","userName":"😹🤤💍🤍","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:29Z","title":"orange man🍊","rating":1}},{"id":"6173166515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"🧚\u200D♀️✨not adequate🧚\u200D♀️✨","userName":"karen hates trump","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:50Z","title":"Make America better without him","rating":1}},{"id":"6173151038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"✨I’m gonna pass on this ✨😌","userName":"its mrs toller","date":"2020-07-08T17:48:57Z","title":"no thanks","rating":1}},{"id":"6173147371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this to “TOTALLY SUPPORT MR CHEETO HIMSELF” but then a fat orange hippo broke into my house and chanted “RATE 5 STARS” and I ain’t having that so I rated one star.
