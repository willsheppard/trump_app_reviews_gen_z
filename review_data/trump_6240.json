I just wanted to say the porn pop ups were not appreciated. The app gave me a virus and now whenever my phone turns on porn pop ups raid my phone and then my phone connects to Bluetooth devices such as ALEXA and it oh my lord the amount of times there was just SCREAMING AND MOANING coming out of my loud speakers🤧 this app is horrifying and I don’t condone this kind of behavior. GOD AWFUL.

I decided chipotle was good, so I went over to chipotle but then i got lost and I ended up at a gas station. To make matters worse it wasn’t even a nice gas station. So I had to try to look up how to get there on my phone.... but i didn’t have service ! So I figured it out and I found chipotle and then I was happy again. But now I’m sunburnt from being out all day and that hurts. \nBut yeah this app is terrible. It’s slow and it took all my internet so my phone didn’t have any signal to find chipotle. Thanks a lot rachel.","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6133920335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T01:04:25Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lyme83","review":"This app is DEMONIC. I tried to download it, and while it was downloading, my hair CAUGHT ON FIRE, my dog decided to SH!T(excuse my language) on me, and I almost died from choking on nothing!? ITS LIKE it summoned a DEMON??! Anyways, after that, the app wouldn’t open! It kept crashing over and over, and when it finally did open, my phone started to BLARE INAPPROPRIATE MUSIC! I immediately got rid of it because of all the horrible things it had made me gone through... I’m SCARRED THANKS TO IT... and while I usually don’t share this information with others... I am now seeing a therapist thanks to this app..

I downloaded this app because I supported Donald Jenius Trump. I was so wrong. Upon opening, it asked for my credit card info. I believed that it was for easy donations, but my credit card has been charged over $700,000! I downloaded this app yesterday! And, this app has somehow used all of my internet. My phone barely works now that I’ve been on the app for only 10 minutes! I refuse to believe that this app and presidential candidate are good enough to govern over my daughter, Mickaulëaigh. This is DESPICABLE!!! I will definitely be speaking to corporate.","title":"I can’t believe this!"}},{"id":"6177800941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:41:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"yo mommas couchie stank🤢🐠","review":"And the reason why you owe me a phone and AirPods because I was using then while voting for you and you fried the bottom of my ear .ok Trump  so buy me a new Xr blue and AirPods and I will vote for you this goes for my billons of families who agree to me writing right now and Im very well serous  pS: don’t think your slick bring back damm Tiktok orange 🍊 Cheeto like your not cute that’s why Anonymous leaked your tiny dms😊🙃so yeah.

I thought, maybe trump isn’t so bad. So once I downloaded it I was looking through to see what it was about and a black man walked past me. I support BLM but for some reason after downloading this app I became a racist bigot & started yelling racial slurs at him. I realized it was wrong & deleted the app immediately & it stopped so I redownloaded it to see if it was me or the app. It was the app. I dont know what type of racial voodoo they use but this app is not good & it will make you a white supremacists. If I could give 0 stars I would. 😌","title":"THIS APP MADE ME CHANT RACIAL SLURS AT POC"}},{"id":"6177411485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:40:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"this is so dumb leave me alone","review":"First of all, when I open the app, the first thing I get is a title page asking for my phone number?! I don’t want my personal information to go to these people! Next thing I want to address was after downloading the app, it was veryyy glitchy and kept closing every time I opened it. I know what you’re going to ask, “maybe stop closing out of the application and then you’ll be able to use it” and my answer for you is no. I’d much prefer to never go onto that app ever again thank you very much.","title":"Very Glitchy and Bad"}},{"id":"6177338915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:19:39Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"yuh yuh ayeee","review":"This app made me so upset, I wanted more information on the trump runnings and such but it took farrrrrr too long to download and I sensed it hacking into my phone, I think it deserves below one star but we’ll get into that later, The fonts were huge and in fact the entire app looks like it took maybe an hour to create, I thought the president would be better than that, maybe I was wrong. I wish Bernie hadn’t dropped out, he’d know how to make an app!! This really made me angry!! I wish the worst of luck!","title":"I can’t believe how terrible this app really was"}}]}
