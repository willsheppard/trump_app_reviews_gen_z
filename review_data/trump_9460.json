Um, allow a tangerine to basically text me anytime he wants, no thanks. And then it asked for my phone number and I’m not about to give my phone number to a gross old man who is obviously a rapist I mean come on that’s just a great way to get kidnapped. \nNo thank you, President Annoying Orange.

It immediately made me have to close the app and burn my phone and of course I had my hands chopped off because they had the audacity to even download it. I am currently typing this with my toes on my computer. Anyway DO NOT open this app around children. They might be scarred for life if they see the Oompa Loompa. So what I’m trying to say is that this app shouldn’t exist and Trumps an idiot. 😘","rating":1,"userName":"✨💕🧚\u200D♀️ bruh 🧚\u200D♀️💕✨","title":"✨HORRIBLE APP✨"}},{"id":"6177544163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app to see what was going, and what Trump had in store and the trump news but when I tried using the app it keep crashing and kicking me out. I restarted my phone and tried again but it kept crashing so I gave up, and when I tried to use other apps those began crashing aswell which caused my phone to turn off and it wouldn’t turn on for a while.","rating":1,"userName":"copdoro","title":"crashing constantly , ruined my phone ."}},{"id":"6177520311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:32Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So i got the app and saw the mistake on the front that is the cheeto that hates women. I immediately got disgusted and since this app spies on you, they got cheeto supporters to break into my house and try to kill me! I had to defend myself so i fought back and killed them off. The app owners got even more mad and blew up my phone! They were still mad so they sent a UFO to come kidnap me and make the aliens eat me! Im now typing this on my ipad and I think the aliens are gonna roast me alive!","rating":1,"userName":"Aʟᴏɴᴇ","title":"0 Stars if I could 🤦\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177481947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:01:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am and have always been a Trump supporter but this app did not fulfill my expectations. The second I opened the app the screen was filled with Trump’s shrimp penīs EVERYWHERE 😣 It was such a disturbing sight to see that I ended up eating my child. Thank god I was able to regurgitate her but she ended up losing her right leg 😕 As well the app is incredibly slow and hard to figure out. The mechanics are really confusing and the app is an overall 1/5 for me. So sorry ❤️","rating":1,"userName":"chandra thay","title":"Disappointed..."}},{"id":"6177454164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:35Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When i first opened the app i saw this rotten orange on the cover page and i was like ewwww and so of course i had to show my dog she shivered and then ran away and now she just sits and stares at the door all night and gets absolutely no sleep and my other dog tries to help her but she is scarred for life and whenever someone comes near her she jumps and is over all always scared that she will see him again.

When I first downloaded this app I wanted to see Trump’s future plans and how our future will continue to grow. When I downloaded it I was walking to the kitchen and I fell breaking my leg. Then the next day someone broke into my house. The day after that I found out my friend only has a few days to live. I decided to delete this app because I needed to clear for some storage. Everything has been fine since.","rating":1,"userName":"vivian mccullough","title":"CURSED"}},{"id":"6177351876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:23:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app is full of “Trump News and Tweets” but nothing about his wanting to ban Tik Tok, an app which people all over the world, including those in America, love and support. Especially since the only reason he wants it gone is because we hurt his feelings.        🧚🏻\u200D♂️s t o p   t r y i n g,   n o   o n e   l i k e s   a n  o o m p a   l o o m p a   w h o   i s   m o r e      e a s i l y   o f f e n d e d   b y   p e o p l e        h a v i n g   o p i n i o n s   t h a t   d i f f e r      f r o m   h i s  t h a n   t h e   i n j u s t i c e s    p e o p l e   f a c e   b e c a u s e   o f   t h e i r   r a c e,  g e n d e r,  o r   s e x u a l i t y🧚🏻","rating":1,"userName":"gen z tik toker","title":"Waste of Time"}},{"id":"6177280723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:03:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I what just minding my business on the app while doing my other business ifykyk when the app made my phone start vibrating like crazy.
