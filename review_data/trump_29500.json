Which is weird because I don’t eat Cheetos, AND THEN I saw a Cheeto on the app!! So would not recommend especially if you don’t like Cheetos. If you do like Cheetos there’s better ones at the gas station so.","title":"THIS APP IS AWFUL"}},{"id":"6174681731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:31:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ChrsipyBacon","review":"This app was going ok until it was time to submit a profile, it glitched out on me and CRASHED my PHONE. I had to restart it and even then I couldn’t get into the app after that and it crashed AGAIN. Not worth your time trying to get if it doesn’t work, THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!","title":"DO NOT GET,  GLITCHES ARE INSANE"}},{"id":"6174676145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:29:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"goodvibes.18","review":"This app is quite possibly one of the most dangerous apps out there. It causes an illness called Karenism. Symptoms include becoming a middle aged white woman with a bad short haircut, belief that you are superior , as well as a “need to speak to the manager”. I deleted just before it infected me. Come on we don’t need ANOTHER badly handled pandemic.","title":"BEWARE OF KARENISM"}},{"id":"6174658604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:48Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"yuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh","review":"Literally terrible. It killed all of my succulents. It literally makes me so saaaaad. Like what did the succulents do to the app bro? Literally nothing. Is it because they’re green? Is that why? They’re not “pretty” like flowers simply because of the color? Bro what the hell. (See what I’m tryna say?) color doesn’t matter","title":"Yikes"}},{"id":"6174653298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:23:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"hdjsosucnf","review":"I’ve used this app and it has the worst glitches.

Now it dies at 80% and it says my storage is completely full. What am I supposed to do now?! I’m appalled this app is even allowed on the App Store anymore! It should be taken down immediately.","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174644792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:20:50Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Revean1978","review":"I found it full of lies and inaccurate data on other political parties. It also seems to have a cinnamon haired old guy ranting about stuff he knows nothing about. I don’t understand why anyone would trust that cinnamon hair old guy, as his app tells nothing but lies.","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174643005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:20:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bootymuncher300","review":"I opened up the app and i found a rat and when I went to grab it, it turned into a dinosaur and started chasing me and then it kicked my mom and brother and even my dog !!!!!

Now, it glitches all the time and the app uses a HUGE amount of battery. This is hard for me to say, but I think this app may be worse than my liberal neighbor...","title":"a HUGE mistake"}}]}
