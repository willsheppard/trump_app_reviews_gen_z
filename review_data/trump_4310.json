Please fix my phone, this is your fault. Mr president orange was really being annoying and his voice sounding like pac man 👨 but that’s besides the point, my phone is now broken and it is being really annoying. Please contact the president to give me 100,000,000 dollars. This costed me 200,000,000 dollars but I’ll lower it for u guys. So if u could once again do me a favor and contact the president, that’d be very much appreciated 😊","userName":"sknekcnnf","title":"very bad app","rating":1}},{"id":"6174134652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:38:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First when I opened the app I saw this horrific image of what appeared to be a naked homeless man and his eenie teeny tiny weeny 🤏(or maybe it was a Cheeto idk) and then the app racked my location and in a few seconds, a man knocked on my door, stormed into my house house, and stole my dogs (ones black and ones a chihuahua 🇲🇽 ) and screeched “ALL DOGS MATTER” and proceed to shoot my black dog and cage my chihuahua. Anyways there was some woman and an oddly talk child there and the both had the look of fear as if they were being held hostage or something (????) idk probably nothing but we had similar names (my names Melanie) then they left.

However, this app not only took FOREVER to load, it immediately began spreading propaganda the SECOND I opened it. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt, maybe Trumpy was right, maybe he IS going to save me from the socialists. However, I did find it strange that he wanted me to sell my first born’s soul in the name of MAGA. But I drew the line when this app had the audacity to tell me that trump was rebuilding America, as if he didn’t mess it up in the four years his fat, radioactive cheeto bum has occupied the oval office.

It took an entire week to download and my phone glitched so bad. My WiFi was not working and i couldn’t do anything with my phone. I had to spend an entire week waiting for the app to download and it definitely was not worth it. Not only did it take my time and my WiFi, but I definitely do not recommend getting this app. Getting this app was a big mistake and I regret doing it. Do not get this app. It is just a waste of time. This president is not a decent president and I do not support him. But even if I did, I still would never get this app.","userName":"Mia_Salgueroo13","title":"Terrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6173797059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:31:57Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I opened this app my VPN started sending me notifications an all the viruses my device was exposed too as well as my phone starting to lag and glitch rlly bad I thought it was just a glitch in the app so I reset it left my phone alone when I got back on it ab an hour later any app I opened would either reset my whole phone or reset the app only when I feted the app did my phone start to return to normal I deleted it 2 days ago and I just got a notification saying it was still tracking my internet and social media uses and my location my biggest regret in the world is downloading this app","userName":"liziphin11","title":"Do not download","rating":1}},{"id":"6173763970","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:41Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is absolutely horrible. not only does it spread FAKE NEWS 😡 but it sends you daily haikus about our NAZI POTUS. 😱 this one i received yesterday:\n                      trump is a fascist \n                nazis were also fascists\n               please just shoot me now\nas you can see, these are very stressful to read 😓 as they are entirely accurate. i personally recommend deleting ❌ the app immediately 😳 and choosing a better one. i suggest the line of Toca Boca children’s games. very educational 📚. in the mean time ⏰, i’m publicly declaring myself a terrorist, as i side with ANTIFA. thank you 🙏🏻 for making an awful app POTUS. my pet toad frog 🐸 named Savage could have created a better program.","userName":"snoofy doot","title":"stinky rat app","rating":1}},{"id":"6173752115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:15:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I just downloaded this app and my phone has  been glitching and i can't leave until i write a review!
