Just that on its own makes me not want to download this app, but my curiosity got to me and I downloaded it. This app literally takes 3.5 days to download (I’m not even joking) and as it finished, my phone started to lag and heat up every time I turned it on, making it quite unusable. I was eventually able to finally open the app and as I opened it, I started to smell something unpleasant. I thought that someone was pooping at first, but when I looked closer at my phone screen, I saw poop on my screen. Poop was forming on my screen. I could see the poop particles slowly being born onto my phone screen in clumps. This had never happened to me before, so I closed the app immediately. All of the poop had vanished. I opened the app again and the poop came back, but it was forming onto my phone screen at a faster pace that I could barely keep up with. The smell of poop had spread to my entire house. I closed the app right away and deleted it. I had never experienced this with an app before. Do NOT download this horrible smelly app.","rating":1,"userName":"9829383","title":"worst app on the App Store (should be deleted)","date":"2020-07-09T09:43:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175941883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to se Donald j trump and then it took 93939383838737474747474774 decades to download then the app gave me coronavirus and basically that’s how Donald trump strayed corona China didn’t Donald trumps app did","rating":1,"userName":"mr!bobby169359","title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T09:43:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175941936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP TOOK 1 MONTH TO DOWNLOAD AND ONCE IT DOWNLOADED IT ASKED FOR MY EMAIL AND MY PHONE NUMBER WHICH I THINK IS SUPER INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE HE HAS A WIFE AND KIDS AND THEN IT FLRCED ME TO GO MAKE DONALD TRUMP A MILKSHAKE BUT BECAUSE IT ASKED FOR MY NUMBER I PUT POOP IN IT 😌","rating":1,"userName":"👁👄👁👀🤮🤢🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻","title":"I HATE THIS APP🤮","date":"2020-07-09T09:43:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175940818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s a horrible app I don’t recommend whatsoever. When I downloaded it bees started attacking me asking me where’s the honey. After they left fish started swimming around me saying yeah yeah over and over again. Soon Winnie the Pooh came and told me to hide something very important. He than gave me a key to another dimension he told me to never go to the other dimension or bad things would happen. I left my curiosity get the best of me and went to the other dimension. What I saw was unexplainable pinhead Larry and kool aid man were playing a game of leap frog while Sofia the first and Sid from toy story were preforming for their first concert.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.
