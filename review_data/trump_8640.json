I was walking my pet rock to the dollar store and maybe steal a pebble but we didnt. When I was walking him home he was really tired so he went to go to bed but when he got to my room the bed was gone! When I realized that the app did it, I put it in time out when it came to life and held me and my pet rock hostage, and not the good kind like in 365 days! My rock then called his friends, paper and scissors, and they beat it up so we escaped. All in all it was a bad experience so 1 star.","userName":"immortal clown🤡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:17:18Z","title":"TERRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6174785165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app eat my sonic burger and i got so mad at it that i went and got chick-fil-a then it ate that too so i yeeted my phone across the room and started singing shawty’s👩🏾like a melody🎵in my head 🧠that i can’t keep out❌got me singing like✍️nananana👄everyday😿like my iPod📱 stuck in replay🔄. but then nothing happened so i started singing ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆. but STILL nothing happen. so all this app did was break my phone and trump didn’t even pay for my insurance 😡","userName":"beachbash3968","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:02:50Z","title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6174781422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is atrocious. Never in my LIFE have I been so disrespected. This app is a waste of time and energy. It’s just full of FAULTY INFORMATION AND FAKE NEWS! I thought it would be helpful and informative but NO! It’s asking me to subscribe to a CULT. A CULT!! This anti Christian, anti American, anti HUMAN app needs to be taken down IMMEDIATELY! I cannot believe apple is okay with allowing this to be sold on their platform!!! I refuse to submit to the cult! I refuse to submit to white supremacy! I refuse to submit to the hateful rhetoric this app tried to trick me into supporting! Take. It. Down!","userName":"Times new Viking","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:01:41Z","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6174769200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You know I expected a lot more from the President of the United States but once again, I have been severely disappointed. This app comes with so many bugs and it’s just so laggy. Waste of time if you ask me. Other apps are SO much better than this one. I tried to find some positives in it but alas I found none. 0/10 if I could give it negative infinity stars I would. Don’t waste your time on this app like I did 😔","userName":"genghid khan","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:57:55Z","title":"Laggy, false news, and overall just terrible"}},{"id":"6174752458","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After I downloaded this app my garbage can ran away n gave me google sheets that wouldn’t turn on because the starfish tht was trapped under the pineapple forgot to set up the microwaveable stool by the counter so the cracker can Kermit suicide so instead it payed into the carpet which was an abortion n had to be revived but the Karen’s said no so we ended up dragging em n locking em up in my basement where miachael Jackson hides n sings his number 1 hits for all the trump supporters after making their clothes yellow and crunchy. Yeah....terrible app🤕🤮🤢😷","userName":"godswhor3","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:52:51Z","title":"DONT GET"}},{"id":"6174732335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app I immediately closed it down. I was extremely terrified and now I have a phobia thanks to the orange Oompa Loompa on the screen. The app sent an alien from Area 51 to come and threaten me and my family. I was horrified. Then the man himself had the audacity to call me and say that he is watching me and if I don’t vote for him he will karate chop my great grandmother. He also said he will steal my dog that I don’t even have. So not realistic. I very much do not recommend this app. It is dangerous.","userName":"nailah.pretty","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:46:44Z","title":"Very much do not recommend"}},{"id":"6174712007","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to check on our president’s 2020 election and immediately it just starts glitching. It’s such a horrible app it does not update correctly. Do not download this app until changes are made!!! It has not been updated in three weeks and that’s why it’s glitching 😡🤬 it’s not for my phone apparently which is disgusting because I should be able to look at our president’s election at my own free will and it won’t let me. Again do not download this app!","userName":"igitslala","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:40:36Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!"}},{"id":"6174704047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I decided to order some merch of course...to burn(for legal reasons that is a joke😳) anywaysss, i received a notification that my package had arrived. I went outside to get my package and brought it inside. When I opened it, an Oompa Loompa came out, spit in my face, stepped on my baby, ate my dog, and took off his clothes while yelling ACAB as he ran outside around the neighborhood. When that caos happened I decided to look in the box, there was no merch in the box😐 I give it one star for the free show but you owe me a new dog🥄😡","userName":"bby.byeee","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:38:11Z","title":"A horrible app!"}},{"id":"6174670591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was under the impression that this godly app would give me the privilege that i so rightly deserve but alas it did nothing of the sort. Instead the second i opened up the app it started glitching and text started popping up saying how my skin tone was 3 shades darker then the skin color requirement to recieve privilege. ABSOLUTELY TRASH customer service when i called to ask abt this problem bc i was left on hold for THREE HOURS. Do not download this app, seek elsewhere to get privilege  >:(","userName":"Alias Thompson","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:28:15Z","title":"Didn’t give me the privilege i was looking for"}},{"id":"6174665514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened the app a big foot came and sat at my window and then Godzilla came and ate him then he said to me that this app is stupid and needs to be deleted bc he hates eating big foot so I agreed with him bc I do not want to witness that again then this trash app came to life and said it wants to eat me so I got out of it and now the apples are going bad so I threw them away and then a goat came and screamed at the apples so I definitely don’t like this app like I don’t like the orange in the White House 😌✌🏼","userName":"🤪🧜🏻🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:48Z","title":"VeRy dIsaPpointed 🧚🏼🧜🏻👁👄👁"}}]}
