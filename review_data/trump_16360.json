The more I looked into the app, the more I realized that it was just terrible! All it really does is try to make him seem like he isn’t a bad guy and obviously this app is filled with lies. I can’t have an app that lies to my face 100% of the time.","date":"2020-07-08T17:24:45Z","rating":1,"title":"Just as Terrible as the President","userName":"bruhamel"}},{"id":"6173047869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"before I went to bed I downloaded this app and when I woke up all of my pets turned into oranges my poor bunny was a big orange and when I went to check on my dog believe it or not but SHE HAD A HIDEOUS BLONDE WIG ON WITH A BAD SPRAY TAN I tried to take the wig off of her but she built a wall every time I tried to touch her so because of this horrible experience this app will be deleted I hope you’re happy that you ruined my wonderful pets","date":"2020-07-08T17:16:02Z","rating":1,"title":"Oranges EVERYWERE","userName":"i miss my pet"}},{"id":"6173020918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"when I tried to get the app it took 20 hours to download 😥😥 when i opened it 50,000,000 cockâroaches flew at me 🦗they had guns!!! they tried to make me give the app 5 stars 😡🔫 while trying to kill me!!!!!! thankfully I had some of trumps orange 🍊 skin that was shed on me during a rally 😌😼 but then!!! 🍊 they tried to eat the precious skin 😭😭 I threw it outside and they followed 😗✌️✨😼 now I am safe but this app only gets one star 😡I HATE roaches","date":"2020-07-08T17:07:38Z","rating":1,"title":"😥😥😥","userName":"trüm pis mäd waâck"}},{"id":"6173019477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Bad Graphic first off. Feels like the app was made 20 years ago. \nSpreads hatred against people who aren’t white, male, straight and rich (aka the entire premise of the Trump campaign) \nFinally, makes people feel unsafe. The spread of the Trump campaign and his ideas makes groups of people feel unsafe because if he wins the presidency, he will spread his male/white supremacist ideals causing harms to those of minority groups.","date":"2020-07-08T17:07:10Z","rating":1,"title":"Spreads hatred, makes people unsafe, bad graphics","userName":"lauhowardren"}},{"id":"6173014480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"No wonder this app only has 2 stars in rating.

I think there was a glitch or malfunction because the first image to appear was horrific! It was a mix of momo and a chupacabras. Please if you are willingly going to download this app, you must have EXTREME precautions. I have an appointment with my eye doctor this Saturday to see if there is any hope for my vision. I don’t recommend this for anyone, and remember gen z will win.","date":"2020-07-08T16:51:43Z","rating":1,"title":"😕","userName":"BANES285"}},{"id":"6172936278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded it to help fight these libs ❄️ but it went into my bank information and emptied my account and idk what happened but someone changed all my social media passwords.
