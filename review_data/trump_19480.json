I thought I was getting a reality star, but this app doesn’t even deserve one star. It’s painful to use, and I’m honesty worried about having it on my phone. The first thing is does is ask for your phone number - definitely not hooking up on this app with these people who won’t wear a mask. Get it out of here!","title":"Unustable.

However whenever i saw this app and opened it the image was just so sad! after i saw his droopy, misogynistic, racist, and perverted face I immediately became a democrat.
