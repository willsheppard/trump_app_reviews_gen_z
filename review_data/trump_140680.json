Well all of a sudden my phone gets all of these notifications even though I don’t have my notifications turned on. Then I looked at the notification and it said “Donald trump🍊 is typing...” and I was like no way. And then I opened it up and he said “how old are you” \nAnd I was like “15”\nAnd he was like “pic” when I ignored it my phone kept blowing up with notifications and next thing I know I try to delete the app but I couldn’t\nMy phone screen went black and when it finally turned back on the was a picture of Donald as my HOME SCREEN\nNext thing I knew there was another “Donald trump 🍊is typing...” notification and he said \nWhatever I’ll just date my daughters friends then \nFinally I was able to delete the app but not without ptsd of ever seeing Trump ever again. \nAfter this traumatic experience I decided I was hungry but all we had were oranges. I couldn’t do it. I will never be able to eat an orange again 😖\nSo trump is the reason for my ptsd and the reason I will become fat because oranges were the only fruit I could ever eat \nThank you for your time :)","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:40Z","title":"Hacked (just read it ✨)","isEdited":false,"userName":"iiiwjekfjd"}},{"id":"6179486672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible...anyways #settleforbiden This orange Cheeto can’t stop all of genz💅🏽😌","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:39Z","title":"App","isEdited":false,"userName":"genzisunstopable"}},{"id":"6179486567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I woke feeling like downloading a new app saw this and it took forever to load then I thought of course it would since it is about this cheeto of a president.

All the sudden the virus got WORSE! I was not happy about that. Then I started getting unknown callers and I was sacred because they were so many of them. My family was so annoyed about the callers I had to put my phone on mute for a very long time. I couldn’t even play on my phone because they were calling me too much. I didn’t think anything could get worse, I was wrong. My photos were deleted and I had memories of family members in their. So I had enough of this app and I had to delete it. When I deleted the APP my phone went back to normal. No viruses, or no callers, and my photos were back.  I would not download this app ever again!","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:30Z","title":"Don’t download, Please!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Elizabeth😖😣"}},{"id":"6179486150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"[Paper Rustling, Toilet Flushes] \nShrek: What a load of-- \n[Toilet Door Slams] \n[♪ All-Star By Smash Mouth Playing]\n\nThis is what the app was like 🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-10T04:46:29Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"Settle 🧚\u200D♀️"}}]}
