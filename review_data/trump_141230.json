But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: \"This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.\" Admittedly, he had shoes on.\n\n𝐁𝐔𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐓 '𝐒 𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐍 𝐖𝐎𝐑𝐒𝐄 . 😡\n\nThe post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's \"Tell us about us\" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said \"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in 𝓅ℯ𝒶𝒸ℯ ✨\n\n𝚇𝚘𝚡𝚘 𝚕𝚞𝚟 😍😍😍😍🥺🥺🥺🥺😳😳😳😳"}},{"id":"6179442684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"farooq535","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The worst ever","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:58Z","review":"This is the worst ever I’ve ever used"}},{"id":"6179442431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trash like trump ❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:53Z","review":"You want to delete tik tok.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! 😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:44Z","review":"Just a warning for all my good Republicans out there- DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! First of all, it took SEVERAL HOURS to download onto my phone. This is absolutely RIDICULOUS!! I’ll have ALL OF YOU know that I have the most FAST and ADVANCED cellular device MONEY CAN BUY. I know that MY AMAZING PRESIDENT wouldn’t allow such a SLOW, SLUGGISH, and DISRESPECTFUL app be associated with his WONDERFUL and AWE INSPIRING NAME AND IMAGE. This has to be the CHINESE interfering with this app since DONALD TRUMP would NEVER let a piece of trash like this be created with his HUMONGOUS BRAIN and KNOWLEDGE of coding and technology. Additionally, when the app finally loaded, I was asked to log in. The app DEMANDED that I give all of my PERSONAL INFORMATION and knowing something seeming suspicious, I did not allow it. But then, AGAINST MY WILL, the app STOLE all of my PERSONAL INFO without my PERMISSION!!!! I am absolutely DISGUSTED and ENRAGED!!!!!! also my fish died 😢😢😢😩😩😩😩"}},{"id":"6179441974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump is my husband","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Read it it’s worth it boo","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:44Z","review":"Once I got this app I was so excited to support the leader and buy his merch and it kept crashing and once it stopped crashing it wouldn’t let me sign up how sad that I can’t support the best leader of all  😔"}},{"id":"6179441492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tuxedofaiiry","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"10/10 would not recommend","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:35Z","review":"Just like other trump supporters I tried to download this app and unfortunately it took my phone a week to download. After reading numerous reviews on this app I thought to myself these must be internet troll whom are trolling the app reviews , certainly this app must work right ? Unfortunately I was proved wrong when I attempted to download the app which took a week and didn’t allow me to leave the app while downloading. This makes me very angered because if our president can’t keep his app great how will he keep America great ?"}},{"id":"6179441483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rickinitya","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"cheesus","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:35Z","review":"terrible."}},{"id":"6179441353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"OhnoMaddie","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💓","date":"2020-07-10T04:31:33Z","review":"you guys tried your best!!!🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥳✨💕never do it again🥰🧚🏻\u200D♀️🦋🌸"}}]}
