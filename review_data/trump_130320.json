this so I could look at Cheeto puff recipes🥵 but ended up with some orange🍊 with crusty noodles 🍜ontop🤮\n\nsome people think that you can be anything if you just belive✨🧚🏻💕 they wanted to be an ommpa lompa😍🥰💓\n\nyou may wonder why this is such a trash app well heres why: \n\n1. everytime i got off of the app i kept seeing some man outside my window. i caught a glimpse and they were holding a sign that said, “why you download app. you dead now.” i coukdnt belive what I saw. unbeliveable, apparently if you download someone will track you down.\n\n2. ruined food incuding, cheese, pasta, Cheetos, crossaints, and oranges. i know i already said some of these but seriously. discusting, i actually had to pour milk into my eyes because they burnt.\n\n3. everytime i got on or off the app i felt like some chhild predator was near by, also a racist bembo. i dont know why but i think it has to do with the freak on the front page, cnat belive i actally thought that this app would be usefull. \n\nthose are just three things wrong theres many more but i cant possibly finish some by how long the paragraph would be. \n\nSkin?: wet Cheeto puff \n\nHair?: greased pasta \n\nHotel?: Trivigo \n\nSome reactions told by emojis: 😐😬😶🤢🤮\n\nfamily says: “this is terrible, my daughter saw the first page and immdently felt pain. she passed out and told us that she felt violated. we took her to the doctor and they told us to take her to therapy. but she began staying mute, and woukdnt talk. everytiime we brought the app up she would start crying. after finally finding the right therpist she told us that she felt like she experinced rape vertually. sayiing that the man on the front cover raped her in her mind because of how discusting he looked. also because her freinds had told her of the mans history. her friends downloaded the app and the EXACT thing happened to them, something about this app is cursed. dont download unless youd like to be emotionally unstable.” - local mom \n\nthis app should be taken down, periodt💅","rating":1,"title":"crusty musty🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:38Z","userName":"Sara

Just wow. This app is RIDICULOUS. I asked amazon Alexa what app would be best to keep up with the presidential elections and she suggested this one. Right after she said the word “Trump” she began to speak Italian and made the lights in my room turn red.  It was almost as if Alexa had started the Trump purge. After that happened, I signed into the app only to find that it consisted of a monkey like man talking about politics. Woah! What is this? Something from Dr.Seuss? Unbelievable. Even my dog ran away after hearing the word Republican.","rating":1,"title":"Trump purge","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:35Z","userName":"Simbatherepublican"}},{"id":"6174717847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Hi🖐I'm👁Kim💄Kardashian🤩West👸I'm👁Gonna😈Cry😭My👆Diamond💎Earring💫You😎Don't🚫Think🤯I👁Feel😐Bad😡I👁Feel😐Sad😞I👁Hate😠My👆Sisters👭I👁Never❌","rating":1,"title":"it’s just a no for me.","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:21Z","userName":"chile anyways 🥰✨🥳"}},{"id":"6174717744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is disgusting and ewwwwww this app is so bad it made me poop out a frog and turtle! what do i do now? my Starbucks drink is gone and so is my sanity. only download for bad luck","rating":1,"title":"ewwww","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:19Z","userName":"akbdkanfbjaxnkaka"}},{"id":"6174717192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted information on the ban of tik tok but then my phone stopped working and then I restarted it and the next thing you know, my phone screen had trump and all my apps were changed to look like trumps face. I went to my emails and they were all deleted and it was flooded with Trump emails, apparently he had a dinner with the Russian President and he hooked up with a woman named Anya and sent a doc to the president that basically said to keep it on the low low. My camera roll was pictures of a red background and some of them had MAGA. All of my Instagram pictures had TRUMP 2020 on it and it ruined my page. I opened my fridge and there was a Trump 2020 hat on my lasagna leftovers and I moved it and someone printed MAGA on my leftovers. I looked around and I saw Trump 2020 stickers all over my wall. Trump himself came to my house and said if I don’t decorate it more, he was going to deport me back to China but I wasn’t from China. He said he didn’t care because he was done with the Kung Flu people. I’m now on a plane, to Shanghai, hope it was worth sending me back you orange Cheeto🖕-1/73838 not recommended","rating":1,"title":"Invasion of privacy","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:09Z","userName":"hanuelyi"}}]}
