People who want to watch this orange man can go on the news. We don’t wanna see a app filled with him. To be completely honest he IS NOT my president it’s a free country and we should not be controlled by someone who doesn’t care. So yes I have this review because better apps can replace it.","title":"✨spam✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"🌊Nani🌊"}},{"id":"6177059921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:00:54Z","review":"I wanted to download this to see why I should vote for him , when I opened the app it was glitchy and it ran SOOOO slow I sat there for 30+ minutes waiting for it to load & then it crashed after 30 minutes don’t download the app 😾 DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME so it’s gets 0/5 but I have to put a 1 star","title":"It’s horrible 😢","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ronda 🤡💛"}},{"id":"6177057440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:00:13Z","review":"Here I thought this would help see what’s going on for the campaigns but no the app is terrible. It’s hard to find information, annoying to navigate, and overall just a total let down.
