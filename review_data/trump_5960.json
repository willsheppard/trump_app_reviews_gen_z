I immediately noticed spam mail in my email account, spam calls, and spam notifications after I downloaded the app. I genuinely believe that this app could ruin my phone or other people phones. I would not recommend this app to anyone with a phone they would like to keep. Also immediately after I deleted the app, all of the spam mail and notifications where completely gone and off my phone. This app should be deleted from the Apple App Store.","title":"This is spam","userName":"Savior from spam","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:07:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176482298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"YA HEARD THE TITLE.

The app seemed to have been hacked. There was misspelling, letters in random places, and little clown stickers popping in and out of the screen. I was so disappointed. This year I just turned 18 and I was really looking forward to voting for the one and only Donald Trump and learning more about how to make sure the republicans win again this year. Sadly I can’t do much on this app. You should probably check your system, because if you’re being hacked, a couple misspelt words isn’t all the hackers will do...","title":"Sus","userName":"emmabrown😹","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:22:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176177298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so it started off a sunny morning i decided to download the app😼i waited about 5 hours for the app to download. it was off to a terrible start but i waited just to see the annoying orange. i then proceed to open the app and my screen turns off. i try to turn my phone off but it doesn’t work. it seems too have been locked or something so i take my phone to apple and they manage to turn it on and tell me i have spam apps on my phone (this app). so i proceed to delete it and i have lived a better life till this day 😻","title":"Absolutely atrocious","userName":"cutie w a 🍑","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:58:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176141615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. I downloaded this app to gain hope for the future again, but it just kicks me off of it because I make less than $50,000 a year and I’m a woman of color. Don’t even get me started on how long I took to download. 153 attempts and 3 days? An example of unprofessional actions. I expected better from the developer, and instead of getting information I get emails telling me that I’m fat, ugly, lonely, and will never be loved by anyone. My dogs sanity was compromised because of the noise coming from the opening page.","title":"HIGE DISAPPOINTMENT","userName":"deepedtoes","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:47:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176079179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"VERY VERY BAD APP, took 231 weeks to download. after it downloaded i got an email saying that trump wanted my address to make a surprise visit. i emailed back saying no, he then explained since i downloaded the app they automatically got all of my information including my email, phone number, social security number, address, blood type, bestfriends diary from 2014, my sisters pet chamaeleon’s dads name, & everything else. i was so scared. three days later trump showed up to my house & brutally murdered my pet mouse.... all because i downloaded his app..
