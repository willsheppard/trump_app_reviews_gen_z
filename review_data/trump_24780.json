There was this weird man who had the WORST skin, straight up 🟠Cheeto Puff lookin’ man. His hair looked like dead corn🌽, and I’ve never seen such dead eyes in my life.☠️ Overall, I do not recommend this app.👎"}},{"id":"6172420271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"JUST HORRIBLE ! ALWAYS CRASHING","date":"2020-07-08T14:14:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"-G------","review":"Where do I even begin!? This app is terrible! It has horrible graphics, bad coding, and it is always crashing. There’s not informative information on the app at all. Why is this even an app!? It definitely needs to be changed and removed. The App Store needs to be made great again!"}},{"id":"6172388429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It’s unfair","date":"2020-07-08T14:05:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Isabella Berge","review":"I have been hearing that they might ban TikTok from the U.S. just because China basically made it or something like that. It is the only platform that makes people have fun. Musically is gone, vine is gone. What now are we just gonna use Instagram like it’s TikTok? I don’t like that idea at all that’s why I’m leaving a 1 star review"}},{"id":"6172341391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Glitching 😔","date":"2020-07-08T13:53:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yeezyhamburger","review":"All-in-all, a terrible app. The amount of texts I get are ASTRONOMICAL, to say the least. It looks desperate to me👀. Any-who, the app started glitching sporadically and despite my efforts, the app is just poorly made, poorly developed, and poorly run. Please do not get this app as my phone has permanent damage due to the glitching. This reflects poorly on you Mr. Trump. Do better."}},{"id":"6172332782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible!","date":"2020-07-08T13:50:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"searchcentral","review":"Do not download this app! It is absolutely horrible! First it had the audacity to ask to give me notifications! Like... What??? Then they ask for my phone number! What an envision of privacy. And it gets worse, it then informs the user that it was paid for by DONALD TRUMP? Are you kidding? I’d give it negative ten stars for that alone!"}},{"id":"6172326767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible","date":"2020-07-08T13:49:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KeyonteA.","review":"The quality of the app icon is very upsetting to my home screen the colors are just ugly and simply treacherous let me not get on the naming I just don’t like the letters and if your reading this you are wasting your time just like trump waisted four years but anyways make sure your social distancing"}},{"id":"6172275251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do not get this app it will destroy your phone","date":"2020-07-08T13:34:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"haveagr8tday","review":"When I opened the app it told me I joined a cult and that I was no longer allowed to support anyone other then white people.
