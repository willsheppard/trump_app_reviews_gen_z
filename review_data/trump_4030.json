I’m very disappointed in this app and do not recommend to those who are prone to heart attacks or heart diseases and you may need to wash your eyes with bleach after looking at this mess who’s hairs half detached from his head. Actually bleach won’t cut it; why don’t you just take your eyeballs out, thank me later. Once again I’m very disappointed and did not like how the app insulted me, I’ve a very insecure and sensitive person; oh wait just like our president, and this app was the final straw.","date":"2020-07-08T23:08:31Z","userName":"Mi22gymnast"}},{"id":"6173915948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Honestly the worst app i’ve ever used","review":"if I could read this app zero stars I honestly would there’s nothing that I have to say about it I opened the app and automatically I saw something that scared me so bad I was put in the ER for six days 🙃Apparently this man’s name is Donald Trump I would never recommend him to be seen ever I met him in person once after downloading this app and I recognized him immediately due to the post traumatic stress disorder and he spit on me tied me up and threw me in the river I narrowly escaped with my life I end up finding out he is having a rally right outside my home and they eventually flood in my house and then set it on fire while chanting witch craft spells 0/10😒","date":"2020-07-08T22:16:45Z","userName":"AnUpsetMother"}},{"id":"6173819060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"This app is the worst! You should NEVER get it. It took 69 years to download and as soon as it downloaded it automatically sent all of my credit card info and my social security number to trump. As soon as I opened the app some kind of gas came out of my phone that attracted millions of Murder Hornets that were all infected with the coronavirus and were not wearing masks and it gave me and my whole state the virus and stung me 696,969,696 times. And also when I clicked the “cancel” button while trying to sign in, it put a nasty virus on my phone called the trump virus and I had to get a new phone. The app is just so horrible and I do not recommend it at all whatsoever.","date":"2020-07-08T21:40:28Z","userName":"whawda moccashin"}},{"id":"6173802465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app is trash✨🍊","review":"so it took about 3 weeks for this app to download. i couldnt wait to use this app because i wanted to learn all about MY president😌i just don’t understand why people dont like him. whats not to like?😯 so i was on the app after 3 weeks of downloading and i clicked on a link in the app and it was a picture of trump and his tiny d- and i couldnt believe my eyes. so now i am legally blind and suffering. this orange buffoon can not be president. anyone but trump 2020✨✨dont download the app unless you want to be physically and mentally scarred😔 i still cant sleep at night sometimes. i have to go to a therapist every other day. i will be suing very soon✨✨🇪🇨🇪🇨 #blackandbrownlivesmatter","date":"2020-07-08T21:34:01Z","userName":"#blackandbrownlivesmatter🇪🇨"}},{"id":"6173781588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I AM HORRIFIED","review":"dear all, i am just as DISAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED as you are. if you are thinking of downloading this app, DONT. I cannot put into words how TERRIBLE AND PAINFUL this app has made my life. As the app was downloading on my phone, it erased EVERYTHING. all previous apps that i downloaded were GONE. it had even changed my wall papers to a picture of our amazing president. Then, it proceeded to take over my entire phone. My brand new iphone was starting to shake and buzz. i was terrified by its behavior. my phone then started to change appearance and turned into a giant pipe bomb. It ended up exploding my entire family. All that remained in my home is the trump flag in my living room. ZERO STARS. WORST APP IM THE WORLD DO NOT RECOMMEND.","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:09Z","userName":"noble.noodle"}},{"id":"6173689623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE!!!🍊✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","review":"i came on here to add detail to my fat cheeto puff trumptydumpty shrine and the app immediately closed in my face. when i opened again a bunch of tiny orange oompa loompas started chasing my throughout the house and yelling “vote trump”. i was extremely scared but ended up stomping on all of them. then my phone turned orange and roundish and a few seconds later ended up being an orange! i am now typing this on my orange and am in need of a new phone! but WAIT THATS NOT ALL. my house immediately started being filled with cheetos ,overflowing rooms. i tried to swim through them all but i realized i can’t swim. sadly i have passed away! do not recommend this app!!🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨ will take ur life!!✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T20:52:26Z","userName":"yagurllxx"}},{"id":"6173653117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Im DYING 💀🤮🤒🦠💒🇨🇳✝️🌎👩🏼💀","review":"after downloading this app I was contacted with corona virus.

It took like an hour to download, so I was waiting forever. Then once I finally got on the app it was so slow and glitched out. When I got to the help line to call, they were so rude!!! They called me slow and just terrible unspeakable names. They didn’t even fix the problem. So now it is still glitching. Maybe it needs a completely different software. It’s crazy how bad this app is. I figured our racist Oompa Loompa president would’ve at least been able to make a proper app that actually works,,but no he even messes that up!! All I can say is to not even try to download it. 0/10, would NOT recommend!","date":"2020-07-08T19:23:29Z","userName":"Jessica123456abcd"}},{"id":"6173367905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER MADE!!!!😡😡😡😡","review":"It told me to put my phone number down and then when I did it got me login and after that a random person start calling me I just ignored it and then it kept going off my phone God million missed calls I think they’re trying to use your phone numbers to give desperate people your phone number do not download this app I repeat do not download this app I repeat do not download this app and also when the Colleen stop I got a dozen text messages 😡😡😡😡😤 we tried to stop and deleted it but my phone kept coming off I think it’s a scandal do not trust Donald Trump ever again he’s trying to destroy I truster something don’t download this app","date":"2020-07-08T19:00:28Z","userName":"lolcoolskyhi"}}]}
