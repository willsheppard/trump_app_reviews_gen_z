offensive","userName":"Sierra Sonko","review":"It’s absolutely the most racist, ugly, disgusting, and it honestly makes me nauseous how do I know Donald Duck won’t steal my money or my mom or rape my sister idk, it should be a profanity to say make America great again because back than there were in slaved people... grrrr and I do not support tbh the Karen’s are one starting this app so that means something... I would rate this zero stars if I could but I can’t. How am I supposed to help trump win with this app any way silly willys or small willys like trump. MISS. Donald Trump is a lying, stealing coward that thinks big of himself but he’s actually very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very veeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry small just like ur willy and ur flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat ass, and he’s a butthole face he probably rapes his son baron trump because he’s a time traveler.
