It has been growing since. My entire left leg is orange now. I’ve also noticed that the more orange I’ve become, the more racist and sexist I am becoming. Can somebody please tell me how to remedy this, I don’t want to run for president and drive our nation into the ground like this buffoon already has. I think he might be using this app to make clones of himself to loophole the 2 term rule in order to establish is dictatorship. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!","userName":"Trump Clone 345","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176895920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:17:04Z","rating":1,"title":"awful glitch","review":"After downloading this app my phone randomly started to shut down. I’d open the back and my screen would go black. I genuinely wanted to get this app so I could keep in touch with Trump❤️. I respect him so much❤️. He’s everything I’ve wanted in a president and his app being this awful disheartened me. Please remove this app from the store. It’s awful and doesn’t portray his campaign right. There are other ways to show your support and this app is not it.","userName":"_miguellpereira","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176791941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:49:41Z","rating":1,"title":"This app almost killed me 😒😒🤪🤪😌😌✋✋","review":"This app took 2 years to download and once it did... my life would be changed forever. After opening the app a notification popped up on the screen stating that I had 1 week to live if I didn’t vote for Donny 😣😣 this had me very upset but, after a long walk with my pet giraffe down by the bay I realized I had lived a good life and it was time I give it up for a good cause so, I have 2 days left and I think I’m gonna eat beans for breakfast tomorrow 😎","userName":"Bye this is fun so play it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176780216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:46:36Z","rating":1,"title":"A DANGER TO SOCIETY","review":"I got this app to support our amazing president 😌. Although it came to my attention, when I opened the app I got sent to another website. The website had a list of missions for the space station, but they were not normal and I was afraid 😿. This Cheeto’s website sent me to his top secret assignments 😹. Yet, it was all fun and games until I saw what I did. Trump in his alien form 😱😱. He has a plan to bring his alien creatures to our Earth and destroy us all. Don’t vote 2020 😖 unless you wanna die of course 😌.","userName":"person34567745","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176672251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:18:08Z","rating":1,"title":"This app killed my brother😖🌚😏","review":"So I downloaded the app & started to browse around in it then all of a sudden I get a call tellin me to come downstairs because something horrible has happened to my brother I already knew it had something to do with the app😖🤘🏽 so I came downstairs to my brother laying on the floor gasping for air I tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me😾aghast I help my head down in sorrow knowing there was nothing else I could’ve done to save him #RIPbarthalemule #RIPbigbart","userName":"dabaddiebokirt","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176656666","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:14:02Z","rating":1,"title":"All Apps Matter!","review":"I downloaded the apps in hope it would free me from my sins, and make me 🧚smart🧚🏼\u200D♀️. But oh, was I wrong. It took 12 WEEKS to download. And it still GLITCHES! It can’t help a poor, liberal, college student, then i don’t think it can help you.I just think that if you are getting an app, you should make sure it’s a good one. Like subway surfers, or ninja fruit slice -the game.

It also appears that the app does not include a feet pics gallery for Trump which a friend told me was available. But even then I still wouldn’t give this app 1 star..I’m giving it 1 star because every 3 seconds an ad pops up for penis enlargement pills.","userName":"Andrew19876","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176094083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:32:32Z","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting.","review":"This app was horrific and just so impossibly horrid. Not only would it crash after 20 seconds of opening it, the ads were unbearable. Definitely would not recommend downloading, just a waste of time and storage space. I also noticed it starting deleting pictures from my camera roll? I had a little over 1000 and now I have 982. Why would the app even do that? Once again, don’t download, it isn’t worth it.","userName":"Foxi Star","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175897804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:28:38Z","rating":1,"title":"Oh Lawdy","review":"Well besides the fact that it took a FULL DAY to download, once i opened it, it told my girlfriend that i cheated on her and we started arguing. It got to the point where it would start notifying us about how we should get physical and “throw down” well we did and it got pretty crazy. apparently people were placing bets on us! She won because the app gave her ideas on what to do so it also condones cheating! I still don’t understand where the politics come into play 🥴🥰👁👄👁🥳🤪","userName":"T_lover88green","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175887208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:24:59Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"I opened the app and I made a huge mistake I realized trump is a rapist and so is his bestie so whoever downloaded this app supports a rapist and also my phone restarted immediately because she’s against rapist’s and then the app deleted by itself and shortly after the worst thing happened  Kanye west is running for president you know what that means he supports a rapist also like everyone who still has this app ewww disgusting 🤮🤮🤮 I couldn’t rate it this app 0 stars so it made me rate it 1 🙄🙄end of review","userName":"THATBITCHJULIANA😘","isEdited":false}}]}
