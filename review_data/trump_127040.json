I kept trying to click it, but nothing happened, but then my phone shut completely off. This has never happened before and my phone is fairly new. Once my phone turned on again, all my apps were glitchy and everything was so laggy. Not even my texts would send. This app is terrible, it has some sort of virus once you download it. Unless you want a virus, I recommend downloading it."}},{"id":"6177985761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Tictok","date":"2020-07-09T19:39:22Z","userName":"appleand onozhshycnaizo","review":"This app is horrible just like his personality you little Orange ass"}},{"id":"6177985012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨Trash✨","date":"2020-07-09T19:39:07Z","userName":"trumps psy neck","review":"1.)First of all you had ur face when I opened the app you know how scary that was? \nThere was no need to scare me like that..\n2.)

Of course I was in favor of the initial message, but out of nowhere a group of headless power rangers were holding the flaming body of our beloved Donald. I was screaming to let him go but they preceded. They set him in the middle of the Karen circle and joined hands with the Karen’s shouting “kill the fish!” Of course at this moment I quickly turned to look at my fish who was sunbathing on the sand of his tank, only to see him shortly after levitate and float above his pool! Immediately he was pushed under the water and began suffocating!!! I tried to move to help him, but as soon as I jumped off my bed, a group of armadillos rushed through my door and held me down. I was able to break one of my arms free and delete the app, but sadly my fish was dead. -1020393474929/10 recommended DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! Also, it took FIVE WEEKS to download. Do not download or  You will have a similar experience."}},{"id":"6177981899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"f u","date":"2020-07-09T19:38:10Z","userName":"gilkmonabaj172826","review":"as a proud member of gen z im here to say f this app and the cheeto president🥳"}},{"id":"6177981626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No","date":"2020-07-09T19:38:04Z","userName":"barron trunk","review":"ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃᵗⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃʸ."}},{"id":"6177981120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:53Z","userName":"📯👅📯","review":"i🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫"}},{"id":"6177980287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏾trump is bad🧚🏾","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:37Z","userName":"Liv22347","review":"It🧚🏾🍊took🍊 🧚🏾🍊the 🧚🏾🍊app 🍊🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊whole 🧚🏾🍊month 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊download 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊took 🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊big 🧚🏾🍊chunk 🧚🏾🍊of 🧚🏾🍊my 🧚🏾🍊data 🧚🏾🍊and space 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊keeps 🧚🏾🍊crashing 🧚🏾🍊my 🧚🏾🍊phone 🧚🏾🍊whenever🧚🏾🍊 I 🧚🏾🍊try 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊get 🧚🏾🍊on 🧚🏾🍊TikTok 🧚🏾🍊other 🧚🏾🍊game 🧚🏾🍊or 🧚🏾🍊app 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊takes 🧚🏾🍊me 🧚🏾🍊off 🧚🏾🍊and turned 🧚🏾🍊my 🧚🏾🍊phone🧚🏾🍊 off 🧚🏾🍊I 🍊🧚🏾🍊had 🧚🏾\u200D♂️🍊to 🧚🏾🍊delete 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊the 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊app 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊and 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊it 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊still🧚🏾\u200D♀️ 🍊wasn’t🧚🏾\u200D♀️ 🍊working 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊so 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊I 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊got 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊a 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊new 🧚🏾\u200D♀️🍊phone 🧚🏾🍊this 🧚🏾🍊is 🧚🏾🍊why 🧚🏾🍊am 🧚🏾🍊writing 🧚🏾🍊this 🧚🏾🍊review 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊think 🧚🏾🍊Trump 🧚🏾🍊is 🧚🏾🍊an 🧚🏾🍊orange 🍊but 🧚🏾🍊that’s 🧚🏾🍊disrespectful 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊oranges 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊don’t 🧚🏾🍊like 🧚🏾🍊him 🧚🏾🍊he’s 🍊dirty 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊think 🧚🏾🍊he 🧚🏾stinks🧚🏾 🍊I 🧚🏾🍊don’t 🧚🏾like🍊 🧚🏾🍊him 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊he’s 🧚🏾🍊racist 🍊it 🧚🏾🍊kept 🧚🏾🍊telling 🧚🏾🍊me 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊go 🧚🏾🍊shoot 🧚🏾🍊the 🧚🏾🍊black 🧚🏾🍊people 🧚🏾🍊but 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊am 🧚🏾🍊black 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊told🧚🏾🍊 me 🍊that 🧚🏾🍊if 🧚🏾🍊you’re 🧚🏾🍊Mexican 🧚🏾🍊you 🧚🏾🍊got 🍊to 🧚🏾🍊go 🧚🏾🍊back 🧚🏾🍊home 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊don’t 🧚🏾🍊like 🧚🏾🍊Donald🍊 🧚🏾Trump🍊 🧚🏾he’s🧚🏾 🍊a 🧚🏾🍊bad guy 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊he 🧚🏾🍊said🧚🏾 🍊Joe 🧚🏾🍊Biden 🧚🏾🍊is 🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊bad 🧚🏾🍊guy 🧚🏾🍊on 🧚🏾🍊the 🧚🏾🍊app and 🧚🏾🍊then 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊told 🧚🏾🍊me 🧚🏾🍊that 🧚🏾🍊if 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊am 🧚🏾🍊black 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊need 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊go 🍊jump 🧚🏾🍊off 🧚🏾🍊of 🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊building 🧚🏾🍊Trump 🍊🧚🏾wants🧚🏾 🍊me 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊harm 🧚🏾🍊myself because 🧚🏾🍊I’m 🧚🏾🍊not 🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊white 🧚🏾🥛person 🍊🧚🏾Trump 🧚🏾🍊is 🧚🏾bad 🧚🏾🍊he 🧚🏾🍊said 🍊🧚🏾go 🧚🏾🍊back 🧚🏾🍊home🧚🏾 🍊he 🧚🏾🍊said🧚🏾🍊 that African🧚🏾🍊-🧚🏾🍊Americans 🧚🏾🍊are 🧚🏾🍊unemployed 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊that’s🧚🏾🍊 all🧚🏾🍊 I 🧚🏾🍊ever 🧚🏾🍊going 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊be 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊took a 🧚🏾🍊whole 🧚🏾🍊month 🧚🏾🍊for 🧚🏾🍊the 🧚🏾🍊app 🧚🏾🍊to 🍊🧚🏾download 🧚🏾🍊and 🧚🏾🍊then 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊took 🍊🧚🏾another 🧚🏾🍊month 🧚🏾🍊for 🧚🏾🍊me 🧚🏾🍊to 🧚🏾🍊be able🧚🏾 🍊to 🧚🏾🍊take 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊off 🧚🏾🍊my 🧚🏾🍊phone 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊kept 🧚🏾🍊texting 🧚🏾🍊me 🧚🏾🍊after 🍊🧚🏾I 🧚🏾🍊said 🧚🏾🍊stop 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊don’t🧚🏾 🍊like 🧚🏾🍊it 🧚🏾🍊so 🧚🏾🍊I 🧚🏾🍊got🍊 🧚🏾🍊a 🧚🏾🍊new 🧚🏾🍊phone🧚🏾🍊 and 🧚🏾🤮that’s🧚🏾🍊 why 🧚🏾🍊I’m 🧚🏾🍊writing 🧚🏾🍊this\n Review 🧚🏾🍊on 🧚🏾🍊my 🧚🏾🍊new 🧚🏾🍊phone 🧚🏾🍊thank 🧚🏾🍊you.........🧚🏾✨🌟🤮🤢🍊🍊🍊🍊🧚🏾✨🌟✨"}},{"id":"6177980135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Go follow my tik tok @_l_o_g_a_n_","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:34Z","userName":"13&492010$346","review":"Keep tik tok aliveeeee"}}]}
