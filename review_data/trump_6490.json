It’s hard to tell if his tweets are real or fake, so I found this app. I was going OK, until I tried to One of his rallies, and then my phone started going slow. I tried to exit out of the app to restart my phone, and to my surprise, MY WALLPAPER WAS ORANGE???? It won’t let me change it back, and I just bought this phone. 10/10 would not recommend. Plus it’s nearly impossible to get tickets to his rallies, they get taken up by youngsters so fast!!!","title":"MY WALLPAPER IS ORANGE AND I CANT CHANGE IT BACK","userName":"aaaaalibraaaaps","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175024417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:15:24Z","rating":1,"review":"I just don’t wanna play the Xbox was the way I was just finished my hw today I wanna was play with my dad last summer so we have a good job on my way home from work today omg omg 😳 was gonna you wanna was the day I was just finished and my mom didn’t get a lot done last time you got me a ride to my dad I was gonna was your time to do this hw is my dad I just wanna is a day to get home and I have some fun with my family I don’t have much fun for me tonight and then I’ll be home 🏡 was that I was gonna we got home from the pool 🏊 I have a lot of stuff.","title":"HoRrIBle 🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼","userName":"taketwitterawayfromtrump","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174946596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:50:46Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded in my life. Ever since I got it, my phone has been acting glitchy and weird. The battery drains crazily fast, my other apps stopped working, my phone randomly shuts off, and it takes up so much data. Not to mention the app itself runs super slow and has so many bugs. I strongly suggest that whoever made this app deletes it because this is utter trash. The design is also incredibly ugly and unappealing, and the layout is so consuming to navigate. 11/10 would not recommend.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"kshsjdjbsvsudk","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174914776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:41:01Z","rating":1,"review":"My name is Genz and never in my 16 years of living have I ever had such a bad experience with an idiotic app!! This app needs to come back to where it came from. Can I talk to the manager of this company? It seems to me that a bunch irresponsible,lazy, unprofessional boomers think that they deserve authority. I mean it’s against my religion to kill people solely because of their skin color and it’s not okay in the eyes of god. Therefore I believe that all this “corona is hoax” is hoax. It’s my body my choice, I can wear a mask to stores even if its not required. I will be in contact with your ceo very soon!","title":"If Karen was GenZ","userName":"ZarahP26","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174792912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:05:12Z","rating":1,"review":"this almost gave me a heart attack . i downloaded it so that i could support daddy trump’s campaign but when i first signed i noticed the color BLUE! what’s the issue with this you ask??? well, the color BLUE is the democrats 🤢🤢🤮🤮 color!!!

I cannot believe that this kind of content is allowed on the phones of anyone! Especially 17 year-olds. I can’t believe that the man who calls himself the president stands for this app! This is absolutely outrageous. I cannot tell you how much this app has caused a downfall in the very course of my life and so many others. It is the worst thing ever to exist on this App Store and I insist it be taken down immediately. This should not be how the American government acts.","title":"No no no no no","userName":"jsidhxhchixiswhjsidhcudiie","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174538167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:50:29Z","rating":1,"review":"When I first opened the app I was met with a disgusting picture of a rotting orange supposedly called “dolad turnip” who would give a orange a name anyways? Well it was taking so long to load and when I got off my whole screen was with the same rotting orange and all my apps changed to the same picture. My phone had a virus and when I looked it up on my computer it was called a “orange virus”. I was then being sent a bunch of pics of a Cheeto which was disgusting and worst then the orange. You should never get this app it will ruin your phone!","title":"Horrible app","userName":"bleeep_bloop","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174513452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:31Z","rating":1,"review":"I’ve never been more disgusted with an app in my entire life. From its sheer audacity of asking me if I want push notifications, to the message: “keeping America great” my a**. The general design, and more specifically colors, logo, and home picture of our cheetoh-lookin’ President made me gag. Trump 2020 was such a poor app that I didn’t even take the time to place it in my nicely color-coded app screen, instead it had it’s own page where I sure hope it just sat and weeped. I’d be happy to never see this on the Apple Store ever again.","title":"do not subject yourself to this","userName":"dbbeb","isEdited":false}}]}
