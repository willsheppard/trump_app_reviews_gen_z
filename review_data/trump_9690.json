It was so bad my dog had to talk to me down. I wish that I could go back in time and not download this app so I wouldn’t have to see the lil orange soggy cheeto but unfortunately my therapist quit after only 5 minutes with me. Can’t say I blame her since I had to pour bleach in my eyes from the H O R R E N D O U S sight. I really hope that people will use detergent to wash their eyes out with instead of bleach.

I’m on my third phone at this point, the only logical explanation is downloading this god forbidden app. Every time I have tried, it takes up to an hour to download, and once opened, it crashes repeatedly. I’m not even able to be on the app for more than 3 seconds without my phone restarting. Eventually my phone just stops turning back on and I have to buy a new one. Worst app ever!","userName":"henrietta gruntle","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176059024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:21:17Z","rating":1,"title":"Not trustworthy","review":"Honestly would give it a 0/5. Upon opening the app after waiting 2 days for it to download it told me an indigenous bisexual woman that if I didn’t vote trump2020 that my uncle would be taken for a period of time. Unfortunately my uncle is a trump supporter and so when they got there he told them of his crimes and they let him be. I can’t believe they would do this to me after promising they would take him. Don’t make promises you won’t keep 😡😡","userName":"Em 🏳️\u200D🌈","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175929191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:39:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Disappointing","review":"I downloaded the app so I could get a better view and opinion of President Trump. However, This app has just made me realize how bias, prejudice, and unforgiving trump is. Also the second I downloaded it, I receive many alerts about the app messing up my phone. In addition, approximately 2 minutes after i downloaded the app, my phone started to glitch! I DO NOT RECOMMEND!! Trump supporter or not, i’m warning you that this app does more bad than good :/","userName":"Aliabunny1234","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175898143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:28:45Z","rating":1,"title":"SO AWFUL!!!😖😖","review":"I am INSANELY disappointed by this app and the creators. This app took approximately 197 hours just to DOWNLOAD!!! The content is not appealing WHATSOEVER and I find it very misogynistic and racist to be completely honest!!! I cannot believe that this country’s own president would own and advertise such an app!! Disgusted by this MONSTROSITY of an app! Racist, homophobic, and misogynistic apps need to be LEFT behind forever, not belonging in the App Store in 2020!!! Shameful and awful!! I am so embarrassed to have EVER downloaded this app!!! Do not download it!!! 😢😢😖👎","userName":"BTSienna","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175883165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:23:40Z","rating":1,"title":"Almost had to get a new phone","review":"I downloaded it and opened the app. Automatically crashed my phone. I had many attempts to no prevail until I kept getting pop ups on my home screen that takes you to random websites that seem like spam and virus threats. I’d also randomly get pictures of black screens in my photo gallery every time I crashed or got sent somewhere I didn’t want to be sent to. Do not download, 0 stars.","userName":"Caden887610","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175829340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:05:53Z","rating":1,"title":"THE WORST THING IVE EVER USED","review":"when I downloaded this app I thought that maybe I would learn a little bit about out President. but then! all I saw was propaganda about how great our country is! how does trump know? he doesn’t even know how to apply his foundation so it matches his neck. Even I can do that :(( anyway this app is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. It’s also definitely gonna mine your data which is something I think a lot of people dislike. Just a thought ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ DONT GET THIS APP","userName":"jerod scarapaducci","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175821421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:03:14Z","rating":1,"title":"KILLED MY LIZARD 😭😭😡","review":"i opened the app and IMMEDIATELY i heard banging on my front door, only to go downstairs to see the FBI KICKING DOWN MY DOOR!!!! 😡😡😡 insert the cheeto puff man 🍊 he waltzes into my foyer, looks me dead in the eyes, then points at my bearded dragon’s cage that is in the living room to the left, and instructs his boys in blue 👮\u200D♀️ to “neutralize” him, they proceeded to throw tear gas canisters at him and shoot rubber bullets directly at his head, killing him in an instant 😭😭 this dumb cheeto man proceeds to do the stanky leg in the MIDDLE OF MY LIVING ROOM OVER MY DECEASED LIZARDS CORPSE 😭😭 i am MORTIFIED, do NOT download this EVER!!!!!!","userName":"💗💖💕💞💓💘💝","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175692836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:19:23Z","rating":1,"title":"Very horrible🧚🏿\u200D♀️✨🥰💞","review":"Do not download this app. It took a whole 2 hours to download. Right after i opened the app, my phone got a virus or something and my child went missing. THEN all of my tvs turned on and started playing really inappropriate things that my missing child should not have to see. It’s been 48 hours and my child is still gone. If you don’t want your child to go missing don’t download the app, it’s not worth it!","userName":"😊Brielle😊","isEdited":false}}]}
