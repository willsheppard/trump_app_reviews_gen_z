I have been a Trump supporter since 2016. I have done absolutely everything in my power to get my fellow friends and family to vote for Trump in 2016 and now in 2020. This app provided terrible service if I might say. I am appalled by the experience I was given while using it. When I was first downloading it, why did it need so much MB for me to download this? My president shouldn’t have me wasting so much of my storage on an app. Secondly, once I opened the app, it says “Keep America Great”. I’m confused because at first his slogan was “Make America Great Again” and I’m wondering, when was it great? Don’t get me wrong, I love my president, but he is spreading “fake news”. I always used to look at President Trump as a prince in God’s kingdom, but now I’m not so sure. I also found out that he is now using the same sign as the Nazi’s used back in 1933-1938. I feel attacked because I am Jewish and he is using the same hate symbol that killed my ancestors. Thirdly, why should I have to put in my email and my phone number for this app. I feel as if it is an invasion of privacy. What if someone hacked the app and took all of my data and then threatened my children, Samantha and Brady. Speaking of children, my daughter has an app called “Tik Tok” and she learned that apparently your son, Baron, is in trouble. Is the White House not safe? I guess it is safe since President Trump hid in a bunker during the Black Lives Matter protests. Whew, golly me! I got way off topic. In conclusion, the app is terrible, I completely 100% believe no one should download it and everyone should give it a 1 star rating (iykyk). #saveBaron2020 #dontbantitkok","userName":"fluffybunnybearcat123","date":"2020-07-08T18:22:15Z","title":"100% do not recommend"}},{"id":"6173252093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is poop I’d rather eat poop 👁👅👁","userName":"Mooooosssssssssssenuts","date":"2020-07-08T18:21:52Z","title":"Poop"}},{"id":"6173251277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is disgusting. As soon as I downloaded it it started glitching and playing dance monkey on repeat, as a way to mock me I presume, as it is the worst song in the history of music. Anyway, the music got louder and louder every time it repeated until it broke my speaker AND caused me to go deaf. Not to mention the music attracted ladybugs, which my sister is deadly allergic to. One flew in her mouth, and she had to get rushed to the hospital in an attempt to save her life. She made it, but now she has to live inside a plastic bubble that has to be sprayed DAILY with ladybug repellent. The smell is awful. When i went to delete the app, it glitched yet again and started controlling all the lights, fans, televisions, you name it in my house. I haven’t slept in weeks because now the only thing that the television will play is old videos of Shane Dawson hitting on three year olds, and my bedroom light won’t stop flashing Morse code for god knows what brainwashing messages. I’ve about had it with this app and whoever designed it to attack innocent people, as to my knowledge that’s what the police do for fun rather than their own jobs.","userName":"Ella121212","date":"2020-07-08T18:21:36Z","title":"Terrible.
