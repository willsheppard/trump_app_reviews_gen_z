People of color would walk by me and I wanted to yell at them to go back to their countries! All I wanted to do is make money off of minorities. When I didn’t get exactly what I wanted I would make a scene and ask for the store manager. Worst experience of my life. I was hurting everyone around me!","rating":1,"title":"The worst!","date":"2020-07-08T20:30:06Z"}},{"id":"6173611464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BIPOC LIVES MATTER","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I heard about the president that made this country “great”. I guess I wanted to see what he used to brainwash people.  I open the app and the first words are “join us today to keep America great”. I guess You could say this app is great...just like Amerikkka is great. Now that we have reached this “peak” let’s keep it that way!
