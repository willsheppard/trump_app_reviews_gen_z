Worst images ever are shown on this app including inappropriate ones. This app gives children nightmares and adults.

It hasn’t been updating and seeks to have a new platform. I had to delete it after just 5 days because of how inaccurate the timing and updates were. Clearly the app was constructed to release info and fails to do so...","userName":"Tina Roshannia"}},{"id":"6177446372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:51:12Z","title":"I don’t understand?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Every time I click on to the app it immediately kicks me out.
