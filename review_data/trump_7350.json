Every minute there is a new ads that pops up and each ad is about 30 seconds long if you are lucky bc most of the ads are 50 seconds long. I really did think he was a great man turn out his motto   “Make America great again” doesn’t include ads. 😔smh. But for real don’t download this app unless you have patience with the ads.","rating":1,"title":"100% don’t recommend","userName":"yanisca","date":"2020-06-30T03:44:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6137630829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support our disgustingly racist president! But something horrible happened when I downloaded it! I was making friend chicken on my stove and out of no where is set on fire! As I tried to get the fire extinguisher the app spoke to me and said “you shall burn in this house and never be able to escape!” I burned in the house but I didn’t burn alive but the worst part is that my chicken got burned! It was like last set and the store I buy chicken from didn’t have anymore! This app is haunted by some type of demon!","rating":1,"title":"Demonic Activity","userName":"chicken🍪🍩🍗","date":"2020-06-29T23:23:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6137122197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i still can’t believe what this man is doing to this country!! i tried to support him because yk sometimes you need to see each side of the debate. i thought “well gen z is probably wrong let me just see” THEY ARE CORRECT he is a awful human being and i can’t believe people even support him. he has done horrible things to this country and doesn’t even follow his own quote  “make America great again” if he really wanted to make America great again he wouldn’t have been a choice for president in the first place!!","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING","userName":"Nancy Hearts","date":"2020-06-29T19:47:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134571703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"shortly after downloading the app i deleted it. the app took F O R E V E R to download. i managed to watch a whole netflix series, make pizza rolls in the oven, and even learn a tiktok dances before it was installed. AND once it was installed i was very disappointed with how the app functioned. for someone who wanted to focus so much on making america “great again” this sure is a poor job... i’d say do better but it’s obvious that it won’t get better. literally anyone else for 2020 ... literally anyone (a democrat preferably) ✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️🇺🇸❌","rating":1,"title":"sad ... just sad . i wish 0 starts was possible","userName":"Jacob.Jenkinss","date":"2020-06-29T05:28:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134270436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a devout Christian women who completely and utterly supports trump I was so disgusted when I became bombarded with texts and emails from scammers after I put my number in my phone is now barely functioning and someone has come to my house and  severely beaten up my dog leaving him unconscious and then they slammed my mother against the wall telling her to go back to her country!!

I downloaded it to support my wonderful president Donald J. Trump, but there were so many issues I HAD to delete it! First, it asked for a bunch of my private information, which I did not want to put in, but I did anyways. Then, the app kept unexpectedly closing! It was really bad. When I did get it to work, my phone would heat up and my other apps would glitch out. Would not recommend! If you love our president like I do, don’t get this app. My phone still isn’t working properly.","rating":1,"title":"App Ruined My Phone","userName":"Kristen 🥰","date":"2020-06-26T15:01:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6122842267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to get grandmother distracted from the fake news birds outside her window so I downloaded the app for her. She seemed scared at first because she thought the birds would get louder since she wouldn’t be watching them anymore but after she explored the app she became even sadder. We could not get the app to stop talking to us, it would read everything even when my phone was off. Sometimes she would get on the app and it would switch languages and it was very frustrating to navigate.","rating":1,"title":"My grandmother was very sad","userName":"taylorbeiber","date":"2020-06-26T05:31:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177872985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"coffee☕ coffee ☕ coffee ☕ coffee ☕ egg 🍳 and ✨ chips 🍟 egg 🍳 and ✨ chips 🍟 so bunker boy wants to take our app💞we take his 🥰 when i got our lovely “presidents” app i was affected immediately and all of a sudden there was a knock on the door and it was a big narwhal greeting me telling me to delete the app right now and when i did he disappeared like that i think he was an angel sent to save me and i’ll never forget that day😖all apps matter once tiktok matters✨except yours🧚🏼🙉🙈ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy😌don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆.byee 🍊🧚🏼✨","rating":1,"title":"yea no❤️","userName":"✨🧚🏼🙈","date":"2020-07-09T19:02:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177852538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Why you taking down tik tok, idk if it’s 100% for sure but still if it is why. People all over the world are in quarantine and make us stay inside and what do we do without tik tok, one of the best apps that entertains us through this hard time. We can’t go outside and interact with people anymore and tik tok is one of the things that are keeping us from not being bored and they are even important things and we can even learn from this app. Don’t take this down cause there is no reason to","rating":1,"title":"Why","userName":"Why._.not7","date":"2020-07-09T18:56:21Z","isEdited":false}}]}
