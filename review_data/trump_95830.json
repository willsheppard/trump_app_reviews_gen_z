SERIOUSLY I MEAN IT, I ALMOST DIED!!! Here’s what happened. I downloaded the app which took months to download. When I finally opened the app I got an allergic reaction from all the oranges I saw. I passed out and woke up in the hospital. When I woke up, all the nurses and doctors were ORANGE! I was so scared so I had no choice to jump out the window and use my wings to fly away. After a few hours, my wings stopped working and fell into the White House. I was sooo scared! I was looking for a way out then I saw an orange monster!!! I tried to run as fast as I could but the monster kept on following me! Soon he sent his orange minions to come and arrest me. I got arrested and I was stuck in a prison. The orange monster down to dungeon and told me I was going to die. I ask what his name was and he said Donald Trump. “What an ugly name” I said. He left the dungeon and that was my time to escape. I crawled through the wall and ended up in China!! I needed to get out so I found my homegirl and Mulan and we built a Chinese army, we sailed across the Indian Ocean, then the Atlantic Ocean and reached Jamestown, Virginia. After that, Mulan used her time traveling machine and went back to the 1600’s. Mulan’s Chinese Army teamed up with my girl, Pocahontas’ Powhatan Army. We time traveled back in 2020 and went to the White House and Pocahontas kicked Donald Trump out of the White House. LITERALLY! She kicked him so hard that he flew all the way to Neptune! “WEEEEEE” Donald said. Me, Mulan, Pocahontas, and their armies celebrated all night long. The U.S. elected Ms. Bey Riri Minaj to become the first black female president of the United States of America. \n\nThe End\n\nThe Lessons of the story is to not trust orange people and do not eat oranges.😃","date":"2020-07-08T18:13:28Z","userName":"whatspoppin.ayeee","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173214865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😭🤮🤢","review":"This is the worst app I downloaded","date":"2020-07-08T18:09:36Z","userName":"rjsjsmc sk","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173205439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app","review":"this app is spreading false information about our president","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:26Z","userName":"isaiahhs04","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173204135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad app","review":"because :,( i once had hope now it's gone","date":"2020-07-08T18:05:59Z","userName":"pustoophat","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173198675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮","review":"It gave my phone roaches?!?!
