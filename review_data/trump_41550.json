Also an orange 🍊appears out of no where on the app. I could go on and on about this app but the most unsettling thing is the random hot Cheeto dust that gets on your fingers when you swipe on it, ALSO my grandma died 👵🏻☠️after she found out I had this app. In conclusion DO NOT buy this app.\n\nSincerely,\nEllie, Adam, Isabel, George, Emily, and Jack\n\nP.s Save Adam 2020🇺🇸","userName":"RealRapidFlow","date":"2020-07-08T18:56:12Z","title":"🧚🏼\u200D♂️💖Sm6 Band💖🧚🏼\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6173332374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate it.
