It loves to make your microwave get hacked and explode in a coffin. It’s such a oven eater. It always eats my foil and poops in the stove. It also sounds like it gets high off helium. Every time the app updates Godzilla breaks into my house and drinks my bodily fluids. The best part of the app is deleting it and that’s on what?

That was until I got a virus on my phone saying, “TRUMP IS A PIECE OF S***”. I couldn’t have agreed more.

This is why you don’t vote for oranges 💀","userName":"taehyung's big toe"}},{"id":"6174900917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:36:54Z","title":"Very Unhappy","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Downloading this app was a huge mistake.
