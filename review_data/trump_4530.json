It will mess with your phone and even cause it to break! i had to take my phone to the apple store over 5 times because of this app. me not recommending this would be an understatement. DO NOT GET!! it will hack your data base and more! This app is all about some random narcissistic and ignorant 5 year old who thinks the world evolves around him! Once i got the app and realized how horrible it was a deleted it only for it to randomly come back every two days! It will hack and go through all of your personal info and sell that info to the world. THIS APP IS DISTURBING, DISGUSTING AND MORE!!! DO NOT EVER GET IT AND DELETE FROM APPLE STORE!!"}},{"id":"6174753485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ughhhhh","userName":"durosinmi","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:53:09Z","review":"Hey I just got home I got to my head right back up at my moms number one is there anyway you could get me a text and let y’all go to the work right now I cannot is the time you get home all I can do you wanna is my day and day tomorrow night or Saturday or tomorrow or Saturday or Friday or not tomorrow night I gotta was a day for a cookout and a ride home I gotta is a good night to you join me and me to come stay and I do have fun at my house and I’m staying home all day tomorrow and Saturday night or night tomorrow or Saturday morning I only need a little bit to come out and come get out and then come get back with me tomorrow I wanna was the night 😔."}},{"id":"6174664776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP","userName":"937194","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:35Z","review":"i downloaded this too see my cheeto king 😍😍😋😋🤪🤪 but instead i got a virus and my dog did a flip yesterday in summer last winter so i went outside indoors and my fish started connecting to my bluetooth and started playing world star money by joji🙈🙈 which i don’t mind but then the cheeto king called me personally and called me an alien and said he’d smack my dog🤬🤬 and my dog went upstairs and cried on my water bed and drowned and cheeto king laughed🤬🤬🤬 so i said i’m coming over to barron 😍😍🤪🤪🤪😏😏 the only thing he made that has a good impact on this kitty 🐱🤪🤪 but anyways as i was saying i would rate 0 but i had a lil appointment with barron🤪🤪 so it’s a 1 cheeto king 2020 in a grave😍😍😍😍."}},{"id":"6174664066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Honestly worst app in the App Store","userName":"jessie_smith_58495","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:26:22Z","review":"I downloaded it immediately once I heard about the death of Donald Jeffery Trump, but after I made an account Godzilla burst into my room demanding Starbucks. Eager to please him I rushed to my local Starbucks to get him and iced coffee. The only problem was it was run by Chimpanzees! I was scared out of my mind but I knew that if I didn’t get Godzilla his iced coffee he would eat my family. Now that wouldn’t be a problem except I knew my family tasted horrible and I didn’t want him to throw up because I would have to deal with my family’s remains along with the metal from the refrigerator he ate in my kitchen. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE"}},{"id":"6174634334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ruined my life🤬🤬","userName":"lira ingrim","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:50Z","review":"Where do I start? I was so excited for this app but then it jumped me and my poodle while I was motoring through the oceans of Utah. I tried to speed away, but no! It was too quick. Then, the next day, I was at work, and my phone lit up in flames and started blaring the popular hit song ‘Replay’. Even Charli D’amelio’s renegade was not powerful enough to extinguish the mass destruction. I was fired from my job and Christmas was canceled! The force was so huge that my cat’s half-brother’s uncle’s racist mother was awoken and she just started Hurricane SixNine. The devastation and havoc this app has wreaked on my life has been just horrible. Wish I could rate it a 0!"}},{"id":"6174628506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😾😾😾 DISGUSTING","userName":"choo choo beach","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:16:12Z","review":"STREAM STAY GOLD BY BTS\nBlackpink\n\nAye aye\n\nBlackpink\n\nAye aye\n\n착한 얼굴에 그렇지 못한 태도\n\n가녀린 몸매 속 가려진 volume은 두 배로\n\n거침없이 직진 굳이 보진 않지 눈치\n\nBlack 하면 Pink 우린 예쁘장한 savage (Blackpink)\n\n원할 땐 대놓고 뺏지\n\n넌 뭘 해도 칼로 물 베기\n\n두 손엔 가득한 Fat check\n\n궁금하면 해봐 Fact check\n\n눈 높인 꼭대기\n\n물 만난 물고기\n\n좀 독해 난 Toxic\n\nYou 혹해 I'm foxy\n\n두 번 생각해\n\n흔한 남들처럼 착한 척은 못 하니까\n\n착각하지 마\n\n쉽게 웃어주는 건 날 위한 거야\n\n아직은 잘 모르겠지 굳이 원하면 test me\n\n넌 불 보듯이 뻔해\n\n만만한 걸 원했다면\n\nOh wait til' I do what I do\n\nHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du\n\nAye aye\n\nHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du\n\nAye aye\n\nDdu-du ddu-du du\n\n지금 내가 걸어가는 거린\n\nBlackpink four way 사거리\n\n동서남북 사방으로 run it\n\n너네 버킷리스트 싹 다 I bought it\n\n널 당기는 것도 멀리 밀치는 것도 제멋대로 하는 bad girl\n\n좋건 싫어하건 누가 뭐라 하던 when the bass drop it's another banger\n\n두 번 생각해\n\n흔한 남들처럼 착한 척은 못 하니까\n\n착각하지 마\n\n쉽게 웃어주는 건 날 위한 거야\n\n아직은 잘 모르겠지\n\n굳이 원하면 test me\n\n넌 불 보듯이 뻔해\n\n만만한 걸 원했다면\n\nOh wait til' I do what I do\n\nHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du\n\nAye aye\n\nHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du\n\nAye aye\n\nDdu-du ddu-du du\n\nWhat you gonna do\n\nWhen I come come through with that that uh uh huh\n\nWhat you gonna do\n\nWhen I come come through with that that uh uh huh\n\n뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire\n\n뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire\n\nBlackpink\n\nHey\n\nAye aye aye aye\n\n뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire (hey)\n\n뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire (fire)\n\nHit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du"}},{"id":"6174624148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It’s a no from me ✨💕","userName":"covetznplayer","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:15:00Z","review":"Where to begin?\nThe second I opened this app, the Home Depot theme song started playing on all of my home speakers!

Is this a new mascot???? I am very disappointed that this Cheeto horse has been chosen as the mascot of this country.  In the words of philosopher John Mulaney “This guy being the president, it’s like there’s a horse loose in a hospital. I think eventually everything’s going to be OK, but I have no idea what’s going to happen next. And neither do any of you, and neither do your parents, because there’s a horse loose in a hospital. That’s never happened before! No one knows what the horse is going to do next, least of all the horse. He’s never been in the hospital before, he’s just as confused as you are.”"}}]}
