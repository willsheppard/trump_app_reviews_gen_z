I’m appalled that it’s even allowed to be on the AppStore. It’s a disgrace to all the beautifully well crafted apps on the store. It’s glitchy, it’s hateful, it supports white supremacy. If this is what Apple wants to help represent, I don’t think I want any part of it.","userName":"fuzzy7737"}},{"id":"6174449168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:25:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was really looking forward to supporting warlord Donald J. Trump, but when I opened the app, it took me straight to videos of naked men. I was going to show my inbred southern children how to support our TOTALLY NOT RACIST OR SEXIST OR PEDOPHILIC supreme leader, and ended up scarring them for their entire short, non-vaccinated lives. Sad. Please remove this bugged app from the App Store.","userName":"ReadingGreek"}},{"id":"6174407339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:12:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET","review":"when i made an account something had popped up saying “Vote For Trump or else we will k*ll a fairy.” this message gave my child nightmares, mind you my child is 45 years old. this caused him to imagine pictures of trump k*lling fairies whenever he eats soup(which is his favorite food). you have scared him for life!","userName":"DoggyLover2000"}},{"id":"6174396018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I aM fLaBeRgAsTeD","review":"ever since i have downloaded this app all me and my pet pig named shrimp can smell is CHEETO PUFFS🤢🤮 AND everytime i open this app the lice from my little sister finyin’s hair jumps onto my phone until i get out of the app. once i get out of the app the lice go back to their home (my little sisters hair). in conclusion this app is HORRIBLE 🤬","userName":"ripmypetpigshrimp"}},{"id":"6174393449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"my balls are itching 😿","review":"i downloaded this app hoping to see “GLORIOUS” pictures of the cheeto who runs the country and as soon as i opened the app my balls started itches and so i went to the hospital to get them checked out and it turned out i had 4 different kinds of STDS 😿 so i plan on getting them treated so PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP 😫","userName":"isa loves tom lucitor"}},{"id":"6174389796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:07:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"made my pet chinchilla very sick 🤢","review":"Fs in the chat for my chinchilla Rufus, he got into my coin collection last afternoon and found my phone.
