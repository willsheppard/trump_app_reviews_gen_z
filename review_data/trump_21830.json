I was in the middle of the woods at the time and without my phone I almost got lost in the woods Andy have been left for dead. Do NO download this app it will RUIN your phone!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:55:17Z","title":"Not worth the download, almost died😔😬🤷🏼\u200D♀️💖🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172561189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mary.zz","review":"I went to download the app so that I can be up to date, but instead it took 74 hour to finally download to my phone. When I finally had the app downloaded, I’m pretty sure it has a glitch cause all I saw was a Cheeto puff on the screen and nothing but FAKE news. I was not satisfied... you can do better.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:53:15Z","title":"Do not download","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172554584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Linda 1969","review":"this is by far the WORST app i've ever downloaded. it took up so much data (i have a 64 gb phone and before downloading this i had 25, now it's at 55!) and it's so slow! it keeps glitching every time i open the app! it even led me to a website, causing my phone to get a virus! a terrible app. i'm sorry to anyone that uses it.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:51:26Z","title":"terrible!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172553541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Shortstuffcutie","review":"This is probably one of the WORST MADE apps. It actually glitches so much that it started affecting my family as they were using it. They are losing brain cells  now they just keep repeating things like “all lives matter” and they keep eating bags of Cheetos?? Horrible app I had to delete it right away.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:51:08Z","title":"Horrible app many✨✨ glitches","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172551459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tiktokuser15725","review":"The second you open the app, you notice the logo “keep America great” please point to a point in time when America was ever great? The colors of the app are hideous (at least they’re not orange) nonetheless I find it hypocritical to have an app (probably designed by foreign companies) but then hate in POC and immigrants 🥴 0/10","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:50:33Z","title":"A failed app just like a failed presidency","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172531043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yeet543","review":"I am a very patient person but this app took much too long to download. When I opened it it was confusing and hard to navigate. It’s hard to think how such a professional app could be so terrible. Would not recommend to a friend and definitely won’t be using in the future.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:44:50Z","title":"not a good app!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172511914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hdhdbdkuf","review":"Trumps app I thought luxury on my phone … it wasn’t. It was buggy and terrible it made me cry. My whole family was extremely disappointed   I cry every time I get a notification. You’d think he’d put more money and time into his app but no. It freezes all the time. Fake. Not legit. I’d rather vote for Biden. Black lives matter this app not so much.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:39:23Z","title":"💔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172452120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tucker3127556","review":"This app is one of the worst set ups I’ve seen and the only nick name he can come up with is stinky joe?? God a middle schooler could come up with better. No updates and there isn’t even a racist meter ??? Sorry but I don’t want to know that people of all races in this country will ok I want to know that I , a white male, will be above the law . Just terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:23:05Z","title":"No effort","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172426213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"happy_girl_101","review":"I don’t understand why anyone would download this app. Maybe because there isn’t enough bad stuff happening in 2020 you needed to open your phone to remind you that a homophobic, sexist, racist, goldfish is running our country. Downloading this app only made me miss Obama even more! I’d give it zero stars if I could","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:16:05Z","title":"Thank you next","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172402995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i almost died 🖕🏻","review":"I wanted to find more ways to support our bunker boy chettto of a president but as soon as I downloaded it my phone turned of an started violently thrashing around and started smoking!!!
