I was immediately greeted by the most vile looking creature I’ve ever seen asking for my phone number. Donald, I am a MINOR. Disgusting, absolutely vile. Now I know many apps, I am great friend to many apps. I have more apps than any other citizen. I have a great relationship with these apps. I’m a great citizen what can I say? There are very good apps in the App Store. Amazing apps. As I said, I’m friends with so many apps. The apps love me. I fully support the apps. Not this app though. 😤 The upset from this event and the lack of action and failure on the trumpet’s part to protect our country from the COVID outbreak cause me to contract the disease. I am typing this on my death bed. Nevermind, I’m dead now. Anyways, in conclusion: no ❤️"}},{"id":"6177472907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"eat rocks u cheetp","date":"2020-07-09T16:59:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🧚","review":"This app was awful it took a week for it to download, and then once it did I saw this horrible looking ompa lompa bodied Cheeto when I opened it . This monster scared me so much I threw my phone, when it landed it stared to play this terrible music that made cockroaches come out of my walls. The cockroaches continued to sacrifice my pet llama named Steve (rip). They stared chanting (something about an orange demon) and stared to eat my toes. Luckily I had my magic bottle of ketchup to squirt at them. They went away, but then came back with a poison glitter cannon. I was so scared I did a jumping jack. They fired at me multiple times but I hid in my bunker. When I was down there I saw the orange ompa lompa again and ran out to the roachs global warming is fake, but they were gone. Then I saw the bunker boy and feel off my house.\nI’m writing this review from taco heaven."}},{"id":"6177336464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"user153563615252","date":"2020-07-09T16:18:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"💔","review":"SpeakerBangerz\nLook, uh, look\nHeart been broke so many times I\nDon't know what to believe\nMama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve\nThink it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice\n'Cause I can't breathe\nI'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice\nIt's gettin' the best of me\nWhile in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him\n\"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier\"\nNo one could understand, I had way too much aggression\nThat built over the years from my abandoned adolescence\nSee I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken\nI wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open\nPrayin' one day I'd find a piece of mind by the ocean\nI spent all my time committing crimes to get closer\nWhile at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling\nTryin' not to get in my feelings\nThinkin' of a way I could make these millions\nMaybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days\nHeart been broke so many times I\nDon't know what to believe\nMama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve\nThink it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice\n'Cause I can't breathe\nI'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice\nIt's gettin' the best of me\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nBrrt"}},{"id":"6177299105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fortnite Fluzzer","date":"2020-07-09T16:08:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app causes stress😾","review":"I am not one to put other down... but lemme tell you.... this ✨orange✨ created this app to destroy us gen z. and is that okay? negative. not to mention... mid away downloading the app... i saw a vision of kanye telling me that trump is trying to take down the almighty, wonderful, powerful tiktok😾 that angered me. because kanye told me that... i guess a secret agent had found out and arrived with scissors at my door. ‘why scissors?’ you must ask. well... he yeeted through my bathroom door and guess what that very fine, big, built, not orange man did ? nothing. he gave me a reward. ‘who is this mystery man?’ you are probably thinking. get ready because this will completely blow your socks off!

The first thing they ask for is your information, that’s my privacy! I trusted the great orangutan of America and he betrayed me! I’m appalled! All of my information was given to marshins, YES LITERAL ALIENS! those slimy freaks showed up at my door and took my baby(her name was Oprah Judith Laqueesha Alejandra Leeann Marie Jill the seventh)! She has dyslexia and is bad at basketball, I can only imagine how frightened she is! Not only was my child abducted but I was forced to let the marshins into my home at the orders of the White House power junkie, they ate all of my applesauce!! Are you kidding me!!!! All they did was play dance monkey and chant gummy bear commercial lines WHILE I was sat on by a cyclops with seven toes and a bad haircut, he smelled like moldy bologna and crawfish. This is unacceptable!!!!!! BRING MY BABY BACK!!"}},{"id":"6177193851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"483928","date":"2020-07-09T15:38:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No💖💖🐀","review":"When I saw the app at first I was soooo excited. The most handsome and respectful man on this earth had an app 😍 count me In. But like my parents with me I was strongly disappointed. When I got the app everything was fine. Besides it taking all my information and leaking all my pictures on the forbidden site. Oh yea and it taking a few years to download. But besides that everything was going great. But when it finally downloaded i was addicted to the app so much I didn’t sleep for 5 days straight. I almost DIED. But that’s just the start. Seeing the sexy man pop up on my screen was really fun. Except when I got PREGNANT. Not by him ofc(although I was scared) I am now 9 months pregnant and I’m actually giving birth rn 😋. I hope he doesn’t Seduce you guys. Yettus the Fettus. Oh and remember kys🤪(keep yourself safer)"}},{"id":"6176993991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♀️tiktok✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:43:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨gen z✨","review":"i was excited to see on tiktok gen z is getting this app of the appstore so i decided to jump on here and give ✨🟠bunker boy🟠✨ an amazing little review😊. here are some of my favorite fairy comments🧚\u200D♀️for bunker boy✨. everyone is a gift from god💕🧚\u200D♂️✨☺️i hope your parents kept the receipt 💕🧚\u200D♂️✨☺️. everyone has a plan in life🥰🤍🧚🏼\u200D♀️🌸 yours should’ve been plan b🌈💟😘.

The most i can do ma’am is reboot your phone and tell you to go rate this app a 1 in the app store, to help it get taken down quicker.” SO NOW IM TELLING ALL OF YOU, RATE THIS APP A 1 SO IT GETS TAKEN DOWN!"}},{"id":"6175994458","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ndr.98","date":"2020-07-09T10:00:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Help me conservatives!","review":"Give this app a 1-star review! Evil snowflakes are at it AGAIN!! They created this app and they’re trying to steal the devil’s-I mean...our President’s identity! We have to help him! The bill of rights! The constitution! This app says it’s the OFFICIAL TR*MP 2020 APP...a LIE! FAKE NEWS! He, who shall not be named, said it himself! ON TWITTER! Download this and leave THEM a BAD review. The baddest most worstly humongous-ness best very bad review in the world globally. Do it in a way no one has ever done before. The more negative reviews this app gets is a good thing because it means more people are leaving reviews and so if they leave a bad review there are more. It’s good...more bad reviews. And lastly...to finish what is the end of this review\nin summary, DON’T open this app after you download it or these snowflakes will steal ALL of your information and clone you!
