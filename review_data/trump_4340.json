I ran away from the app 🏃\u200D♀️ and kept running until I heard a dreadful ding🔔. I looked towards my phone, eyes still in pain from the previous incident, and I saw the cheeto puff man’s name on the screen 😱! I slowly started to melt as I ran down the street hoping for someone to see me and help, with my shoes sticking to the pavement with every step. As I slowed down and saw no one help me, my eyes started melting 🔘👄🔘. In my last moments of vision, I saw my legs and torso spread on the pavement with small bubbles on me as if I was boiling water💧, and then I passed away.\n✖️👄✖️        xoxo, gossip girl💋","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:32:46Z"}},{"id":"6171801642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app period","userName":"fgftvgvtb","rating":1,"review":"I thought this app would probably make me hate the person who I would never call my president less (no I didn’t) but guess what... nothing happened, in fact I feel like I hate him more. Not because of the app, I didn’t even open it, I don’t want to burn my eyes looking at the orange Cheeto you call your president, which I call an embarrassment to America which I don’t even like anymore because of him and his supporters. Additionally I honestly think the little bunker boy is too scared and stupid to do anything else instead of just hiding, standing in a 45° angle, not having the ability to speak, or drink water with one hand. PERIOD","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:14:59Z"}},{"id":"6148158558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not recommend 😪😪","userName":"ablexa","rating":1,"review":"truly disappointed😥. i got the app and it asked for my phone number😳. sorry maam but i do not🤚🏽 feel comfortable giving my number to a cheeto😾.  it also took a good 5 seconds to load, good thing i was listening to music 🎶, really lets time pass by .

After downloading it, which took over THREE DAYS, it took me to a screen with a KNOWN WHITE SUPREMACIST. I couldn't believe my eyes. After a bit of trying to scroll past and figure out what was going on, it glitched and jumped to a screen that told me I had 24 hours to go to a certain location near me and pay 4000 dollars or I would be sent to far far away to a Planet called Drool that's located just outside our Solar System. I paid up but that was almost all my rent. Luckily, my aunt Theresa is rich so she just bought me a house. I quickly deleted the app before anything further could happen.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:11:52Z"}},{"id":"6177220014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP USES YOUR LOCATION!!!!!","userName":"Sarah Finney","rating":1,"review":"This app is not safe at all! It wanted to use my location I don’t even know why! I just wanted to support my president but this is just toooo far. Why does he need my location? To find where I live and blackmail me if I vote against him in the election 😰? Not risking that! Please delete this app immediately if you have it and write a one star review to take it down. This app is dangerous and should not be on the App Store! Additionally it wanted my phone number! I thought I was going to receive a message from my president Donald John Trump himself but I was greeted by bots! This app is a scam. Please remove this dangerous app from the App Store at once.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:45:35Z"}},{"id":"6177202095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","userName":"iamnottellingyouwhoiam","rating":1,"review":"I WAS SO EXCITED TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP AND \"SUPPORT\" OUR ORANGE CHEETO LOOKING PRESIDENT🍊and turns out he had the audacity to run again, I later learned he was a rapist and is a racist and a homophobic and MANYYY more things. yeah so I no longer support him and tbh I never actually did! I OPENED THE APP I NEARLY SCREAMED CAUSE I think the app malfunctioned and used a picture of Donald duck instead, I nearly flew all the way into the great wall of China cause I was so scared. WHEN I came flying back to the U.S. I bounced off the white house and then a a basketball hit me in the head and I somehow was still intact when I came home! THE POINT IS WHEN U.OPEN THE APP, BAD things happen like what happened to me, so yeah don't get the app!

Once I had downloaded it my entire room began to fill with his merchandise and boys with fishing pfp were in my dm’s. I ignored it and continued to use the app and soon after it started to collect my data like my house address and credit card information. I even got dms from the orange himself saying I should inject myself with cleaning products to get rid of the Coronavirus. He also killed my grandma when I was away from home. Overall I have to say the worst thing about this app is the ads I DON’T CARE IF YOU CAN’T REACH PINK LEVEL!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:26Z"}}]}
