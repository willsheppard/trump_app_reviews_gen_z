I was taken aback about the terrible quality of this application. It’s so bad that I don’t really think that it can be improved in any way. I wonder if the creator was actually dumb or just trying to be funny. I’m really sad that I wasted my precious time to press the “get” button, and open the application. That precious time will never be returned to me. So I will be giving this app one star. If only if I could give it no stars... in that time I could have had a piece of pizza,got a pet fish , and maybe even kill a few spiders. And that time will never be replaced🤭🤭😪😪"}},{"id":"6174810894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRASH APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"importanperson101","date":"2020-07-09T03:10:32Z","review":"When I got the app my phone glitched the entire time at first I thought it was just because my phone was an older model so when I finally got a newer model and installed the app again my phone kept on glitching and wouldn’t stop. Now I know that it was all the fault of the app and I do not recommend for any users in the future. Also when I got the app it kept on exiting out of it even though I did not exit the app. I do not like this app at all it makes me angry and it hurt my phone. this app is absolute garbage and I would not recommend it to anyone unless you’re writing a terrible review."}},{"id":"6174794833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump 2020✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"💝me💝","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:49Z","review":"I expected great things from this app considering how AMazing our president is but u was sadly let down. The app is just too hard to navigate, it glitches profusely. I even tried to delete and reinstall it. I’m just very disappointed and dissatisfied with my overall experience, like I said before I expected great things. I was just so looking forward to being even more involved in President Trumps campaign and like I previously stated I am dissatisfied and disappointed. Hopefully this is no foreshadow of what the upcoming election will bring. As always Trump 2020🇱🇷 All lives matter and shut down the fake news🇨🇱"}},{"id":"6174774193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is terrible, do not download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"BLM Hdhsyensh","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:28Z","review":"When I opened the app the first thing that popped up on the screen was a rotten orange and it wouldn’t leave 🤦🏾\u200D♀️ then the orange started started talking and it sounded like a dying cat that fell from a 20 story building. Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, all the dogs in the neighborhood could sense that I had the app, and they chased me because of how terrible the app is. Lastly the app made my fridge start running and I had to chase it all throughout my neighborhood, by the time I caught my fridge everything in it spoiled and rotted just like that disgusting orange. I’d give a 0 star rating if I could."}},{"id":"6174768677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not right","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"LadyRage08","date":"2020-07-09T02:57:46Z","review":"This app is SLOW!! It slowed down my phone it slowed down my country it just isn’t good at all. It’s so offensive to see the 2 and 0 and 2 and 0 next to each other. Not to mention the T, R, U, M, and P. Like why? The app itself is not useful at all. It causes hate to spew from those people that have small brains and it’s really sad to see. Apple should just get rid of this and give the world a chance to get better. This is just not it sis. Don’t trust the app at all. It causes your phone to turn orange! Scariest thing I’ve ever seen because the only thing that wasn’t orange was two circles next to each other."}},{"id":"6174762035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD⚠️⚠️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lexi game master","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:45Z","review":"This is the most annoying ⚠️horrible app ever it kept glitching was not working well the app should be deleted please do not download it’s a waste of space and time it won’t help u at all it’s really not worth it it’s a very horrible app🤢🤢I never wanna download ⚠️⚠️it again well since they might bann TikTok I guess it’s time to make my account on Chinese TikTok🤧🤧 please (APP IS A WASTE OF STORAGE NEVER GET THIS APP ITS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!

It all started on Monday morning, 2020, when my dog and I went to PetSmart. My dog could look at nothing else but the Trump 2020 collar! I got this app as a joke, but then I realized that it had been telling my dog lies about Democrats when I fell asleep at night. Now whenever Joe Biden pops up on the TV screen, my dog will start barking and growling nonstop. I don’t know what to do. I respect my dog’s opinion and all, but it’s starting to get out of hand. I caught her last night trying to reserve a seat at the next Trump rally! So, yes, this review deserves one star because Trump peer pressured my dog into becoming a Republican."}},{"id":"6174690321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is terible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"zxxanonymousxxz","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:05Z","review":"Don’t buy this app it will ruin your life and it doesn’t really make ya happy and then you don’t get to it it doesn’t really make ya think of a choice to get it to be timmy it was so good I got it to get ya back to it where you can get your hair done then they get it bruh is the best day of my year and it’s so sad to have a crush of my heart like this I wanna is my first day in the south and the ocean and the world I love y’all I wanna see ya in a little while you don’t get it it’s to just say it is the best thing you have in your mind that I don’t have to worry about you you guys are just gonna is a great way of saying you love y’all"}},{"id":"6174665773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting 🤢🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"wut.it.do.jadab0o","date":"2020-07-09T02:26:53Z","review":"every time i go near this app it makes me gag which is horrible bc i have no gag reflex. i throw up on contact of this app(think it’s worse than corona😷) and should be burnt like they did with the “Black Death” or “Black Plague”. also i heard that this app abused animals and ignores the fact that children are being torn away from their families and locked away in cages in their own fecal matter and urine🥱. hey if y’all reading this add my snap👁👄👁(@jpalmer1003) and remember #NotMyRodrick❤️oops i meant #NotMyPresident❤️ i’m such a crackehead🤪like that typos amirite😌💅🏽anyways #BLM #TheMannyWillNotBeTelevised and save brittany spears and barron. also ellen looks tired w/o her adrenochrome right🙃"}}]}
