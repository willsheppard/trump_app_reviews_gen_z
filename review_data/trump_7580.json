It’s disgusting of them to ask for that info and not let me access the app. Also, are they affiliated with Cheetos or did they just give this man a bad color correction? Because he is looking like an Oompa Loompa with that spray tan. It’s just sad. Anywayyyyy if I had been able to get into the app I’m sure I would’ve hated it. But I only got to the first page and HAD to rate it one star. Just awful of them to try and steal my identity."}},{"id":"6173960141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting","date":"2020-07-08T22:33:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Air contionael","review":"I’m not very sorry about this but I am not supporting a man who does not support LGBTQ plus and you know others who want to live a life with social media and this guy just does not let that happen I will not be willing to this man because he’s disgusting and should not be able to have this opportunity to be president there’s a little more presidents that I bet  are so much better than this orange haired Cheeto so unless you have a better way of going at first then to gassing him BLM then I’m sorry but we cannot be friends"}},{"id":"6173945322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I- No😤","date":"2020-07-08T22:27:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bubbleguppises","review":"I wanted to rlly get i to politics this year with the 2020 election I was so displeased in the fact that kanye was running fb and nit drake so i decided to look into trump. open the app and there was a very scary orange cheeto looking man my little brother was sitting next to me and began to ball his eyes out at the sight of the man. I quickly got out of the app and my phone has been glitchy since so i had to delete the app and right this review. I do not recommend, the app does not pass the vibe check and the flavor was not immaculate but rather bitter😒🤚🏽"}},{"id":"6173893993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Guat da fuack","date":"2020-07-08T22:08:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"guacguac5000","review":"Hello, my name is Abort Shawn. This is just.. the most horrible app. As soon as I opened it, and took a big whiff I just knew that it was missing a little bit of..umm spice. Anyways I was harassed by the Cheeto looking man and I honestly believe that I will never be able to recover from this mental and physical trauma. I thought this app gave you white privilege and supremacy above all. It was a big scam. Honestly I have created better and more sufficient apps in my Computer Science class😐. This app is just something else. I don’t recommend this app if your name is Karen."}},{"id":"6173863306","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","date":"2020-07-08T21:57:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"_heyitspek","review":"This app is soo horrible I don’t know why anyone would want to install it. First of all it made my phone glitch so badly and caused it to get infected with al least 30 viruses and also caused it to reset. Next it was very bad quality and was very hard to use and navigate. Also not to mention that the person  shown on the app is soo ugly and looks like a literal orange. The app shows many pictures of this specific person and it is very disturbing overall I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE to install this app AT ALL it’s soo BAD."}},{"id":"6173848531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ong this is wack","date":"2020-07-08T21:51:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jazbeaner","review":"I downloaded and while I was at Walmart I found my self in a parallel dimension where trump was an actual hitler!!! No far from reality but I HATED IT!!! I was met with a bunch of trump soldiers and thanks to my latina strength I back handed all of them. It was terrifying!! But luckily I managed to go home safe and sound. When I got home I got news that trump was looking for me and so I warned my family of all that was to come. I deleted the app and everything went back to normal. Didn’t get deported which was good but HATED THE EXPERIENCE!!! 1 star honestly is too generous😤😤"}},{"id":"6173835841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Be careful of scam","date":"2020-07-08T21:46:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dhuggj go iflhgg","review":"So I downloaded this app. First thing wrong, you require a phone number and require a convent to call my number as you please, not happening. Require an email, that’s understandable but not my phone number so you can contact me as you please. Secondly this app is misleading by telling people this app is about news related to Donald Trump when is much more than that- a campaigning app for Trump and still more. If you ask me this app is nothing more than a marketing platform for trump, by trump and holds all biased opinions and views."}},{"id":"6173795465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET IT MADE ME ORANGE","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pooh Tohh","review":"Alright so I downloaded the app and all and I wanted to see was what trump had in his new merch. I guess I stayed on there to long before going to sleep because when I woke up I was ORANGE🙀. I hate being orange now! I tried to scrub and scrub and it won’t come off😣 it makes my everyday life harder now people look at me weird and say things to me like “Are you wearing a wig” or “That spray tan is so ugly” and so on. Now all the racist boomers in my town all the sudden want to be nice to me??? So guys please I’m begging you do not get it. It’s not worth looking ORANGE and ugly😿"}},{"id":"6173753867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible App🤮","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dnvudmfieuf","review":"This app was a complete waste of my time, while I was waiting for this app to download which I think took way to long I was debating with my aunt why trump is a racist and how Gen Z should rule to country and see how well that goes cause we could actually make a change in this planet today. Because instead of us worried about a wall and more money, we can actually make a change in the world. But the app was completely a waste of my time and probably yours too, don’t download this piece of trash!! Go manny"}},{"id":"6173748503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It’s kinda garbage","date":"2020-07-08T21:14:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kaahluaa","review":"I was giving as one does, when all of a sudden a sudden hankering for Cheetos over came me. I googled where to get Cheeto puffs and lord 🍊 popped up. So I immediately dropped all my morals and downloaded the app funded by a child rapist. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰 as soon as the app opened I wasn’t greeted with oranges as promised I instead saw a reach for credit card information. And as a capitalist American I don’t believe in socialism ideals like sharing the wealth that’s for poor people so maybe Donald should get another small loan to cover his campaign instead🤷\u200D♀️😘"}}]}
