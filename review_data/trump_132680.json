Looking at me and it turned out to be him because he ate the orange but their skin color is exactly the same so I couldn’t tell at first but you see the orange was for my dog who’s fur is black. He said himself Thats the reason why he ate the orange so my other dog who is a dark brown came to poop on the toilet but never seen trump and her poop is black so trump is black now. 😐🥱💀","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump is black now 🟠⚫️"}},{"id":"6173833548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:46:07Z","rating":1,"userName":"This_Unknown_User","review":"This is a horrible app!!! This took 2 years to download! Once I downloaded it, I started seeing Dr.Phil. Dr.Phil was feeding me peanuts with rice while our President watched. Then the president came over, and said, “May the force be with you.” I was so confused. Then when it hit lunch time, there was a chicken that came out of the app and appeared in my living room. A real chicken!! It was alive. Then Donald tRump started chasing me & the chicken around the living room with a rubber chicken, while squeezing the rubber chicken. Then when I went for my daily walk in the woods, I saw there was a fire lit up. There were people surrounding it while wearing red hoods. Then I saw Donald Trump. He was sacrificing that same rubber chicken. Ofc, I went back to my house, and grabbed my belt. I came back and beat the crap out of Donald. He has been a very naughty boy. Then I kicked him the f* out! I can’t have a orange, who is lazy af living in my house. Nope! Not today hun!","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!"}},{"id":"6173833402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:46:03Z","rating":1,"userName":"imrawidc","review":"THIS is one of the worst apps ever it is always so slow and it will never download correctly!
