I am not aware of how, but once I immediately opened the app, I obtained a virus on my phone. I really don’t want to waste any more money on buying another phone, but I will have to. I can’t go to repair my phone due to COVID-19, and will have to pay a lot of money for a new phone plus taxes and shipping. It is absurd that this app gave me a virus when it is for our president; I don’t comprehend how this app has given me a virus. It is unacceptable and I will not stand for it. I don’t mean to sound rude or petty—which I probably am sounding—but it is a very unreliable app. \n\nThe only reason why I did download this app is because I was going to try and convince myself who I should vote for as president; I did so, with no chance of actually considering voting for President Trump. \n\nNow that I have seen this app and what it is about, I have a reason not to vote for President Trump. \n\nIt is highly unacceptable and I will not stand for it.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:04:58Z","title":"So Terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"name.wtiting"}},{"id":"6172633987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay so first of this is a really bad app.  Second of all my fridge started to grow a pair of arms and legs and then started beating me up because I slammed the door too many times.  Oh but do you want to know why I slammed the door so many times.  It’s because I was waiting for this awful app to download so I could look at Cheeto make those faces he makes.  Oh the faces.  They make me want to puke then eat the puke then add some salt and rotten eggs and then puke that all up and then eat a trash bag filled with that puke and puke it all on Mr. racist Trump.  Wow I’m really glad I got to vent right now.  Thanks.

But when I entered the app there was this spinning thing that started HYPNOTIZING ME. It kept saying, “VOTE TRUMP 2020” “VOTE TRUMP 2020” “WHITE SUPREMACY” “BUILD A WALL” I had to quickly delete the app as fast as I could! I felt betrayed and USED. How DARE this cheeto try to hypnotize me. DO NOT BUY THIS APP.

This app is absolutely ludicrous👺. I am revolted😾, for I was required to put in my personal information in😦😦😦.  I don’t feel safe knowing the 🍊 has ALL of my hidden details🙈. Anyways, 1 out of 10❤️. The one only being in support of our dearest Barron and Melania😝. Off topic but, free Barron and Melania, those poor people look ✨𝓶𝓸𝓻𝓽𝓲𝓯𝓲𝓮𝓭✨ to be upon the Trump household.
