When I opened the app it took me to a porn site. I was disgusted and immediately deleted the app. My phone now has a virus and every time I open my photos it shows pornography. I would give it zero stars if I could. I will not be voting for him this election because of this DISGUSTING app. Please do not download this app. I’m taking my phone to the apple store soon to sort this out.","date":"2020-07-08T17:05:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"britishpony456"}},{"id":"6173011078","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WARNING DONT GET","review":"I downloaded this app to see more of our president, boy I asked for too much. Turns out this is Trump and Meliana’s onlyfans. I started to think differently about the president. I also noticed that my breath started to smell worse everyday. The whole app smells like bad breath and it’s highly embarrassing. I want clean breath not bad breath. If you want to keep your image about the president and have good smelling breath I highly recommend not getting this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:04:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gwen Jonson"}},{"id":"6173011019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump killed my pet goat 😭","review":"I was just casually downloading this app so I could rate it a 0 out of 10 stars because Donald wants to delete TikTok 😡and suddenly he pops out of the screen and punches my grandma in the face 😭then proceeded to kidnap my goat and feed it to his fans at a dinner party 🤯. Me being left devastated 😖try’s to peacefully go to sleep, and while I was praying to lord Bernie, trump pops up and kicks my dog in the face too 😫.

Donald Trump acts like a 12 year old, so I suppose it is fitting. It must be hard to be raised on Daddy's Money, Dodge the draft your whole life, and claim you care about American working class lives. Donald Trump is a White Supremacist who knowingly lets Russia murder American Troops for bounty and is doing NOTHING about it. If you vote or trust this man, please inform me the age you were dropped on your head as a child. ✨🦋❤️","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jfdjkv"}},{"id":"6172988665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Im so upset🥺😢","review":"This app ruined my life. After I downloaded it, I started uncontrollably yelling racist, xenophobic, sexist comments at all my friends and family. My best friend dropped me after I said that “laziness is a trait in blacks” and my mom kicked me out of the house after I tweeted “@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision”. Please do yourself a favor and do not download this app.","date":"2020-07-08T16:57:48Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"joe freaking biden"}},{"id":"6172971134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Take down this app","review":"I put in my personal information trying to support our president in his hopefully last term and I can’t unsubscribe from the constant calls and text messages from the app along with new telemarketers. It seems this app has sold my personal information since I’ve never had this issue before. I’m disgusted with this app and truly disappointed in our president.","date":"2020-07-08T16:52:27Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"samabauwiwnen"}},{"id":"6172955179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Poor quality, don’t download!","review":"This app took like hours to download, wouldn’t let me into the app itself every time I clicked on the application it would kick me out, and when I finally got in I couldn’t make an account nor could I leave the home screen. Do NOT download this app, unless you want to spend hours trying to get it to work. I wanted to support my president, but if I can’t use his app how can I?","date":"2020-07-08T16:47:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"EggHeadCosplays"}},{"id":"6172955068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE","review":"This is the worst app i have ever bought when I tried to download my phone glitched and turned all the way off then when it finally started again i went on the app and it was so laggy but i have amazing wifi and it just kept glitching an orange on my screen over and over again but when I deleted the app everything went back to normal. don’t buy this app please.","date":"2020-07-08T16:47:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Am23165"}},{"id":"6172914252","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Overwhelmed 😰 overworked 🚘 overpaid 🤑","review":"I opened this app and Donald Trump jumped out of the phone.
