When I got my phone to turn back on a horrifying picture of Donald Trump popped up on the screen. It was terrible, I had nightmares for days and nights about it. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t want to sleep for nights on end. Terrible app should be off the market.","rating":1,"title":"Terrifying app"}},{"id":"6176730762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:33:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"𝕒𝕝𝕪𝕤𝕤𝕒 𝕒𝕝𝕓𝕖𝕣𝕥","review":"My phone became so glitchy when I got this app and I was log out of all my social media and I couldn't log back in my volume would go up and down out of no where also with my flashlight it would stop turning off and on and It took literally a hour to download I deleted this and everything was back to normal this app is terrible don’t download!","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6176714558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:29:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Catty900000","review":"Even though I have my notifications off, every thirty minutes an alarm goes off to the sound of “All Star” by Smash Mouth, with the warning: help bunker boy win this election by jacking off to this picture of him in Lake Como, Italy. Safe to say that as a trump supporter, I do not even have a dingy long enough to complete this obscene event. I have to delete because this app is an insult to my pride, and my dingdong.","rating":1,"title":"No luv✨🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176709540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"alyyyssaissamgreattt","review":"It took forever to download and not to mention the use for this app like honestly it lags so much and it wasn’t even working so I had to delete it there’s so many things that need to be worked on so I recommend you don’t download this if you don’t want it to lag or have creepy old men on your phone like Donald trump cuz let’s be honest nobody wants that","rating":1,"title":"This is the worst app ever"}},{"id":"6176681688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:20:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dezmv","review":"First off, it took forever for the app to download and when it did, there were almost no features! Every feature seemed outdated and it doesn’t take into the fact that a pandemic is still going on. How am I supposed to support a president when everything isn’t handed to me on a silver platter? Will be removing from my phone immediately.","rating":1,"title":"Just Awful"}},{"id":"6176673560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:18:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hpbeycrufrgf","review":"I downloaded this app to see what trump was doing and see how well him and his team could make an app and i noticed so many things wrong with the app. i’m not happy with it and i’m not impressed by it. The app kept glitching on me and wouldn’t let me see anything. so in all honesty don’t download this app. you’re wasting your time. thanks for coming to my ted talk.","rating":1,"title":"Don’t think about downloading"}},{"id":"6176543578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:43:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"nugget- mc","review":"This app took forever to download and it is a waste of time it is sloppy and not well made also my friends told me to get this app and i was sadly disappointed in my choices this app is useless and over all used for bad reviews on people in the political field which is technically bullying and ignorant. This app has no use to be on the App Store it is absolutely ridiculous","rating":1,"title":"Useless app"}},{"id":"6176503192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:32:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"savannah ooh na na","review":"I really thought this app could help me find the good in trump but instead it did the exact opposite. It hacked into my phone found my location police came to my door and took me without consent.🤦\u200D♀️they brought me to jail and didn’t tell me why until they said Trump. So Barron(my bestie) came and bailed me out. I then met his oranged face father and I flipped him off and walked away. Then Mr. orange wrinkly face cried. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! YOU WILL REGRET IT SO MUCH!!💕✨","rating":1,"title":"Orange wrinkly face is fake🤢🍊"}},{"id":"6176446445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:16:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"im_not_a_lizard","review":"b i t c h\n\n☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅ ☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅ ☆☆☆☆☆☆▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥\n\n🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦🔥🔥 🔥🔥▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥🔥🔥▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅▅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nYou should be more open mind ✨🤗💋like JFK🌈💅🤭\n\n💕my 🖐 name 👄 is 👀 not ❌ five 5️⃣ weenies 🌭 i 🔥 am 😎 shoto ❄️ from 🤩 UA 🏫 and 👈 i 🥵 wanna 🙏 be 💫 a 🤗 hero 🦸\u200D♂️ \n\noikawa 😳 toorus 🏐 favorite 🥢 food 🍡 is 😇 milk🥛bread 🥖 his 😃 personal 🥰 motto 🤪 is: 🥳 if 🤯 you’re 😐 gonna 😯　hit 🥱 it, 😬 then 😮 hit 😳 till 🧚🏼 it 💕 BREAKS? 😍\n\nare ❓you 🎉 all 🥰 mights 💪 secret 🔒 love 💝 child 👶\n\nITS 👇YOUR 👉 POWER ❄️ TODOROKI 🔥\n\n🔥 boom 👉👈 boom ✨💀 boom 🥴😳 i want you in my room 💦🍆 we’ll spend the night together 🤤🍑 together in my room 🤰👀\n\nla 😩 la 🧐 la 🖐 la 👂 la 💋 la 👁 la 💞 la ⏳ la 🎙 la 🏵 la 🎤 la 🎼 la 🎹 la 🎸 la 🎻 la 🥁 la 🏀 la 🍙 la 🦵la 🌬 la 🥀 la 🦟 la 🐩 la 🍺 la 🎂 la 🦚 la ⛑ la 🧶 la 🧜 la 🗣 la 🚨 oh 😷 no 🤮 uenoyama 🪕 is 🏆 gae💄he 👀 comin 👣 to 🤛 steal 💃🏼 yukis 🧑\u200D🦯 man 💆\u200D♂️","rating":1,"title":"Trump 2020 💅✨🔥 on a gravestone 🥱💫🌷"}},{"id":"6176293464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:33:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mymomnamedmeelysabeth","review":"If I could give 0 stars I would.
