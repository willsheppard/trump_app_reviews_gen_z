I downloaded the app this morning and as soon as I opened it the app made my toothbrush explode  because of the disgusting adds for MAGA hats that showed up in the app. I believe the pure sight of them caused my poor toothbrush to explode with anger and explode. so then I had to go to cvs to get a new one but they only had red toothbrushes(which I do not prefer) so I rode my penguin to the grocery store and I bought a blue toothbrush. Then I opened the app again to see a hide picture of an organ he Cheeto and I SCREAMED because I was so terrified! My pet inchworm was sitting next to me at the time, and passed out do to what the doctor diagnosed as “fearoffatorangeracistsexistuglycheetomansyndrom” So of course I proceeded to take my inchworm to the ER and by the time we got home it was already nighttime. This took a lot of valuable time out of my day, which I would have been using to support the BLM movement, by spreading awareness, signing petitions, going to peaceful protests, and education myself. My day has been ruined because of this app, and I would not recommend downloading it unless you would like your toothbrush to explode or get the sometimes fatal illness that my inchworm had been exposed to.","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:43Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP WITH HEALTH CONCERNS","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMPISEVIL202\""}},{"id":"6175636344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Downloaded the app because I was curious, little did I know a storm was coming. Day 1 of having the app I started to here this horrible sound coming from my phone and it kept saying something about having “bigger and better nuclear missiles”. I ignored it and figured it wasn’t anything to worry about. Later that day I was locked out of my phone and I tried to use my fingerprint and it still wouldn’t work until I couldn’t get into my phone for 20 minutes... Once I got back on my phone all my pictures were gone, apps deleted, and I was only following Donald Trump on all my platforms. THEY HACKED MY PHONE AND TOOK ALL MY DATA. Then I got a call saying that they were coming after me and were going to kill me.. I tried to call the police but nothing happened it simply wouldn’t let me as if the app knew my every move. I had about enough and tried to delete it but it was permanently stuck to my home page and wouldn’t let me click it. Suddenly my phone started having seizures and it shut off and it won’t turn back on. I am currently using my IPad. This was a horrifying experience and it all started the day I downloaded this stupid app. \n\n-Sent from IPad","date":"2020-07-09T07:59:42Z","title":"My phone is ruined.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"uglyorangepoophead"}},{"id":"6176615493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give 0 stars I would this app is so weird and litterally took 55 weeks to download not only that but took all my storage asks for too much personal info costs 100$ when you log in and our fellow president I was expecting a high quality app and this app won’t even load now and I thought I was gonna have this high quality app from  president orange but I guess not ????

But was very disappointed that this app took two weeks to download and it wasn’t my WiFi. I also didn’t like the vibes on the app it had pervert vibes all over so I un downloaded it. And when I opened the app I saw and orange Cheeto when I was expected the president you might wanna fix that. Also it wade me throw up a lot I stayed up all night throwing up when I opened the app. Also my phone was glitching and I just did not like the app so I would NOT recommend. Also I don’t see him thanking blacks for what they’ve done building this country and also thanking Hispanics for continue to build it and keeping it beautiful and for other races for making America the way it is with all the cultures here but he’s just mad he doesn’t have culture. What’s his culture, Cheetos? And now after downloading this app I don’t like the vibes so I don’t support anymore! Also gen z isn’t going down without a fight with tiktok so better luck next time ✨🧚💅🏻 but this was 100% an honest review not about tiktok so do not get this app nor support this orange Cheeto puff ! If I could give it no stars I would but I can’t.","date":"2020-07-09T17:17:41Z","title":"✨🧚 o r a n g e 🧚✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Alexa Cortez"}},{"id":"6175576362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"All I wanted was a good app and can’t even give me that, what a joke wats next another million dollars of COVID relief funds goes missing to aid fox and there radical opinions to distract the minds from all the stuff they are slipping under the rug in the trump admin like come on this man isn’t about the people he isn’t about justice he doesn’t care about the gov and what it should stand for he isn’t a true patriot letting our own troops be hunted when he could have done something yet choose to ignore it like COVID and now here we are struggling while other countries are reopening in unity to help each other while he just splits and divides the American people (101 divide and conquer) He doesn’t care about the safety of the people only about the billion dollar companies he’s associated with this government isn’t about the people it’s about the billion dollar companies now they get the spotlight now we poor folk just don’t matter just another number in the millions in debt all because of the greed by a narcissist.

I was shocked to find he was asking for my number, but as we know my president would never cheat on his wife because that’s misogynistic and disgusting, which has always stopped him before. After looking through the messages I received a text from the  ̶C̶u̶l̶t̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶d̶e̶r̶ president saying that he wanted me to join his team. I happily obliged and received my first video call from the manager of his team.✨💕 You can imagine the surprise I felt when the Lorax’s face popped up on my screen. The president had told me that he took great inspiration from his manager but I didn’t realize they were related! But the Lorax kept threatening to lock me in the bunker if I didn’t join the legion of maggots (aka maga) and rate this app 5 stars. This kind of inappropriate threat traumatized me deeply and that is why I’m here right now giving this the lowest rating possible. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the bunker girl to your bunker boy, C̶h̶e̶s̶t̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶e̶e̶t̶a̶h̶                   Mr. President xx","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:05Z","title":"Always and forever bunker Boy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trump suckssssss"}},{"id":"6175396923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"um- chile anyway. this is for tiktok. ITS so disgusting that we have a fascist president who’s homophobic, racist, and sexist. Also, for all the trump supporters who agreed with his sexist behavior and said that a women shouldn’t run for office because they are too emotional are looking dumb right now! This is the most emotional response to children( gen zrs) ruining your little rally anyways. You were disrespectful in the first place trying to have a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the birth place of the Tulsa race massacre where black Wall Street was attacked. You really tried to have a rally in that city during black lives matter. You’re insane. If I could rate this app a zero I would but it’s not allowed. And to let you know as a individual a part of generation z. This is not over! You can try and silence by banning tik tok, but what makes you think we won’t scurry over to other social media and expose you. We might even start with Twitter the most productive thing you stay and motivated to do nowadays. Anyway, like I was saying 0/10 would not recommend. Also, I hope this finds you well. We appreciate our racist, fascist, homophobic, xenophobic, immigrant hating president 🧚\u200D♂️✨😍. Biden 2020.

I legit started bleeding out of my behind at first I thought I was having my period but I remembered I’m a dude and I’m like I don’t remember learning anything like this at school so I immediately turned my house upside down looking for a plug to stop the blood coming out of my behind, keep in mind in doing this with one finger in my bootay so none of it leaks and I get in on my vintage white carpet I bought from ikea but anyway I looked for hour not knowing what to do until I went into the kitchen and realized how hungry I was I made my self some macaroni and cheese that was in the shape of spongebob it was really good (remember I still have my finger in my bum) until I realized I needed something to drink but we had no water we had no soda or juice the only thing I found was a bottle of wine I looked at the bottle for about 5 or 20 minute but then it hit me. I could ya the cork!!!

Finally after a week of torture I decided to open the app the thing that await me was a horror it was a photo of an orange man with fake hair I immediately closed the app and had nightmares for weeks later I learned that this was the president and I opened the app again it asked me for my phone number which I think is a very personal question but I put my phone number and email about 10 minutes later I started receiving threats that if I didn’t vote for him that I would be killed. I then got spam emails with links to unknown websites when I opened one my phone turned off and when I turned it back on all of my screen said trump and their were threats I was so scared I had to have Apple support to fix the problem and then I deleted the app I can’t believe someone would make such a horrible app. \nIf a president can create a successful app that what makes us think he can make the country great again I mean he’s already ruining it.","date":"2020-07-09T13:12:06Z","title":"If u download this app there will be consequences","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"rit:("}},{"id":"6176745673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app infected my phone with a little Trumpling, reminiscent of BonziBuddy from the late 90s. He uses his cartoonishly long tie like a lasso to pull my apps around when I try to open them so I always tap the wrong one. Sometimes when I open an app like Twitter or Instagram, I won’t even be touching the screen and I can see his little toupée poking out from the side of the screen, and he’ll jump out and like some racist post about how BLM activists are terrorists or something. I think it granted itself access to my camera, because sometimes when I frown or sigh this little Trumpling peers over the bottom of my screen and starts ranting about how I have no right to be sad when he’s the most unfairly treated president in history. This persists even when I remind him that several presidents have been assassinated and that getting mad about people tweeting mean things at you is major snowflake behavior. Occasionally he goes on unhinged rants about some topic or another, and won’t stop until I drag his Adderall and hydroxychloroquine jelly beans into his slacked mouth. Also, downloading this app made my mom’s cancer come back. Wish I could give 0 stars.","date":"2020-07-09T13:37:30Z","title":"Wish I could give 0 stars","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Duck369"}}]}
