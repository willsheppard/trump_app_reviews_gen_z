I picked up the first call and heard heavy breathing. I could tell it was trump breathing because hey, I know how my king sounds like, and a distant slapping noise... I was so confused so I said “hello?” And all I could hear is Trump saying “oh yeah lemme break that small thing inside ya” and then I hung up. I thought it was a prank call or maybe a mistake so I went back to sleep. Got another call, it was 4:02 am this time, I picked up. “Hello?” I asked, despite being really tired, and I could only hear Trump saying.... and oh god those words he told me, I could never forget them....\n.\n.\n.\n“ Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friend\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\n\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breaking all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\n\nThat girl, like something off a poster\nThat girl is a dime they say\nThat girl is a gun to my holster\nShe's running through my mind all day\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn\nGirl, you really change my life\n\nDoing things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breaking all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\n\nThat girl, like something off a poster\nThat girl is a dime they say\nThat girl is the gun to my holster\nShe's running through my mind all day, ay\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nI can be your melody\nOh, girl, I could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come, baby girl, let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nOh, girl, I could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come, baby girl, let's sing with me\n\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singing\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singing\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\n\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay”\nI was so shaken up when I heard this, I could feel  hands shaking as I let out a choked sob.
