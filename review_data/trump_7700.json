And once it finally did download it took the entire month of March to open. In the time I was waiting, I bought ALL the tickets to his rally’s I could, but I couldn’t go because I was waiting for the app to load! And now when I open the app it makes a HORRIBLE ringing sound and it glitches 24/7. I think it has to do with the creator of the app, it shows how inconsistent and slow he is. This app NEEDS to be taken down!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:20:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE"}},{"id":"6173764268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"babygorl 👁👅👁","review":"i downloaded this amazing app after going to trump country with a bunch of old white people that changed my political views to the amazing racist orange in office🥰😍 unfortunately so, the app took 3 days to download and random oranges wearing toupees kept popping up all over my screen💥💥💥 this gave me a massive headache so i went to the doctors and im now brain dead!?!???
