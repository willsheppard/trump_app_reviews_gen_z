First the app didn’t gave me an option if I wanted the notification to notify me. Then it ask me for my number this is UNACCEPTABLE I don’t give out my number unless is anonymous. I was watching Netflix and out of no where the trump app  was spamming my phone I was so upset 😠I was trying to enjoy my movie night with my baby dady anonymous. So I decided to delete the app because it was getting me mad I almost ripped my mom favorite trump hat. Few hours later I heard a big noise as if there was an army of caillous then i saw caillous at my back and front door they knocked my door so loud that it woke my couch up so I opened the door because I’m not scared of nothing “debby Ryan face” then the caillous Kept on saying “if you don’t download the app again we will take you away” so I said NOO because you know I love a little action Tehe so they grab me then they threw me in a white van I was scared that I wasn’t going to see my baby dady anonymous anymore so I yelled my baby daddy is anonymous they stoped the car so fast that I almost turned into a pickle they asked me again who is your baby daddy I said anonymous they got so scared so they drove me back to my place and they left I didn’t even see because of how scared they were I never saw them again. And I am very disappointed on this app because I almost got killed so I’m giving the app a 1 Star review","rating":1,"userName":"anonymous crush","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180605301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trumps dick is small","date":"2020-07-10T11:11:01Z","review":"lets😹just🤪relax🔪and🇲🇽turn🤏🏽on😈the 🔫radio🔪would💿you🔪like💅🏽alg☁️or🍆 rythm? lets🙈just🦚relax🦄and🐌turn💛on✊🏿the🔪radio🔫would💿you🗿like🖇alg☁️or💸 rythm?","rating":3,"userName":"random:)🔫🔫 pewpew","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180603592","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Save TikTok","date":"2020-07-10T11:10:37Z","review":"Save TikTok","rating":1,"userName":"hansjwjwbsbso","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180603483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-10T11:10:35Z","review":"This is the worst app ever. DON’T DOWNLOAD!!!! So first of all I was trying to see what’s happening with our crazy president so I got this app. All of a sudden this rats were crawling out of my phone saying vote trump. So I was like NOPE! So I went to go delete the app and it said yes❤️. Then again yes❤️. Then I realized the tiktok girls have come to save me!!! Then the tiktok girls saved me and we made a plan on are most wonderful tiktok gen z squad that should not be banned at ALL, that we should do something so we did something and we all went and threw trump out of tiktok land. Overall I have to give this app a one star I would give it a zero but yeah this app is a no no.","rating":1,"userName":"Fhjfdnifsasklpp","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180603344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Constantly Crashing","date":"2020-07-10T11:10:34Z","review":"The app keeps crashing at launch!
