I opened the app and couldn’t even enter my mobile number because the sight of the president as the opening photo made me vomit. I vomited on my hands and couldn’t even pick up my phone.

I’ve never had this happen before, but upon opening this app, a wretched smell started fuming from my phone. I don’t know what this means but it smells like when my memaw would eat my papi’s chunky chili.......I have had all of my windows open for THREE DAYS and even after deleting the app, lysoling my phone, and sparking one up in every single room, I STILL cannot get rid of this putrid smell. Fix this - NOW!"}},{"id":"6174124459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Omg my eyes terrible ☠️👄☠️","userName":"cookie1191ndjs","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:34:18Z","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and I saw the ugliest orange creature in the world. It was so bad I had to take my eyes out. Omg this ugly guy I was like “ how could someone look so much like a orange baboon” it was so bad. Then in the tiniest spot you could see “ his toupee “ it was gross. The boomers can’t believer what they see neither can the Karen’s. We all cry in disgust as me see, oh no , AAAAAAAAAAA.

I REFUSE TO HAVE TRUMP HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER AND LOCATION FOR HIS PERSONAL BENEFIT and yes I said location because they are always tracking it BECAUSE OF THIS APP. I feel undeniably unsafe because of this. If you want people to hack into this app and take your phone number and address then by all means do what you want but I refuse to have that happen to me. GOOD DAY✌🏾😡"}},{"id":"6174107939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hurt","userName":"omg just give me an nickname","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:28:22Z","rating":1,"review":"I was ready to give my support but I learned/FELT things. 1st I saw that the sign that I bought in support of my big man (our nicknames for each other) have changed I am hurt to say the least. 2nd I felt pressured to give my phone number when entering the app which MY NUMBER MY CHOICE.
