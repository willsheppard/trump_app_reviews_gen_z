I only eat Big Macs and fries (which are lukewarm at best) and drink Crystal Pepsi. My main tasks I do now include applying a TON of spray tan and becoming orange, making finger paintings, staring at a wall, and singing “He’s Got the Whole Word in His Hands”. One day, I skipped singing and took a nap instead, and woke up to a toupee on my head and my hair completely gone! Cheeto man was leaning over me and bit me! He whispered “no one can save you now 😈”\n\nI miss my family, my dog, and my bed. I want my life back 😫 I have this condition where I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep 😔👎🏻🤕\n\n-9000000/10 DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP PLSSSS.

BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.
