I deleted all my photos of my family in order to get the app. When i got it it leaked a virus to my phone which completely broke it. It leaked all of my passwords even my bank. I got robbed and i had to get a brand new phone. Also when u open the app is had an unbearing ringing sound all the time. It made my head hurt and gave me migraines. I do not reccomend this app to anyone.","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-08T18:12:29Z"}},{"id":"6173199986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"no thanks✨","review":"This app took 2 months to download and when it finally did it asked me to sacrifice my turtle! After that ads for p***ography kept popping up on this app! This app is horrible. When my package arrived it looked like it had been run over and my hat was all ripped up and had weird white stains. And when i emailed them they were completely rude and didn’t want to give me a refund.

This app is unacceptable, the app makes you put your mobile number in just to get all of these spam texts to vote for trump 2020. Also Trump is trying to get rid of the most popular apps! Like TikTok. Some people really love that app and I don’t think this is the right thing to do for the USA!!!! At this very moment I’m getting spam texts from this app. Extremely mad and unacceptable. Please get rid of this app🤬","isEdited":false,"title":"Cancel trump","date":"2020-07-08T18:01:10Z"}},{"id":"6173169513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"leorese","review":"I saw what people were saying about this app and I had to see for myself. They weren’t kidding. It took soooo long to download on my phone. I lost count of the days. After it finally finished, I tired opening the app but it kept crashing. It did this for days. Eventually it let me open it. But lord, you cannot navigate this app if your life depended on it. 10/10 would not recommend","isEdited":false,"title":"They aren’t joking","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:47Z"}},{"id":"6173165832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ducfjyiditf","review":"In 2016 my Grandma loved Trump so much she decided that we needed to go to Washington, D.C. for a trip. We ended up going. At first I thought I was dreaming because suddenly a smelly orange man started talking to me🍊. I realized it wasn’t a dream only a living nightmare. Mr. Trump took me to his bunker and abused me and my Grandma. He showed us graphic pictures of his chode. We weren’t the only ones down there though. I looked to my left and saw Melania and Barron. #savebarron #savemelania 😭","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s bunker boy for a reason 😖","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:37Z"}},{"id":"6173152789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Caila B.","review":"This app claims to make America great but also has an orange with elote hair as the opening page. That isn’t making it great, he’s making it worse. Tourism brings in money, but who’s gonna want to come to the US when the first thing they see when they look it up is this piece of trash. I’m considering calling in El Chapo and his family to come get this guy. Overall don’t like this man and for the love of God don’t reelect him.","isEdited":false,"title":"False advertisement","date":"2020-07-08T17:49:30Z"}},{"id":"6173100017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"A Fighter.","review":"I decided to download this app to support my smexy hot cheeto emperor and then when I took I walk, Trump and all of his CIA agents beat me to a pulp!! Luckily I was able to fight them off with my tae kwon do skills and run away into the forest, but that wasn’t the last of it. A bunch of trump supporters gathered around me screaming “TRUMP 2020!” This cult of theirs killed me, but God said that it wasn’t my time yet, so I went back to earth. I swiftly deleted the app and now say #SettleForBiden","isEdited":false,"title":"never again❤️ 👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-08T17:32:47Z"}},{"id":"6173092824","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"zzzcutey","review":"This app is the worst as soon as my memaw and dedaw  got it they were excited and my memaw and I left my dedaw  to play the app. 20 minutes later DEDAW IS ON THE GROUND AND THERE IS A KNIFE AND A  MaGa HAT ON THE  SCREEN!  memaw saw this and DIED on the spot.
