So it was definitely a waste of time to download since it gave you a horrible view (I still have nightmares from looking at that orange face 😨). But I do still like our president, it’s not like he tried to ruin our lives a billion times 🙃.  I am so excited for when it’s his last day in the office because let me tell you it has been a hectic year already, and with him it just makes it so much better 😉🙃. I was going to go to his rally in June but I realized I had more important things to do like, catch up on my Obama readings. So overall this app is horrible and make sure you don’t let kids get it because it will give them nightmares! ✨🟠🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-08T15:29:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This needs no title"}},{"id":"6172460384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"OKA07","review":"I downloaded the app in the hopes of supporting my cheeto puff president but unfortunately it’s done nothing but cause problems for me. My phone is a liberal and when I downloaded this app, it immediately rejected it. It won’t download all the way and now I unfortunately can’t support the president. This app was causing tremendous glitching on my phone and now it won’t work well. I don’t blame my phone for not being a Trump supporter though. I’m so stressed because of all of the glitching going on with my phone and now I can’t fix it. Now instead of getting to support controversial president, I get to try and fix my glitching phone that seems too hot to safety handle. Thanks Trump. If I could give this app ZERO stars I 100% would. Tell the cheeto puff to do better from now on with phones that are liberalists.","date":"2020-07-08T14:25:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Liberal Phone"}},{"id":"6172380394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nasstasia Rio","review":"Hoping I would find something good to vote for trump I soon found that he is an orange trash bag that needed to be taken out a long time ago. He can take his bad ideas and throw them out the window like he does with all of his ✨good✨ employees. He cares about no one but the good of himself and I believe is a danger to society. Trump supporters will say it a ✨joke✨💀but I don’t remember him taking the job of a comedian he’s our president and this is why OBAMA will always be superior and my president whether he’s in office or not. I believe that he has the brain the size of a pea and he’s a bully to any race that doesn’t look like him. A president is supposed to be for equality but instead he is the one causing people to believe that discrimination is a good thing. ✨That’s why I will be voting for JOE BIDEN and you will be rotting in your bunker.✨","date":"2020-07-08T14:03:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨what a garbage waste of time✨"}},{"id":"6172297818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Winnifred..","review":"i got this app just a few hours ago 😿 and i was trying to set up the app, but right as i presses sign in my phone glitched... so i redid it and THIS TIME my phone completely broke, it exploded 😩😭😿😰 and now i blame you orange boot 🍊 i am claiming a law suit!!!!!!! my mom even doesn’t like the app, she told my auntie flo🩸 about it AND SHE DIED!!!! she had a heart attack right then and there!!!!!! like YOUR APP caused MY AUNT to DIE!!!!!!!!! this is gonna make multiple law suits because i am very needy and poor and i can not afford a new iphone or a new aunt, how am i gonna buy a new aunt now? what am i gonna do? i need a new aunt :( if anyone knows a good place to buy a new aunt let me know because i am in need... oh ANDDDDD the second my aunt flo died, MY PERIOD STOP!!!😹😁😌🥰 so thanks for stopping my period, but imma need a new aunt flo! 😿😢😾🥺 frick you orange boot 🍊","date":"2020-07-08T13:41:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"😾😿😔😭this app but i to my mom and bad"}},{"id":"6172273416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Balda Choker Poker","review":"i downloaded this app to see what was up with the pumpkin in the White House and two days after downloading it my grandpa called me and told me his pumpkins all were poisoned. then I went into my cabinet and so were mine. and then the next day the poison pumpkins came to life while I was sleeping and tried to attack my dog but luckily I’m a lightsleeper and I fought them off with my ninja skills I got from Hamilton.

MY FACE WAS SWELLING UP. but the strangest thing was that as soon as i closed the app i felt great again and the allergy was gone ✨ i was so confused but i refused to think that our cheeto looking president would do such a thing. i later on just had to accept that i’m allergic to this app 😖💔 it breaks my heart but i just wanted to share my experience so no one else has to go through it 😔 so please if anyone else is thinking about downloading this app, don’t do it unless you want to end up with a swollen face and throat 🙏🏼 🧡","date":"2020-07-09T18:46:44Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no ❤️✨ + i’m allergic to it 😔💔"}},{"id":"6177730053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"step chickenz","review":"The second I downloaded the app I felt something weird. I thought is was nothing but then I looked at my hand and it was orange. I freaked out and ran to my cat who also turned orange after I showed her a picture of our ✨wonderful✨ president. I ran and then I felt a hand grab me. I woke up in a white room and saw a poster in front of me that said 🥰Trump 2020🥰 I tried to scream but then I couldn’t. Then trump came into the room but then I showed him a picture but not a normal picture a picture of him that anonymous leaked (I’m not saying what is is cuz little kids came here from tiktok) then trump screamed like a little girl and then I deleted the app and I found myself back in my house with my cat. After countless hours of therapy, I am still traumatized. Please send help.....\n✨🧚🏻💅🏻trump 2020🙈✨🥰 but on a gravestone✌🏻✨❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:19:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I need Jesus"}},{"id":"6177525976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"black baddie","review":"I downloaded this app because I am a black female and love my racist rapist KING! But I knew this app was going to be quite troublesome I mean considering I knew trump was quite troublesome back in 2017 too. The app not only took two years to download but also another two years to even be functional. The fact that this app is even allowed baffles me, it’s a scam, it supports a racist homophobe sho has relations in human/child trafficking, he literally talked like a four year old when you ask him a question, there is no way that man is Christian, he is literally orange, it’s crazy how he hates black people but he isn’t even white himself like boy fix your tan before you come for my skin, and who lets a man put hay on his head like boy we all know it’s not real. This app is a disgrace to America and should be banned immediately !","date":"2020-07-09T17:15:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"ORANGE PEEL"}},{"id":"6177377565","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DeeJeeAitch","review":"So for some reason this app downloaded on my phone and I did not remember downloading it. Granted I do have Alzheimer’s disease so I thought “well I’ll check it out because it can’t hurt.” Right? WRONG!!!! This app hurt my eyes and confused me by asking for some numbers, I typed in ones I remembered but it wouldn’t work! My nephew had to come tell me what to put in, thank god he was visiting fixing my pills for the week. So once I get in I can’t even look because there is just a screaming in my ears coming from the phone! I exit the app quickly but it doesn’t stop!! And then I hear some words like “trump” and “vote” I smashed my phone in terror and only then did it stop!! I still hear the ringing in my ears! I’m writing this on my Samsung toilet paper and I won’t get a new phone for weeks! Thanks trump.","date":"2020-07-09T16:30:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Weird app?!"}},{"id":"6177372616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TheRoseWithThorns","review":"So I downloaded this because I love trump but this just takes the cake! I constantly got bombarded by spam, it just wouldn’t give me a break! And whenever I go on it it tells me I am a stupid fat rat that doesn’t deserve to live! I haven’t put my love in Donald trump to deserve this kind of hate! What kind of president has this kind of app! I want to see it off of the App Store this instant cause it can cause brain damage, just getting this app has made me stupider! All of my friends got this app because we all believe in OUR president but our iq has gone down! I didn’t know how that was possible because just supporting the president already makes us stupid but this just takes it to far! If this app doesn’t get taken off I will make sure to get the manager! This app is horrible!","date":"2020-07-09T16:29:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app! (Serious!)"}}]}
