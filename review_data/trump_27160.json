UNACCEPTABLE. I feel lip latex and that all my rights were taken away from me. Ban this app and get trump out of the White House, make America great again.","date":"2020-07-08T14:53:00Z","title":"Highly disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172531334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"NellyforBiden2020","review":"I spent only a few seconds on this app and it made me feel threatened for my life. Not to mention all the bad energy that came from using it. It attracted way to many bad spirits and bugs into my home. Worst app EVER, never again, let’s make a change for once!","date":"2020-07-08T14:44:55Z","title":"Does NOT work!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172525782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"durfj24","review":"This app gave my phone a virus. Shortly after downloading I noticed my phone was getting slower and slower and when I took it to get looked at they said this app was the reason. Eventually I couldn’t even use it anymore. Worst design ever. Don’t recommend","date":"2020-07-08T14:43:20Z","title":"Don’t download it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172500552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Gustal K","review":"Ever since I got this app it keeps crashing. When I could get it to stay open long enough, it made me put my information in, and now I keep getting all these spam calls. I am truly upset. Also this app is FULL of libtard propaganda. It even said that he’s not Christian 😮.","date":"2020-07-08T14:36:10Z","title":"Oh goodness me!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172478725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"abcdefgxyvxyz","review":"Personal information on the first page. Censorship. News that is full of falsities. And so many unfulfilled promises. It’s getting to the point that this man has been wrong so many times, I almost immediately think the opposite of anything he says is the truth.","date":"2020-07-08T14:30:14Z","title":"Are you kidding?","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172471372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"notyourmamadoityourself","review":"I don’t have the best WiFi around but even this app took wayyyy longer than ANY other app I’ve downloaded. Even when it was down the app itself wasn’t worth my time, it keep kicking me out back to my home screen. Would not recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T14:28:15Z","title":"Thumbs down","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172447623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"1!7,9'plymrc","review":"i refuse to follow or agree with anyone who believe that it is ok to treat anyone poorly, and these people treat all people of color, trans people, and other members of the LGBTQ+ community terribly. there is obviously something wrong with our government. neither rapists nor racist deserve platforms, and our current president is both.","date":"2020-07-08T14:21:52Z","title":"bad vibes 0/10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172422463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"notaorry","review":"This is with out a doubt the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. There was some creepy, old, rapist on the cover when the app opened. And I don’t support racists. On top of that this dude look like he woke up in Cheeto dust. And it said “make America great again,” but last I checked America was never great, So what’s the “again” for.","date":"2020-07-08T14:15:02Z","title":"Worst app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172401391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"stripegrace","review":"This app is so unorganized and not helpful whatsoever. It made me put in my credit card information and took a 10 advance without my permission!!!!! My phone was also very glitchy and not took all my storage. This app is a virus and shouldn’t be taken down along with its advocates.
