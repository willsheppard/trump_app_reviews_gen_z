But when It downloaded (which took 5 hours 🙄), I opened the app and It stared playing these exact lyrics...\n\n“I climbed out of my head\nAnd watched myself implode \nA thought without a body\nOught to be the shot to take a load off\nMy brain is poisoned \nAnd I’m searching for the antidote \nBut every time I find it \nMy defenses scream out “oh, no you don’t!”\nWOaH”\n\nDO YOU KNOW HOW TRAUMATIZING THAT IS! On top of that, It gave me a major headache, which was THE WORSE PAIN I have ever felt in my life. I wouldn’t wish that kind of pain on anyone. 10/10 wouldn’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T06:11:03Z","userName":"ifyfdedjicf I give up"}},{"id":"6175317139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worse app ever","review":"I got this app and my phone immediately ran out of battery. I am at 4% battery when I was at 50% one minute before downloading this app. Almost as if it’s draining my life battery. Anyway, the picture of this app is going to give me nightmares. And the T spinning looks like a Nazi sign. I just want to clarify I am NOT a Nazi. This is the worst app ever. Do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T05:58:00Z","userName":"WaKaalaa"}},{"id":"6175280958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I DONT LIKE THIS APP","review":"i made the biggest mistake getting this app... it made my dad realize he didn't want a family and leave.
