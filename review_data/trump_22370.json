It was difficult to use. Require personal information to even get in. There was no option to avoid entering personal info. I don’t want them knowing more than they need to!

I was trying to look for some style advise but instead i opened the app and saw a big orange dude who is racist, sexist, homophobic, and plenty more but i don’t have enough room to write that. He had terrible style he looks like he’s about to burst out of his suits and explode."}},{"id":"6177188190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:30Z","title":"who let this happen","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"All I want is red lipstick","review":"when i went on this app, there were spiders all over my floor!! only this app could’ve caused such madness. when i clicked an event, trumps face had a clown face!! but i’m okay with that🥰 all i have to say is, don’t blame tiktok. don’t blame tiktok. don’t blame tiktok. don’t blame tiktok. oh and, don’t ban tiktok!! don’t ban tiktok!! don’t ban tiktok!! don’t ban tiktok!! don’t ban tiktok!! tiktok is a coping space for some people and while it can be toxic, some people rely on viewers for the financial standing and some people need the safe place it is when they may not have it. get rid of this before tiktok luv❤️"}},{"id":"6177186297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:58Z","title":"gen z go hard","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Hsbdbbxbvd","review":"this app literally took 1 week to download. it traumatized my phone. and I open the app after it finally downloaded and I was faced with a cheeto. it was so terrifying, i nearly had a heart attack. i say just delete the app once and for all. see y’all at the rally... oh wait i think i had to walk my fish. 🥰🥰"}},{"id":"6177109401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:14:34Z","title":"Poor functionality","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"IguanoG","review":"The app is very slow on an iPhone 11 Pro and won’t let me even maneuver through the app. In addition, the app crashes a lot more than my own games and other high data-taking apps.

WILL end up shutting down your phone upon opening. Any other app would’ve been better. When entering the app it immediately shuts your phone off. After getting in for the 5th time or so, it was even more disappointing."}},{"id":"6177063328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:01:49Z","title":"Scary Orange Man 😟","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"susannah108","review":"when i saw this app floating around the app store i thought it said dump 2020 which i figured meant it was an app that showed you where to throw away your trash and i thought 2020 meant the vision so it was like look at trash with 20/20 vision but when i opened the app all i saw was a rotten orange man and it scared me half to death. please fix this.😔"}},{"id":"6177058488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:00:30Z","title":"Made my phone crash","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"haie. sobshsl","review":"After I downloaded this terrible app, it made my phone crash and glitch, until I deleted it.  When I downloaded the app, it gave me tons of viruses on my phone. This app also has a very bad set up and it’s so pathetic. Why is the president so cheap and he can’t make a better app boy bye"}}]}
