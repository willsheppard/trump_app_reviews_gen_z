An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...ProfessorMcGonagall.\n\n \n\nThe cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Good evening, ProfessorDumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?\n\n \n\nDumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad. \n\nMcGonagall: And the boy?\n\nDumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.\n\nMcGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\n\nAlbus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. \n\n \n\nThere is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.\n\nDumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?\n\nHagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.\n\n \n\nHagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are \n\nDumbledore: The only family he has.\n\n \n\nThey stop outside a house.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.\n\nDumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.\n\n \n\nHagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all. \n\n \n\nHagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.\n\n \n\nThe camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:","title":"🙈🙈"}}]}
