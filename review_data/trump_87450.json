I had heard so many fun things about it, but as soon as I went to open up the app after it downloaded, a minion came out and took me for his personal pleasure 🥴. YES!! right out my phone screen he then took me to what I thought was a minion $eX dungeon, but turned out was just victor seeking his revenge as Agnes killed his mother. Victor then looked into my chocolate brown as$ and asked “are you lost babygurl?” that’s when I knew it wasn’t victor it was the love of my life of i’d been searching for,gru. Right when I leaned in for a kiss the Backstreet Boys dropped kicked me in the throat and kidnapped my love gru. Sadly ripping off my *nsync merch in the process. I then went on a journey to look for him. A QUEST, you could say. I followed them and was led thru a door that led to the river dale set. I turned to see kJ appa fighting jiggly head so I stopped the fight and they immediately fell in love with me. They were head over heels. The sexy security guard led me out on his rolling scooter🛴.I will never forget his name, Paul blart, his smell, how he gracefully grabbed me, his hands up against my arms his heavenly heavy breath down my ear... ugh so hot. Then right before my eyes he threw me out the door which led to a one direction concert. Right then I noticed all these girls going crazy but that’s when I knew, “I’m not like every other girl”. I decided to take out my cat in the hat x fifty shades of Grey novel and read it throughout the entire concert. Harry styles then pulled me up and said “your different not like every other girl” so we proceeded to get engaged. At our wedding I remember what my mother told me “you know sweetheart you should settle down and marry a rich man” I murmured under my breath as I was standing face to face with Harry as he was saying his vows, “mom I am a rich man” I then took out my kill bill sword from under my dress, which I had just in case I needed it, and slit Harry styles in the throat. In the background bill Joel’s “white wedding” playing as I did this all in slow motion. There it was. I was the runaway bride. What have I come to? One minute I was just downloading a fun game for me and my family to play together to forget the fact we’re broken and in debt, the next I was running away from my problems. This is one of the many reasons I I would not recommend this app to the public. There are so many more flaws such as it promising for me to be able to go thru boo’s door one last time and instead it took me to a room with Randal! Then don’t even get me started on this sh!tty pool playing I swear Merida tried turning me into an ACTUAL BEAR because she lost a game against me the Dean Winchester. That’s what that curly headed Twinkie gets for adding plus 4 to me. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my wonder pets. Instead I gave them up for adoption to the backyard agains. My brother Sam wasn’t an option because of his kink for that type of stuff. God Sammy, why?! At the end of the day I still have my beautiful wife’s, Ellen degenerous, and Mattia Poblio. This app was definitely not worth my v!rgin!ty. #kairiwasabetterdaddy #captinunderpantieslives #bringbacklegalizingmonopolymoney #lotteria #countryboyiloveyou #takuachecuh #fruityintheb00ty #cornonthecob #letmer!deyourface #istolemonopolycards #roadworkaheadyeaisurehopeitdoes #youshouldhabekilledoffannifrom13reasonswhyseasons3-4 #elsa x jackfrost #janeandthedragon #jacobtootoo #babyshark #popseeko #pearly #artzooka","isEdited":false,"userName":"AnonUser736","title":"Reasons for dysfunctionality","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:09:06Z"}},{"id":"6178245561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This orange big ball of crap doesn’t deserve an app","isEdited":false,"userName":"hunkahunkalicker265780","title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:07:11Z"}},{"id":"6178235743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"app started to slow down my phone...had to call apple support","isEdited":false,"userName":"ckdkso","title":"my review","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:38Z"}},{"id":"6178234640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP GAVE ME A VIRUS!!
