DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","isEdited":false,"title":"NO!!!"}},{"id":"6175677365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:14:08Z","rating":1,"userName":"fjcjfjdns","review":"as soon as the app downloaded, three ninjas with trump hats smashed through my window and attempted to arrest me for being bisexual. I managed to fight them off with the help of my pet snake, and in the process I unmasked them and realized that they were all white. After they left I had to clean up the broken glass and since trump got rid of medical protections for lgbt people I had to stitch up my wounds myself. Plus the app was glitchy.","isEdited":false,"title":"SAD"}},{"id":"6175614773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"becky w the good hair😍😍","review":"I was having a good day today.

I’m not tryna let this man take my rights away and trust me we won’t let him. The racism, sexism, homophobia and overall hate and lack of education makes me sick. Anyway I love Aoc and Bernie and they will forever be my role models. Biden2020! Don’t forget to vote you guys!","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m extremely offended 🤡💕✨🧚🏽"}},{"id":"6175137959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:51:40Z","rating":1,"userName":"jessiperez123","review":"idek what to say, this app was the wackiest thing I have ever seen. I went to work one day and worked a 13 hour shift and then I got home all tired. I saw there was an app for my Cheeto puff looking president and wanted to get it but once I got it, it detected I was Mexican so it put a wall in between me and my phone. My phone is now broken so I am currently typing this out of one of my local libraries computers","isEdited":false,"title":"disappointed.."}},{"id":"6175106064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"big fat juicy bussy","review":"this is a bad app, when i downloaded it my phone started playing gangnam style and wouldn’t stop! then it started playing alvin and the chipmunks parodies, AND then it started playing dixie damelios new song and this went on for about seventy years then it finally stopped! but then i got burger king and a mcflurry it was really good. a little on the sweet side but overall it was very good but this app is the opposite of good it is bad very bad 😾😾 anyways ✨ACAB✨","isEdited":false,"title":"BÜËŸÙŠ"}}]}
