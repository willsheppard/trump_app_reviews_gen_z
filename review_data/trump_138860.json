That’s when I realized it was bc of this app. This app isn’t worthy at all and this app didn’t help me at all. I feel like the Obama app was wayyyy better hehehhehe #blacklivesmatter.  I heard that the government controls everything if u have this app I would never download this app again.

I am truly and utterly disappointed with this app. Do not waste your time hitting download. It took 20 hrs to download and even after that it asked me for my personal information! What happened to privacy and freedom in America! I should have to input my PERSONAL INFO on a public app. You are more than likely to get scammed through this app do not bother.","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6179678893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tomi Lahren","review":"I don’t know if it’s from all of the people downloading it, but I couldn’t use it at all, I think I will have nightmares after seeing such an atrocity in my screen.","rating":1,"title":"Glitching"}},{"id":"6179678858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:52:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trump that B","review":"Won’t work keeps freezing","rating":1,"title":"Horrible"}}]}
