I was hoping to see updated information on what  new idiotic thing trump did but instead I got some stupid stuff on how trump is handling this world situation well. Also I hated that I had to put in personal info news apps are supposed to give you news not know your personal information. After one or two days I developed a virus on my phone and it originated in the this app. It is a horrendous app. If also accessed all the personal information on my phone and I counts control what my phone was doing. At one point the screen wouldn’t respond at all and my phone wouldn’t charge. Also whenever I texted anyone it would say Trump 2020 my friends thought that I went crazy because they know I would never say that. Also this app uses the American flag just like the rest of trumps stuff using the American flag on t-shirts, hats, bumbler stickers, ect. which is illegal.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","date":"2020-07-10T05:26:35Z","rating":1,"userName":"catlover23527"}},{"id":"6179605112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is stinky poop poop","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad","date":"2020-07-10T05:26:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"rizsim"}},{"id":"6179604599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i first opened the app a dirty orange popped up","isEdited":false,"title":"absolute disappointment","date":"2020-07-10T05:26:24Z","rating":1,"userName":"stream fine line 🥺"}},{"id":"6179604518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible app don't download keeps crashing my phone","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","date":"2020-07-10T05:26:22Z","rating":1,"userName":"Amin M.Z"}}]}
