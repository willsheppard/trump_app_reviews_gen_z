We are not pleased with effects that it has created. It turned my brother into a mushroom, my mother into a green lizard, my fridge to an apple. What else am I supposed to eat other than an apple. The orange guy may tell you otherwise but this is app is straight awful. Please rethink this app before downloading. Please survive out there. Good luck.","date":"2020-07-08T23:01:42Z"}},{"id":"6174028622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leelee(#^.^#)","title":"dIsGuStInG🤢","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"the first thing i see when i open the app is this big Cheeto man, that was just uncalled for.

I said no out loud thinking I was alone, until I heard a raspy Cheeto voice telling me “I SAID NOW”. I asked who said that as the voice coming from my iPhone 8 said “I DID, NOW DO IT”. I am scarred and traumatized from this incident, and now have to go to therapy because my parents think I’m going crazy. They are watching us.... DO NOT GET THIS APP.","date":"2020-07-08T22:32:05Z"}},{"id":"6173955365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"goodluckcharlie67","title":"Danger!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened this app my phone began to overheat and glitch.

Anyhooo good luck Charlie 😌","date":"2020-07-08T22:31:18Z"}},{"id":"6173940550","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BobLeBootyBuilder","title":"RUINED MY LUSHES BOOTY","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First off i work hard to get a big booty and take pride in my work but when i opened the app I could feel my booty deflating and i broke into tears on my floor then out of the corner of my eye i saw my dogs booty also deflating.

Oranges used to be my favorite fruit, I would eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.. this app made me lose my passion for my favorite fruit. Now whenever I see a orange I throw up. DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! Not only will it mess up your phone but it will also mess up your appetite.","date":"2020-07-08T22:24:49Z"}},{"id":"6173932270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"terrible donald trump","title":"Absolutely terrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So first off, I opened up the app to see a beautiful picture of the president but instead I saw an ugly rotten rusty musty dusty orange guy with blonde hair ,I wanted to throw up. I went outside to walk my pet fish because he needed to burn those calories. Then I went back in the app and there he was again so I ran to my parents and said that I saw an ugly mole rat and they screamed and said don’t go back in that app ever again.","date":"2020-07-08T22:22:42Z"}}]}
