My friends made a better functioning app in high school. Cinnamon Hitler claims to be an expert on many things, app making isn’t one. The Chinese spyware known as TikTok is better constructed. Bunker boy is a pedo, white supremacist, homophobic, transphobic, rapist, and all in all piece of crap. Who has the vocabulary of a fourth grade. Also who is the app for? Racist boomers supporters probably can’t use a landline let alone a smartphone. And 95% of millennials and Gen Z can’t stand him. I’m just here to ruin a racist’s day. Have fun on Saturday with 0.6% of expected turnout.","date":"2020-07-09T04:58:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible App for a Terrible president"}},{"id":"6175152286","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"not for trump anymore","review":"I thought this app would be amazing since the person who made it is rich af😐 I was wrong!! When I got this app I had to pay $50 and I was like “oh okay” and I still payed for it because I love my president and I would like to keep up with him BUT then it started making me pay so many things and it has A TON on notifications, at least 50 a minute. The worst thing that happened was that it took up so much GB that it deleted EVERYTHING from my phone, I wasn’t happy. If you get this app make sure you don’t. This is why I give it 1 star, I expected so much from you pelo de elote.","date":"2020-07-09T04:56:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"NOT WORTH THE SPACE"}},{"id":"6175140343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"laichitaa","review":"I downloaded this apps to show support to my BeLoVeD trump and get details about his campaign. But when I got it, the app froze for like an hour 🤬🤬. I un downloaded and redownloaded but it just froze. The app started glitching and sending me weird notifications. So I decided to delete but once I deleted, my phone was acting all weird and shut down outta no where. I thought maybe it died and i charged it. And it turned on, but it showed that it had 69% I noticed that my phone was full of notifications of this app even tho I deleted. I still get some. ITS THE WORST. PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP. IT WILL GLITCH YOUR PHONE.","date":"2020-07-09T04:52:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP ON EARTH 😡🤬"}},{"id":"6175083314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Auntie Ungie","review":"This app is filled with bigly hate speech. Trump calls people names! Not good for the presidunce of the free world! America has had enough of his hateful language... he is a fascist and hates all non whites!!! Has never acknowledged the murder of George Floyd! Why? Cause in his hate filled heart he sides with the racist cop that supported his campaign! Don’t waste your time on this unless you too are a racist pig that takes the 🍊side.  He is nothing but a bag of excuses for all he has done. Hey let’s ruin the environment and take away a woman’s right to her own body!!! The man is a pig and I can’t wait till Nov 3rd!  Vote people, our lives depend on it!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:33:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Hate filled app"}},{"id":"6174999954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"haiamwklk","review":"I’m gonna I was just thinking that I was just gonna was the day I was just thinking of y’all and you guys are so gorgeous I love y’all and you have too many people to talk about you know how you gonna act and I don’t know how y’all feel about it but I gotta worry is you just wanna talk about to you and I know I don’t want to it’s not just cause you know what you mean you’re not mad I don’t want to it’s me I just don’t want to be with me I gotta forgive me you know what you wanna I love y’all and you know what you wanna I was like you were gonna was a great time I wanna know how?

Plus it wasn’t giving me updates on about the campaign it wasn’t giving me news resources he didn’t even tell me the policies that Trump was going to in act it didn’t give me any rallies near me it was just not good at all. I honestly think that my experience with this app has turned me into becomingA liberal, as much as I hate to say it.","date":"2020-07-09T02:49:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible"}}]}
