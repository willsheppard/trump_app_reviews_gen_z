Very weird coincidence! But anyways with that backstory this app must be broken because all I saw after opening it was the picture of an old crusty rotten Cheeto! Extremely disturbing it scared me and my 69 children! Do not download! It endorses supersize me McDonald’s and the Karen’s.","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179377409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"natalie zavala","isEdited":false,"title":"Ugh","review":"Stinky app 😠 it made my eyes burn and I had to pour bleach on them","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179377356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"J_iskey","isEdited":false,"title":"Viruses","review":"So when I downloaded this app I got 3 viruses immediately it cost $20 to fix","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179377295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tiktok Teens drop the mic","isEdited":false,"title":"OVERGROWN OOMPA LOOMPA’s app is 🗑","review":"This is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded, i got corona!!🤮 I was just minding my business listening to our national anthem “Donald Trump is a white supremacist, if you vote for him again, you’re a white supremacist”, yk the truthful song of our nation, when his ugly face popped out of the screen. He violently spit on me and told me to go back to Mexico. I wasn’t even born there silly goose. As a result of his onion breath spit, i got the corona virus because he does not wear a mask. This is a very difficult subject to talk about, it scarred me for life, not only did i have to see his putrid face (which cause me to barf multiple times) but i also got Covid-19. I don’t think it’s safe for orange trolls to have apps so this should be removed immediately. Also he is racist, thank you and have a good night. #settleforbiden2020 #avoteforkanyeisavotefortrump #savebarron","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:48Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179377328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"juziepoo","isEdited":false,"title":"Hacked all my info, started a virus","review":"Honestly so disappointed, trump is supposed to stand for the people!

He looks inept, weak, and honestly like he could use a shot of espresso. His eyes read pain and humiliation, almost as if he realized he is the glitch.","date":"2020-07-10T04:09:45Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179377061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Chi Chi / C.C","isEdited":false,"title":"Don't download.","review":"This was nice and all, but they deleted all of my important emails.
