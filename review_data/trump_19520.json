But every night the app held me a gun point and made me do this ritual around a trump 2020 flag. Like a hoo ha hoo ha hoo ha ha ha. One night i refused to do it and the app took my secret army of obama 😛💕🥰✨🥴 cardboard cutouts and burned them in front of me in my own backyard. I had to sit there and watch in terror.

It took forever to download and kept crashing. With all of its poorly structured arguments. It was full of homophobic, racist and hypocritical ideas. Make America Great again? More like make America white again. Overall, very unsatisfied. The app required a phone number? Who has that so I will be going on tiktok.
