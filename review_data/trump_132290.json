Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

The imagery was so vile that I immediately filled my adult diaper to the brim with half digested Diet Coke. I was a proud 65 year old supporter until I was forced to see this, my wife Janine said she’d had enough of my **** and that I wasn’t allowed to have Fox News on anymore. After I turned off the TV I looked outside and realized that systematic racism, global warming, children being kept in cages, and other obscene human rights issues exist right under our noses. The only positive of this app is that it made me realize the bare minimum knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs that the average highschool model UN student has is more than any trump support ever will.","userName":"(Marilyn)36","title":"Made me poop myself","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:43:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173987062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽","userName":"trumps small snail","title":"bad Cheeto man","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:43:19Z","isEdited":false}}]}
