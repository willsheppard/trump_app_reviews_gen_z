However I was only met with disappointment when the home page was a full blown naked orange man. That alone would earn 2 stars. However the driving point to one star was the app continuously giving pop ups on why I should vote. One star, don’t recommend","userName":"Ndjdhdbvd bsbdbdhd bush","title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6173179352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:57:58Z","review":"This app was so frustrating I was about to throw my phone at my wall. It took WAYYYYY too long to download, the amount of ads is ridiculous, and not to mention I had to download it TWICE! It somehow deleted off of my phone and I had to go back and get it again. I expect more from the president of the United States. UNEXCEPTABLE! Plz delete. Thank you.

I mean, we all know Trump has repeatedly shown a complete lack of moral compass or empathy, but I thought he could at least care enough to make a decent app. Just kidding, I expected nothing else from arguably the most despicable human ever elected to presidency in the United States. Anyways, have a nice day🙃","userName":"Little_Diva","title":"Terrible quality"}},{"id":"6173092270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:30:16Z","review":"This has to be one of the WORST apps I’ve ever downloaded! First of all, it only has one purpose: Trump! And I’m getting sick and tired of this conceited news! Second of all, I thought this was gonna be a decent app but nooo! Finally, I hate this app and I believe you shouldn’t purchase it because it’s absolute garbage. Like whoever made it shouldn’t be proud.

It took all my personal info, AND sold it to many other companies. I now have 30 companies with my number, email, name, and my billing info. I am sick of Trump and his fraud. I will not be voting for him this year. I am so sick of this racist, sexist, homophobic bastard. I will not be voting for him this year.

Then my toxic republican betta fish started to sound just like Donald trump during our mid afternoon tea/chat session. So I asked why he was talking like this and then he “I got the Chinese virus” I was very angry with him and put him In time out in his bunker.
