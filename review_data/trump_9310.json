Not only did my parrot attack me merciless for making such a choice but to make matters worse HE ALSO BIT MY FINGER OFF?!?? The app took hours to download and when it finally did it wouldn't open up. I’m disappointed I wont able to see the patriotic NOT fake news has made this app number 1 for news. Anyways make america great again by getting rid of the orange peel. Dont 4get 2 rate!","isEdited":false,"userName":"rot in hell orange","title":"Had high hopes","date":"2020-07-09T15:47:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177017637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took an incredibly long time to load. It had unprofessional graphics, and was difficult to navigate. I was surprised to see how simplistic, amateur, and unpresidential the graphics were. It sent me hundreds of notifications, none of which were remotely informative. Overall, this is one of the worst campaign strategies he’s come up with. Hope something changes soon because this app is doomed without some sort of remodeling.","isEdited":false,"userName":"sabrina.ned","title":"Sucky","date":"2020-07-09T14:49:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176964685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took an eternity to download. I was very excited to get the app, so I can learn about upcoming events and all things Donald trump ❤️. However, every time I tried opening it the app would crash. It would also cause my phone to overheat and the battery drained. I’d try and try and try to open the app; because I’m a devoted trump supporter. So, you could only imagine how upset and saddened this made me. Please get this awful app off the App Store.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Asesino2012tj","title":"Not very good at all.

After it finally downloaded I realized that this app was to support some orange oompa loompa dude who is so racist, misogynistic, and a former rapist. I found the app totally impossible to navigate. The organization in the app itself is terrible and so hard to follow. I looked at the reviews after to realize that I was not the only one who was having trouble with this awful app. If I could rate this app zero starts I would.","isEdited":false,"userName":"JJstar702177","title":"Horrible✨🧚\u200D♀️💖💫😘","date":"2020-07-09T14:23:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176885240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what the hype was all about when suddenly I got a notification about my information being stolen from me!!! This had never happened before I downloaded this app and honestly it has caused me so much trama. This app even started recording me in my PRIVATE TIME. This app even R*PED ME! I was sitting on my stool and all of a sudden my phone began shaking vigorously from notifications from this app. If I could rate this 0 stars I would.

I sat down and my phone started talking to me. It’s said if you don’t support trump then they will kidnap me, Charli D’Amelio, Chase Hudson ,and Addison Rae. I was so scared . So I got my sister and told peppa pig and we got in our car and was backing out of the drive way . Then we see a trump face in the camera. So we didn’t know what to do. We called the police department and they came and killed peppa and made us eat her. I am so traumatized.","isEdited":false,"userName":"??? angel","title":"I HATE IT","date":"2020-07-09T13:40:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176678048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"sup trump, i just wanted to let you know man. as our president of the US of A.... you stink man. like old white man sweat. i don’t know how if you literally don’t do anything all day. like cmon son take a shower. well anyways don’t delete tik tok. and if the secret service sees this. don’t come to my house. this review is not that serious or deep. just go ahead and hack my icloud and delete the review. don’t come to my house :/ anyways ....
