His tax cuts have helped the 1% and corporations and have increased the national debt. He has defied the very values of his party by expanding government and is a disgrace to the American people.","date":"2020-07-08T14:11:32Z"}},{"id":"6172397480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"who is this man?","userName":"justwokeup2w","isEdited":false,"review":"i was in a coma since 2013, and last time i checked barack obama was our president— but when i woke up ( two weeks ago ), i found this orange man in office saying some crude things on twitter! twitter! youre ‘our president’, be a little more professional than that! anyways. i wanted to learn more about him and how he’s running office, so i downloaded the app. it kicked me out multiple times and would not load and made my phone glitch. then, when i got in and put my number in— they texted me and called me a cripple. if i could give this app 0/5 stars, i would.","date":"2020-07-08T14:08:15Z"}},{"id":"6172252169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful","userName":"qwertymouse","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to show my parents with them, not against them but, I did download the app, shut down them all.

If you just sign up for his texts, they provide a bunch of information. It also says the election is on November 3rd, when it’s actually November 4th, which is odd. Also, there are a lot of pictures of Trump and it’s repulsive. Do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T13:16:59Z"}}]}
