I blocked the number but it won’t stop 😡. Also the app made my cat scared and she ran away from my house. She’s upset because she doesn’t like trump 😤. I tried to convince her to like trump but she said no and ran away when i downloaded it. I deleted it within 2 minutes because my entire family became paralyzed when i downloaded it with fear. They don’t support trump either smh. Also the cockroaches under my bed started to come out and go to my phone. I guess the roaches support trump. Please fix your app and delete it from existence 🥺.","date":"2020-07-08T18:59:29Z","userName":"zvbdhj"}},{"id":"6173349963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER !!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is soo horrible ! it glitches worse than vanellope from Wreck-It Ralph. I also have to complain about the screen you see while opening the app. America was not and will never will be great. Instead of telling people to go back to your country and keeping people out , you should start packing with us because last time I checked..... this isn’t your land NOR your country. and it’s sad childish and miserable for you to use your platform to silence and destroy us and our voices when the poc did nothing but try to be peaceful and nice. But everything happens for a reason and we will gladly be watching you and your racist supporters rot in hell 🥰💗","date":"2020-07-08T18:54:12Z","userName":"30_Curry"}},{"id":"6173308590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I got this app to keep in touch with our wonderful hot cheeto president and I regret to say that this app does not live up to the expectations, and honestly the bare minimums. I mean, you would think with the way he is running this country, at least the app would be good right? Sadly it is not. This app took nearly 2 hours to download and my wifi has been working perfectly fine. Not only that, but the app continued to repeatedly glitch and there were certain moments when it would just shut down. I am quite disappointed, but then again no one should expect anything of high quality from our lovely orange president, Donald Trump.","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:09Z","userName":"Dissapointing Honestly"}},{"id":"6173226812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Yikes","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was prompted through a Facebook ad to download this app. This app is buggy & froze my phone up. I was hoping to find a reason to vote red this election, but this broken, decroded, non-functional joke of an app was the last straw. I’m pretty sure it installed spyware on my phone because all my other apps started acting buggy as soon as I installed it - and this is a brand new phone that functioned PERFECTLY before. Half of my settings are displaying in Russian now and I can’t fix it. I’m gonna have to wipe the whole drive, which means taking it to the Apple store and spending money I don’t have. Wish I could rate 0 stars. This app doesn’t belong in the App Store.","date":"2020-07-08T18:13:31Z","userName":"YvesAdele"}},{"id":"6173218704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app RUINED my life","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I thought this app would be a good patriotic thing to interact with on the 4th of July. BOY WAS I WRONG. Not only does the app glitch every second, it also sends me inappropriate notifications at least once a minute that refuse to leave the screen. It even told me to become a vegetarian because I was eating bacon too much. No one gets to tell me to stop eating pigs. Then, the app hacked my bank account and stole all my money, and hacked my WiFi and turned my Alexa against me, making her insult my grandmother in her own home, before unlocking all my doors and letting pedophiles in to steal ALL of my things. Now, I’m homeless, I have no money left, and my grandmother hates me.","date":"2020-07-08T18:10:49Z","userName":"breadwithbutterandsalt"}},{"id":"6173174484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️never again (bee movie script)❤️✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

The only good reason was for me not❌ to vote for him. Which I think would make America GREAT again😺👍. Our overall economy 💴 would be better and maybe Trump supporters will actually be  able to get good education 📚 for once in their lives🙀. I really do wish that they get some good education 📚and learn that separating families is NOT❌okay and that all family’s need to be together.

Not only did it take so long to download (even with good wifi), it also glitches on almost every page. It was a waste of time and effort. Also, I’m pretty sure the app gave me bronchitis. That’s how bad it was. I just wanted to get easy updates about my president but now I can’t breathe and I cough every time I go into the app! I thought it was just me so just to be sure, I showed my dog the app, and now my dog has AIDS! YES YOU READ CORRECTLY! THE APP GAVE MY DOG AIDS! Now I need to spend my limited money on my bronchitis and dog aids medication. As if 2020 couldn’t get any worse. So disappointing! Please reconsider getting this app. If I could give a 0 star review I would!","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:18Z","userName":"LadyMRod"}}]}
