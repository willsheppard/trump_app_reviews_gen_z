Everywhere I go I see Cheeto man one time I went to Starbucks and the person taking my order was BIG CHEETO MAN right then and there my eyes fell out so I hopped onto my shoe and went home I then proceeded to bleach my fallen out eye balls and once my eyes were back in my eye sockets I looked in the mirror and guess what I saw it was BiG cHeEtO mAn and this app was then installed into my dog so my dog was talking in Siri voice and describing big Cheeto mans photos I was horrified and then I thought “isn’t big Cheeto man the orange version of big chungus? Then I smacked myself and thought “no that’s so mean to compare Big chungus to Cheeto man” I then got on my phone and I knew the only way to stop this horrific dream of mine was to delete the app so without hesitation I deleted this app and gave it a bad review! And you should do the same!","title":"MUST READ","userName":"moonlightbirdy","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:31:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173932758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira.

I spent about an hour scouring the app and by the time I was done I was hysterically crying. This app has exposed trump and his entire administration for being dumb, ugly, fat liars. If I’ve learned anything after using this app it’s that our country is doomed under this administration. After being exposed to these truths I started to do research on trump as I’ve never really seen anything about him because as a previous trump supporter I was brain dead and ignorant to anything bad that this man has done. BUT WHEW LET ME TELL YOU. Trump is ACTUALLY a horrible human being. Even me, a rich white boy who lives off of my daddy’s money am not protected by trump. He only wants to protect his billionaire friends and he is running this country into the ground to do so. Fellow whites, if you really want to make America great again then I suggest you vote this man out in November🇺🇸","title":"I’d rather vacuum the ocean","userName":"Weirdoswagg14","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:00:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173760921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I love Donald J Trump and despite the fact that I support that he should have the power to decide wether or not a woman can birth a child out of her uterus I think this app is not worth it. As soon as I downloaded it ominous music started playing then a blindfold was put over my eye. When I finally woke there was a large tv in front of me and the clip playing was video of Donald trump talking about how he would date his daughter. Then multiple of him making sexual remarks about young ladies started to play. When the video was over the screen was wheeled away and a large circle formed around me. People in suits with red ties danced around me and held bright orange candles. When they finished there satanic dance where they chanted “blacks are lazy” Donald Trump revealed himself. He then brought out Barron who was screaming for him to stop and he made Barron watch me undergo minority conversion therapy. I am now a middle aged white man who believes in minority stereotypes and I beat my wife\n-Ped O Phile","title":"Worst app ever","userName":"Ped O Phile","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:18:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173679867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app so horrible and you should never download it!! If I could I would leave it a NEGATIVE five stars I would! At first I thought all the negative reviews were a trick from the best generation 🧚\u200D♀️✨ Gen Z🧚\u200D♀️✨but I was mistaken, it truly is a horrible app!! When I downloaded it, it asked me for my phone number in order to create an account. I didn’t think much of it and typed in my phone number. It then proceeded to ask for more personal information such as my address, bank account info, social security number and much more👁👄👁. After I proceeded to not give the information the app got angry and caused a virus on my phone!! I read another review saying this app is cursed and I 110% agree. The app cursed my cat and killed it in front of me! My uncle downloaded this app and got COVID-19 because of it😷. I believe this app is why people are getting ill and getting coronavirus 😱! Please don’t download this app and support the fellow 🍊!!!","title":"NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP🤬🤬!!!!","userName":"🧚\u200D♀️✨Cheetohater123🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:48:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173590255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For one trump talking about “make America great again” and he never did. If Hillary Clinton was here everything would of ran perfectly smooth. And he racist too the African American population and to the Hispanics as well..and he’s a rapist..we can not and will not have some one like him to be our president in 2020 and never in years. And seems to call black people thugs. He is doing nothing but  trying to do good stuff because he doesn’t want to make him self look bad in front of the world. When we already know he has already done that. I don’t even under stand why they make an app all about him but never made an app of all the other presidents we had before him. This app doesn’t even need to exist and now he’s trying to delete Tiktok just because people are telling the real truth about him..people need to know. And I gave this app a one star this app doesn’t even need a one star it needs no starts at all.","title":"Get rid of this app","userName":"Corra 💕✅🌏","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173428060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My name is Yoshikage Kira.

Right after downloading it the FBI exploded my walls. They took all the Mexican children I was hiding in my basement. It was so unfair the agents dragged them out by their pinky fingers and threw them in the back of a ice cream truck. So logically I followed it until I got to an old factory in the middle of the woods. I went inside only to find out they were making the children into bricks for Trumps wall. Personally I found this wrong, but I didn’t care that much because it didn’t effect me so I took my favorite Mexican child, Maria, and ran. We went back home but just when u thought we were safe I got a message from the app that said give us the Mexican. So I did the only logical thing and blew up my phone. Me and Maria ended up ok but I don’t recommend the app. Other then all the other stuff it was a little glitchy and kind of boring.","title":"Terrible Trump","userName":"kateyytyyyyyyyyyyshdhbf","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:14:37Z","rating":1}}]}
