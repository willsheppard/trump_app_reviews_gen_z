I guess 2016 is the year it all went wrong but let’s keep things recent. Starting with how the app didn’t even open up. After a few days it finally opens up just to disappoint. It’s glitchy, and annoying. Freezes up all the time. It’s sentences don't even make sense?? Who’s idea was this? This is the worst use of time energy money and probably tears that has been put into an app. Hopefully it can be kicked out of offic- I mean the App Store asap!!"}},{"id":"6173272663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"xx deleted","date":"2020-07-08T18:28:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"How could they DO THIS?????","review":"I was sooooooo excited to download this app, but when it downloaded completely, my phone shut off and wouldn’t turn back on for 6 nights! Then when it did turn on, both my lock and home screen were pictures of very graphic hentai!!! I when I went to my camera roll to replace the image, all my photos had been deleted and replaced with MORE HENTAI!!!!! The only reason I gave one star was because they did have diversity in the hentai and I appreciated having at least that."}},{"id":"6173270507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nickkkknammme","date":"2020-07-08T18:27:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"INAPPROPRIATE","review":"I downloaded this to support the amazing Cheeto for President but as soon as it finished downloading five days later, I started getting pop up ads on my phone. These ads included porn. Now my kids use my phone to play learning games and I don’t want them to see that. I deleted the app and they still popped up every minute. So I had to get a new phone AND a new Apple ID. I do not recommend getting this app or voting for a president that glitches your phone and doesn’t know the difference from work and private life."}},{"id":"6173190510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Save Baron","date":"2020-07-08T18:01:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"😳 wow 🧐","review":"So today started out as a great day and I saw this app for our wonderful 🍊 Cheeto puff president and I was delighted ! 🤪 but as soon as I saw the app orange liquid started flowing out of my phone 😫 of course I try to ignore it and keep going through this amazing ? App but as I looked next to me I see our very own president p3do, rpist, racist, homophobic thing trying to ensure I vote for him 😳 We may stan ? you but bribing me with an orange cake ? Like what I’m already over weight and he was covered from head to toe in that orange liquid 😖 Terrible app I would never recommend.

I opened the app while chilling with my dog, but then when I tried speaking all that came out was a ruff! 😾🙀 And then I took some cough medicine to see if I had developed a sore throat. This is when it gets crazy! A squirrel 🐿 had ran across my lawn and I started making whatever sounds they make! The only way I could go back to english was by deleting the app after looking at people! So, NEVER USE THIS APP"}},{"id":"6173079856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jensbskdkwbsh","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download this!!!!!","review":"I got this to educate myself on trump, and it took a full two days to download, and now when I open it it’s open for about 3 minutes before it either starts glitching, kicks me out, or turns my phone off by itself. And it’s not my phone either because on the same day I downloaded another and their has been no problems. I think apple needs to delete this app, I’m afraid it’s going to give my phone a virus with how glitchy the app is, it needs a software update or SOMETHING."}},{"id":"6173046190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🚫🧢....","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"What the hell","review":"worst app ever....\n\ncops showed up to my door (with a random black family) after i deleted this and forced me to download it again. they said if i didnt they would shoot the family they took captive! so i downloaded it again and i cant delete it now so its stuck on my phone i dont know how to get rid of it, my phone is now super laggy and my apps dont work?! so i did the logical thing and got a new phone, cops showed up AGAIN and said they said they didnt see any recent activity on my phone so i asked how they knew that....... \n\nthey said they had been watching my phone screen for the last few days and looking at  my location \n\nthey also told me too write a 5 star review or else they are gonna shoot my whole family and so im breaking my phone, changing my name, and moving FAR AWAY \n\n!!!!!!!SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173033340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dyan Regester","date":"2020-07-08T17:11:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"just awful","review":"I downloaded this app in an attempt to see what my grandparents were going on and on about but turns out it’s just awful, it keeps rerouting me to this annoying orange lookin dude who I guess is our president ?? it honestly beats me why anyone would download this app. don’t get it it’s not worth all the trouble. they need to do some serious updating. maybe they should base it off of someone more like able and less orange, like literally anyone else. the app would do so much better. I 0/10 do NOT recommend this app."}}]}
