I’m sorry but the things I’ve seen on this app are beyond scary. I can’t even begin to imagine who this person is. When I first opened the app satan himself came through the screen grabbed my dog and ripped him open. Then he proceeded to curse and enslave me. I am now in hell serving his lordship.

It took 3 days to download, and right when I opened the app I fell into a horrible cardiac arrest because of the terrifying, disgusting orange MONSTER they put on the front cover. I then couldn’t sleep for months. Every time I blink I see this disgusting monster. Delete the app immediately, I’m now having to take therapy to recover from this flabbergasting incident.","title":"HORRIBLE.","isEdited":false,"userName":"susan3311"}},{"id":"6172898281","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:41Z","review":"When I tried to download the app it took all my data!

To think that it would do what it says is OUT OF THIS WORLD. This app is out of control, not only did it try and get my personal information to mind control me but it started popping up in all my other apps not letting me use them. This app is facist!!!

Absolutely acceptable!!!! and that’s not all. When I was on there, they where asking for my personal information. I should be able to be on this app without people asking for my personal information. Adding on to that. There are TONS of communists on this app,rasists,homophobic, and sexist people here. This is VERY disgusting and disappointing.😡 do not download this app!!!!!","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"sihdandosjsjx"}},{"id":"6172797681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:59:56Z","review":"I read the reviews and saw how the app itself had caused death and was reluctant to download it, only to find that anyone who downloaded it would be filled with ignorant information about how helpful or nice our president is. I hope that no one under or over the legal age to votes get this app it’s incredibly misleading and shouldn’t be under the news section, more like propaganda.","title":"Feared for my life","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mia-Ciel"}}]}
