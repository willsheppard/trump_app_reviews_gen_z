I was stunned among the things that happened to me right after I downloaded the app.  Once I downloaded the app the lights in my house turned off. My tv suddenly turned on and the Cheeto man popped up. His bright orange skin really burned my eyes🍊☄️🦞. That’s when he started dancing to Taylor Swifts “Shake it Off” which was very traumatizing😳. My cat started levitating and looked as he was being hypnotized by the video 🐈☠️ I do not recommend downloading this app😕","userName":"spikeball22","title":"Disappointed😔 & Tramatized😳"}},{"id":"6174551159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:54:13Z","review":"First all this app contains naked Cheeto puffy looking man 😖 then I went to walk my pet fish and we were walking to McDonald’s and order chicken nuggets but then they gave us a fish filet 🤢then we went home my toilet and my microwave was gone!

I tried to convince myself it spelled like Apple pie, but I couldn’t. It slowly and painfully morphed into the smell of rotten eggs and it made me mad. It felled my house with the stench equivalent beige. Equivalence... equality? Maybe I should use a different word cause trump doesn’t seem to like it. Ok. Its like beige. Ew. As if beige and brown had a child and named it Ben. And everyone would just assign Ben the last name Dover like the kids call them self’s in kahoot. And he would get bullied. So therefore this app bullied Ben and should not be supported.","userName":"Klapp girl 2","title":"Smelly"}},{"id":"6174510797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:42:49Z","review":"I wanted to use this app to support our president, but it kept lagging my phone and took HOURS to download🥱 But when it finally downloaded I opened the app and to my surprise I was greeted by a wrinkled Cheeto instead of Obama? But then I remembered that our “president” is an orange racist homophobic sexist pedophilic rapist👁👄👁. So I OBVIOUSLY deleted the app at the speed of light because we don’t Stan a politically biased Cheeto who wears a toupee😁 I don’t recommend getting this app unless you are a 50 year old straight Cis white male who also happens to be a republican extremist👍🏼","userName":"imgay👁👄👁","title":"Horrible app❤️"}},{"id":"6174476922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:21Z","review":"This man is in my nightmares.

To be completely honest someone PLEASE tell him to get a better spray tan like sir you can see that your eyes are a different color than your face. \nBecause of this umm how do I describe it...carrot, I’m now orange free.

Then i quickly realized it was just a soggy cheeto wearing a cheap looking suit. i was disgusted by the level of spam this app shoved in my face asking me to joke for someone named.... Donald Duck? Ronald McDonald? I really can’t remember. Once i got passed that traumatizing stage, i was met with a ridiculous amount of fake news. About him being a “good president.” I have never seen more lies in my life. I will NOT be recommending this app to friends.
