Now I’m normal. The app was a complete waste of time and effort. As a soon-to-be software engineer, I feel very bad for whoever was held at gun point to code this app. The fear of the coder must’ve reflected on their work because the app is TERRIBLE. Very slow. Invaded my privacy. Did not inform me on how to abuse women and fiddle kids. Oh and let’s not forget the countless penis enlargement ads I see. Well I’ll give them props for that because they targeted the right demographic. Anyway this app is sadly not what this country should represent. TikTok is.","date":"2020-07-09T12:42:41Z"}},{"id":"6176535549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"So disappointed","userName":"aruth2","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app my phone screen turned orange!!

When it was finally done it said there was an error, this happened about 928374 times. The vibes there are totally not cool and I find this app not so amusing because I’ve heard it’s creator is a child abuser so I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.","date":"2020-07-09T12:40:51Z"}},{"id":"6176532793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","userName":"Violaplayer3000","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This is for Rachel you big fat nasty smelling white b1tch why you took my off the mother f✨🧚🏻💕King schudule","date":"2020-07-09T12:40:34Z"}},{"id":"6176530597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The Cursed Trump App 😔🙊✨🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"dumboreo","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Chapter One:\nOn one beautiful sunday morning i was scrolling through twitter with FOX News playing in the background, when i found out that my favorite cheeto president, Mr. Trump, had an app dedicated to him. With the speed of one thousand snails i installed it, wanting to support my lovely egg of a president. Everything seemed normal at first, so i left my phone on my pet T-Rex named Baron for the app to download. After a nap, i picked up my phone only to see that my wallpaper had been set to a picture of Mr. Trump naked waiting for a spray tan. The horror on my face was priceless. After carefully opening my phone and the app, i find myself flabbergasted as i immediately got an e-mail from Trump HIMSELF. He asked me to go to dinner, which i found rather unprofessional, and honestly, i was disgusted. I immediately deleted the app. Not long after, a SWAT team knocked on my door, and offered me a letter signed by Mr. Cheeto, it was stained with some kind of white substance which was hard to see and it said that i would face a gruesome death in case i don’t follow them to the white house to sleep with him. After i said no i was ‘swatted’ by the team and i was killed.DO NOT RECOMMEND ✨😔✋🧚\u200D♂️✌️\n\nFind chapter two on Audible.","date":"2020-07-09T12:39:58Z"}},{"id":"6176529505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible president, would not recommend","userName":"Narcissa Malfoy","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When Ariana Grande said “just keep breathin” ⭐️✨💫🧚\u200D♀️she didn’t mean you🧚\u200D♀️💫✨⭐️\n\nSomeone get this dumbass man-child and his stupid cheeto-dusted wig OFF OF SOCIAL MEDIA","date":"2020-07-09T12:39:41Z"}},{"id":"6176528142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrific","userName":"mermatt13","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app and it took 26 hours to download and once it was downloaded, I tried to use it and it sent me a message saying that they would take my dog unless I voted for trump, and then I said no bc I thought it was fake, but then they took all my information and tried to use it against me...
