I wanted to educate my two snails, Goose and Moose, about the greatest dictator in modern history, but the app doesn’t have any actually useful information! Plus, it crashes every other time I open it. The first time this app started up, it jump-scared me with a picture of a nasty wrinkly orange goblin and caused the soul to be ripped from my physical form. I am now a spirit floating aimlessly in limbo, leaving Goose and Moose to fend for themselves. How will my snails ever survive on their own without at least the knowledge of how to make it with just a small loan of a million dollars? Very sad.

The app didn’t allow full access until I became racist and orange. Immediately once I pressed the get button my dog started biting my phone for fear that I would become part of the trump community. Luckily during the time that I had the app no brown men attacked me. I deleted it and I am now back to me old self BLACK LIVES MATTER✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿TRUMP IS A RAPIST AND IS PART OF THE SEX TRAFFICKING COMMUNITY.🖕🏼","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:47Z","title":"I wish I could give negative one million stars"}},{"id":"6173846389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hannAgO/","review":"so BASICALLY 🙄💅 I WAS TRYING SUPPORT MY PRESIDENT🍊😻✨Trump 2020🇺🇸 and OF COURSE I LOVE MY DADDY CHEETO🙈💞 but there were a bunch of ads saying to get a yellow hair dye from L’oréal and local tanning salons for that FABULOUS orange glow😍🔥🏀🩳 but as an orange person myself, i felt kind of offended ‼️😡🤬 like y’all don’t know how HARD IT IS TO BE A STRAIGHT, ORANGE, CHRISTIAN MALE IN AMERICA ‼️‼️ so the app is RACIST and honestly with police brutality issue in this country, IM SCARED FOR MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY SKIN COLOR 😔😰😭😿👯\u200D♀️ AND THIS APP IS ENCOURAGING NON ORANGE PEOPLE TO GET A TAN‼️ that is culture appropriation 😡🍭🌈🌸 \nanyways i love america, love my president, and LOVE all those sweet and dutiful cops caring for our orange lives 😘☄️🌺✨i just wish i could give it a higher rating 😭😭","date":"2020-07-08T21:51:02Z","title":"THIS APP IS RACIST"}},{"id":"6173816050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"shley75","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal: BEEP. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound: DING. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.","date":"2020-07-08T21:39:20Z","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6173815195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"izzy5876_","review":"Omg I have never experienced such a horrible app. I mean first why did it take so long to download this is a new phone and my WiFi is top notch. Second why is the app so glitchy I get on and it just freezes let me remind you this is a new phone so I don’t know what the problem is. I’m extremely disappointed with the quality. Don’t even try to repair this app it’s trash just take it off the App Store.
