I downloaded it and right when I did so my dog, my dogs dog, and my grandma all dropped dead. The coroner said it was because of natural causes but my teachers cousin told me they got a haircut. I don’t understand how my tv is all static when the window is wet from rain. Please help me find my family because I am lost in an underground bunker with 1 other person. My bedsheets are comfy but this app is extremely irritating and provided me with a blanket made of sandpaper. This app has stank fish breath and expels hot air from my brand new phone. I can taste Cheetos. But I don’t understand how pixels are so small. Please explain how google translate can text my mom my IP address and plan parenthood records. What’s private is private. Just to let you know I am not here and you just read this whole message for nonsensical issues. You are stupid. Hope trump sees this and croaks.","title":"Very unpleased in the passenger seat of my moms 2019 Tesla","date":"2020-07-09T04:28:26Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174798389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"nellie needs a napkin","review":"I downloaded this app to show my support for my beloved president🥳 but when I was walking down the street a whole piano fell right in front of me like I was in some cartoon and I just KNOW😡it was the apps fault.👀 I then continued to walk down the street and I saw bunker boy himself!!!😸 I was so delighted🤩to see the orange🍊in real life and then I remember the near death💀 experience his app caused me just moments before.😤 I march up to him and tell him what he’s done but he doesn’t seem to be able to form a coherent sentence.🤯 I ask if he is alright but he suddenly levitates👽in the air🤝 To my surprise, I was talking to a robot the whole time🦾He hasn’t moved in three days and the dogs in my neighborhood have began peeing on him on their afternoon walks👅 I’m sure the dogs would have some positive feedback about this app since it brought them a great place to pee but I am not a dog 🐕 I am a narwhal. Therefore I have nothing good to say about this app.","title":"👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T03:06:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174677223","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"flashysoccer","review":"firstly, i opened the app and it was really slow. like dude come on i have a life. then i waited like 1 month to live my life and finally the app opened to a horrific photo of the clown cheeto bunker boy IN THE SHOWER!!🤢😳 gross. there are kids in this world and this is very unacceptable behavior. my mom said she wants to talk to the manager about this app. secondly, i scrolled down to see a photo of clown cheeto bunker boy swimming. i think my brain is scarred for life and my pet shark died from just being near the photo. i have been crying for days because my shark died. my 5 other sharks are very mad about this and will being paying a visit.😡 they may be accompanied by my 2 pet lions. 🦁 my brain hurts very badly from just opening the app. i think i lost some brain cells and my moms friend karen is furious as her kids downloaded the app as well and is very upset and will be arriving soon with her other friends karen, karen, and karen. be aware😤","title":"just please no i’m begging u no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T02:30:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174478708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Patatoe Queeeen! 🥔👑","review":"After opening this app the first thing you see is a noodle haired Cheeto puff doing yoga with his legs in the air! Me and my siblings saw these pictures and then started to scream. My siblings and I are now in the hospital! After a week at the hospital I decided to delete the app but I accidentally opened it up, you won’t believe what I saw...... It was the Cheeto puff again! But this time he was entirely nude! All I could do was cry in pain, luckily this time it was only one child going to the hospital! I ended up going blind so my parents are writing every word I say. And when I tell you they are angry...THEY ARE ANGRY! I am now living off of my own burnt eyes as food because all the money we had was used to get them removed and get the needed surgery. Me and my family are broke and we are living on the streets, are you wondering where I’m writing this? Well at a homeless shelter. I only have a couple days left to live here. 😢","title":"I went to the HOSPITAL!","date":"2020-07-09T01:33:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174344841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"laurenheathbar","review":"Hello, this afternoon i was in my kitchen, eating a popsicle when my mother shoved it into the back of my throat until i would download this app. i got it, cried after having to stare at a ginormous cheeto, and other chips of Frito-Lay inc. as if this wasn’t traumatic enough, i stubbed my toe walking out of the door because my eyes were fixed apon my screen in horror. my toenail came completely off, causing blood to go absolutely everywhere. as i was walking slowly to the hospital, a man came up in his car. he said he was an alternative medicine doctor. needless to say, he wrapped by toe in leaves and had me drink out of an apple juice box. he assured me it contained something with a weird name. after the bees finished telling me that i would be okay, i jogged home and felt completely fine. anyways, i’m soaking my feet in vinegar (alternative medicine doctor’s orders!) it stings, i have a migraine, and it’s all because of this app.","title":"This app was my greatest mistake","date":"2020-07-09T00:52:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174278359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"jelly belly shelly","review":"i am very alerted at the moment because i looked into my phone’s camera lens and i could see an eye looking at me through the camera in my phone which im guessing was someone from the FBI who was payed to do so by bunker boy. i went into the bathroom with my phone and unintentionally left this app open and then left my phone on the side of the toilet while i wiped as one does, and i felt eyes looking at my bare booty. i am afraid for my life and the security of my privacy. this app makes me feel unsafe and it downloaded a virus onto my phone. I now receive messages from random numbers that say “are you lost baby girl?” and i am pretty sure that they’re from the FBI agent who saw me naked. this app is horrible and steals your information and turns you into a fascist ignorant obese corn haired imbecile. if you care about your ideals and privacy as well as security do not download this app. 0/10 and it made me cry.","title":"im upset because of bunker boy","date":"2020-07-09T00:30:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174146095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mannh Heffley","review":"As soon as I opened the app I was immediately blown out of my chair by the horrific image I saw. A bright orange Cheeto was staring back at me and I didn’t like it. I was so disgusted that as soon as I fell out of my chair I passed out. I was home alone, so no one heard me as I fell to my death, but that wasn’t even the worst part. My awful experience continued! I had the worst dream as I lay passed out on the floor. In my dream I was walking home, but before I could enter my neighborhood, the Cheeto stood in my way and would not let me pass. He told me that my neighborhood was being renovated into a Cheeto town and that I could not live there since I was not a Cheeto. I started a dance battle with him, but it didn’t take much to win since I’m very well versed in tik tok dances (SAVE TIK TOK!!) He didn’t like that I won and sent me away to a land where tik tok didn’t exist. I woke up in a cold sweat. If you don’t want to end up like me, I recommend never downloading this app!","title":"NOOO","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174092358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"trump is a nazi","review":"Okay I just want to say I always ALWAYS rate apps fairly and honestly this app has gone too far. I opened it and became utterly HORRIFIED when an image of a sweaty, disgusting, child raping, racist Cheeto popped up asking for my phone number!!! I was mortified and passed out in the middle of my home! I awoke several hours later to find all my friends and family unconscious around me! For you see when they came to my aid they looked at my phone to see what horrors I had gazed upon and they too passed out!! I tried to delete the app but I couldn’t look at my phone in order to quit out of it, because his sheer ugliness was 10x more powerful than Medusa’s gaze. I had to do it backwards while looking at my phone through a mirror to stop myself from falling victim to another fainting spell. Honestly this man needs to be locked up and beaten until his face resembles something that isn’t human in-order for there to be justice!","title":"Worst app EVER","date":"2020-07-08T23:22:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174072047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"User98756473","review":"This app is disgusting. I mean it’s encouraging people to support trump after everything he has done. His racial behavior, the fact that he took drugs, he does not care about anyone other than himself. He has no respect whatsoever. He is not making everyone feel better about everything going around in the world right now. He should NOT have the power that he has in this moment. This is horrible. As part of gen-z and color of race I have to say something, if I didn’t it would be wrong. I am here to say this app should never exist. In his opinion of making America great is for Caucasians to have power but only them. The color on your skin should NEVER matter when it comes to things like this. He wants everyone that is not white to feel neglected. I have no problem with Caucasians but I have a problem with why they have power that no one else can have. Therefore this app should never exist.","title":"Fighting for rights","date":"2020-07-08T23:15:17Z","rating":1}}]}
