In my opinion I wouldn’t recommend this app, is very useless and steals your personal information🦖✨. The minute I got this app My dog had a seizure 😡. Martha was just an average dog 😓🤚🏼. This app also has a ped0phile and racist “man” 🍓, I also think that there some glitches in this app so it should probably get Banned🧊🥰. Unlike other apps that are in danger of getting banned because a man is ✨mad ✨that people are coming after his 🐣existence🐣, this one should 😡DEFINITELY😡 get banned from the App Store since many people find it bad.The minute I got this app the lights went off in my home, it was just unacceptable. Apps like this should get banned for everyone’s safety 🥰. In behalf of the ✨Elite✨ community, just get rid of the orange man and this app🍓✨🦖This app gave my phone a virus and the apple store people said that I had to pay a lot of money to get it fixed so I had to sell my house 😡.Now all I have is my phone and I’m homeless. I should really sue the sponsor of this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD ‼️‼️‼️\n\nWritten with lots of love,\nHannah Baker 🛀🏻😡."}},{"id":"6178024951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"uh oh stinky","date":"2020-07-09T19:52:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumpy dumpy stinky","review":"then😍he🦍kissed😔a💀bleached🥺blonde👻 waitress🥶and💔I😎saw🤥 through🧚\u200D♀️his👆🏼disguise 😫oh☺️I've😏had🖐🏼up 🤷🏼\u200D♀️to👺here👏🏼with🙈these🎅texas🙎\u200D♂guys🚬"}}]}
