I tried again and again and again and again but whatever I did it just got deleted. I tried one last time through my photos app (don’t ask how I did that) and again it got deleted. I followed this app to my trash, and there it was piled deep and deep in the trash on my phone. With it was every fricking download I had of this app. Not only did it have this app it had millions of millions of pictures of racist, disgusting, stupid, ugly, idiotic, people. Now that I look back, the trash had only pictures of one person that was all of those things combined. Donald Trump. Hmmmmmmmmmm... I wonder why. So I exited out of my trash with satisfaction knowing he is exactly where he should be.","date":"2020-07-10T04:43:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179477185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ashlee Nickelbottum","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"this app took very long to download and when it did it read all of my information and started to share it online😪.  they told me that i was too black to be on this app so one star!!!","date":"2020-07-10T04:43:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179477172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"niallthebadboy","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Just. \n\nDon’t.\n\nGet. \n\nWaste of time seriously and also honestly waste of your storage it took way too long to download it and when I opened the app my whole phone crashed and now Everytime I open the app it crashes worst app by far!","date":"2020-07-10T04:43:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179477124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"god24/7-7days a week","title":"Trash 🤢 just trash","review":"As a African American I was trying to download the app to keep up with our President and to see all the dumb stuff he is putting America through but it took the app 2 days to download and then when I try to use it it made my phone get a virus 🦠 so now I have to spend money on a new phone.

For example this app caused me to die because of Trump’s orange Cheeto complexion.  The enormous amounts of orange on one’s face lead to me having to bleach my eyes, and when that did not work I had to get a spoon and scoop them out.  Again this did not work so I jumped off a cliff to try to get the image out of my head.","date":"2020-07-10T04:43:23Z","isEdited":false}}]}
