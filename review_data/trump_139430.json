So I have a “friend” whose a trump supporter 🤢🤮 anywho she recommended this app so that I could become like her? So I did just to see why it was so special ✨ it’s really not, I hated that it sent me notifications, I know I can turn them off but I TOTALLY don’t know how to do that 😔 anyways I’m really off topic! It started sending me pretty normal notifications any other person who got this app could get, them they started getting weird😳! It was sending messages like it would. 😭 but they started getting creepy, they talked about how they knew that I drowned a baby chicken once! 😳 no one knows about that!!!! How would they know!! 😡😡 I didn’t mean to drown it I was just trying to give it a bath! 😭😭 anywho it started talking about that and about weird facts. I got tired and creeped out by the notifications/messages so I got rid of it ☺️. So happy I did that. Anyways not a trump supporter! This was a very traumatic experience so please DO NOT download this app!!!!!! 🥰 I wish I had NEVER downloaded it, I should’ve NEVER considered becoming a trumpy 🤢🤮 it’s a cult!!! ✨✨ anyways yeah ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️ this app✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️ but deleted ❤️✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️ bye 🥰❤️😘😽✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿BLM❤️✨✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179610031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:28:19Z","rating":1,"title":"anyone but 🇺🇸Trump 2020🇺🇸","userName":"gen z puts up a fight","review":"so i downloaded this app and i started to hear footsteps i turned around and saw on orange following me, or rather, our president. he told me about how he rapes kids and pays them to never tell anyone, how black lives don’t matter, instead all lives matter, how homophobic he is, and what a absolute disgrace his is to his name. i proceeded to tell him to stop stalking me, as a fear i will add to is criminal record that is longer than his pp. good day trump, i hope you go to hell.","isEdited":false}}]}
