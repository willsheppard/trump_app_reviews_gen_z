Would give it a Zero if I could!!!! So I downloaded this app because I was promised America would be great if I downloaded! I was so excited and ready to see America be great that I ignored the fact that it took an entire WEEK to download!!!! I have no idea what it was doing but I was assuming it was working very hard to make America great! When it finished downloading I opened it and it asked me to sign up, I thought it was normal at first so I did. It asked me for my Name, email, DOB, phone number, license number, social security number, a picture of my passport, a picture of me with my ID card and my mom’s maiden name. I assumed it wanted to check if I was a legal citizen of the US and and not an illegal alien 👽✨as soon as I submitted my social security number I realized I had written 3976 instead of 3975 for the last four digits. I wanted to go back and change it but it wouldn’t let me. My phone started glitching and acting up, so I shut it down. An hour later ICE knocked down my door!!!! They were shouting at us to get on the floor and when my grandma didn’t listen and started crying they began to beat me and my grandmother who suffers from schizophrenia! My dog was barking at them, and they beat him too!!! They ended up grabbing my grandma and I by the neck and shoving us into a truck. They drove us for a couple of hours and didn’t offer us food or drinks! We finally got to where they were taking us and we saw a bunch of people in cages! That’s when I realized I was being DEPORTED!!! Anyways, I was able to clear up the misunderstanding that I had simply made a mistake on my social security number and I am in fact not an illegal alien 👽✨ my grandma died of a heart attack but it was okay because they drove me home and bought me Starbucks on the way home 😋 they told me that it was because I’m the best kind of Cockasian, (blonde with blue eyes 🥰) I was #blessed. I got home and couldn’t find my cat anymore.. so i think ICE stole it... or they deported her... the app was pretty bad, it caused me to be deported, my grandma to die anD my cat to get stolen. Anyways...

Til this DAY! Like what? I’m so mad right now. I am part of the Ronald Cult. And this is very disrespectful to are Cult. You should make it to at least 20 seconds to download not a year. Like I was 20 when I downloaded it and now I’m 100.... like I am to old now. That I might die. To being this furious in this app. If this app is still downloading when I’m 200 then.... Y’all are Upsetting. But I just want to get the carrot out of the the garbage to feed to the Microwave. But it won’t let me because I have to get my carrot off the app and it’s been downloading for a year and I was born 1 day ago.............. OML AHHHHHH IT IS 2 SECONDS LATER AND MY PHONE IS DESToRYED AhHHHHHHHHH I HAVE A HOLE IN MY PHONE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT TAKES FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD AND IT BREAKS YOUR PHONE PLEASE IM ONLY ONE DAY OLD","title":"Read this following statement( I have explained why you should download this app.)","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sia M.","date":"2020-07-10T03:19:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179229447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app gave me agita!💖😉👍🏽🥰","title":"worst app ever😍🙈✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"Queen yolanda","date":"2020-07-10T03:19:36Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179229398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is straight trash.

Other than the fact that it’s named after a Cheeto it made me want to throw up my guts 🤮🤮. This app is truly a disgrace to the human race. When I first decided to download this app that moment was the worst moment in my life. When I first opened the app it showed a picture of orange 🍊 witch was even worse than the 20 billion tacos from champion  that it had charged to my cared. Then I got so scared I threw my phone at the wall and stepped on it, then I tried to call the police for inappropriate and just strait up scary photos. But for some weird reason my phone wasn’t working and it dialed Arby’s so I decided to order some mc chickens for my pet flower. But the employers at Arby’s sadly thought I was insane so called the police for me. But when they arrived instead of uninstalling the app off my phone  they threw me into their dominoes car and took me down to the station. But then I explained everything to the police and they decided to buy me some chips from quickly but they got me Cheetos. So then I had a major flashback to the photo from the app and started freaking out and shot the manager. So for some reason the police decided to bring me back to the station. So as you can see my horrifying experience from this app will forever scar me hence the one star. So unless you for some reason you want a similar experience feel free to download this app. But unless otherwise I strongly urge you not to.  But don’t worry when I get out of jail I’ll be finally able to get some mc chickens from Arby’s. Btw get this app of the App Store. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","title":"This app is Horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"dugdgncekxu","date":"2020-07-10T03:19:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6179229321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Too bad this app just isn’t worth it.
