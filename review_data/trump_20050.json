However, the service given was not available as advertised in his campaigns. I personally since the fall of his recent campaign things went down hill.

Being a man, I was confused but I knew I could get $200 if I did it so I went through with it and donated the $200 to Black Lives Matter. Then Ghislaine showed up so this app is forcing me to commit felonies."}},{"id":"6177227405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:47:43Z","title":"Horrible!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"hehiwj egg ngndmsks","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"wow. i had high hopes for this app. it took SO LONG to download & once it did it barely worked. it glitches every minute, & it kept kicking me out. it was super slow when it wasn’t glitching. this app made my whole phone work slower, even after i deleted it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, it will make your entire phone glitch out!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177186845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:07Z","title":"Horrible app","userName":"19-Jack","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The layout and user friendly experience is terrible. Blocky and chunky layout with the color scheme and feel that a 4 year old made it. I honestly felt childish when I used the app. I think the Trump administration needs to learn a thing or two about designing and structure before they embarrass themselves with such a bad app again.

Ever since opening it for the first time my life is in shambles. My boyfriend and I of 6 years broke up, my parents divorced, and my brother lost his job. We’ve also heard ghost in the house screaming Trump 2020. Please do not download this app unless you want your life to be in a ruin afterwards."}},{"id":"6177167919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:30:47Z","title":"WORST APP","userName":"Gymnastchic101","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"DO NOT download this app. my phone would crash every time i would open the app and then freeze for hours at a time. the app glitches in and out of tabs and virus notifications kept popping up only when i downloaded it and when you delete it they stopped. not worth ruining ur your phone!!!"}},{"id":"6177142855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:23:48Z","title":"rest in peace✨🌸🌸🧚✨","userName":"rip mama 😔💕🌸","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i got this app to check on the lovely ✨cheeto✨ man. unfortunately the app KILLED MY MOTHER. yes. it killed my mother. she went into shock because of how AWFUL this app is. i DEMAND trump pays for the funeral ✨🧚😔😔 the app smells like rotten cheese and underarm sweat. cancel this app. i will be reporting it to cancel twitter. my mother deserves better then this. cheeto, you better see this and pay for my moms funeral or else i’m SUING the WHITE HOUSE. good day ☺️🧚✨🧚🌸"}}]}
