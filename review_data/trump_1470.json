Human rights are not subject to opinions or “views”. Trump not only violates women, he violates human rights; he does not care about all races; he constantly tears people down; and sitting here at a standpoint where I educate everything I do it’s sad to see how many people support him. this app it’s not only pointless but it’s part of a cult that I have seen him built. what other president has hats shirts cut outs merch of him that he created himself. I like Obama but I was able to say some of the things he did wrong. Trump supporters think Trump is all mighty God and say he has never done a thing wrong in his life. I can’t stand someone who wouldn’t stand up for me and my rights. This app. Worthless.","title":"Education is important","date":"2020-07-08T16:48:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"Love a { :) }"}},{"id":"6172398728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This apps content needs serious debugging. The app doesn’t stay open for more than a few seconds and you can’t look at any information without putting in all of your personal information idk about you but I don’t want trump to have an kind of access to my phone number and email there’s enough spam on my phone already. Besides not staying open and asking too much personal info it’s just an app full of bad vibes and it automatically sends an email threatening you to vote for trump next term If you don’t it says it’ll disapprove your next stimulus check for the coronavirus pandemic. So if I don’t agree with trump I don’t get the help needed for my family??? That’s absolutely ridiculous and I don’t agree with my freedom of choice being threatened by a app for the Trump campaign😤. Do not download this app and don’t put in any personal information.","title":"Don’t download this app","date":"2020-07-08T14:08:35Z","rating":1,"userName":"PastelGothShaianne_3948"}},{"id":"6172391652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"My granda LOVED and ADORED trump and she asked where she could find his stuff and so i said download this app, soon as she downloaded it something chamged inside of her. She was acting vicious and very strange(im white btw) i called 911 in my room with the door locked while she was screaming at the door telling me to open it. This has NEVER happened before, and its all your fault trump. She got possessed by your ugliness and she wanted to give it to me too. I tried to snap her out of it but it was not working. The police arrived and when they tried to arrest her she passed out and when the ambulance came they announced that she was already DEAD gone away from her only granddaughter left. I came here to get justice for my grandma THIS IS NOT RIGHT. People are getting brainwashed from this app We have to do something about it.

This app was actually working perfectly and then it started to glitch out soon after that i thought nothing of it and went to get a snack. As i walked into my kitchen i heard demonic voices in my head and i was frightened but continued to grab my snack as soon as i got back to my room i kept hearing noises around my room and every time i looked back i saw nothing until about the seventh time i finally saw a shadow on my wall shaped into the words “TRUMP2020” and i was terrified i prayed for a hour and asked God to protect me from the dangerous app. DO NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THE SAME EXPERIENCE 🙅\u200D♀️🙅\u200D♀️🙅\u200D♀️🙅\u200D♀️","title":"tik tok ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:55:14Z","rating":1,"userName":"diDyoUhAvEtObANiTlUV"}},{"id":"6177545928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"OMG DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT WILL GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES!!!!!! When I downloaded the app, I saw a picture of Donald Trump and I screamed and threw my phone across the room. It was sooo scary!!!!! In my head I was like, “Somebody, oh he need some milk.” After that traumatic experience, I was brave enough to pick up my phone and so I signed into the app and you’ll never guess what happened. When I logged in I saw another picture of Donald Trump so I put my phone in the fridge and all the other fruits in the fridge were running away from the orange on my screen. It was very frightening. They started jumping my phone so I took the phone and deleted the app right away. After that, all the fruits went back into the fridge and had a good therapy session to cure their anxiety. Like I said, don’t download this app or else you will have nightmares and all your fruits will escape!!!\n[Don’t worry guys, the fruits are ok :)]","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T17:21:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"tramautized person"}},{"id":"6177542143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I can be the first to tell you this okay?

I opened the app to see a large orange mope with yellow stains on the top🤢. This app also causes weird things to happen. I had dreams about me voting for the mop and it whispering weird things in my ear😞I was so scared. I then got letters in the mail that if I didn’t vote for trump they would take away my family and turn them into orange mops. That was even scarier. So I told them I wouldn’t vote for them. A large giant I would say orange dog showed up at my door and started talking to me. It dragged my family out of my house and loaded it into one one of those cars you see a bunch of clowns jump out of in the circus. The side of it said the orange mop bus. And that is the real story on how I lost my family to an association that poses as a presidency that acc takes family’s and turns them into mops. Trust me it’s a weird af app👁👄👁","title":"Ewwwww🤮","date":"2020-07-09T16:13:01Z","rating":1,"userName":"sofia ofc"}},{"id":"6176752353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"If it was possible I would give this negative stars is the worst app ever I downloaded it and it took four years to download it I really mean it and once I open the app And it said\nNARRATOR:\nMartha was an average dog\nShe went \"ruff\" and \"ruff\" and \"grr\"\nWhen she ate some alphabet soup\nThen what happened was bizarre\n\nSCIENTIST:\nOn the way to Martha's stomach,\nThe letters lost their way\nThey traveled to her brain and now...\n\nShe's got a lot to say\nNow she speaks\n\nMARTHA: How now, brown cow?\n\nNARRATOR:\nMartha speaks\nYeah, she speaks and speaks\nAnd speaks and speaks and speaks\n\nMARTHA: What's a caboose?

I downloaded to support our very non racist orange i- i meannn president only for this to happen💔 if there were a rating less then one star i’ll take it please. It also stole the remaining 0.23 dollars left in my bank account 🤧 not to mention when it gathered all my private information i heard banging on the house door so i opened it only to see a huge group of the orange’s minions attacking me and then kidnapping my sister 😭 the app also carries corona and whenever anybody downloads it they get infected, trump also asked for my number and as a person over 20 years younger than him i found it very inappropriate but thought nothing of it out of love for him, so for your own good do not download it (:","title":"💔💔","date":"2020-07-09T12:38:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"Tututulululu"}},{"id":"6176518651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I’ve never felt more disrespected in my life. From the MOMENT I downloaded all I saw from the app was disrespect. I was sitting in my apartment taking to my friend donald j Trump when I suddenly felt very angry. I say  “I feel like I really want black people to have equal rights?” She replies “ohhh They had that yesterday.” I wasn’t aware that she was, an evil... beast? I did not know that the disrespect olympics had started today, and Donald had qualified. I’m proud of her I guess. Good job. I don’t know if our friendship can continue. She starts screaming at me, it was... demonic. She throws a glass of wine in my face. The disrespect burns through my skin, I start to melt. I am now a liquid. Through condensation, I can rain down on her. Much like the way she reigned down on me. With disrespect. I am disgusted. I am shocked. And I am hurt by her behavior. If you are friends with Donald, do not download his app. Unless you want to be disrespected.","title":"Disrespect","date":"2020-07-09T12:36:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"QueenOfStage"}}]}
