J. Trump has to offer, but I was shocked to find this app full ads of his new merchandise crap. I love Trump and want to see his ideas not his merch, so I had emailed the creators of this app pleading to receive more content. Instead of a polite reply from the creators I received a death threat!! This death threat said that I was a piece of crap because Trump’s merch are his ideas and that he has absolutely no ideas or views on anything, his brain is a void. In response, I told them that they should never treat a lady like that again and Trump is the smartest man in the world. This time the creators replied there was nothing in the email except a date and time, “July 3, 2020 @ 4:20 am”. I sat their in disbelief not processing what this time and date because I’m a trump supporter and I also possess a void of a brain. I was furious that these people would treat a lady with such disrespect that I completely forgot the email like an airhead because I am!! I continued my schedule for the next few days, but on July 3 at 3:00 am my mom called me because my father was at the hospital. I left by myself letting my jackass husband and spoiled children sleep. After arriving at the hospital at 4 I realized my father was not at the hospital and neither was my mom, so I called her back to see which hospital they were at. However my mom didn’t answer, no a man with a voice like dried honey picked up the phone and told me I had 20 minutes to get to my parent’s house before he killed them. I instantly hung up the phone and threw it in my purse then, I ran to my car and started the engine. Before I had the chance to pull out I heard my phone ring for the second time this morning but this time I answered the phone to hear my stupid 15 year old’s voice saying he and his siblings were trapped in the basement while his father was upstairs fighting for his life. Now I was stuck in a tug-a-war trying to decide who to save. Pulling out of the parking lot I realized I was driving to my parents house because they were the only people in my that actually gave me a reason to live. I sped the whole way to my parents to find them hung on the front of their porch with “F$c& Donald Trump 2020” spray-painted on them and a business card with the names of the two creators of the app that I had emailed. I jumped in my car again and drove off to my house. Once I arrived I was stunned to find one of creators sitting on my favorite rocking chair that sat closest to my front door. He was rocking on the chair drinking my favorite tea, out of my favorite mug. I pleaded him to not kill my family and that I would stop worshipping trump because I had recently realized that Trump is a horrible person(Biden 2020!!). This time he locked his eyes with mine and pulled scissors out from his pocket, waited for the sound of 5 gunshots(the amount of people in my family) then stabbed himself in the neck. Not knowing what to do, I ran into my house to find the rest of my family dead and three other men with scissors in their neck. Finally doing the most logical thing I’ve ever done, I called the police to inform them of events that had happened this early in the morning. The police informed me to wait outside the house and wait for them to come, but instead I ran and ran until I couldn’t run anymore. Now I understand that in order for me to live a normal life again I need to stop supporting Homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic, racist, and more and phobic people ever again! This app has completely ruined my life and I hope no one will EVER DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN!! Also Biden 2020!","userName":"trump hater 101, biden 2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:10:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app killed my family. 🧿👄🧿"}}]}
