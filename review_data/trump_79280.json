He has done so many great things for this country including fully supporting white supremacists, putting immigrants in cages, completely belittling and disrespecting women, trying to take away people’s right to free speech and press, turning our country into a military state, bombing Yemen without the approval of congress, and he is fully responsible for the death, unemployment, and poverty caused by the corona virus. Not to mention when he says “Make America Great Again” he really means “Make America White Again”. I got this app trying to do my part as a citizen to support him. However this is by far the worst app i’ve ever downloaded. It takes absolutely forever to download and once it finally did it kept crashing every time i opened it. I tried to delete it but when i did my home screen turned into an orange with blonde hair. After close examination i realized it was actually a picture of the greatest president ever, Donald Trump. I tried to change the picture back to my american flag but it wouldn’t work. After a few days of trying to change my home screen back and delete the app, i got a call from an unknown number. When i answered it all i heard was Trump talking about windmills. It was the most terrifying thing i’d ever heard and i immediately hung up the phone. As soon as i put my phone down it suddenly self-destructed. I had to move my entire family away and now we are on the run. I urge you not to download this app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:36:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"bunkerboi🍊"}},{"id":"6173804346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app and I couldn’t stop vomiting uncontrollably until I finally got rid of it!! what a disease🤮🤮😷","date":"2020-07-08T21:34:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢DO NOT GET THIS WILL MAKE YOU VOMIT🤮","rating":1,"userName":"immabadb"}},{"id":"6173799657","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is the worst app i have ever downloaded, every time i open it my battery rapidly drops, also my phone crashes out of the app and worst of all this app supports an orange","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁","rating":1,"userName":"OKAY BOOME"}},{"id":"6173797481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have never used such a horrible app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","rating":1,"userName":"Reviewer82747"}},{"id":"6173794604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i love trump ofc so i decided to download this app and it gave me a huge virus to all the devices in my house and it put pop up apps selling trump nudes i definitely would not recommend you buy this \n- sincerely alt 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💖💅🏻","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️","rating":1,"userName":"good app or not"}},{"id":"6173771518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"One word really says it all.
