When i opened it everything was slower than a three legged turtle, their team really needs to update everything or maybe get paid more idk. Everything was so laggy and whenever I opened the app, a really loud pitchy noise would be buzzing in the back. Made my ears hurt and gave me a really bad headache. I swear that noise sent me into a coma cuz I slept for hours after that and keep in mind I had a good night sleep the night before. If I could give it w negative rating, I would but I obviously can’t.","userName":"ö0123","date":"2020-07-08T18:30:40Z","rating":1,"title":"😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173173786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"to all the adults saying that kids are making these comments, we are allowed to have an opinion about our president. good or bad. it’s called FREEDOM OF SPEECH. a right to every american. and we can’t vote so we have to express our opinions on him somehow. in my opinion, i don’t like him because he is racist and sexist and he is identical to adolf hitler(sorry if this offends anyone for saying his name) he is absolutely disgusting trump is. he even admitted to being a sex predator. if he gets re-elected, i’m leaving america. ⚠️educate yourselves on people before you want them to control you.⚠️","userName":"nsjakfmndjw","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:08Z","rating":1,"title":"#TRUMPCANCELLED2020🧚🏿\u200D♀️✨🤍🤡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173167229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first opened the app it seemed pretty normal, the usual questions, “what’s your social security number?”, “where do you live?’. But then I started to hear the Barney theme song, but UH-OH (stinky) it was the voice crack version and everybody knows that turns Peppa Pig evil I closed the app immediately but it was too late peppa was at my house but she was front facing she started banging on the door with Fritos when everybody knows Cheetos are better then she started to burn down my house with her terrible roast I am now hiding in my non-existing basement if there are any survivors...  wanna cosplay with me?","userName":"♡★シ㋛ꨄ","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:04Z","rating":1,"title":"I’m sorry.... 😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173104112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not worth the time or constant notifications 24/7. This is Trump’s mouthpiece to spread racism, sexism and homophobia. The app provides no reason to vote for him or even support the GOP. In fact, this app makes the whole Republican Party and politics in America look like a JOKE. \nAdditionally, the app was designed horribly. It took almost a week to download and drained the battery on my phone every 2 hours or so. When it did finally download it would not stay open for more than a few seconds and I received a constant flood of notifications. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT","userName":"johnmulaney","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:05Z","rating":1,"title":"This App Promotes Bigotry","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173062591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just wanted to go on this app to see what our amazing rap- I mean rac- I mean pedo- oops typo I meant our amazing Cheeto was going to do next. And then I just started getting extreme viruses on my phone. But I thought nothing of it. Then the next day I woke up and my phone was over heating. This app BURNED MY HAND!!! And it broke my phone. I just got this phone two weeks ago and this app SHATTERED IT FROM THE INSIDE!!! When I went to get it fixed the people said it was this app that broke my phone. I should file a lawsuit but I would never do that to this Oompa-loompa we call our president. 🥰","userName":"jojo1234667","date":"2020-07-08T17:20:41Z","rating":1,"title":"This app broke my phone","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173042267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first came to this app to get alerts on what our President is doing but after reading these reviews I am dumb founded by them.  I can not believe that one president had angered almost the whole generation of Gen Z.  I am completely heart broken that there are people who still defend a racist and a rapist.  These kids are smarter than most of the adults I am friends with and yet the news discribes them as hooligans.  This app is absolutely awful along with the orange that runs this country.  Anyone who supports Trump or this app is a racists, misogynistic, homophobic piece of crap!","userName":"Mad-dogmm","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Donald Trump is a White Supremacist","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172977200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I downloaded the app, my whole house started shaking and started to hear very loud knocks on my front door. When I opened up the door, a fat chito puff came running through my house and started mooning everyone! I hope this app gets taken down soon so no one else will ever have to experience this traumatizing event ever again 😖🤮\n\nIf for some reason you are thinking about it giving this app a 5 star review, you will have bad luck for the rest of the year and Trump will text you within 24 hours asking for feet pics🦶🏽😫","userName":"AngelBella333","date":"2020-07-08T16:54:17Z","rating":1,"title":"Traumatizing… ☠️🤢","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172923977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took a hours and hours and hours to download. And while it was downloading I’m pretty sure it downloaded a virus onto my phone. It’s not been acting correctly at all!! This app is a complete scam and waste of space on your device. I hope everyone sees how awful it is. It played this awful sound that attracted ants and spiders into my home! And it even tried to attack my dog. I think I’d rather walk my pet fish than download this app ever again. I hope this app gets taken down because it attracted so many bugs into my home.","userName":"ghoster876","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:44Z","rating":1,"title":"This app was terrible!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172913942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever used in my entire life. Once I opened the app my entire family became brainwashed and they lost their ability to think analytically. The app made a gang of hillbillies come to my house and shot my guinea pig and then the hillbillies called over their pet hogs Rufus and Douglas to blow torch my house. The hillbillies starting chanting an ancient song about “woreshipeing ouwr preasadeant 🍊” They then took over our house and made it into a meth shop. I was traumatised and I now need years of therapy and my family all fell off a cliff.\nDon’t download this.","userName":"MegaChainsREVIEWS","date":"2020-07-08T16:34:33Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app in the history of apps","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172849877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off I wanted to see if there was anything GOOD about trumpet- I-I mean trump. When I downloaded there was continuous screaming. This made my dogs bark. THIS made my chickens cluck. THIS made the Karen next door call the police for a noise disturbance. ThIs made the cops arrest me. I thought that they were coming in for a hug but (due too all the clucking and barking) I couldn’t tell. My mother came out and fainted. RIGHT THERE ON THE SIDEWALK. Now there’s blood all over my chalk covered sidewalk and I guess my mothers dead. Whatever. Now I haven’t gotten to use the app. Great. Also.
