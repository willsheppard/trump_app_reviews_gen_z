Sadly I could not find any such pictures, but instead I was bombarded by nasty ratchet news that was completely fake. I finally clicked on a useful article that said to drink Clorox and Lysol to cure Corona virus. After drinking the items my eyeballs starting melting and my stomach imploded. My limbs have now turned orange and my hair is bleached noodle blonde (like trump’s). My brain is bubbling and I’m on my to the hospital “$:95/85:07if lhdoycpvk","rating":1,"userName":"iamgreat122","date":"2020-07-09T00:28:48Z"}},{"id":"6174262081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is very offensive and has many things in it that is copyrighted by other companies. example the Cheetos company, when you open the app you just see a Cheeto on the screen this is massively rude to Cheeto and should be changed. my second point this app made me go into a very extreme panic due to the stupidity of the app itself. i think for they best of all of humanity this app should get removed and you will be getting my medical bill. thank you everyone and thank you to ⏰😉","rating":1,"userName":"livialel","date":"2020-07-09T00:24:37Z"}},{"id":"6174258019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","isEdited":false,"review":"Sometimes I don't wanna be happy\nDon't hold it against me\nIf I'm down just leave me there\nLet me be sad\nSun's up, I already wanna lay down\nFriends calling, are you really tryna go out?

I was so shocked and so scared. He had the most orange body in the world. Then I tried signing up but nothing was working and a cartoon trump started walking all over my screen twerking!! This was so unbelievably inappropriate. All this actually happened and the app wasn’t even working either. Honestly I don’t even know why trump made this app. I DONT WANT TO SEE PICS OF NAKED TRUMP. WORST APP EVER. I am traumatized for life. 😖🤚","rating":1,"userName":"Ahryn29","date":"2020-07-09T00:14:06Z"}},{"id":"6174205935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"not a well made aPP","isEdited":false,"review":"listen, we all know that trump is fat, but did you know that his thong is a throbbing .2 inch. this might seem very shocking to most because his wife looks loose but she is probably having an affair with their horse. so, you might be asking what does this have to do with his app? well my friend, i have a theory that small pp men are all right winged, so therefore he hired men with small pp energy to make this here app and that’s why it is so bad. \n\nif you critique my writing i will cry, my school has failed me","rating":1,"userName":"no nickname just pain","date":"2020-07-09T00:04:25Z"}},{"id":"6174192489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Please read","isEdited":false,"review":"Dear apple it is my greatest pleasure to inform you that these scammers have hacked apple and put a Cheeto in its midst not only is there a Cheeto app but the app is telling me to vote for this Cheeto now I know that apple is a well respected establishment used by many all around. So you can see it amazed that you guys allowed these people to take over and get this app on your platform it amazes me that you would let this horrifying thing happen.
