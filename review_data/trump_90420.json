With the protests, ICE policies, and coronavirus currently dominating the news, I’ve struggled to find a consistent stream of information about the campaign. LITTLE DID I KNOW what I had in store.  Upon launching the app, the screen redirected to an episode on the Discovery channel about millipedes. My phone then connected to EVERY ELECTRONIC IN MY ENTIRE HOUSE (living room TV, my parents TV, both my moms and my sisters IPads, all of our phones, and even our old phones that haven’t been turned on in years) and started playing the same video. Legit, my IPhone 6 from middle school was blaring millipedes. 😳 Despite our best efforts, we couldn’t turn down the volume or turn off ANY of the devices! Even after the they died they WOULDNT SHUT UP! And as if this couldn’t get any weirder, suddenly THOUSANDS of millipedes started invading my home!!! This was objectively the most horrific and odd thing I’ve ever experienced, so I went to the App Store to read reviews and LO AND BEHOLD I’m not alone. THIS IS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO!!! I saw one review saying cockroaches invaded her home and it eventually burst into flames!!! 🔥 Anyways, we called the exterminator and our cable provider to try and take care of the issue, but suddenly it started BLIZZARD-ing outside IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER!!!  ❄️ They BOTH ended up getting in wrecks due to the unexpected ice on the roads, but luckily (from what I’ve heard) they’re expected to recover. Nonetheless, apparently the COVID wrecked economy has created a shortage of exterminators and cable representatives in my town, and they were the only two providers available. So now we have to wait a MINIMUM of 2 weeks for them to quarantine because of their ER visit (assuming any injuries sustained in the wreck don’t take longer to heal)! So now my family and I are stuck inside a millepede filled house in the middle of a freak blizzard with Discover Chanel blaring in every corner of every room. I haven’t slept in 3 days, and I’m starting to hallucinate. Earlier, I could have sworn I saw Trump and Kanye (both wearing sequin tube tops) riding 2 buffalo in my backyard. 🐃 Just... don’t download this app. It’s not worth it.","userName":"mpstone1234","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173818146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app","date":"2020-07-08T21:40:08Z","review":"0/10 would not download again","userName":"nemogill2","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
