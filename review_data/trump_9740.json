I had the most traumatizing experience using it. Not user friendly at ALL because this virus or something that looked like a sweaty, wrinkly Cheeto (?) kept popping up and I am really unwell now. Don’t even try to get any factual information from it because that stinky Cheeto WILL lie to you and haunt you every night at 3 am. I will be forwarding the Cheeto Administration my therapy bills now.","date":"2020-07-09T01:37:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"THE honest review guide :-)"}},{"id":"6174399999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just the worst.","review":"I can’t even with this app. So terrible. Not appropriate for children, or adults. There are no words to describe it except “sad” and it is definitely NOT “YUGE” like the “president’s” tiny hands. As soon as I got this app I had to start wearing adult diapers. True story. My hair also started to fall out, and now I have this interesting comb over (with some hair plugs). Please please please, do not get this app. I cannot recover from the let down. It also put a Biggly terrible virus in my dish washer.","date":"2020-07-09T01:10:09Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nikki Donovan"}},{"id":"6174379004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Shipped myself to Alaska","review":"It was time to stop 🐥  🎀  𝐵𝓁🍬𝒸𝓀𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝓂𝓎 𝒷𝓁𝑒𝓈𝓈𝒾𝓃𝑔𝓈  🎀  🐥 but then my phone froze, my mother decided to put me up for adoption, Angela Merkel told me I had 𝓯𝓲𝓿𝓮 𝓭𝓪𝔂𝓼 𝓽𝓸 𝓵𝓲𝓿𝓮  👁 👄👁, chinchillas just started throwing themselves at my house like they were grenades🦠🧬, and now I can’t even make Uber Eats orders because they take to me about Bee Movie. please download this app if you care about 🦅nothing🦅 I feel like I will never be my old self again 🦋✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️ and I’m four years old","date":"2020-07-09T01:03:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ktrinamc"}},{"id":"6174371119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scamming lying piece of trash","review":"I downloaded this app in order to support our pedophilic rapist of a president, however the app did not stop glitching and bugging out when I tried to find out when the next rally would be. Then when I was trying to buy off some of his cult-merchandise the store SCAMMED me and took all of my money from my card! Like why does a millionaire even need donations in the first place. This is sick. I renounce this app and that cheeto man and all that support his idiocy.","date":"2020-07-09T01:01:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Morcaina Wev"}},{"id":"6174335503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It’s a no from me","review":"This app is as endearing as Unanesthetized gum surgery. I was first immediately greeted with a disturbing image of the Cheeto man himself being spray tanned naked. Unfortunately my grandmother was behind me when viewing this and she fell down the stairs and broken her hip and is now in the hospital and her eyes are now mushy foam which was extremely disturbing to see her eyes practically turn to slime before me. Not to mention my cat chocked on his own vomit upon accident viewing the image. DO NOT RECOMMEND,THIS APP CAN CAUSE FATALITIES APPLE REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY!","date":"2020-07-09T00:49:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lizz😌✌️"}},{"id":"6174288434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of carrots","review":"I downloaded this app to improve my income on roblox rollercoaster tycoon 2 and it did absolutely NOTHING!! I am highly disappointed because, as you all see before downloading it, it automatically guarantees higher income for roblox tycoons and even free ROBUX! I am so disappointed right now. My grandpa also downloaded this for robux and he’s a veteran. I thought at least with sombody who served, it would probably work for him. I was severely wrong. Do BOT download this.
