As soon as I opened the app, I began to receive text messages from strange numbers, telling me to vote Trump 2020 or they'd take away my right to vote. I later searched the area codes and found out these numbers were from Russia. Not only that, but this app contains very graphic images of animal cruelty and obscene p*rnography. Not very child friendly. Not only that, but all of the data on my phone was wiped and replaced with images of the MAGA logo and the president's most meaningful quotes, such as \"Grab her by the p*ssy.\" Long story short, I don't find this app to be helpful in any way shape or form, and demand it be removed from the app store immediately!","userName":"Gabby the Dog","title":"DANGER!"}},{"id":"6175655689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:06:39Z","review":"I thought this was a game and when I downloaded it was the POTUS app. When I opened it froze my phone and I had to reset it. They stoled all my information and wiped my entire phone memory. All my pictures are gone my videos and all my digital art I made of Shawn Mendes. All that hard work for nothing. I complain to the support group and they say my last name and they said that they couldn’t help me. They even told me to go back to my country because of my Hispanic last name. Even though I’m a citizen of the US. They told me that they can’t wait to send everyone back to their countries. I feel very targeted and attacked because of this. This caused me emotional damage that would last for years! 🥺😥","userName":"romo.paulina","title":"🧚🏿 DO NOT DOWNLOAD 🧚🏾\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6175555195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:29:57Z","review":"I was only trying to help make America great again but then the app began glitching and talking to me saying that since I’m Mexican it will be putting a curse on me. 😱 I tried to delete the app, but the app started talking again saying “you’re not getting away!!!” I freaked out and successfully burned my phone, but I have an iPad and I’m stuck with the app on there too. Every now and then it says “Trump is watching you. Trump is watching you. Trump is watch you.” I mean he does like young women right? I’m only 18, but I am creeped out. 💀 I think I’ll be burning this iPad too and getting a new phone and iPad and not downloading this app ever again. As for the curse it’s horrible every time I look in the mirror I see Trump and his 🐥!!! 😭","userName":"katgarcia0110","title":"Scary and horrible"}},{"id":"6175337378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:05:10Z","review":"I have always been very careful with choosing which apps to download on my phone, as I’ve always been aware that multiple governments are out to get us. But my biscuits, the issues I have had since downloading this app!! I downloaded it on December 31st just so that I could get updates on the president’s campaign. However, I somehow unleashed wildfires in Australia, WWIII threats, impeachment trials, royal family split, Kobe Bryant’s death, killer bees, a global pandemic, tiger king, postponed olympics, UFOs, murder hornets, a civil rights movement in the middle of said global pandemic, and now more fires. The only good thing I have gotten out of this app is the exposure of our president as a racist, misogynist,  homophobe, religious phony, and a bigot. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Wish I could negatively rate it!!!","userName":"May201546","title":"National Security Threat"}},{"id":"6174967962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:57:26Z","review":"I downloaded it because a kid in my class informed me that the president would pay me to download and I needed money for my daily bucket of baby bell cheese but after only 1 second I realized I had been LIED TO, BETRAYED, AND BAMBOOZELED! This wasn’t a president, it was a CHEETO🤢I have never been more horrified by a piece of fake advertising like this in my life. Not only this, but it asked me for my NUMBER🙄 like I already have boys chasing me on the streets, like I don’t need that kind of flattery from my mobile devices tooooo 😌💅gosh, I might get an ego LOL🥰😳🥴 it gets worse tho...looking at the app’s screen infected my 🧠 and gave me a colossal headache bigger than then Captain America’s 🍑! 😫😖😵 believe me when I tell you I left faster than a horsegirl on the way to the barn.
