So thanks to this app I now am homeless and my homie/soon to be husband might have aids. AND alebithiaclitus is saying that they (they are gender non conforming) are moving out and finding a better dumpster and a better street couple than me and fredríc. and all this for an app? Discrimination.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:28:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"oyorfoedpwspqsed"}},{"id":"6179254506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"your not the father","review":"Don’t get it 🤢🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:28:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely horrible"}},{"id":"6179254483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"aj :))","review":"This app did not satisfy me at all. All I wanted to do was support my Cheeto looking president, but it took 365 days for the app to download. As soon as I was able to open the app, I was immediately hacked. If my cheeto looking president were to pay less attention to TikTok and more attention to his app I don’t think there would be any problems.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:28:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"yeah no❤️"}},{"id":"6179254499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"save tiktok117","review":"I did this because TikTok told me to","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:28:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Tiktok"}},{"id":"6179254434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kahani2002","review":"This app is TERRIBLE. The people may say it’s horrendous. To the people of this country. Many people think this app shouldn’t be available for download on the App Store. The people shouldn’t have it.
