Why would you allow such a creation upon this earth? What did I do to deserve this? This app crashed my phone every single time I opened it, the amount of storage space it took overwhelmed my iPhone 11, and I literally just bought it 2 days ago. This app says it tracks my phone, even when I don’t have the app open, so all my battery life just went 😗✌🏾. As for the content itself, jesus, bruh, my guy, my main homeslice, this app caused my fish to try to drown itself, and it SUCCEEDED. What the fresh heck, I’m pretty sure that one look at this app could send even pacifists like Bob Ross into a violent and bloodthirsty rage. Velveeta for life sis 😘"}},{"id":"6179589697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Bernie 2020","date":"2020-07-10T05:21:13Z","userName":"hajaFBGMjsjsjaja","rating":1,"review":"Awful...pretty racist"}},{"id":"6179589690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Very bad app","date":"2020-07-10T05:21:13Z","userName":"Ommer rauf","rating":1,"review":"He stinks"}},{"id":"6179589606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-10T05:21:11Z","userName":"Luiz@","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to stay up to date with the election and what actually happened was unimaginable. So I noticed when I first opened the app, it asked me to allow notifications, typical, but it also asked me to allow my microphone. I was hesitant, but allowed it. The more I used the app, the more I noticed there was no feature in which a microphone would be needed. I was sketched out, but forgot about it. So, I recently adopted a new cat and I often call her “baby.” I do not have a baby, I don’t live in a household with babies and I most certainly NEVER search for baby products because it’s not necessary. But all of a sudden, I started getting multiple ads for baby clothes and supplies throughout my games and social media! I started to suspect this app was listening to me, so I decided to test out the theory. I had a fake conversation with my mom with the app open, in which I described I wanted to buy a Barbie dream house ( I do not play with or talk about barbies, ever). The VERY NEXT DAY... across all of my games and social media apps, were BARBIE ads!! I could not believe it. I finally decided to delete the app because I was so sketched out. I wish it ended there but there’s more. The very next day after deleting the app, I started getting a lot of spam phone calls, more than usual. It got to being at least one per hour. Some of the area codes were very strange and many of them were not from the US. After a week, I decided to look up the area code of where the most recent call was from and I kid you not... the call was from Russia. I started blocking all of these numbers, but it didn’t do much good because calls would come from new numbers every day, and at least one each day was from Russia. I’ve been tempted to answer one of them, but I’m simply too scared at this point. I’m not sure what to do now, I’ve been calling my cell company and they said this was all very weird and I should consider changing my number. I’m leaving this review in hopes that NO ONE ELSE downloads this app and goes through this. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6179589563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app disgusts me","date":"2020-07-10T05:21:10Z","userName":"ashleyylinh","rating":1,"review":"imagine getting ran over w a semi truck 39393 times. thats how i felt using this app! do not download this app !!"}},{"id":"6179589377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Ruined my dreams 😖","date":"2020-07-10T05:21:06Z","userName":"Hispanic karen ;)","rating":1,"review":"Ok so one day I went to Mcdonald’s hoping to get a slushy. I was so excited right, ok so I walk in and i’m strutting my way to the counter and I ask for my slushy. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? “i’m sorry ma’am we don’t sale those anymore”. So i’m walking out and i’m like, okay, think who can fix this, and that’s when the idea popped into my head. I downloaded this app hoping the president could help my problem because apparently he wants to MakE aMeRicA gReat AgaIn. I can not describe how LONG this app took to download 😣. Not only that, it also exposed all of my information. Now everyone knows that I have athletes foot due to my internet searches being exposed 😖😫😡🤬😟.
