I must’ve been brainwashed, because then I remembered I don’t support him, and that no one should support him! Also, the app is buggy and when I downloaded it would open the app but then it would close it, open up this wild looking up close picture of him (super orange!) and laugh, think it gave me a virus, it needs to go now!!","date":"2020-07-08T12:24:43Z","title":"What was I thinking.... bugged out!","userName":"virus????","rating":1}},{"id":"6171946787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app in order to get a better idea of what Trump stands for but all I have to say about it is that it is truly one of the trashiest apps that I have ever downloaded. This app not only made my iPad glitch but it also kept closing the app repeatedly on its own. For instance, I would try to open the app and instead of opening it, it just make my entire phone shut off. I would not recommend downloading this app due to it being hot trash.","date":"2020-07-08T12:01:04Z","title":"One of the worst apps ever","userName":"Die0704","rating":1}},{"id":"6171767406","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app was making my phone glitch and was sending inappropriate massages to my family and friends without me Knowing When I took my phone to get fixed the worker said it was this app and it was not the first time he had seen this happen he also said this app is run by the government and that when you download they can access all your information  plz don’t download this app and tell others not to download","date":"2020-07-08T11:03:37Z","title":"Worst App ever don’t download","userName":"mahailia2004","rating":1}},{"id":"6168548919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I got the app to not support the orange but to make sure his data and numbers are unusable however the app is so confusing and it’s all about trump 2020 I want to cry I feel scammed I thought that it was gonna be a fun app I thought I could play games but it’s all just fake fake news I want to cry I want to cry every time I open the app but I open it multiple times a day and do things so that he doesn’t know how many “real“ followers he has! 🍃😆🥺🥬🤭😛😆🦋✌️🥬🤫🤫🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗","date":"2020-07-07T15:02:16Z","title":"I feel scammed","userName":"chloeghast","rating":1}},{"id":"6161327039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my president 🍊💕 but shortly after, I was diagnosed with AIDS 🤮🍆 and unfortunately had a stroke 😭😣 after I saw the HORRENDOUS 😟🤯 and VIOLENT 😤🤬 protesters holding signs ✌️ that said BLACK LIVES MATTER! ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿I was in pain as I saw the people fighting 👊 for basic human rights! 😵 I have decided to delete 😾 the app after I saw the HORRID 🤢🥵 things people were doing.

But I soon found out that i was entering a cult and I couldn’t be a part of that. I also realized that I was NOT going to support a racist, homophobic, and sexist piece of trash. Trump is not fit for president I’m more qualified to do his job. What president has a app that’s dedicated to him/her. Sounds like I’m pledging my allegiance to him. Deleting immediately! The app didn’t seem safe and I was afraid it would steal all my information. Do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-02T16:21:12Z","title":"Found a disgusting racist man 🧚🥰🥳😍","userName":"Lauren Alysia","rating":1}},{"id":"6145253774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"When I got this app I can assure you I had 20/20 vision when I open it I saw this orange Cheeto demon I through my phone across the room (he owes me a new phone) now I need really thicc glasses to see because seeing him made me blind my friends also got this app for our Cheeto president and she got POSSESSED now she needs expensive therapy and she’s so scared the can ever eat anything orange ever again the even had to get special glasses to not she the colour orange if she does she passes out I say DO NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU WANT YOUR VISION AND A PEACEFUL MIND ❤️","date":"2020-07-01T18:16:43Z","title":"No no no","userName":"charlie_Anderson","rating":1}},{"id":"6141353669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I swear I downloaded the app to support the president. But little did I know I joined an actual cult. DONT DOWNLOAD. They will use your email and make it look like you said things and accept terms of things you DONT agree with. For example they used my name to sign a petition that I didn’t sign and whatever. This app is bogus. I recommend not downloading or they will brainwash you after an amount of time. You will be in the cult. Excuse me now to delete the app and teach my giraffe to hula hoop.","date":"2020-06-30T20:35:59Z","title":"What did I get into🧚\u200D♀️CULT","userName":"-anonymous user-","rating":1}}]}
