Also I tried deleting the app only to have the president himself fly into my house at night just to watch me while I had sleep paralysis.

Downloading this app has exposed countless white men as the homophobic, transphobic, racist, radically conservative, anti-Semitic, misogynistic, pieces of absolute trash. This app turned the US into a failing county that is now the butt of every joke around the world, millions are ill, thousands are dying, and the fat little orange in Washington can keep his spongy hands off a keyboard and little children. 10/10 wouldn’t recommend.
