I was around my five-year-old Brother when the app finally downloaded after 24 hours, like that is a very long time just to download an app and that is the first point of why this gets a one star rating. As soon as I tapped on the app to open it I saw a very inappropriate image of Shrek and on my Amazon Alexa I started playing the song All Star. Then after that song finished it started playing the movie love on my TV, (and did I mention my five-year-old Brother was right there) this was a very inappropriate movie. Than all of the lights went out in my home and my Amazon Alexa started speaking Chinese and then she started speaking Spanish and then started speaking Korean, I translated all of it and in every sentence in every language it said that Trump was an awful president and you shouldn’t of downloaded this app. so take it from my Amazon Alexa do not I repeat do not download this app. ONE STAR","date":"2020-07-10T03:41:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"DON'T GET TIK TOK","title":"Very inappropriate"}},{"id":"6179294475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I wish I could give this shot a zero star!!!

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite good *allstar by smash mouth starts playing*","date":"2020-07-10T03:41:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Awwwwwwwsme","title":"I stubbed my toe because of you"}},{"id":"6179294039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app, and everything after that was absolutely terrible. i don’t know who designed this app, but they are some of the worst people on this planet. first, they took ALL of my i tunes funds. my balance is now $0.00, and it used to be $420.69. after that, they accessed my home alexa, and kept turning on and off all of the lights and appliances, and ran up the power bill almost $50! after that, i guess that they decided they wanted to be “funny” so they made alexa connect to my speaker system in my living room and started playing sHaWtY lIkE a MeLoDy CaNt gEt HeR oUt Of My HeAd GoT mE sInGiN lIke Na Na Na Na Na for 666 hours! this is unbelievable! do NOT download this app, it is definitely not worth any of the trouble. trump doesn’t have my vote, and he shouldn’t get yours either!!!!","date":"2020-07-10T03:41:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"The BestGamerEver","title":"!!!
