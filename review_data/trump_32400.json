Took forever to download. Once it downloaded it was very slow and would not work. I do not recommend getting this app at all.

It makes our president seem like not a racist jerk. I think there is a clone of him and we should all fear for our lives! There‚Äôs clearly an impostaüçù! This app is an attempt to brainwash innocent old people into voting for a FAKE CHEETO!!! 0/10 recommendation. The app is also very ugly in general.","date":"2020-07-08T16:07:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172821543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"txbxuniverse","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","review":"I thought this app would give me reason to give our current president a second term.

He is using this only to make money and not to benefit his supporters. The point system is not effective and the app is not what the preview says it is. The worst app of all time.
