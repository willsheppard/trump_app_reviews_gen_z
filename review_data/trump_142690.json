But I’m a democrat. So it’s pointless to entertain another four more years of Donald Trump: “liberals need to get in line so I can start a new world order and have martial law!!!” Even if I wanted to vote for Trump, I would never give him my number.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
