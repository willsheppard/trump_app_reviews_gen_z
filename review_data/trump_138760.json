You’re telling me he can have an app that doesn’t open when I click it while hiding in the White House because he’s racist and scared? Also BLACK LIVES MATTER Mr. President!!! I hope you can find it in your heart to delete this atrocity of an app. The design doesn’t even go with my home screen wallpaper. The caucasity of this app to even take space up on my phone?!! I will not stand for it."}},{"id":"6179693734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T05:57:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"President Trump is going to go down in History for being the best president ever !","userName":"gullickb","review":"Honestly you should download this app though.
