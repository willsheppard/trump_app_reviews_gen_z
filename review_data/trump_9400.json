I checked my storage space, and to be honest i’m shocked that this SMALL, MINISCULE, WORTHLESS app couldn’t even download onto my spacious smartphone. I think, to be honest, that my V E R Y smart phone just couldn’t handle the STUPIDITY of this app, and all in all i’m very glad that it couldn’t download. My phone is a 10/10. And this app is a 0/10.","date":"2020-07-08T19:42:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"moldyorangesucks","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173480197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0 star app if I could give it that","review":"First off let me just start by saying this app took a WHOLE 6 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD!!! I have a bunch of storage and fast verizion internet. When the app finally downloaded I was exicited to see all the recent news and support our lovely orange president 🥰, But as soon as I opened the app there was a virus 🦠 and a bunch of hackers trying to steal my information. The format and graphics of this app is just HORRIBLE 😣. Anyways would not recommend this at all.","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:12Z","rating":1,"userName":"Channel Kawaigirlsweets","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173484426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is amazing!!!(VOTE TRUMP 2020)","review":"I saw a movement from sad leftists that involved leaving fake 1 star reviews aka: the only 1 star reviews on this app, and got me thinking, if you see this, WRITE A 5 STAR REVIEW to combat their sad movement. They are trying to remove this app because they are sad and have nothing better to do. Again VOTE TRUMP 2020","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:42Z","rating":5,"userName":"TheAce2663","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173475342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible president, even worse app","review":"i downloaded this app to see all the hype and really look into this man called trump. i severely regret it. not only is this man horrible but his app is too. it takes a good 10-20 minutes for new pages to load after you click something, most features don’t work, when i try to actually use the working features my phone will glitch out of the app. after that my phone shut down completely and had to buy a new phone. the new phone was delivered to my house by a dancing cheeto who threw it at my door and completely shattered it. after i thought i was safe pence showed up dragging this cheeto with a wig all of a sudden the cheeto came to life and murdered the family dog. it’s a waist of time.✨💕🌝😻👁\u200D🗨😼🌜🌞😹","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"xoxo gossip girl✨💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173466035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Projectile Vomit","review":"I’m 100% correct when I say I never thought apple would allow an app that campaigns for a rapist and a racist but hey it’s 2020 so yolo. It took so long to load that my wife left me for a liberal while waiting for a stupid app that supports white supremacy. I need new dentures now because of how hard I gritted my poor boomer teeth to constantly seeing a Cheeto man that looks like he has the skin of a flaccid penis. Don’t load this app under any circumstance or the following will happen to you.","date":"2020-07-08T19:34:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"xAri.12x","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173461988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download","review":"I am one of the few actual supporters leaving reviews here. This app messed my phone up so badly. It took hours to download and once it finally did it crashed non-stop. I genuinely wanted to be updated but this app is so horrible that I have seen absolutely nothing. Not to mention when I tried turning my phone off and on, my phone started glitching. It didn’t stop until I deleted this app. Please fix it so I can actually use it.","date":"2020-07-08T19:32:57Z","rating":1,"userName":"Natalee Zyskowski","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173436661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"We all matter🍑💀🤩🧚\u200D♀️","review":"Cat lives matter! I was walking my fish the other day and a cat came and almost ate it! People tried to take it away, but I knew it was an accident. So make sure y’all look out while you’re walking your fish.                                                                                                            Do not download this app! But if you do give it a 1 star review. They’re planning on banning TikTok, and gen Z won’t go down without a fight! So if you can give this a bad review.","date":"2020-07-08T19:24:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"#save tiktok🍑👏🧚\u200D♀️🔥","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173419737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","review":"If I could give this app 0 stars, I would. I downloaded this app in hopes of learning more about President Donald Trump and his administration, but the only thing I have learned is how terribly constructed this app is. The programming does not properly work. I can (at most) stay on for a minute before it crashes. On top of that, the text is hardly visible. My phone has been glitching out ever since I’ve decided to download this. I will gladly be removing the app from my phone.","date":"2020-07-08T19:18:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"😬😬😤😤","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173425360","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the worst app ever.","review":"this app doesn't work it glitches when loaded into.
