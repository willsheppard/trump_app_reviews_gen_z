I’m not sure if that’s a glitch or not, but it probably was, as the developers wouldn’t let something so ugly be their first impression of the app. My little sister accidentally looked at the man on the screen and the WEIRDEST thing happened. She started dancing with her eyes closed and was repeating over and over, “丂卂ᐯ乇 乃卂尺尺ㄖ几 ㄒ尺ㄩ爪卩. \nㄒ尺ㄩ爪卩 2020 ㄖ几 卂\n ᘜ尺卂ᐯ乇丂ㄒㄖ几乇” ??? Idk it was the weirdest thing bruh I’ll tell you. Oh and not to mention that my phone started smelling very horrid after a few minutes of being on the app. It started physically puking, like there was throw up coming out of my phone man. I didn’t even know that was physically possible?? Anyways, if he’s so ugly that he can make a PHONE puke, I don’t think he’s fit to be the face of the app. Tbh I don’t even remember his name. Eh it’s not worth trying to remember anyway. Wait do y’all hear that? It sounds like “Settle for Biden” anyway y’all I needa clean up my phone and walk my petCaterpillar. Toodles! 👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:11:45Z"}},{"id":"6173901744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"trump never agin","title":"Top 10 most Disgusting app EVER🤮","review":"I opened the app and saw a “keep America great” kid really first of all it’s not great now   second of all it never was great.
