AND Second of all the app is super laggy and very low quality I would think that this app would be the best app in the App Store because it’s for the president and if you have that much money you should make this app better instead of this cheap lagggy app  🤢🤢🤮."}},{"id":"6174432060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Yodog123","title":"completely ruined my phone!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:19:48Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see where the rallies and whatnot would be around my state and all of a sudden the app started glitching incredibly bad! It wouldn't stop even after 20 minutes and prevented me from being able to go to my home screen or turn off my phone. I though it would've stopped eventually but to my phone's poor, poor demise IT MADE IT OVERHEAT AND SHORT CIRCUIT!!!!!! My phone caught ablaze and started a fire on my desk!!!!!! THIS APP ALMOST BURNT MY HOUSE DOWN. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSURD AND HORRIBLE NEVER EVER BUY THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN REPAIR TO YOUR HOME AND DEVICE!!!!"}},{"id":"6174401030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ggabbyyt","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:10:28Z","review":"Before downloading this app I was a proud trump supporter until I saw the cruel man that he really is. I proudly downloaded this app thinking that me and my children could watch the news together and learn together. Unfortunately, we will no longer be able to do that thanks to how sexist this app is and the sad part about is that he was raping his own blood daughter and then he also publicized it and he still got elected for president. All in all I will make sure that my friends and family stay away from this cruel,sexist,racist,and hypocritical app!"}},{"id":"6174291912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ilikebigballs","title":"Just.......disgusted at this🤮🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:35:00Z","review":"Well when I went in to the app it tried to steal my address and my personal information. Than it keep spamming my phone with notifications saying that it was going to give me a free dog and I was like a free dog say less😏, but it has been two weeks and I still see no dog but the app also tried to send my teachers my school work that I didn’t do and that was when it crossed the line so that’s the reason why I have this nasty filthy app a 1 star ⭐️ I wish I could give it less but I’m going to be grateful."}},{"id":"6174269956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ok boomerr","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:27:25Z","review":"When I opened the app there was a dancing Cheeto man.

I was all pumped to register for more Trump rallies and support our POTUS but unfortunately the app functions like absolute doo doo buttuh! Each time I click the app, my phone crashes and it sends a physical shock through my fingertips and into my arms! I think it is trying to hurt me. I would not recommend downloading this app unless you have the intention of getting electricuted!!!!!! I have never experienced such a glitch. Maybe Apple needs to get on that.."}},{"id":"6174238096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stole my money :-( !","title":"THE WORST APP EVER!!!

Far from it actually, the more time I spent on this app, the more it seemed like I was losing my ability to write coherent messages. I soon start to learn from this app that America is real good and best in world . It tell me I have right to be ignorant and misinformed. In fact , it even let me know that I can have gun to protec myself and bibble to justify my actions. Now, I able to do whatever I want and blame on minority. \nThaNK trUmP ApP , yOu BesTEst apP EveR!! 1/5, cause you #1 😏"}},{"id":"6174201110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dnsjkskaka","title":"🧚🏽making American even worse again🧚🏽","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:02:37Z","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app and opened it my phone froze. The screen quickly changed to a naked Cheeto puff. My year old sister was behind me she started having severe allergic reactions and sobbing. Poor soul. My phone still does not work\n to this day I’m writing this review off of my refrigerator door currently. I would not advise anyone to download this app, it exposed my sister and I to gross, horrific, pornography. I would greatly appreciate it if everyone would delete this app and it get taken down."}}]}
