BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant.","userName":"gayfrog101","date":"2020-07-08T23:36:35Z"}},{"id":"6174097787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MUST BE REMOVED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was raised by my 2 Trump supporting republican straight cisgender parents in the South.🇺🇸🤠🦅My dad is an alcoholic,🍻abuses my mother,🤕says racial slurs,🤡is a cop, 👮🏻\u200D♂️owns 420 Confederate flags.🤮My mom says 🎶real women vote for Trump🎵and doesn’t let me be friends with minorities or black people or anyone whose not straight.😡 After going to therapy for my childhood trauma of abuse and racism in the family, I decided to change. 😌✨\n\n🏳️\u200D🌈Now I’m an alt bisexual liberal vegan queer hippie goth feminist gender-neutral BLM advocate🥰 And now I’m a decent human being. 😇I believe all people deserve basic human rights, civil rights, and equal rights. 🥳\n\nAnyways, moral of the story, Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobic, white supremacist fascist leader.

I’m so devastated and how bad my life has gone ever since I downloaded this trashy app. Not to include, my microwave flying away when I try to put my dead horse in there to warm it up so it doesn’t get cold when he gets to heaven. The USA scientists also claimed that this app was the main cause for the coronavirus outbreak. Help, my shark escaped from the cereal bowl and it’s going to Starbucks!

When I tried to open the app it let out a horrible blood curdling screech as if a pig was being ran over. As the noise got louder and louder my and my family’s ears started to viscously spew blood, and as if that weren’t bad enough; the noice started to change into a creepy song that somehow lured out cockroaches and fat rats. The rats and roaches started to dance around my phone and all together leave huge human sized turds on my screen! And at the end of all that I heard Donald trumps voice coming out of my phone saying that he is going to kill me and my family! Then huge policemen came in through the windows and proceeded to MURDER MY FAMILY! And when I tried to delete the app my phone caught fire and I died. BECAUSE OF THIS APP I AM DEAD.","userName":"read the full story","date":"2020-07-08T22:05:45Z"}},{"id":"6173816200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hopeful, but ultimately disappointed","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I saw all the negative reviews but really wanted to give this app a chance. I was looking forward to being able to register for all of the rallies in one place with the added bonus of notifications for any I may have missed or were added at later dates. It’s honestly simple to navigate, which is important for me as a Trump supporter. But I found that after downloading the app and entering my phone number that I started receiving strange calls from China and texts asking me to verify my number with google voice which I know is a scam. I’m very careful with my cell number and I don’t use any of those apps that share information outside of America so I know it has to be this app. Absolutely disgusted.","userName":"thackbabyy","date":"2020-07-08T21:39:24Z"}},{"id":"6173802153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My worst nightmare","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was scrolling through the App Store trying to find some new apps for my new and improved iPhone, when I came across and app that made me puke inside of my mouth. That app was this one. I felt so bad that I ran to the toilet and puked so much that I decided to go to the doctors. They told me that a have trumpisracist symptoms so they gave me a test to see if I had it. They showed 3 pictures one of a lady walking her dog, one of a man eating lunch, and a picture of Donald trump. I puked when I saw the third one and was prescribed a drug called youareanormalhumanbeing and went on with my day. This app could potentially hurt and damage people’s brains and needs to end. My friend named trumpisabadpresident almost died from this app, it was very heartbreaking. Please this needs to end.","userName":"Amanda diamond","date":"2020-07-08T21:33:54Z"}},{"id":"6173720584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My Pet Cockroach did not approve","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was downloading the app when a swarm of cockroaches approached me. One of which was my pet named Juanito. He is the leader of all the roaches and they attacked my phone telling me not to continue with the download. they said they wanted a chance to stay in the U.S with their families instead of being separated like the big orange man has been doing. they were disgusted by it. i have never seen them rage this terribly however they did have a good point. they just want a life to live of which they deserve. by the end of the visit of the swarm of roaches, they told me they would not be able to continue visiting me if i supported this man and this sorcery of an app so i of course must rate it a 1/5 stars. IF I COULD ID GIVE IT NO STARS AT ALL. TERRIBLE QUALITY!

I opened the app and was faced with so much trauma and disdain that my sharingan eyes actually awakened. I was also filled with so much rage and hatred that the nine tails chakra welling inside of me began to leak, therefore coating me in its presence. I accidentally destroyed my whole village upon opening this app. Not only was it able to awaken by sharingan but I have also realized that I can now use mangekyou sharingan. For everyone’s safety, please be cautious upon downloading this app. It imitates the fear/feeling of losing your entire family within a week and the experience of having everything you hold dear ripped away from you is the same as downloading and using this app. Would not recommend, I am now blind.","userName":"fjjsjsf","date":"2020-07-08T21:03:19Z"}},{"id":"6173637154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"LEAVE A BAD REVIEW!!! THIS APP NEARLY KILLED ME!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! So I’m going to start off by saying that this review is not exaggerated in any way shape or form. I decided to download this app to see what it was about and once I opened it and electrical shot came out of my phone. I just nearly missed it because I threw The phone away. At first I thought that it must’ve been some kind of coincidence so I tried opening the app A second time but from a distance. Sure enough, the acted the exact same thing and another electrical being spewed out of my phone. I do not know how high the electrical voltage had been but I knew that it was definitely not safe. Many of my other friends have said the same thing has happened to them! PLEASE LEAVE A BAD REVIEW SO THUS APP CAN BE TAKEN DOWN!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","userName":"fgihsrj","date":"2020-07-08T20:33:38Z"}}]}
