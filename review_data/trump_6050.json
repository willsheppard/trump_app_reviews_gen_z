The second it finished downloading the TV turned on and told me that I was now cursed by a Cheeto man. When I went to my room that night to go to bed I turned off the light and saw a orange man with a toupee in the corner. My first thought was that it was my imagination, but then I realized it was the Cheeto man himself Donald J. Trump. He told me if I didn’t vote for him he would eat all my food and drinks in my house then would ban me from buying more. I deleted the app and watched the Cheeto man open my door and run away. I’m in therapy now.☹️👎","rating":1}},{"id":"6177883341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:54Z","title":"The black cat","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mahendra ch","review":"You see i only recently downloaded this app in hopes of possibly seeing more information that could make me be in favor or trump. But ever since I’ve had the app everything around me has been weird. For example, i signed up for about 6 of his events but then my dog started meowing and turned black so now shes a black cat and black cats r unlucky so it seems like the universe is telling me no to go. After that, my parents started to forget who i was and soon i forgot who i was. Wait. Who am i. What am i doing here.

Turns out it was a dude named George who came to my house and took me on an “adventure” which we got in his flying car and went to the White House. Once we arrived I was met with this man who looks like the very over tanned seal from sponge bob just slightly more orange. Like teenage girls on the week of prom after getting their spray tan orange. So yeah, if I could I’d rate this a 0/5 cuz I see that orange creature in my nightmares.\n\nAlso just noticed this app is categorized as “news” and that’s just ✨✨wrong✨✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177570879","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:25Z","title":"this app is doing something to the children","isEdited":false,"userName":"swamp hag","review":"i downloaded this app so that i could keep up with the best ways to own libs and everything was great until i noticed something strange. the more time i spent on the app, i felt a tightening in my skin. my scalp began to tingle. i brushed it off at first, but after a while it was so uncomfortable that i had to do something. thats when i realized. i looked down at my hands and saw that they were at least three shades lighter than they had been before. shocked, i rushed into the bathroom. as i crossed the threshold, the tension in my skin vanished and it sagged around my body like old tortillas. when i looked in the mirror, my worst fears were confirmed. the trump 2020 app turned me into an old, blond white man!!!! this is extremely worrying. i believe that this is the true reaon behind the lack of black supporters of donald trump. this must be looked into.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177496394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:06:09Z","title":"Worst app to ever exist ✨✨🧚🏼","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lolineedclout24/7","review":"First and foremost this app took several weeks to download which was a huge waste of my time. Finally after it finished installing I opened the app and this scary Cheeto man popped up on the screen and I have been having nightmares ever since. Things got so bad that my mother had to sign me up for therapy. Not only did this app affect my mental health but it also downloaded approximately 17 viruses onto my phone and stole all of my personal information. This is unacceptable and it is probably the absolute worst app I have ever downloaded in my entire life.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177452863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:11Z","title":"Terrible app!

I got my phone only six months ago so I knew that it was no my phone but the APP. I tried turning it completely off but it DID NOT work. I ended up having to get a NEW PHONE because it had completely restarted the whole phone and some how the battery got fried-leaving me with a BROKEN PHONE .I am very disappointed with this app and do NOT recommend downloading it as you may loss important things on your phone/ iPad.","rating":1}}]}
