When I opened my freezer I saw a truly terrifying sight. Looking up at me was Donald Trump but he looked like Voldemort in the 4th Harry Potter book you know when he looks like a sick baby. He looked up at me and said, “thank you for helping me defeat Sleepy Joe,” in a low, whiny voice. I don’t know how he got into my freezer but he was definitely eating my ice cream too! I wish I could give this app 0 stars. I will not be voting for him in November either. He clearly does not care about anyone but himself. He ate my ice cream!!!!"}},{"id":"6177769701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🌈🧚\u200D♀️💫🧚\u200D♂️✨🧚","userName":"-trailblazer-","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:31:38Z","rating":1,"review":"I can’t! I can’t! I canNOT TOLERATE THIS ANY LONGER!! I was hoping this app would be helpful and try to learn what our current president has planned for the future, but the app won’t even open.

It doesn’t stop day and night. It is like if you give the app permission to invade you entire life. I uninstalled the app and it didn’t work, I feel that my privacy have been invaded. Please I urged everyone to not use personal information in the app because you will receive hundreds of emails, text message etc. Every day.
