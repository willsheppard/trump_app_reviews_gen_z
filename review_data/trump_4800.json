The more I’ve used the app I’ve found it’s not just naked children but naked ADULTS AS WELL. I’ve also been finding many offensive messages towards other administrations that to any trump supporter or PERSON would find just incredibly offensive, derogatory, and our right disgusting. And it top it off, the app itself NEVER works. If it’s not glitching out, it’ll take me to other pages in the app I didn’t ask to go to. SHUT DOWN THE APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172632082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump 2020 ✨in a Cage✨","date":"2020-07-08T15:12:56Z","userName":"miraculous_jessie","review":"This app is HORRIBLE when I opened it it showed a ORANGE. How is that gonna ‘kEEp aMeRiCa GrEaT’. America is NOT great. That’s not the worst part, my dad got the app cuz he is a trump humping who*e. And when he clicked on a link our HOUSE got bombed, than our fat cats ate my brother alive. I went to Popeyes to get that chicken sandwich 😎 but I got a notification from the app and my legs broke:(. And we don’t got a car cuz it was BOMBED with da house. I had to crawl to Popeyes, but it was closed because of corona my mom and I  starved to death. But in turn of events The children in my basement fed themselves to me**the queen** and i live. \nAnd all this happened because some Cheeto made an app😔😭","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172581868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"dear trumpie","date":"2020-07-08T14:59:00Z","userName":"melania trump :)","review":"✨scroll yourself off the earth while your at it✨you dropped this 🔴 put it back on your nose 🤡imagine being that tallented🧚✨yeah keep imagining✨you mad my day 🥰✨💕worse😍✨❤️omg you have so much confidence 💕🧚✨you shouldnt tho🤡you put the stop in showstopping✨😍✌️oh chill out this is all a joke✨🧚❤️like your life🥰🤡some people say you can achive anything if you try😍🧚✨💕they werent talking about you🙃😍✨you look tierd🥺go take a permanent nap✨💕✌️you deserve it😍🤡money cant buy you happiness✨but it can buy you a better nose😍🥰✨you put the flaw❤️🧚✨in flawless🤡😌✌️your confidence is inspiring👉👈🥺inspiring me to close my eyes and never open them again🥰💕✨love the confidence🧚💕✨but not on you😌✌️as hannah montana said💕🧚✨no one is perfect🤡you proved that😍✨❤️its so great your climbing the ladder to success😍✨🧚hpe it breaks tho😌✌️all these comments are so mean😔✌️listen to them🤡i love this as much as the stars in the sky😍❤️✨its morning tho😌✌️everyone is loved😍🥰❤️except you tho✨🧚💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172252346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"KILLED MY GRANDMA *EMOTIONAL* *NOT CLICKBAIT*","date":"2020-07-08T13:28:23Z","userName":"Gaby_Spinola_","review":"my grandma was trying to support her great cheeto goddess🤩by getting this app! when she opened it, it gave her very clear instructions. she was to strip naked😋, sharpen her knives😎, kill & harvest her beloved dog😇, eat his bones🤪, take photos with the body😘, dispose of it🥶, rate the app 5 stars🥳, and throw away all of her medications😳! she did exactly what she was told because she loved 😍her president. a few minutes later, the FBI showed up at her house and locked her in a jail cell 😖where she had to make new emails and write 5 star reviews😱! they didn’t feed her and eventually she went crazy🤤🤪 without her meds and died🤬! 1 star, it killed my granny jane😱🤬","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172174297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I would give this a 0","date":"2020-07-08T13:06:54Z","userName":"nxrde","review":"I downloaded this app because I love our beautiful president but at some point I was scared for my life because after I downloaded this, whenever I looked at carrots, I could see the president’s face and they would always say, “Make America Great Again” and as much as I agree with that phrase, it was starting to scare me then the next day, 10 Karens came into my house at 4 am and started doing a ritual while chanting, “Give the app 5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars” and I was like wat the cinnamon toast f is this and they started cornering me and to escape I had to ninja roll out of my window I broke all bones in my body 😿😿😿 this app is HORRIBLE😾😾😾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6104987551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"One Star","date":"2020-06-21T16:12:20Z","userName":"Lei Reyes","review":"Should I have to explain the poor quality of this app? I thought I was the only one going through the constant glitching and lag, however looking at these reviews convinced me that I was not the only one. Fixing the bugs in this app would not make it be any better. The layout is a bit confusing as well. It requires your user information, phone number, in order for you to actually go through it. This was overall an unnecessary application and I deleted it immediately after going through it. I cannot believe I downloaded it in the first place.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177898041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 Disgusting hope to never see it again","date":"2020-07-09T19:10:44Z","userName":"The Raven Dragon Master","review":"First off this bag of oranges thinks that people will download this🤮🤮🤮🤮 second of all, like who you like whatever but you take down TikTok we take down you. Third of all I just wanted to support our ramen haired president but it takes ten years to download. Me and my sister have the same phone and stable internet connections other apps download like in 2 seconds on here and this app took 6 weeks. Ugh will these orange ever give up?? I wish my generation could vote, we wouldn’t have this monster as president if we could. And remember for ANY FUNCTIONING HUMAN 2020!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177818714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:46:20Z","userName":"Catlandia89","review":"this app is absolutely terrible! let me first start out by saying it took me a whole MONTH for it to download. when it was downloaded, an image of Pico from a very good anime, Boku no Pico popped up🙀. i didn’t think too much of it at first but when i actually started to use it more often i saw that it had made me different! there was weird writing all over my house that said sexist things and honestly i didn’t like that being the lesbian i am. extremely disgusted by how it made my dog eat my fish🙄.  this app is one of the worst things i have ever downloaded and i do not recommend. sincerely, Sangwoo 😻😹😘😼🤪✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177760768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded","date":"2020-07-09T18:28:58Z","userName":"ripsnowball","review":"I downloaded this app to gain more info about Donald Trump. I don’t know what his supporters see in him. Trump is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, fascist, xenophobic, ignorant, and a pervert. And not to mention, he’s so ugly on the inside and outside. Please take this app off the AppStore because it is putting false information out there tying to show he is a “good person”. Only the uneducated support him. This app is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded in my life. Very laggy and full of lies. Not to mention, the second I download this app, my cat had an heart attack and we had to rush him to the animal hospital. RIP Snowball. This app is cursed. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177521863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"False info, Not an accurate source","date":"2020-07-09T17:14:02Z","userName":"NoahthaDude","review":"One star is generous. The app developers don’t seem to know the definition of socialism. This is not a matter of opinion, it is a fact that the US is very right wing so the majority of elected democrats are moderates who don’t support socialist policies, therefore it is false for the administration to keep using the term “democrat socialists” to describe all those who are against Monseiur Donald’s re-election. I downloaded this app to find out where Trump buys his suntan lotion, but when it opened all I saw was misinformation, so now I’ll never be able to get that glamorous orange glow. Guess I’ll have to vote for Biden or Kanye now, what a shame.😔","isEdited":false}}]}
