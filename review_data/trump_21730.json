I’ve been saving up to put my grandma 👵🏽 in a nursing home and now I can’t even do that 😭thanks a lot trump☹️","userName":"Iierre","rating":1}},{"id":"6174114606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:30:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"I opened the app to find my phone number, photos, all my important information all on the site. I went to go play a game and found out that all my apps were deleted off my phone. I found out that they were tracking my address and threaten me to vote for trump for 2020. I don’t recommend to get this app. 🤬🤢🤮","userName":"Jungkookie BTS ARMY","rating":1}},{"id":"6174113740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:30:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Repulsive","review":"I have never been so traumatized from an app in my entire life. Opening it and seeing such an old, wrinkly, NUDE cheeto has caused me irreversible damage. Thanks to this app, I have to go to therapy three times a week just to try to erase the scarring image out of my mind. DO NOT get this app, you will save so much pain and money from therapy bills. Thank me later.","userName":"Puppyluver316","rating":1}},{"id":"6174104053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:26:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"This app not only supports a Cheeto puff but it is extremely offensive to people who have actual common sense, not only through the views shared on the app, but also how it expects to re-elect a moron with a learning disability who can’t even take an SAT as the president of the U.S. Idk about y’all but Cheeto puffs don’t deserve to be in office and I’m pretty sure Barron Trump would agree.","userName":"Hi 🧚\u200D♂️💫🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6174095234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:23:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app Not worth your time","review":"This has got to be one of the worst apps I’ve downloaded. Took forever to open. Not to mention the excessive pictures of the Cheeto that were just not necessary. Much of the app promoted very offensive propaganda that is extremely offensive to marginalized groups. 0/10 would not recommend.","userName":"Alex C23","rating":1}},{"id":"6174093576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:23:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump✨✨but in jail🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨✨","review":"As a former gen z kid I do not consider trump as my president instead he is a racist ,no good, inappropriate person. If I could I would throw him in jail myself so then America could really be great again. I met trump once and he threw his coffee at me and my very old grandmother leaving my grandmother very ill with herpes. I will not stand for this no good orangish creature. He is not even considered a human to me. BLM!","userName":"Madigoals","rating":1}},{"id":"6174086348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:20:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not snowflake approved","review":"Some background:\nI’m a snowflake, to make it short, and this app is not for me. \n\nSee, this app just is too much. It makes my little, fragile brain explode. \n\nI mean, why would a racist, homophobic, pedophilic Cheeto that doesn’t care about his country in the slightest, need an app for his small amount of followers. \n\nI thought that he would care about African Americans because he himself is a person of color, that color being bright orange of course.\n\nThis app is also just a virus in plain sight. When you download it, it will turn you into a mindless lowlife like the Cheeto himself.\n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Human #7432659015","rating":1}},{"id":"6174081883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:18:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting this app is the legal","review":"Horrible app should not be on the App Store this app gives me Night terrors it is inappropriate it’s child endangerment I see it in my fridge raider and I want to bleach my eyes every time I see this app is inappropriate it is scary children cannot download this app you should not get this app at all it’s a very dumb I just see it it is on my hot Cheetos","userName":"user56732246754578904","rating":1}},{"id":"6174053217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:08:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Please no","review":"This app is racist and prejudice on every term, as is the person it’s made for. No one should have their lives ruined because of an old sex offender who wants everyone on their knees for him, it’s just wrong. Everything about this is wrong and it needs to be proven. I am disgusted and traumatized by this so please don’t download it’s not worth it 🤢🤮","userName":"ZaturnZ","rating":1}},{"id":"6174050400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:14Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Developed hives","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD.\nDownloaded and immediately developed hives. They’ve slowly been developing facial features. The ones with mouths have breath that smells of Cheetos, and the teeth are caked with Cheeto dust. Constantly mutter sexist, homophobic, and racist comments. They occasionally shout about fake news and walls. The doctors told me the only way to get rid of them is to destroy the app. Hate negativity but I have no choice 😔👋✨","userName":"Tara Dickoff","rating":1}}]}
