It just kept repeating “Fake News Fake News” for like thirty minutes straight. It made my ears and nose bleed and I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone!

As soon as i opened the app it started showing me pictures of Trump naked🤮. I’ve never seen something so disgusting before. Then my phone started glitching and i went into my messages and the app had texted everyone i know with those pictures. My phone then got a virus and it was unfixable so i had to get a new one.👿","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-06-29T14:53:58Z","userName":"Anonymous🥱🥱🥱"}},{"id":"6134779977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This has quite frankly been the worst app that i have used. I feel like its cursed. I opened the app and put in my number because i just wanted to support america’s wonderful president and my phone shocked me which caused me horrible stomach pains and and a broken arm. I don’t know how it did it but it was sure as heck shocking. A little bit later my dog fell down the stairs and my building collapsed. I believe it’s all the app’s fault, i blame you trump\nMAGA 🤡","isEdited":false,"title":"Loyal trump supporter here","date":"2020-06-29T06:52:30Z","userName":"Ciara Verneige"}},{"id":"6134271355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"All I want to do is support my president but I can’t use the app without giving it my cell phone number. As I’m reading these reviews, I realize it’s probably a good thing I didn’t. I should be able to support my president without getting spam calls and being bombarded with texts. I wish I could give this 0 stars. Very unpleased with this app and expect things to be changed immediately.","isEdited":false,"title":"My personal information","date":"2020-06-29T03:23:37Z","userName":"Amgk2407"}},{"id":"6133604714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app is not only racist but it is HORRIBLE. i personally think that this app is very terrible because bernie sanders is not mentioned in the app and neither is queen nicki minaj 🙀‼️ i think it is very disrespectful to start an app and not include flavor 🏃\u200D♀️ is gen z will take over and create an app where all is welcomed except trump supporters, conservatives and republicans. 😸 we will invent an app where queen nicki and king bernie are featured as well as nmillz1. 😹 u have not seen the last of us ‼️ we are the future.","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-06-28T22:59:56Z","userName":"kittyslayer101😼"}},{"id":"6099377548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Here I thought that I’d be supporting the president but no. This app turned out to be a scam. They ask for your phone number and then you start receiving nothing but liberal content!!! I also put in my credit card info and donated thinking it was to the Trump campaign. Turned out it was for that liberal black lives matter movement. Those smart liberals think they got me! I called my credit card company and declared FRAUD. This app is FAKE NEWS!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"Beware, app is a SCAM!!!","date":"2020-06-20T07:45:28Z","userName":"FirstTimeRater20000"}},{"id":"6088898982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"M-my finger slipped making be download this and out of curiosity a clicked on and to my horror I saw a crusty orange easy-bake oven looking excuse for a president immediately I closed the app realizing I will end up with reoccurring nightmares of a racist,homophobic,Misogynistic rapist that is SEXUALLY attracted to his own daughter \nBut it doesn’t end there in the days following \nI was greeted with many members of th-the MAGA cult as they chanted “Make America Great Again” over and over\nWhat do you mean AGAIN   you and your cult members just want only white people and that’s a lot to say for someone who’s orange I thought while sprinting to my car and after many hours of them chasing me down the highway with torches I finally escaped\n\nIn conclusion I DO not recommend ✨🧚🤡✨🧚","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚✨🧚🌱","date":"2020-06-17T21:34:23Z","userName":"lando1t4"}},{"id":"6179125953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"After using this app for ten minutes, my phone battery went down by almost 20 percent! My phone was already at a low charge and I had to turn it off because I knew I would need it later and I couldn’t be home until 10:00 pm. It was a serious inconvenience for me and completely ruined my day. Not to mention the app crashed twice while I was on it. Ten minutes NOT well spent.","isEdited":false,"title":"DRAINS BATTERY","date":"2020-07-10T02:41:33Z","userName":"💕Aizawa💕"}},{"id":"6178916163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I know it sounds crazy, but as soon as I downloaded this app I started to experience crazy phenomena. Chairs were moving on there own and taps were made on the windows and that was just the small stuff. Later I had to had to have priest come to my house to preform an exorcism on my dog who had become possessed by the demon.
