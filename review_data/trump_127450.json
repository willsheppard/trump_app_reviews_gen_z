It would just blank out my screen and emit a faint orange glow. The more times this happened, the more intense the orange glow became. I downloaded other news apps just to make sure it wasn’t NBC, CNN, and NYT, but the only one that didn’t have an issue was Fox News. I ended up offloading the app because it just seemed weird. About 20 mins after I offloaded the app, I got a notification that I had a new voicemail message. I checked my call log hadn’t received anything, but apparently there was a message left for me. I looked at the transcript and it just said “MAGA” in bloody red text. I listened to the message on speaker, but it was sent in Morse code. I had to quickly learn Morse code and it translated as “I’m coming.” It was getting late, so I went to bed not thinking anything of the message. I just assumed it was a weird prank call from that kid who used to bully me in high school. When I got up in the morning, I checked on my pet betta fish, Bernie (who was a gorgeous royal blue color), and found him strangled with a piece of upholstery thread. My kitchen counter had orange handprints all over it, and my fridge was void of all the oranges I had bought the day before. I called 911, but only got a recorded message saying “Make America Great Again” over and over and over. I finally decided to permanently delete this app after my pet fish was brutally murdered and orange handprints covered my kitchen. When I went to delete it, however, the delete app button wasn’t there. I think it may be an Apple bug, but I have to go now because there’s someone knocking furiously on my door.","userName":"Hange Zoë","date":"2020-07-09T17:57:17Z","title":"This app killed my pet fish","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177656661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"SHREK\n\n                                       Written by\n\n                                William Steig & Ted Elliott\n\n                                     SHREK\n                         Once upon a time there was a lovely \n                         princess.
