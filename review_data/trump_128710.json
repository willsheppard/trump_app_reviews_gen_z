There are no uses for it and it should be taken off the App Store for good due to the fact that there are so many problems with the app itself not to mention how long it takes to download or that it can potentially hack your phone. Remove it please and thank you.🙏🏻😊","isEdited":false,"userName":"Elizabeth Herrason","title":"This app sucks🙃","date":"2020-07-09T12:34:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176508114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"But he’s trying to threaten to take TikTok of the App Store yeah you’re funny try it again you fat Piggly mole rat smell body fish thinking and orange onions grease burned ugly roll street runner and your wife is cheating on you","isEdited":false,"userName":"nar🤍","title":"Nar🥰 TikTok is Bankr0ll.narr","date":"2020-07-09T12:33:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176506597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am from a small hick town in North Carolina where the only options are to be a trump supporter or be disgraced. So, in efforts not to be burned at the stake I decided to download this app to properly fit into the american melting pot and low and behold I think it worked! The only downside? I had to lower my IQ a few points to understand the rudimentary, kindergarten level lies that are on this app and give up my dignity and rights because I’m a woman! A small price to be a sheep! Oh and the app design was confusing. Why Red and Blue when the only color that matters to you is White? Just saying, know your audience. Anyways Good luck with your campaign to be dictator, hitler would be so proud!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"felloprince","title":"In summary... a scam","date":"2020-07-09T12:33:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176506143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"F*** trumpppooo","isEdited":false,"userName":"illegal sooo illegal","title":"Don’t download!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:33:16Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176504256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I download the app, it starts to make my phone super glitchy, I thought it could be another cause, so I looked passed it. As soon as I open the app it started asking me for too much info, just me to just sign in, like bruh 🤨. cmon now........ Tonald Drump think he slick or sumn tryna get all my info, as if I’m not already in a gov. database but anyways, when I deleted this horrible app, my phone BLACKED OUT. I couldn’t turn it on or gain any interaction with my phone for MINUTES BRUH. during that time my phone’s speakers were blasting a speech from a Tonald Drump rally and I was bout to cry real tears.His voice is so agonizing, I had to leave my house and get some fresh air. I stepped into my car and drove to a chipotle. I got a fire bowl and it was good ash. as soon as I got home, pulling in the driveway my heart went:”DUMDUM, DUMDUM” cuz i remembered the voice of Tonald and I got scared. I crept back in the crib and my phone seemed back to normal,  I guess someone has my personal info like my iCloud stuff and the secret Krabby patty formula I got when I blackmailed plankton cuz he was cheating on Karen with S- you know what, 👁......👁 I spoke to much, back on track. BUT THEN SUDDENLY TONALDS VOICE COMES BACK LOUDER THAN EVER, MY PHONE SCREEN (INTERNALLY) LOOKS LIKE I BEAT IT UP ON A CURB and then my stomach starts to turn because if the horrific sound of our Presidents speech.i couldn’t take it anymore, neither did my bowel movements, I rushed to the bathroom. and......the rest......was history.......","isEdited":false,"userName":"Calicatt10","title":"THIS APP GAVE ME HEMORRHOIDS: STORYTIME","date":"2020-07-09T12:32:44Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176501879","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🤢🤮martha😀was🥰an🙃average🐕dog👥she💨went🍒aerf🌝&🤕aerph😢&👻EEEERR🤠 DONT DISRESPECT MARTHA LIKE THIS AGIAN!!!£&&:&;&39392£!LDKRJJDNJFJDKDIJTRKRK","isEdited":false,"userName":"MerryMerryMiner123","title":"NO","date":"2020-07-09T12:32:05Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176499309","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","isEdited":false,"userName":"fifi_c.","title":"shawty","date":"2020-07-09T12:31:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176491994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is a very smelly fish app🐠🐠. no. just. no. ❤️. @thesquadfan101：ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃ","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anti Karen moms","title":"no ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T12:29:24Z","rating":1}}]}
