That’s what this app promised. I was disappointed that when I downloaded and put my information, he would visit me. All lies! I was so ready for him to meet my pet unicorn🦄, hoping maybe it would knock some sense into him. But I am very disappointed. So whomever is running this app needs to fix this issue now😤😤😤 also I think opening the app was a bad idea cause I just looked at my pet unicorn and it had my phone with the app opened, and now my pet unicorn🦄 is turning orange🍊. So please stay safe this app will turn your pets skin orange 🍊.","date":"2020-07-09T03:55:38Z","title":"Horrified!!😡😡 My pet turned orange😡😡😱😱"}},{"id":"6174925327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"brentjester","review":"Hey Trump if you want to make America great then why are you in the White House making the worse decisions for your country. You were elected president for a reason so man up and make the change you want to see in the United States. Stop hiding because your getting called out for all the hate crimes you got. And I mean REALLY you think that being president is just living it up in the White House where the only work you do is make the country you promised worse? Huh is that what it is? Just to boost your confidence as an individual? Donald your entire country is suffering from all the fake and offensive news your giving out.","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:12Z","title":"Terrible App= Terrible Person"}},{"id":"6174773075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"my wæ or the hi eye wæ","review":"I downloaded this app!! Our sister pigeon was given the nickname Ellie/ eliana like how rude is that i don’t even know how your crusty Cheeto fingers have her that nickname but I am so disappointed. My brother Adam is now trapped in your app I always see his face pop up in the corner every time I open the app because he was trying to see how you run your app that we were told was amazing but now he’s stuck DISGUSTING!!  Ever since I’ve downloaded this app everything has gone downhill my dog got the chicken pocks, my dinosaur got away and got run over by a car. Disgusting never get this app unless you want a crusty Cheeto to see you every night. It is a no❤️ from me.","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:07Z","title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6174756384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"chogiwhatsgoingon","review":"I downloaded this app and it worked fine for the first hour. Then things in my apartment started turning in to piles of Cheeto dust. First it was the small things like my air purifier and blankets, but it suddenly escalated to my tv and couch. Have you ever been sitting on the couch watching your favorite show, Cosmos: Possible Worlds, and suddenly your in a pile of Cheeto dust? Also, the Cheeto dust was stale. Smh. I went to comfort myself about my couch and tv by making a fried egg on the stove. I was mid flip on the egg and the stove turned to Cheeto dust. It only took 5 hours for my entire apartment, including my dog Clyde, to turn into Cheeto dust. Please do something about this app before I turn into Cheeto dust....","date":"2020-07-09T02:54:02Z","title":"Pile of Cheeto dust"}},{"id":"6174746107","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"rose.1234512","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! this app is haunted!! as soon as i downloaded it a talking cheeto appeared in front of me!! it was horrifying! it almost looked like our current president who shall not be named. my sister got so scared she jumped out the window and became a cheeto too!!! it was like my living nightmare was in front of me! then i go outside and there was a cheeto army! they polluted my house w their venom called racism! it was the worst day of my life! do not recommend this app it will haunt your house! i went to the hospital to get help and i saw more cheetos eating people’s brains and inserting some weird thing called white supremacy in their brain. it was like a cheeto apocalypse!! i had to delete it right away.

I restarted my phone and an orange face appeared claiming to be the real Donald J Trump. So I clicked it and was bombarded with a virus worser than the corona virus, which by the way our oompa loompa is doing his best to solve 🥰.  Anyways I had to get a whole new phone and identity since all my information was stolen. Through all of this I’m still giving this app a 1 even though it deserves a -2. And out of the kindness off my heart I would like to thank Donald for making this country worser than it already was 🥺😘 Keep doing you boo 😉","date":"2020-07-09T02:40:31Z","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6174674012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Tynicpal","review":"I didn’t even know you could make an app that is this bad why was it even possible to make a such horrible thing. To call this app trash is basically an insult and being disrespectful for trash itself. So in advance I want to apologize to garbage and trash for relating it’s glory to this app. It’s so imperfect. It glitches before I even open the app. It’s all around a bad app. I could cut batteries in half and have them still operate better than what this thing is doing. It’s unbelievable on why it even exist. It have spams and people asking for money. What’s even the purpose for this app??? I don’t understand. I’ve lost all respect for whoever made this app. 🤮","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:14Z","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE 🤢"}},{"id":"6174648751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"UPS Delivery Guy","review":"I got this app to support our beloved Oompa Loompa Cheeto man. But as soon at I got the app Thongs started getting weird 😟. The next day I saw my dog flailing around like a spastic dolphin 🐬.It was like the dog was instead a cat with an attention disorder and someone pointed a laser pointer at it. Then I looked over at my pet fish to see that he was turned into the evil bubble from spongebob 😱😰.I screamed and ran outside my house but when I got outside I saw the Cheeto man kick a girls wheelchair and sent her flying. 👁👄👁. I panicked and knew the app had something to do with all of this. I deleted the app immediately after and everything went back to normal. Except forThe evil bubble that is now on a rampage in the city.","date":"2020-07-09T02:21:56Z","title":"Wa?👁👄👁"}}]}
