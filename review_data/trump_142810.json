DONâ€™T DOWNLOAD.","review":"I really was interested in seeing what was going on in terms of our amazing President and his rallies, but I was scarred to see such a horrendous image upon downloading the app, which by the way took a whole entire week. I have never experienced such a delay in downloading time in the app, and as soon as I the download was complete, I began to experience a great deal of glitching of my phone which I had not experienced beforehand. My phone has begun to shut off randomly and overheat rapidly even though I am indoors, and now I am scared every single night that my phone is going to overheat too much to the point where itâ€™ll catch fire in the middle of the night, and I wonâ€™t have any idea. Not to mention the traumatizing image you would see of an orange man as soon as you clicked on the app. I had to delete the app a few nights after experiencing this because I wanted to make sure that was the case, and I was right. Never again will I download this app, and it needs to go asap!","rating":1}},{"id":"6179262558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"me1958262","date":"2020-07-10T03:30:57Z","title":"AHAHAHAHAHAAA","review":"We know you did it with a bowl of spaghetti ðŸ‘€","rating":1}}]}
