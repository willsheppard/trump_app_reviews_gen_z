Trump ❤️😻. However this app is AWFUL. First things first, when I first opened the application, I was greeted by a very unflattering picture of a monster of some sort. It was orange and had papercut thin lips. This feels like a mockery of my beliefs and our country!  😡 Second of all, the overall format and idea of this app seems well made (of course cause I love Trump ❤️) but it isn’t. It’s a cheap way to praise a man like a god. NOT TO MENTION.....\n“Spongebob hurry up with those orders!” \n\n“I’m sorry Squidward! I’m trying, I really” — he burped — “am.” His hands were everywhere. His silver spatula was whooshing through the air in record speed. Lettuce and Tomatoes were flying, pickles and cheese met the hamburger buns. Spongebob was about to add to the condiments when- “Ah, shrimp!” he exclaimed, grabbing his stomach and groaning. \n\nSquidward couldn’t help but whip around his head in shock. “Uh, Spongebob?” \nSpongebob couldn’t help but groan louder, pain pocking his sides. \n“Squidward,” he said in between pain filled groans, “I think..my water broke.” \n\nThe squids eyes widened, joy and fear met his face. “I can’t believe it...it’s happening! It’s really happening!!” \n\n“Please, we need to go to the hospital,” the yellow square said, water dripping down his legs. \nLike lighting, Squidward snatched the sponge and ran to the hospital as fast as possible. It would only take minutes until he could see his new baby. \n\nHours and hours passed, Squidwards brain was filled to the brim with worry and anxiety. “Did he make it?” he couldn’t help but ask himself as his tentacles paced the waiting room.\nAs if someone was reading his mind, one of the nurses came out of the emergency room and met her teary eyes with his worried ones.\n\n“I-“ she said, stuttering, “I’m sorry Mr. Squidward...he didn’t make it.” \n\nHis knees felt weak as he collapsed on the ground. The only one who was keeping him here in this sea, the only sponge he could ever love just left him. How could he live on? \n\nTo be continued....\n\nOVERALL, a very disappointing app. I do not recommend."}},{"id":"6173997602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"a non o moose","date":"2020-07-08T22:47:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No","review":"Bad just bad 🧚🏻💕🧚🏻Very racist ✨🌷✨ Very sexist 🌟🥰🌟 Very homophobic 💥🤩💥 Very Transphobic ✨🍒✨ Very Bad 🌈🎂🌈"}},{"id":"6173989020","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jerry smithh","date":"2020-07-08T22:44:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"How is this guy the president? 🤦🏽\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6173976189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"WORST APP 0 STARS","date":"2020-07-08T22:39:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP ON THE APP STORE","review":"I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER CREATED I OPENED IT TO FIND A CHEETO ON MY SCREEN 10/10 WOULD GIVE 0 STARS SO DIGUSTING 🤮🤮🤮 worst app on this app store i hope its deleted"}},{"id":"6173931820","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yee²","date":"2020-07-08T22:22:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🤢🤢🤢","review":"i got nothin else to say except i hate this cheeto lookin man my god"}},{"id":"6173927757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump's shrimp peepee","date":"2020-07-08T22:21:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","review":"This app makes your peepee shrink 🍤."}},{"id":"6173917006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"iamarandomperson❤️","date":"2020-07-08T22:17:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","review":"anyways- \nAll I am is a man\nI want the world in my hands\nI hate the beach\nBut I stand in California with my toes in the sand\nUse the sleeves of my sweater\nLet's have an adventure\nHead in the clouds but my gravity's centered\nTouch my neck and I'll touch yours\nYou in those little high waisted shorts, oh\nShe knows what I think about\nAnd what I think about\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no\n'Cause it's too cold whoa\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold whoa\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\nAnd if I may just take your breath away\nI don't mind if there's not much to say\nSometimes the silence guides our minds to\nSo move to a place so far away\nThe goosebumps start to raise\nThe minute that my left hand meets your waist\nAnd then I watch your face\nPut my finger on your tongue\n'Cause you love the taste yeah\nThese hearts adore,\nEvery other beat the other one beats for\nInside this place is warm\nOutside it starts to pour\nComing down\nOne love, two mouths\nOne love, one house\nNo shirt, no blouse\nJust us, you find out\nNothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no no\n'Cause it's too cold whoa\nFor you here\nAnd now\nSo let me hold whoa\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\n'Cause it's too cold whoa\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold whoa\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\nWhoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa\n'Cause it's too cold whoa\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold whoa\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\nIt's too cold whoa\nFor you here and now\nSo let me hold whoa\nBoth your hands in the holes of my sweater\nIt's too cold,\nIt's too cold\nThe holes of my sweater"}}]}
