So, I downloaded the app all excited to see what it has in store and I was greeted but a DISTURBING photo of a Man wearing an orange peel mask.

As well as this app has Trump's face in it which I personally don't understand why they chose to do that. I just think that it would be best if this app was gone to be honest with you all.","rating":1,"userName":"lourve louve somebody louve","title":"Very horrible app"}},{"id":"6173935736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:23:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I had a seizure last night and I’m pretty sure I died because I woke up and seen this app. Now, I’m not religious but I do believe I’ve ended up in hell.
