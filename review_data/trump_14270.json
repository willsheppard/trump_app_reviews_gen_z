It took hours to download. The app will crash every time you try to open it. I thought this app was going to be very good, but it is actually terrible. This app takes up so much of your storage. When I first downloaded the app, my phone started to glitch so bad.  I found out I got 22 viruses from just downloading this application. Please fix the glitching and crashing. DO NO GET THIS APP.","date":"2020-07-09T14:56:04Z","userName":"rae sist","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177037249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET","review":"this app took more than 6 hours to download, and resulted in my whole phone storage being used! Silly me for thinking this app wouldn’t use my whole 256GB of free storage. only download if you want to turn into a sexist orange lame excuse of a man. not to mention he ALSO r@ped my 12 year old sister. the first thing that pops up on the app are his nudes, which has mentally deteriorated me. if anyone knows of a good therapy app, please let me know.","date":"2020-07-09T14:54:43Z","userName":"zdenslow","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176928962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Waste of Storage","review":"This is honestly the most useless app. It asks you for your phone number right away, and is a way to trick you into receiving frequent and obnoxious texts from the Trump Administration. Little to no useful content is provided through this app. On top of it all, the app quality is much worse than expected from the president.... You’re better off without this download.","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:39Z","userName":"Lola Ingrel","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176921686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"It broke my phone then an unknown caller started spamming messages saying ✨o r a n g e ✨ and like this is terrible I cannot and I don’t tolerate it destroyed my phone and like I’m crying and there’s so much spams and like idk it makes me wanna cry cause ice done some serious studying for this phone and the app destroyed it and there’s like a whole lag this app is bad remove it right now please and thank you bye have a blessed day and pray because covid-19 isn’t good.","date":"2020-07-09T14:23:47Z","userName":"Elle is already taken 😭😭😭","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176902475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨🍊 no thanks 🍊✨","review":"this app was an aw𝐅ul experience in all, and a complete 𝐔dder waste of time and space on my 𝐂ell phone. he clearly doesn’t 𝐊now what he is doing with 𝐓his app. as soon as i opened the app i was greeted by the most horrid dis𝐑espectful thing i have seen in my life. yo𝐔 should not download. it requested my phone and i believe that that question violated 𝐌y privacy question. over all do ✨not ✨ download this a𝐏p! :)\n\n- Very valuable opinionated person","date":"2020-07-09T14:18:47Z","userName":"🍊🦗😭😵🤤🦗⛳️🦟🥳🥺","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176895103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bruh","review":"I’m only here because I heard that Trump is trying to band tik tok in America. And that makes him a bad person so I his app deserves to be gone. What I don’t understand is does he know that the app tik tok helps people overcome depression? Does he not know that people have almost committed suicide and then stopped when they got tik tok? Does he want to kill people? It would be a really bad thing to delete the app. Because of his actions I rate this app a 1 Star.","date":"2020-07-09T14:16:52Z","userName":"Mommy11223323","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176874148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This is the WORST APP i have ever downloaded","review":"After 4 yrs of watching my racist, sexist, homophobic president I decided to download this app to in anyway support my president. I regret EVER downloading the app it’s is disgusting and poorly designed, what would I have expected considering the fact it was designed by donald trump himself. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!! If I could I would give it a 0 star.  Also I don’t usually review apps so that fact that I am reviewing this app speaks volume.","date":"2020-07-09T14:11:20Z","userName":"kate,,.","isEdited":false}}]}
