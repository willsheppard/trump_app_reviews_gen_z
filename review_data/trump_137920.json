I was searching for a purpose in something, but nothing worked. Not school, not drugs, not my boyfriend; I even did alcohol, but that just left me feeling even more lonely. After that I thought I would branch out, so I got involved in a Jamaican dog fighting circle, but I soon learned that that was bad news. I was lost. But it was in this pit of despair that I discovered the thing that changed my life forever. I downloaded Trumps app. At first, I was a casual supporter , reading updates every once in awhile. But as time went on, being a supporter began to take on a deeper meaning. 11 pm on a Friday night meant something completely different than a 9:30 on a Tuesday morning. Checking in on the app became something special, something meaningful. Trump transformed my life. It taught me what it meant to be a mother, how to take out a bank loan, even how to talk to people without violently vomiting. I would not be the person I am today if it wasn’t Trump and this app. Now to you out there, reading this review, thinking to yourself, “How could this stupid app ever be useful?” Give it a try. I beg of you, take a chance. You won’t regret it. Thank you, God Bless you.","rating":1,"title":"Hear me out...","userName":"Jupiter Rayne","date":"2020-07-10T06:48:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179826766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i really wanted to like this app.. however, it constantly crashes and bombards me with nonstop ads. it’s glitchy and is totally useless as an app.","rating":1,"title":"not worth the storage it takes up on your phone","userName":"elizabeth10284$","date":"2020-07-10T06:48:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179826620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t believe y’all let a Cheeto become president not only is he a Cheeto puff he is a racist, liar, manipulator and rapist shame on America for letting this man become president.

I asked around and my friends referred me to this app. It looked promising because the Icon is blue (blue is my favorite color), and I have never heard of a “trump before.” Is that some type of spice? Anyways, upon opening this app I was met with my first match. He was the most vile, regurgitated, bile Cheeto I’ve ever seen in my entire life. I can’t believe that this app would match me (a very beautiful Aryan white woman) with somebody that looked like my delicately tanned anus. I am appalled. I was willing to lower my standards to find my man, but I didn’t mean this much. Anyways. This is the worst dating service I’ve ever used. 0/10 would not recommend 😞","rating":1,"title":"Wish I could give this 0 stars","userName":"steffiehughes","date":"2020-07-10T06:48:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179826185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"APP NEVER SHUTS UPP.
