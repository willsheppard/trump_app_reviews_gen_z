When i first downloaded the app i was willing to support our president during this terrible time but soon after i realized that HE was watching everything I had done on the app without me knowing. Only later did i realize he supports homophobia and racism. I'am telling the truth when i say not to download this app. I developed migraines from the levels of anxiety on this app and deleted it.

I quickly closed the app and reopened it later the next day and as soon as I opened it my mother sang the hokie pokie in bass while doing the Macarena. I was about to give up on the app but opened it once more and my house flew into the sky with no balloons attached. This app is purely demonic and I will never use it again.

When I opened the app there was a huge Cheeto with a little one coming out🤢🤢 I was disgusted and quickly deleted the app. I found it confusing which makes sense because nobody with common sense would actually download this unless it’s a joke❤️🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💖🌈🌙.

I downloaded this app as a way to thank him but as soon as I went to open it my grandma who died in 2012 told me to walk my fish before it got ugly. After I finished with that I had to put gas in my skateboard in order for me to drive my seat belt. As all of this was happening it just so happened that I died and I would like to apologize for any inconveniences that I have caused. -Melania Trump🙂","date":"2020-06-29T15:23:15Z"}},{"id":"6135066929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Made my phone glitch so baddddd!","userName":"Tréę","review":"I downloaded this app and then not even 5 minutes later my phone was about to blow up!

As soon as I installed the app I was overwhelmed with constant dizziness and horrible gas!!! The farts became a daily symptom, they felt deadlier every day!! Not only that, every time I heard Trump’s name I had the sudden urge to twerk to the National Anthem and can never bring myself to enjoy a bag of Cheetos ever again as I am constantly remind of President Trump and his horrible app. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL!!","date":"2020-06-29T08:29:05Z"}},{"id":"6134157545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Such a disappointment...","userName":"J3NHD3Z","review":"This is by far the worst app that has ever existed... like EVER!! It steals your personal information and there is constantly notifications going off spamming you 24/7. I will never recommend this app to anyone.

His supporters are even worse. Bunker boy could say the n word with a hard r and his supporters would say something to the lines of “you misunderstood him” Please for the love of this country, put that toddler in a grown mans body of a president in the WORST reviewed mental hospital. Lobotomy’s are illegal now, but I think we should make one exception. Down with Trump 2020 ✨🧚🏻","date":"2020-06-28T17:17:59Z"}}]}
