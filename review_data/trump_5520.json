Every single word is like reading from the vocabulary of a kindergartner who just learned how to make fun of someone. Not only that, but this app is filled with fake information, probably delusions from Bunker Boys brain. I wouldn’t doubt if he used all of his brain power to try to make this app appeal to the masses but no one cares enough about his success, not even his poor wife and son (who needs rescuing). Also vote Biden 2020 to get this white supremacist out of office for the love of what good is left in this world","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T08:12:20Z","userName":"bananacookie5","title":"Reads like a child with anger issues wrote it","rating":1}},{"id":"6136521926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"oh boy, this app is awful. i’d previously read the reviews stating it was cursed, but my immense love for trump convinced me these were only false allegations. ive never encountered evil ... until i downloaded this app. trump WAS my sleep paralysis demon. my dog would also roam the halls at night and whine which he’d never done before. im convinced he was possessed or something. on top of all that, i was receiving very many messages that i didn’t want. all in all, i do not recommend this app to anyone. ive been receiving therapy since downloading this app. my therapist says this could be years of trauma and ptsd. thanks trump🙄","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T16:17:34Z","userName":"Boneses!","title":"🧚\u200D♂️ no no no 🧚\u200D♂️","rating":1}},{"id":"6136126248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t even know where to begin. i was so excited to support my president but this app is awful! as soon as i opened it my mom told me my parents are getting a divorce, my dog ran away and now i’m single👹👿 trump also CURSED me out as soon as i texted the number, which was very scary and traumatizing. i just advice to any other patriots to never buy this app. my phone started heating up and burned my hand bc of the overload of info on the app, and the app was so mean😡 it asked for my face id and then roasted me for hours. it called me shrek donky dog doo doo and told me to get a nose job. this app has convinced me to #settleforbiden","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T14:17:17Z","userName":"Malia Ann Obama","title":"Crap!","rating":1}},{"id":"6136062715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I personally just want to say before I rate this app, rip trumpie 🐵🙈🧚\u200D♂️✨✨no one will ever miss you✨🙈🧚\u200D♂️✨. After that I immediately downloaded it and then a bunch of dirty ads popped up, I have never done any such sin, so I immediately complained to Donald j trump himself, before he passes of course. When I did he tried to get my address and he asked me to send pics! I was a big trump fan so I gave him my address he then proceeded to come to my house and take a dump on my lawn, then started to twerk while naked I front of all of me and my family.. not sure how I feel about that. I am not a trump fan anymore.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T13:59:49Z","userName":"🐵✨🧚\u200D♂️disapointed🙈✨✨","title":"Disgusting!!!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6121659087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do not waste your time on this app!!! It is a SCAM. I downloaded this app as a means to feel closer to our wonderful President. Mr. Donald J. Trump. I am disappointed to find that this app is FULL of nothing but FAKE NEWS!! I don’t know if some of those pink haired liberals hacked it but this app is a mess. It constantly lags and kicks me out of the app. It also DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY ALBUMS WITH TRUMP’S PICTURES!!!!! How is this acceptable???? I DEMAND to somehow be reimbursed with the time I wasted trying to figure out how to use this app. I will be waiting for an email apologizing for this blatant disrespect and a courtesy pack filled with MY PRESIDENT’S merchandise. I expected more from you, Donald😤😢😭","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-25T21:59:59Z","userName":"Trump supporter123","title":"WORST APP!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177743164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I believe this app is used as a strategic method to hack the phones of innocent Americans. After I first downloaded the app, all the money in my bank account disappointed. I noticed things were purchased on 7 different apps on my phone where my card was saved on my profile. Do not download this app. As soon as it gets on your phone, the government has access to everything in your cloud. They will steal your money and use it to fund Trump’s campaign, the police, sex trafficking rings and promoting white supremacy. This app and Trump need to taken down.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:23:39Z","userName":"CornHolioForBreakfast","title":"Worst app (and person) ever!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177659018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst experience i have ever had with an app ever. My 5 year old cousin could have created a better working app. When I first opened it, it crashed 16 times before i got to the main page. Then, it deleted all of the contacts on my phone just from logging in. It also made a loud beeping noise every time i opened the app and didn’t stop unless i turned my phone off and on again. Lastly, I was visually unpleased by the orange looking creature within the app so I decided it was best to get rid of this app and make apple get rid of it too.✌🏼","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:57:47Z","userName":"miss kiesha🧚🏻\u200D♀️","title":"Truly a disgrace🤢","rating":1}},{"id":"6177564290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worse! it keep making ur phone crash, it keep taking me off the app! Then when I put my phone number in, I got random texts from different people! This app had leaked my number to different people! This app doesn’t even tell you trump plans it jus make your phone crash and it’s loads very slowly! It was doing perfectly fine until I had downloaded this app! Guys please don’t waste your time trying to see his plans because it won’t even load right! I HIGHLY do not recommend and do not download it! This is 1 Star! Very useless","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:27:19Z","userName":"eww you","title":"BAD APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6177480889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took two weeks to download. Ridiculous! Wish I could give it zero starts! I opened the app and it said I am now cursed! It then started deleting everything of of my phone including pictures and I hadn’t had my phone backed up! After it deleted everything my phone exploded. All I was trying to do was support the unproblematic king trump😔 but instead it took everything including the money from my bank account. I am now in debt and lost my house and can only eat Cheetos👎🏽 never ever download this app it is the work of satan😡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:01:27Z","userName":"bunker boy's babygirl","title":"This app ruined my life 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177453814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Within minutes of downloading this application, without even opening it, my quality of life DIMINISHED. I became almost completely braindead from the pure brain rot radiating from within the application. I sadly can no longer even think even because of the idiocy Donald J. Trump is spewing and publishing through this application. My phone is also severely damaged, as all the pixels on the screen around the app EXPLODED upon installation! Now I will have to buy a new phone! Not worth the money I paid for this app, if there was a zero star option I would use it.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:29Z","userName":"Emma Styles 10415","title":"This App Ruined My Life Forever!!","rating":1}}]}
