I love it! I love it!\n\n  \n- I wonder where they were.\n- I don't know.\n\n  \nTheir day's not planned.\n\n  \nOutside the hive, flying who knows\nwhere, doing who knows what.\n\n  \nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\nJock. You have to be bred for that.\n\n  \nRight.\n\n  \nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n  \nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n  \nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\n\n  \nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\n\n  \nDistant. Distant.\n\n  \nLook at these two.\n\n  \n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\n- Let's have fun with them.\n\n  \nIt must be dangerous\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\n\n  \nYeah.
