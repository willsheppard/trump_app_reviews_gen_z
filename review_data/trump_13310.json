Every time I tried to get in it didn’t work. Also, after a while I started hearing beeps coming from my phone that sounded like the sounds Trump makes in his rally’s. Those traumatized me and I had to sign up for therapy DURING Quarantine. So thank you for ruining my life with this disgusting app🥰","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:21:43Z"}},{"id":"6178096178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"user4294344465","rating":1,"title":"horrible app","review":"I downloaded this app to find out more about politics and how the election might go but in due of when I fully downloaded this app, it immediately crashed and I had to keep on redownloading and redownloading it and when I was finally able to open it, it shut me down and out after a while.

But they weren’t them. It’s was a front for spam callers and sales people. It took me at lease twenty minutes to figure out why it was happening CONSTANTLY! And so I deleted this ridiculous app. Worse invasion of privacy I have experienced ever! I would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANYONE!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:13:47Z"}},{"id":"6178075996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😌:karen worgerbottom","rating":1,"title":"this is a 🍊horrible🍊 app.","review":"This app slows my phone down for than imaginable, I am unable to clsoe out of the app unless I am forced to send my phone number, and This ✨app✨is making me feel extremely uncomfortable, since I’ve notice strange activity on my phone once I downloaded the app. I do NOT recommend downloading this app!

A couple days after I downloaded the app, my apple account got blocked and so did any account I had opened on my phone including TikTok. I tried contacting Pear Support but they told me that the president didn’t want me to find out about all the naughty things he had been doing behind closed doors. Will never be downloading this app again.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:04:10Z"}},{"id":"6178058438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anonymous2.518","rating":1,"title":"This is terrible","review":"This app is so bad it doesn’t even work it’s glitchy and I am part of the Gen z movement so TAKE THAT GOVERNMENT I hope that you have learned your lesson not to mess with us but over all this app is terrible it doesn’t run correctly and makes you mistype things and it just doesn’t meet the standards that I had for it trump 2020 is a no he shall not be president again no thank you so this is a goodbye that that president and a good ridance","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:03:10Z"}},{"id":"6177977521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NotSecretlyAKat","rating":1,"title":"Cat resurrection failed","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes that my dead cat would come back. I’d seen many videos talking about how trump was bringing back our beloved pets with this app’s instructions, but like every plan and promise he makes, it went completely downhill. My cat Did come back, but she was completely decomposed, and missing both eyes. Even her tail was bone! 0/10 would not recommend, look for cat resurrection alternatives.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:36:40Z"}},{"id":"6177976181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"get your knee of their neck","rating":1,"title":"They are all the same","review":"Trump is a white nationalist who has systematically thrived off of our racial caste system. He supports a fascist police governed state, and wants nothing more to make the rich richer, and to continue killing and exploiting minorities. Not only is he a blatant racist, but his TRUE connection to Epstein, and others, proves that he is directly connected to Human Trafficking, and sexual abuse/rape against minors. He’s disgusting, abhorrent, inhumane, and is the neoconservatives cult leader. Gen Z is not blind. We are the revolution.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:36:16Z"}},{"id":"6177949202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Julianna Kang","rating":1,"title":"disgusting.","review":"whoever created the graphic design should be FIRED. as someone with sensitive eyes, this was incredibly offensive and would NOT recommend AT ALL for anyone who has the same problem. the colors? the picture of DJT? horrendous. i have never been more disappointed in an app in my entire life. it even asked me for phone number?! i am not that easy. i want a refund immediately! let me speak to your manager right now.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:27:30Z"}},{"id":"6177934448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"navi00098","rating":1,"title":"very disappointed","review":"As an avid maga supporter, I’m very disappointed with this app. I looked up to this  🍊 for a while now, but now after a week of using this app I am annoyed, disgusted, and will no longer support him. He has no lips 👄 how will he get a kiss kiss 😚 😚. No kiss 💋 for him. The graphics are horrible and it’s very difficult to navigate through this app. I know my president ✨would never approve of this app, and I demand it be taken down.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:22:43Z"}}]}
