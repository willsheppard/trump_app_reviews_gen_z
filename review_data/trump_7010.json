Then I think u should just not waste your time cause you won’t get it back and you will spend it liking at this pig of a human that thinks he knows what he is doing.  In general the app is just glitchy and isn’t very useful at all so it is just occupying space in your storage because why would u want to know about a Cheeto 🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174185748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"You definitely don't know me","date":"2020-07-08T23:56:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"absolutely horrid","review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh"}},{"id":"6174167990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sophia😌","date":"2020-07-08T23:50:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING AND DISGRACEFUL","review":"when i tried downloading it, it took about 17 hours to finally finish even with good wifi and everything soon a pop up showed asking if i wanted to join the illuminati 😳😳😳 and of course i said no because that’s a big no no 😾😾😾 big orange peel should know better than that 🤬🤬🤬🤬anyways when i finally got passed that it was glitch after glitch and soon it brainwashed my dog into packing its bags and leaving the house 😭😭😭😭😭i’m crying so much right now he’s never to be seen again😖😖😖 0/10 do not recommend😾😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6174157962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kengacha1121","date":"2020-07-08T23:46:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Wow, racist much?🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫","review":"First off, this app is telling me to add my phone number? yeah, no way in hell. Out of all apps this is definitely not one I will be giving my information to! and 2nd when I opened the app I greeted with a very racist white fat man, me being part of a race that doesn’t happen to have white privilege, I took this to GREAT offense! And when I downloaded this app I was expecting great trømp2020 content BUT that’s CLEARLY not that’s this app is about. Also, I was not warned about seeing a Cheeto in the front page. Which I will admit. Was hilarious!🚫🚫⚠️🤢🤢🤮🤕😪👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"}},{"id":"6174130343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DISGUSTED_USERRR22","date":"2020-07-08T23:36:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"I was interested to see what this app was all about, upon download I IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED doing so. The app has changed the way my phone works!! Changing the layout of the iPhone, refusing to let me unlock or even recognize my face!? I am offended that the president and administration are allowing such an app to be available!! Especially to all ages!? NO!! The context is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY nor user friendly. I am HORRIFIED this app is available for download and I hope that I can stop anyone else from downloading such a PUTRID and DISGUSTING app!!!

NOT, DOWNLOAD. THIS. APP 😡😡!!!!! For starters there was a weird orange dude on the sign in page 🤮🤮. I was extremely creeped out and I felt like I was being watched 😬 It made me want to call my mom 😔. He was demanding my personal information and I felt completely violated 😖😖.  There was some rando thing behind him in the back that made no sense 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️. He kinda seems like a predator and I am now putting a lock on my hamster cage 😳😳. Idk maybe I’m just dramatic but unless you want your eyes to be molested, I would steer clear of this app 🤭."}},{"id":"6173975431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"this suckkksksksksjdj","date":"2020-07-08T22:38:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not Download!!","review":"Oh my word! This app is terrible!! I am of course a Trump supporter (vote Trump 2020!) and I just wanted to get all the latest updates on rallies and our president’s campaign. However, once I downloaded the app, my phone shut down!! It wouldn’t turn on no matter what buttons I pressed. I took my phone to my local phone repair shop and they said there was nothing they could do. So, I had to purchase a brand new phone. This app costed me two hundred dollars!!! I am furious! Whatever you do, DO NOT GET THIS APP unless you want a virus in your cell phone. ✨✨"}}]}
