The design, details, operation... can’t even use it. It’s a tragedy really. A shame that it can’t even function as a basic app. Disgraceful.","userName":"jjjBIZZLE","title":"Unbelievable App!"}},{"id":"6173648301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:37:38Z","rating":1,"review":"Reasons I don’t recommend this app!\n\n1. Takes weeks to download\n2. The app overall is just disgusting 🤢\n3. Once you download the app and you click “sign in” or something it takes a few minutes to actually open the process\n4. I had to restart my phone 2 times for the application to open\n5. Once I had opened the sign in page after I registered I couldn’t enter into the app \n\nThank you for reading if you did 🙏🏽","userName":"VeryTrueReviews","title":"Worst app I’ve ever seen!!"}},{"id":"6173622997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:28:36Z","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened the app my phone got a virus and was hacked. They got all my card information and spent a bunch of my savings. Now I’m homeless with no where to live.

I just wanted to support the myth, the man, the legend, President 🍊. When I opened the app, there was terrifying music playing that made my house erupt with tarantulas. Soon after, my house shook so hard it fell to the ground. It is unfathomable how upsetting this app is.
