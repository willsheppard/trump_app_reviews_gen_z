This app was not user friendly. Also I wanted to see the rallies coming up but I had to make an account in order to see them? Not very republican of Donald Trump if you ask me. If he wants to be president he should make everything easily accessible on his campaign app. Overall very disappointed in this man. I also think that because of this app he has lost my vote this fall.","title":"Horrible App to Use","isEdited":false,"userName":"*winnie*pooh*","rating":1}},{"id":"6174540250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:51:06Z","review":"I don’t like this app because it just give me chills because they would let an Cheeto run an app I don’t want to sound rude but just staring at this app makes me fell weird and like ima puke up all my dinner🤢but sorry to say luv but this app ain’t it and ik where some people are coming from😉 I hate that this app is even a thing it’s at like 1.4 review so you can just delete it it won’t really get any better so I need to put this in its own wall against all the other apps cause this one ain’t it🥰","title":"horrible app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"narwhal56","rating":1}},{"id":"6174533412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:49:07Z","review":"Please please DON’T get this app when I opened I saw and rotten orange like who does his spray tan its horrible anyways I also saw his Cheeto 🤢 and that blinded me so I had to get an eye transplant then I had to get a therapist because I was still hunted with that horrible image and then I had such a bad nightmare it was about an orange with crusty lips and hair that looks like corn husks my phone was also terrified she ask me why I did it to her and then she died you scared my phone to death rip my phone😢(btw I am typing this on a microwave) so please DONT GET THIS APP","title":"HORRIBLE 🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"jocesly","rating":1}},{"id":"6174517958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:44:47Z","review":"When I opened the app to support the POTUS and see the news he shares, I had a severe glitch in the simulation because I realized I care for the people in the country and believe that the world is in a horrid place right now because of him, because he wont recognize he needs to work for change. So the app kicked me off and undownloaded itself to try and avoid an awful review but he couldnt beat me and here I am writing a review 😊 Sorry that we have Cheeto for a president and I hope he doesnt get re-elected","title":"Very Unsatisfactory","isEdited":false,"userName":"Grace Kelly Rhea","rating":1}},{"id":"6174500603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:39:56Z","review":"Do I really have to explain all the horrible reasons why you should delete that app. There are tens of thousands of reviews to look at but I will say one thing. The moment I opened the disgusting app the devil (Trump) popped up on my shoulder. It started saying the most racist, sexist, awful things you could think of and tried to convert me. Obviously I’m strong enough to fight back using tik tok and all of America and the world. To save yourself pls pls don’t download this app or you’re risking your life.","title":"Rate one star to save Tik Tok and America","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bostoff","rating":1}},{"id":"6174492804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:37:45Z","review":"I was hopeful while downloading the app that it would be great and opened it with my kids however upon opening the app me and my kids were horrified. The children began to cry. The cover shows a devilish orange ape winding up his fist ready to punch. I’m truly horrified and would like to warn anyone from the horrifying nature that is this app. If I could leave anything less than a one star review I would. I don’t know where I’m going to get the money to pay for me and my children’s therapy to recover from this trauma.","title":"Horrible😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jo C.

But as I was downloading the app I starting to get worried. Everyone was saying there was naked Cheeto. BUT I REFUSED TO BELIEVE THEM. So, as the determined human I am, i proceeded to download and open this HORRID app. JUST AS EVERYONE SAID there was a naked Cheeto dancing all over my screen. I closed the app with no second thoughts. And that’s when I noticed my wallpaper was the same image! My eyes receded back into their sockets. I couldn’t bare seeing such a ratchet looking creature. So I passed away right then and there😌✨","title":"NAKED CHEETO??","isEdited":false,"userName":"lemonsinmyeyeballs","rating":1}}]}
