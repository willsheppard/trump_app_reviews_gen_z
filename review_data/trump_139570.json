A psychopathic assassin, Bullseye uses the opportunities afforded by his line of work to exercise his homicidal tendencies and to work out his own personal vendetta against Daredevil.[1] He is also an enemy of the Punisher. Although he possesses no superpowers, Bullseye is able to use almost any object as a lethal projectile, be it weapons like shuriken and sai or seemingly harmless objects like playing cards and pencils. His marksmanship is uncanny, at a nearly supernatural level.","title":"F**k trump","userName":"vitotoyi","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179594666","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:22:55Z","review":"Mr. Tangerine’s app took entirely too long to download and while downloading the mango stole ALL of my information!
