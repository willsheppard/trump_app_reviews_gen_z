Trump’s duty as a president is to protect Every single one of his citizens. It is not a surprise that the US is a country full of immigrants and diverse communities. Why run for president if you only REALLY care about one of them? “Make America Great Again” means make America white again. You have all your little supporters on your side but trust that we are stronger than you’ll ever think we are. Trump is NOT winning the election. If he does, this country will be in dictatorship, with EVERYONES rights in danger. Even the white people’s. So for the love of god just open your eyes and see that Trump is only gonna make America worse than it is already becoming.","userName":"lilypad20304829374829","isEdited":false,"title":"Black Lives Matter.

I am truly disappointed in this app and the tragedy it has created in my phone. Ever since I downloaded this app my phone started to crash every single day. I went to the Apple store to see what was wrong with it. They said it was the app. I was deeply frustrated and crushed to the bones. Now, I am known to be a very honest person, so believe me when I tell you: This app is absolutely terrible. Bad quality, very disorganized, and kept logging me out of the app. Whenever I open the app my phone is instantly heated. Would most definitely not recommend the app if you CARE for your phone! I am truly devastated. Never thought I would see myself so Agitated.. ESPECIALLY since I’m a very optimistic person. I am disgusted.","userName":"cami_v","isEdited":false,"title":"Truly Disappointed"}},{"id":"6177622663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:46:03Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to support the one and only ✨Cheese Cheto✨ Zaddy Tronk but when I downloaded and opened the app it told me that it could sense my Mexican Taco fingers and started deleting all my apps and turned off the life support of my grandmother in the other room since I had my phone plugged into the charger and the nanobots went in through my electrical system. But after that it powered off my entire house and also said that if I even thought about using the bathroom that ICE would be deployed straight to my house and deport me and my Taco Bell chicken wrap family so I had to hold in my urine for a solid week until I ended up getting an infection. This app killed my grandma, worst app ever, do not download but if you do please be completely honest, it would be terrible if people lied in their reviews😔","userName":"Ceo of Taco Bell Crunch wrap","isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me a UTI"}},{"id":"6177525000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:15:02Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see what Donald Trump’s ideologies were like, since my parents are Trump supporters. Upon downloading the app and logging on, my phone immediately crashed. I was unable to swipe, use my home button, or even shut off my phone. I just had to wait until my phone could resolve itself. I then waited an extra 10 minutes to see if anything would change and upon opening up the app again, my phone completely glitches and shut itself off. This app is VIRUS!! I immediately deleted it and had no more problems of crashing. On the short time I was actually on the app, I further learned of Trump’s skewed ideas and even got a better feeling for exactly how much he doesn’t care about the people in this country. DO NOT GET THIS APP IT WILL MESS UP YOUR PHONE!!!","userName":"whomp bomp be domp","isEdited":false,"title":"BROKE MY PHONE"}},{"id":"6177519449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:17Z","rating":1,"review":"You are the blind person ever. All you do is say that we are doing fine and we are the best. We aren’t the best nor the greatest. You literally cut ties with the world wide medical group. Why would you do that in our time of need you cut of the one group that can help us. You remember those peaceful protests that were going on until you made the force push them back and pepper spray them. Oh that sat that you probably had someone else do it for you. Probably because you are the most brain dead human ever compared to a baby you look like an idiot. You are nothing but rich maybe not even that you are horrible at running this country. You are blind and ignorant and somehow managed to win election. On promises you haven’t even accomplished 1/4 of in your 4 year term.","userName":"middle middle man","isEdited":false,"title":"I hope you lose the election"}},{"id":"6177345677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:21:32Z","rating":1,"review":"My friends had recommended me this app after inviting me over to their KoolKidsKlub meeting, which I politely declined.👁👄👁 After I had told them no they kidnapped me and forced me to download this app and made me scroll through for hours as this orange plump man was lectured me on how he was going to force the minorities to build walls into twelve factions and we were going to fight to the death for our faction😳🦠😬I then went home scared for my life and immediately deleted the app in fear of my well being and mental stability.

When my phone hit the ground it broke into a million pieces and several shards of glass when into my eye. I believe that would be Donald trumps fault that I am now partially blind. Now my phone is broken and I don’t have the money to fix it because trump is giving all the money to the military and the rich. I also don’t have money to go to the hospital to get the glass out of my eye because we don’t have free health care so here we are with glass shards sticking out of my eye!
