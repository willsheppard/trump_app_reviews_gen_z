As soon as I opened the app it started asking me for personal information such as my social security number and address. The name of the app itself isn’t of my liking. “Trump” and “2020” don’t belong in the same sentence, and Trump won’t last as president beyond 2020.","userName":"✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏻✊🏿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:19:43Z","title":"🖕🏼🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179585192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Mis-ka, Mou-ska\nMickey Mouse!\nM-I-C-K-E-Y\nM-O-U-S-E (that's me!)\nM-I-C-K-E-Y\nM-O-U-S-E\nIt's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\nCome inside, it's fun inside\nIt's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (roll call!)\nDonald (present!)\nDaisy (here!)\nGoofy (hyuck, here!)\nPluto (woof! woof!)\nMinnie (hi, here!)\nMickey (right here!)\nIt's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\nCome inside, it's fun inside\nM-I-C-K-E-Y\nM-O-U-S-E\n✨😌😱🧚🏽💕😌✨😵😵💋💕🧚🏽✨🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏽","userName":"your karen mom","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:19:38Z","title":"Such a terrible app¡!,!,,,,, 👁👄👁😌😌😌✨✨✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179584883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After they ask to put your phone number in all these bots keep spamming you all day to vote for trump over and over all from different numbers.

He has done so much for our country. Like literally. Can you guys believe it? This man deserves a dog treat. I just want to warn some of you that this is a very dangerous app. It has caused me to throw up because of seeing a certain person. I legit had to go to the hospital and take a chill pill because my beautiful eyes were poisoned by the person’s ugliness. Wait. Actually, let me tell you a story of how this app almost killed my dog. I was walking my dog. His name is Max, by the way. We were at a park when suddenly my phone buzzed so loudly. I had so, so many notifications from this app. Like at most, 2000. But the strange thing was the numbers kept rising and rising. I couldn’t take the noisiness anymore so I turned my phone on do not disturb. What happened next almost blew my head off. Wait. Let me get a drink. I deserve some water right now. Actually, I’m tired. Goodnight.","userName":"princess tolly","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:19:30Z","title":"Technical difficultly.
