I’ve been a fan of Mr. Trump for years now — before his presidency, and Ive admired his extreme business skills. When I downloaded this app, I thought it would help me see clearer and understand his polices. Instead, it just brought me bad luck. I don’t think anyone should have the ability to download this app again. It’s dangerous and rather odd. I was sleeping with the app notifications on, and the splurge of notifications went off multiple times in the night! I’m old, and I need my sleep! I had my granddaughter turn off my notifications, and it STILL buzzed at night. Something fishy is going on. Also, I tried buying Maga mercy earlier and filled my car full of merch costing $4200, but it glitched and now my items are stuck in the cart forever. Oh well, I suppose. I also tried t reserve some tickets for his NH rally, but unfortunately, the app didn’t work either, or so I though. Turns out 4 tickets were reserved for me and my family. I couldn’t go because of the app! The app is not helpful at all, and perceived Trump as an amazing president and candidate for next year. It doesn’t mention his history or policies he as a president will ensure. I didn’t learn anything, and if any thing is fake news it’s this! I can’t believe Trump accepted this app and put his name to it! How foolish. He’s said so himself, the polls are rigged! I believe they rig them though. I am no longer a fan of Trump and will be voting blue because of this app. Karma’s a b**** 🧚\u200D♀️ but you’re the real one ✨\n\n-Grandma Karen","date":"2020-07-09T23:42:35Z"}},{"id":"6178577181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"SO REGRET DOWNLOADING!!!!","userName":"a~d~i~n~a","isEdited":false,"review":"⚠️WARNING ⚠️\nDo yourselves a favor and don’t download this app!!!
