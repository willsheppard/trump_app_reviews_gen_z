When I opened it, A big,  orange, ugly dump truck popped up on my screen. It gives you a jump scare and you will have nightmares the rest of your life. As went in deeper into the app, it asked for my phone number, address, city, state, and zip code. Of course I typed all of my information in (including my full name) because I would do ANYTHING to support someone who’s racist and fake. The next day, the FBI arrived at my house and tear gassed me. Then they set off a bomb in my house and I was lucky to get out of there alive. After everyone was safe, the FBI kidnapped my dog and sent her to the president. The president announced to me that he had taken my dog to turn into a statue once she was killed because it would “look nice”. Anyways do not get this horrid app by our orange dump truck president. Your life will be ruined. Stay safe, Donald Dump wants to kill us all.\n\n(And for everyone saying that Trump is the best and is making America “great” why don’t you open your eyes and see how racist he is and how much he has spread the virus. And being fake and lying? Holding up a bible that he has never read and standing out side of the church he never went to? Threatening to take away martial law because he’s racist and against people for their skin? I don’t know about you, but that’s not the president I want. )"}},{"id":"6167227881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#1 Jack and Jack fan","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"The large orange","date":"2020-07-07T07:54:47Z","review":"Personally, I’m not really sure why the App Store is allowing an app that promotes racism, sexism, pedophilia, misogyny, and overall idiocy to stay here.
