I didn’t understand the issue about that because regardless of people’s color of skin, we should all be treated the same because just like an 🥚 we are the same inside, some people might have asthma and others might have a kidney missing but we are all part of the same RACE 🏁: the human race🏃🏽\u200D♀️. This app didn’t pass the vibe check ✅ I am honestly so disappointed in our so called leader, if he packin down there sis, that might be an exception but he ain’t got that BBC and he look like a Cheeto puff :/ I personally hate Cheetos. And cheese, I’m sort of lack toast and toddler ant. Therefore, this app needs to be deleted Immediately!!!! 100% wouldn’t recommend as it does not satisfy my needs.","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app😔😕","date":"2020-07-09T03:08:26Z","userName":"pc_77","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174803541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible.....Absolutely horrible I Freakin Saw A B.I.G.
