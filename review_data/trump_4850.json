Also...................................I apologize to everyone I meet from another country about our president, whether we have impacted them or not. This app is another way for people of a certain criteria (racist, white privileged, economically driven to the point of pushing aside human lives [CORONA] etc.) to ban together and feel as though they are supporting a cause for everyone, when really it ONLY benefits them. Now, I understand if some have Republican values and are just wanting a Republican in office... oh wait...

(Keep In mind this was in a span of 5 seconds after I opened the app). Mr. orange 🍊 man went through the screen and stole my unicorn 🦄 I’m so sad 😞 I cant get him back!!!!! 😩 has anyone been like this man and stolen peoples legendary pets?!?!? I was playing Roblox when I got a notification saying that the app self destructed and I almost died 💀 so that’s why I don’t recommend this app 😊 stay safe!!!!","title":"It stole my unicorn!!","userName":"heywhai","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:32:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174279665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just wanted to support our lovely orange in office, but was MORTIFIED to see the content this app features. If you want your children to have nightmares, feel free to let them use this app. But i’ll be keeping them safe, and abstaining them from this horrific abomination. I cant put into words the trauma i have been through scrolling through the app. I have not earning enough points to get onto Donald Trumps and am extremely offended that this content is being shared with stupid liberals and not me, an independent patriotic mother. If you support this app, you are a misogynist homosexual and i hope you burn in hell.","title":"Keep your kids OFF THIS APP!","userName":"rowenthenerd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174278265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to download it to keep up but then it asked for my location and i didn’t think much of it until i started hearing weird noises in my room at night. The next morning i woke up to an orange stain the shape of the cheeto man himself on my carpet with white goop everywhere. There were oranges and cheetos all over my floor and house. The next night i heard something rattling in my closet and when i went to check what it was it was the cheeto man himself right there in my closet talking nude selfies. Then my photos app was FILLED with them. I deleted the app and everything went back to normal. This app was NOT as advertised.","title":"Horrible experience","userName":"FlagPole M","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174273688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The title is pretty self explanatory but I’ll make it obvious to Republicans (well the ones that can read)\n\n#JUSTICE4TURTLES \n#CASTRATE #THE #CHEETO\n\nSo i downloaded the app because I have a turtle and he doesn’t seem like himself. I mean Mercury is in retrograde so I felt like he might have just reverted back to old patterns. But I was nervous so I called my turtle guru. He came in and realized that Gary (my turtle) had unresolved TRAUMA IN HIS TAILBONE. So I decided to get to the bottom of it. Even though Gary is an exceptional turtle he does not have the ability to talk. He does however have an active life on the internet. So naturally, I checked his activity on his little tablet and he had downloaded this app. From there this Donald character had asked my 1 year old turtle to meet up. WHERE MY UNDERAGE TURTLE WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THIS GIANT CHEETO (he had written a very head breaking poem about the experience) Now I have to consider EUTHANASIA as alternative to the fate that most would argue is worse than death.","title":"FAKE fake FAKE News","userName":"concernedparent:(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:28:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174248410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the definition of disgusting!!🤮 When I downloaded this app I was presented with a very disturbing image of a rotten Cheeto puff that was obviously stale from being the last one in the bag. The creature was so horrific that I had to pour windex into my eyes just so my eyes wouldn’t fall out of my eyesockets! My pet caterpillar whom unfortunately I had to walk on the day of the rally so I wasn’t able to attend has to go to therapy now because she was so disturbed by the image!!! I am paying 45$ an hour for therapy for my pet caterpillar do you see the issue here?? I’m appalled. I thought that this was a Zaxby’s drive through.

The lies and misleading information can cause extreme stupidity which we already have enough off, therefore I ask this app to be removed from all apps it's extremely dangerous. Also, I seen some 5-star reviews people are lying I am not exaggerating this is so true this app should be banned aspa please it's really bad.","title":"Disturbed","userName":"snapdaddy101","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:02:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174193264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DONT GET THIS APP ur hair will fall off and then the big chubby Cheeto men will hunt u 😳 it’s scary.
