More cases of malware in the US than any part of the world. This app explicitly says they’re not even going to run an antivirus app on it because it would make the “bad numbers” go up.

Do not install.","review":"I really tried to like this app and then it got so glitchy. Really feels like hate and racism rolled into human rights infringements and it’s making my phone so glitchy.
