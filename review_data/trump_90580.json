We drove for hours ⏰ and hours nonstop 🚘 there was no escape! It wasn’t until 5️⃣hours later did I feel the truck slow to a gradual stop. Worried for my parents sanity 🌝I didn’t question when they opened the coffin threw me in the woods 🌲 and picked up some shovels. The ritualists helped them as they started to dig tunnels into the ground, they dug with such speed ⚡️ it was incredible. The cow 🐮 stood over me to make sure I didn’t run away. I thought they were gonna bury me in a tomb but instead they dug tunnels that led for 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣’s of miles! It only took them an hour they must be superheroes🦸🏻\u200D♀️. They led me through the tunnel until we reached the end, then they proceeded to dig stairs upwards ⬆️ until they hit concrete 🧱 confused I guessed there was a building above us. My dad picked up a pickaxe and hammered through that b*tch. 🥰 Then they threw me through the hole and climbed through after me. We were in the WHITEHOUSE! 🏡 I saw a cage in the corner of the room where a crusty orange 🍊 was visible inside. My mom looked at the nasty peach 🍑 and lit a match, she chucked 18 lit matches at the nasty orange and then proceeded to tell me this is where I belonged and to “stay and burn” then my father and mother went to rescue Melania and Barron and run away with them! Luckily I survived and was able to escape! I found my way home and confronted my parents! They told me why they did it and suddenly it made so much MORE sense!!! It was because they had accidentally opened my phone a few days ago and saw THIS APP. 🖕🏼"}},{"id":"6158087829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely not✨","userName":"chunkiewunkie","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-04T23:14:45Z","review":"what world we live in🌍"}}]}
