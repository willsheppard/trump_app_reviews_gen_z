EVER.🤢🤮🤕","userName":"🧚🏽Snowflake🧚🏽","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:06:52Z","review":"First off, it took 3 and a half weeks to download. No joke. And when it did download, I opened it and it gave me a warning that if I didn’t vote TRUMP 2020 my information would be leaked. Then it wiped all my data from my phone! And then when my phone turned on again I opened up Duolingo for my Spanish lesson and I got a notification saying “You aren’t for TRUMP 2020? You know what happens now!” And then an intruder alert from my backdoor"}},{"id":"6176626448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"ReyTheWarriorCatsFan","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:06:06Z","review":"It took me 4 months to download this and once I did, it immediately hacked my phone and made my wallpaper and lock screen a photo of Donald Trump. I also got a death threat in the mail saying I had to vote for him this year or else he’d send me to a conversion camp because I’m Bisexual. And whenever I try to play pandora music on my phone, it just plays a bunch of country music on loop and won’t let me listen to anything else. DO NOT GET IT"}},{"id":"6176611890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible my house is now on fire 3 are dead because of this app","userName":"samanthaxyz","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:02:09Z","review":"This app not only took away my rights as a human being but also took my body I am now a giant toaster though I would probably find a way to cope with it if I was a good toaster every price of bread I toast gets burnt don’t use this app if I had know what I was getting into I would have made toast in a bath tub while taking a bath please don’t get this app if you know what’s gods for you \nLONG ELMO 2020"}},{"id":"6176550150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE!!!","userName":"Trump's ass kisser","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:45:21Z","review":"The app took weeks to download and when you open it, Shrek taking a dump appears on the screen🍆!This is quite scary and I was only trying to support my lovely, wonderful, non-racist, and non-transphobic president🍆.

It took AGES to download at least 6 hours. When it finally downloaded I expected to be able to easily get tickets to rallies and be caught up on the things he says on social media. What else would it be for right? WRONG. I’m 68 years old and this app is too difficult for me to use and has no useful information on it. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR STORAGE."}},{"id":"6176290854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrific","userName":"not for the pervert","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:33:02Z","review":"This app is terrible and I never want anything to do with it. This is for a TikTok. But also it’s because this app is actually legit bad like it’s really hard to function and it has content that’s not good for all ages and of course it’s not good for all ages because like politics are not good for all ages I guess. But if you had your phone out and your child got to it and got on this app I would not say it was 100% safe for them."}},{"id":"6176166117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!!!!","userName":"theRÄT","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:55:05Z","review":"This was a horrible app I honestly wish I could give it 0 stars because this app deserves it. The second I opened the app my car died🤦🏽\u200D♀️😞 then my phone proceeded to glitch making it impossible to  do anything on the phone besides shut off and turn back on. And to download this app it took about 5 hours taking up a large amount of GB. My phone ended up breaking and u had to get a new one 😐"}}]}
