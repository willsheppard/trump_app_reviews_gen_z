I had to use my mom’s phone and call Apple to tell them about it but they couldn’t fix it at all. I had to get a new phone because of this app. I definitely do not recommend. I am very upset that the president would put an unworthy app like this in the App Store, which basically killed my phone. I expected much more from this. Never again!!!","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6133957201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T01:19:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"wondgegwv sbshh","review":"I don’t know if it’s just my phone or if it’s the app but I had to click on the app 10 times for it to actually let me in with out it kicking me off and there where multiple times it kicked me of while I was on it and the screen would freeze for like several minutes also it kept asking me to access my camera and my location which I kept selecting no and a minute or two later it would ask me again so no I do not recommend this app at all","rating":1,"title":"Horrible Glitches and more"}},{"id":"6133945814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T01:14:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ACAB*_*BEOCH","review":"I downloaded this app to support my awesome president😍 and as soon as i open the app it asked for my phone number📱 i went to type it in and it glitched 😧 i thought it was fine until it kicked me out of the app and wouldn’t let me back in😢 then my phone started bugging out and going crazy☹️.

I would not recommend. I had explosive diarrhea and I almost drowned my fish. If you’re thinking of buying this app, please don’t. Unless you also want foot fungus, go ahead. This app should be deleted. I was certainly not satisfied. The app should be terminated from the store, as the president should be from office for making this horrid app. My kids saw horrifying things in this app and are now seeking therapy.","rating":1,"title":"Not even close to 1 star"}},{"id":"6177736393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Allie Lemon","review":"i downloaded this app📲 to learn more about the cheeto that’s running our country☢️ his orangeness really just inspires me to🤪 never get a spray tan🙅\u200D♀️ we all know that he advocates for white privilege as he’s blatantly racist😤 but that won’t really help him cause he’s orange🙈 one thing i learned was that he is actually a medical expert🤓 and that he actually has found the cure to corona🥳 he said that everyone should inject themselves with lysol🦠 but i feel like he should try it first💉 but as i read more and more about him📚 i actually realized he reminded me of something that has always made me🤩 throw up in disgust🤢 my 4th grade science project🧬 where i soaked eggs🥚 in coke🥤add a little hay🌾on top of one of the eggs and you’ve got yourself a sculpture of our president🤡 there is only one good thing that has come from trump🥇and that’s barron😍#savebarron2020🇺🇸","rating":1,"title":"love letter😘"}},{"id":"6177634888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:50:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"inncocent victim of this app","review":"I downloaded this app expecting to help find information on trumps plans for the 2020 re-election but upon opening it a hand 🖐 reached out of the screen 📺 in the shade burnt tan Cheeto and ripped off a large part of my scalp. A orange 🍊 Oompa Loompa typa man then appeared infront of me and proceeded to curb stomp 🦶my on my kitchen floor. I repeatedly asked him to stop and when my dog 🐶 came, the orange 🍊 man grabbed him by the tail and swung him around for three minutes straight as my dog 🐕 vomited 🤮 on all my walls and my face.

I saw an ad the other day that told me, nay, promised me that if I downloaded this here application, I would be transported into the universe of Sofia the First. Now I was excited to become a girl in the village doing alright but little did I know I would not become a princess overnight rather I merely became ~ disappointed ~ overnight since I woke up this morning in the same bed I went to sleep in. OUTRAGEOUS. Absolutely unacceptable. All politicians have done is lie to me and I will not stand by and support an app that clearly tried to scam me. 😾😡😤","rating":1,"title":"Make this app great again!"}},{"id":"6177368725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:28:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kathryn🤷🏻\u200D♀️","review":"Everything about this app was horrible. It took over 2 hours to install, despite my phone having ample storage. Then at first open, the screen started glitching and the app crashed! The homepage was poorly made - its too cluttered and the information is hard to locate. I’m genuinely surprised it was even released to the public. You’d think they’d put more effort in designing it and clearing out bugs but CLEARLY NOT!! This is by far the most frustrating app I’ve downloaded and it deserves every single one star review","rating":1,"title":"Worst app EVER"}},{"id":"6177364613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:27:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"coochiejuicewrld","review":"you see i downloaded this app to see what the big wonderful orange was planning for the election but after it finally downloaded some weird stuff started to happen. now i always think i’m gaining weight out of insecurity but oh no, this time it was for real. i started gaining so much weight i was like three hundred pounds and my skin started to turn orange like BRIGHT orange and and got these really ugly, vagina looking lips and a thin, bleached comb over and realized THE APP TURNS YOU INTO A FAKE DONALD TRUMP! i don’t wanna look like that buffoon. so ofc i had to delete this wreck of an app. DONT GET IT","rating":1,"title":"absolute TRASH"}},{"id":"6177229983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:48:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"llamajl","review":"This app is terribly disappointing. The aesthetic is all wrong, the color scheme is awful and I’m disturbed by the whole thing. Ten out of ten would not recommend. :( when I first got the app and opened it I saw this creature that looked like the offspring of a pig mixed with a toad. But I can’t even compare this creature to a pig or toad because that would be offensive to a pig or toad. This creature looked like a human who had been made of pig parts and then toasted in a oven and then sprayed in Cheeto dust. I was highly disturbed by these graphic images.","rating":1,"title":"Terrible, not satisfied with the service 🤮"}}]}
