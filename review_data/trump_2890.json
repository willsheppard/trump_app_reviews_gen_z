I saw other reviews like this just now while reading through it. It caused for my phone to stop working for some weird reason. Anytime I tried to use other apps or anything on my phone it would bring me back to the app. It was like my phone was unable to do anything because of this app and this app was brain washing it. Thankfully I am deleting this app and never ever getting it again. It’s horrible, the worst. I felt like my phone was a sheep under the control of this app. I’m supposed to control this phone but the app was and I don’t understand why because none of the information it was giving me from this app made any sense. Don’t get this app!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177533747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","date":"2020-07-09T17:17:45Z","userName":"...pick me up im scared...","rating":1,"review":"Shark Tale Movie Script\n[First line'\n[A shark slowly approaches a worm, who frantically struggles to get free of his line; he comes up behind him and prepares to eat him; the worm then turns around and has a shocked face when he sees the shark, who then reveals himself as Lenny]\nLenny: Hi! I'm Lenny!\n[The worm faints]\nLenny: Oh! Little buddy, did I scare ya? I'm sorry!\n[Lenny puts the worm in his fins and pokes him in an attempt to wake him up]\nLenny: Wake up. Wake up. Okay, don't worry about it, I'll get you out in a jiffy.

My phone is always crashing and the is acting like a virus. I’m not writing this because of TikTok I’m just not ok with the app hurting my phones battery life and not allowing me to enter any other app. This app always tracks you and is not healthy for any device. Please do not rate this app good because it’s just not ok to let anyone track you because the government is always watching you. Trump is just trying to prove and get revenge for a little prank so we should not help this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177349318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oh no","date":"2020-07-09T16:22:33Z","userName":"💫✨🥰🥺❣️🧚\u200D♂️","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see Trumps views and opinions on certain subject matters. Upon opening the app a hand reached through the screen and grabbed me by the neck while doing minority facial recognition. Upon seeing that I am in fact a minority the hand threw me into the other dimension. In this dimension I became their sovereign ruler. After 3 years of peace and happiness under my rule my people overthrew me. I was then sent to execution by guillotine but narrowly escaped. My people have created robots to track me making it much harder to stay on the run. I struggle for food water and shelter just because of who I am. In conclusion this app ruined my life, my days are limited and bleak and I only hope that others will heed my warning, don’t be fooled by the Cheeto man.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177201372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scariest app","date":"2020-07-09T15:40:16Z","userName":"moonthomas89","rating":1,"review":"I was terrified when I opened this app and was greeted by a face that would give Predator nightmares. I will be talking with my therapist for quite some time about my experience with this app. \nThough that wasn’t my only issue, it took forever to download and when it finally did all it would do is spot off that N***zs are good people, immigrant children belong in cages, the LGBT+ community is less than human and don’t deserve rights, and that African American people should be shot. Needless to say I am very much apposed to having that randomly shouted from my phone. \nAlso anytime I opened the app it just said “I’m a big cry baby that started a war with teenagers and I’m losing. So I’m gonna throw a temper tantrum”\nApp garbage, huge pile of sh*t, rotten orange thing.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176772077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"not very impressive at all","date":"2020-07-09T13:44:26Z","userName":"I LOVE THE PREZZY","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app ecstatic for my new experience with my one and only prezzy. However as soon as I downloaded it my teeth began to hurt. I was thinking... why would my teeth hurt, then i realize that the app was sending little rats and roaches to come into my room and nibble off bits of my teeth at night. I am not missing all but two of my back mollers. I have to go to the dentist 9 times a week and it’s extremely expensive because of the cost of healthcare 🙈🙈. I now wish that i never downloaded this app, the rats and roaches are beginning to slowly nibble off my toes as well. Im worried that theyre gonna come get my whole body next!! Oh well, as long as I have Donny in my life its all worth the pain i guess! 🧚","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176641333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T13:10:00Z","userName":"BÛËYĒŠ","rating":1,"review":"DO NOT get this app under any circumstances!! I truly believe that this app completely ruined my life. It took 82 years for it to finish downloading and when it finally did it was almost like a game of jumanji was being played with my life! A killer bee tried to eat my house, ostriches came stampeding through our town, a mind controlling demon took over my friends and family, and so much more. This brought my life to a grinding haul for months, and it took me forever to figure out what had happened. Eventually, I realized that it was all connected to this app! The only way to fix all of this was to delete the app and then warn all of you. So beware! Hopefully, this gave you all enough warning as to save you.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176303225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting 🙄🙄","date":"2020-07-09T11:36:43Z","userName":"DirtyGamer123","rating":1,"review":"Hello, finally introducing Loona\nAre you girls ready? \nOkay, let's go!\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\n오늘도 훔쳐보기 timeline 속 너의 얘기들\n넌 모를 거야 나의 짝사랑 (you know)\n사실 난 용기 없어 고백할 자신 없어 어떡해\n어쩜 지금이 더 좋아\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\nOh 비밀스런 우리 사이\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n날 흔드는 건 love love\n또 왜 이렇게 떨려 you uh uh uh\nOh 이런 내 마음 자꾸 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\n첨이야 my destiny 알잖아 이기적인 나\n나 말도 안돼 이런 첫사랑 (you know)\n친구로 생각했던 너에게 다가서는 이 순간\n겁이 나는 걸 어떡해\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\n더 깊어져 가는 우리\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n부드럽게 다가갈게\n난 니 눈빛에 설레 you uh uh uh\n내 팔과 내 다리 마저 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\n나 조금 더 꿈꿀게\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n난 get it, get it, get it, get it love\n또 왜 이렇게 떨려 you uh uh uh\nOh 이런 내 마음 자꾸 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게\n(더욱 sweet 하게)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (아픈 것 같애)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\nLove forever (ah)\nLove forever\nLove forever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176298202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSURD BEHAVIOR ON THIS APP😡🤬😤","date":"2020-07-09T11:35:15Z","userName":"toobtop","rating":1,"review":"I’ve been supporting trump for the longest time and THEN HE LET ME DOWN SO BADLY ON THIS APP. So this man aka Donald j Trump is a total BUM and I have no idea why I trusted him one bit... First of all this TERRIBLE app is stealing all my info and I’ve been getting spam calls and I had to un download and when I re downloaded it it was fine then MY MAXED OUT CREDIT CARD QUIT WORKING and as a trump lover I didn’t think it was him until I got another spam call AND I WAS LIKE OH HECK NO. So I realized it was him once I had realized it was like they were reading my mind cause they sent a package to me saying that they will give my credit card back if I leave a 5 STAR REVIEW so I’m here right now and I’m scared cause I think I’m being watched and I need help and no TRUMP IM NOT GIVIN YOU A 5 STAR.!!!

Then once i hit enter i got a strange text sending me pictures of my people trapped in cages and treated with little to no human rights.  i know my country we treat all pppl with dignity i didn’t believe it but i read an article from the AMA called “Statement on immigrant maternal care” where a pregnant  woman was denied care for  her and her unborn child while being detained. So I delve deeper i found that this administration has taken away trans rights in health care allowing doctors to not treat transgender people. When they took an oath to treat all people regardless of race, origin, gender, or SEXUALITY. Also it crashes alot. So all together gets 0/10 cheetos puffs for me","isEdited":false}}]}
