First off, i downloaded this thinking it would provide useful information. Boy was I wrong. The instant I downloaded it it glitched my phone and completely broke it. My refrigerator started singing despacito and I could not get it to shut up. Furthermore, it sent out a strange signal and a Jumanji board materialized in front of me. I deleted the app and everything went away.Don’t recommend unless you want to play Jumanji, but it seems we’re already in it...","userName":"- daisy","title":"this is just NOT it","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:25:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178914796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Took 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 to download","userName":"spoon and spoon","title":"As","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:24:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178911674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Oh my God!

As a pro build the wall, pro life, anti facts, sexist, racist, homophobic, conservative republican, I downloaded this app to support my lovely cheeto president. Not at all what I expected! First of all, this app stole all of my iTunes money! It also took up all of my storage and made me delete Twitter! Now where will I annoy people by spamming Trump 2020? 😭😭😭 When I opened the app it looked ok at first. But then it threatened to send monkeys to yeet their poop at my window if I didn’t get a ticket to the coronavirus trump rally! I scrolled through the app for a little longer but then trump came to my house and infected me with coronavirus! Then I tried to exit the app but it wouldn’t let me! After a couple more seconds of looking at the app I was so disgusted I started violently vomiting. After about 10 hours I started to feel a little better, but then the coronavirus symptoms started kicking in and I felt awful! Then I turned my phone off and the app started spamming me with fairy comments! Then about an hour later I got a notification from Apple saying that my phone was infected with 537 viruses! I finally yeeted my phone off a cliff but then I still had coronavirus! I tried to buy a new phone but then I found out I couldn’t because the app stole all of my real money too! And that is why I am typing this on my neighbor’s phone. THIS IS JUST A JOKE NOTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS TRUE. SAVE TIKTOK!!!!!!!!","userName":"icecreamemsers","title":"VERY DANGEROUS 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:22:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178910751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is very stinkyyy.

I HATE BIDEN EWWW 🥴🥴🤒🤒🤒🤒🤒 so why did this app tell me to vote for him? it also told me trump is a rapist and a racist and #freebarron. i don’t understand, i thought this app was going to help me learn more about my favorite person on the planet, trumpet, and connect me with other trumpets, but i was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Absolutely WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. 😑😑 deserves to be removed from the app store so no one else has to go through the same trauma i did.","userName":"TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","title":"DISGUSTING 😔😔","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:22:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178909387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Sometimes you gotta just bully the president.
