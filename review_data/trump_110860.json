In France, the Communists ally with the Social-Democrats(1) against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.\nIn Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.\nIn Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846.\nIn Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin.\nThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.\nIn short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.\nIn all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.\nFinally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.\nThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.","title":"communism"}},{"id":"6172547514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:49:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"no to trump","review":"Absolutely disgusting","title":"Yuck"}},{"id":"6172439771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:19:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Harmony M.","review":"i hate it.","title":"i hate it."}},{"id":"6172138265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:56:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ehahd","review":"???","title":"Where’s Donald Duck?"}},{"id":"6172001637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:17:18Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈","review":"just admit that you are\n- racist \n- homophobic\n- sexist\n- misogynistic \n- transphobic\nthis app is horrible bunker boy get your coders and make them update it","title":"trump 2020 on a ✨ g r a v e s t o n e ✨"}},{"id":"6171982376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:11:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"peedog teehee 10000","review":"No he is bad","title":"No"}},{"id":"6171950664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:02:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"aesthetic.rxses","review":"he has no lips!! how will he get a kiss kiss. very ugly, no kiss for him !!","title":"no ❤️"}},{"id":"6171949953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:02:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"7:73)(/)/)2$/88:!:!.):6/6","review":"I hated this app","title":"Not a good app"}},{"id":"6171877867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:39:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jfifhdjid","review":"the sketchers weren’t light up😔","title":"sketchers"}},{"id":"6171846577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:29:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"rate1/10","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, I WAS NEARLY KIDNAPPED FROM A PERSON THAT CALLED MY PHONE AND SAID THEY WERE STALKING ME BECAUSE I HAD THIS APP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, DO NOT DOWNLOAD ❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️","title":"⚠️WARNING⚠️"}}]}
