However, when I opened the app i was greeted with a giant Cheeto in a suit that appeared to have a wig on it (an extremely ugly one at that). The sight before me was extremely horrifying and my cousin came around me and happened to glance at my phone. This is where the horrific event began. She happened to see the grotesque sight upon my cell phone and passed out. Immediately she was rushed to the hospital and remained unconscious there for about 3 days. When my cousin finally came around, the doctors offered her a snack to accelerate her recovery.  She accepted and the doctor set off to give her some  treats. He returned to her with a bag of Cheetos and as he was about to hand them over, my cousin threw a fit, she began to cry and roll around the floor screaming, “GET IT AWAY FROM ME... PLEASE!!”  This behavior was extremely out of the blue... and my cousin was kept in the hospital for  about another week. Unable to discover the root cause for my Cousin’s fear of Cheetos, the doctor turned to my family to ask some questions. I then explained that my cousin saw an extremely grotesque Cheeto from this app, and that was the reason we were there in the first place.  With this newfound information, my cousin eventually recovered and was sent home. However, now she can’t even stand the sight of a Cheeto without going into a fit and being overcome by fear. \n\nIn short: this app is crap","isEdited":false,"title":"Caused permanent trauma","date":"2020-07-08T13:42:12Z","rating":1,"userName":"Robin_DaBank21"}},{"id":"6172280396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t download this app it just spreads hatefulness and lies about minorities.
