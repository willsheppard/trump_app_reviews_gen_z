Weird, huh? So yeah, it all started with just the app crashing and kicking me out, but soon my entire phone started to crash. At first I thought that it was just a coincidence because my phone is old, a 6s, but this continued happening for about a week to the point where I couldn’t even open any app on my phone. Luckily this was around the time that I bought a new phone and transferred all the old apps, contacts, etc from my old phone to my new phone. I didn’t realize this would also transfer the glitches this app has been causing to my new phone. I can only turn the phone on for 5 minute intervals at this point, and the other day when I was in my camera, my face glitched out and instead I was looking into the eyes of what appeared to be an old Russian man wearing a MAGA hat, who was reacting in real time. He screamed something in Russian at me and my phone immediately turned off. Now all of my notifications from this app are death threats from the Russian government and I am scared for my life. I am also scared that this app allowed a Russian agent to watch my every move and gave away ALL my information to the Russian government, most likely to hack into this year’s election again. Which is really odd considering trump is trying to delete TikTok because it allegedly sells info in another foreign country, when really his own app is doing the same with my private information!! I think what upsets me most about this disrespect to my privacy is that I lost my old FBI agent :( I was really getting used to looking at my phone camera and giving him a lil wave or smile but now he’s gone 🥺 and things were going so great with me and him. I hate this app it ruined my life and now I cant sleep because I keep hearing angry Russian screams at night. Don’t download it.","title":"Crashed my phone"}},{"id":"6177596731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:37:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"👀🐽👀","review":"When I got this app I saw the Cheeto man pretending to be the president not funny didn’t laugh this app is a joke","title":"Gross 🤢"}},{"id":"6177562221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:26:40Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"a nickname less then 30","review":"Absolutely a horrible app. It’s confusing and a scam.","title":"Don’t download"}},{"id":"6177542602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"m në","review":"I thought this would give me a view of the world but it’s trash :/","title":"Wuts"}},{"id":"6177541148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:03Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kindchicken","review":"This is so dumb it keeps crashing","title":"Stupid"}},{"id":"6177523454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:14:32Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"the 1# pp sucka","review":"so i downloaded the app and like this orange man popped up on my screen i was so scared. and i checked his vibe right and it said🤭...
