As soon as I opened the app , medical services called me and told me that I had the symptoms of COVID-19. They said if I don’t get it checked out that they would send the US Army troops to come and raid my house from an official Donald Trump order. I felt my life being threatened and at risk. I didn’t get checked out and 1 week later, SWAT came to my house and shot my window 😔the bullet struck my cats back and left it paralyzed 🤧 I don’t recommend you to get this app, IT PUTS YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE !","title":"I got the coronavirus from this app 😪","userName":"kapper kid","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173376672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just wanted to support my orange 🍊 president by downloading this app but it took way to long to actually download and when I finally got it installed it kicked me out 😠 like huh?

America shouldn’t be that way, we need people to come together. He should be thinking of the lives he as tortured. This is disgusting and you guys should have never voted for trump, all of the trump supporters are blind! All they see are the “good” things he has done (there is no good things) but in reality he is a pain in the back. We do not need him on this platform when we have to see him on the news Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and we had to see him on Snapchat! But thank goodness they blocked him on there.","title":"He will never bring justice, this is trash.","userName":"take trump down","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:35:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172853021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to help my black family finally understand why the orange god🍊 is so amazing but I WAS WRONG.
