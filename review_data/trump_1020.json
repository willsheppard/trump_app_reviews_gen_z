It was a terrifying experience. They forced me to sit in a large room filled with pictures of Donald Trump..my eyes were burning and I was scared for my safety. Barron Trump knocked on the only window in the room from the outside asking if I was ok and I said no and I almost asked if he could get me water but I hesitated because I didn’t want to be roofied. Two seconds later Mike Pence walks in with glowing white hair and holds a gun to head telling me to take out my phone and download this app. So I did because I did not want to die. The first thing I noticed was how ugly the app was and I didn’t even want to open it but lucky Mike left in a hurry because he had to meet with some guy from grinder. When he left the room I immediately deleted the app and began to write this review so the world can know my story. Anyways this app is trash don’t get it and don’t vote from the big orange fat man❤️","userName":"melania🌝🙀","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:53Z","isEdited":false,"title":"scary"}},{"id":"6175800757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"got this app in order to support democracy and engage in society. as soon as i opened it, it asked if i was a feminist and after an hour of scrolling through different variations of “no” i finally found a yes option. when i clicked on it it locked me out of the app and then shut down my phone completely. it took two weeks to get my phone back on, and when i did i found all of my data had been deleted and my lock screen had been changed to a picture of trump flipping off my vag*na 😫 now i can only receive texts and calls from the one contact that i still have called “congress” and they text me every day saying that i don’t deserve rights and i’ll be forced to live out the plot of the Handmaid’s Tale once Donald Trump gets elected for a second term. they’re gonna rip out my IUD and if i don’t give birth to a new child EVERY DAY they’re going to force me to participate in a l*esbian o*gy until i D*E!!!!

It had horrible content, it’s glitchy, and this trump guy that it seems to be centered around is just a total human garbage can. I would give it zero stars if I could. I’m in my underground catholic bunker right now because of the pandemic, and today while I was playing one of my sixty nine pipe organs I decided to write this review because, as I mentioned before, this app is an abomination. Words cannot begin to describe how much of a moldy empanada this app is. Never, in my four hundred and twenty years of living, have a encountered an empanada as moldy as this. This mold is the stuff of legends, the biblical mold that you read about in ancient texts. This mold has the potential to topple armies out of sheer disgust. This mold makes onions cry. This app is, without question, the most foul, revolting, deplorable, rotten, vomit-inducing, milk-curdling, rabbit killing metaphorical mold ever created by any person or entity in the history of persons and entities.","userName":"Nebraskian07","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:52:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible, moldy App"}},{"id":"6174693583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened this app my dog started humping  my leg right away. My dog then told me he needed to pick some stuff up from the mall so he drove me there and on the way I decided to open the app again to support my favorite orange monster. When I opened the app this time my phone started electrocuting me and hot Cheetos came flying out the of the charging hole. Once we got to the mall I saw my brothers girlfriend who just happened to be my mom and I told her that my eye has been twitching for 3 weeks so I needed her to take me to the emergency room! So my dog picked up his things including a sparkly new dress and then my brother and my mom drove us to the emergency room. On the way there I tried deleting the app because it was causing so much destruction but when I tried it started screaming at me in a British accent and started singing the song by grace vanderwall called “I don’t know my name” I then panicked and threw my phone out the window. The end.","userName":"mrs cheeto puff","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:35:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Destructive to life itself"}},{"id":"6174597922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"1st off the app took FOREVER to download so I decided to take a shower while I was waiting, when I was in the shower the hot water ran out so that got me in a bad mood. Once I got out of the shower I realized my hair was SUPER greasy and when I went to get my leave in shampoo I realized I was out. I went to the hair salon to buy more but they said that they ran out and the next shipment wouldn’t be in until next week. I actually forgot about the app until later that day because its pretty basic and boring. When I first logged in it was super laggy and dull, I actually got distracted watching Jumanji Next Level (great movie btw). And as soon as I logged in the app was just so glitchy and laggy and annoying, It doesn’t even show the weather! I then realized it was a trump 2020 app, it was just so boring looking that I thought it was a weather app. In the end -1/10 would not recommend. I think I want to go buy some chicken nuggets because im hungry.","userName":"Cafe vanilla latte","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:07:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6174210223","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and ya know it is a good app but I don’t know how to delete it and ya I don’t know what if I wanna it was just a little bit of a surprise but I wanna was the first day of school I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good day I hope I can come back to the house tomorrow and I see ya next time I’m going back home I’ll do it when y’all come home I wanna is a way I can get my dad and I wanna is the night you guys are coming back with us I don’t want you guys like that I wanna is a day like a good job and I wanna is the way you are going out to the house I wanna was a good day I wanna was a good night love y’all so sorry about you leaving for the day and you guys have to be done bye I don’t have any more time I’m gonna was your night with your friends house I just wanted you you want you me I know that I’m gonna you have no ❤️","userName":"ur daddy🥵🥵","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:06:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Never downloading again"}},{"id":"6173651916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the fact that this app is still floating around on the app store, embarrasses me as a person who loves the app store, and i mean LOVE. i come on here daily just to see what new apps are being added every second and i love to see which apps are pending. PLLEAAASEE delete this app. it’s messing up the whole vibe i have going on here, plus the name “trump” makes my blOOOOD BOIL. i hate it here now because of this app. I used to be able to come onto the app store, and have happy vibes ( i collected over 167 hours on the app store in a week..and there is 168 hours in a day...that should show you how much i love the app store). Anyway, now i only have 1 hour collected on my settings under appstore... i’m so disappointed that apple let this happen. let such an ignorant organization with such a hateful leader, spread hate on the appstore. this app is worthless i hope it gets taken down soon. sincerely, \n           - Bernie Sanders fan (currently settling for Joe Biden)","userName":"Bernie_Sandersbabe186","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:38:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Sad times for the App Store"}}]}
