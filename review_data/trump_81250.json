Everyone else has it under control. That does not sound too great to me. On top of this, all of the minorities feel oppressed by our justice system. There have been 598 people killed by the police this year. Not to say that all of them were African American or that the victims were not committing a crime. But, the amount of unjust and racial killings is absurdly high in our country. That does not sound too great to me either. The fact that half the country did not feel grateful to live in our country this fourth of July because they did not feel free is not too great either. And their feelings were definitely justified with a system that is catered towards white people. I am saying all of this as a white person who realizes how Trump treats this country and the cruel things that he says. Whether it be on twitter or in front of an audience, Trump has said some really rude and demeaning things to plenty of people and about plenty of people. For instance, at a rally he made fun of a disabled reporter. No man or woman that is in charge of a country should feel they have a right to bring a fellow citizen down whether they are a minority or not. This is why I believe an app supporting this man to come back into office should not exist because he is not a worthy candidate to fight a global pandemic, help all of his voters, or regard all people with the same kindness that he expects. I understand that stopping a highly contagious virus from spreading is hard work but at least be an example to the rest of the country by wearing a mask which protects OTHER PEOPLE. It is not made to protect you, so it is selfish to not wear it (as long as your health permits it). Thank you for your time."}},{"id":"6176912553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:26Z","userName":"LeosaidBLM","rating":1,"title":"Why orange","review":"Y’all deported my uncle and have our kids in cages"}},{"id":"6176888011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:14:58Z","userName":"Pollosam","rating":1,"title":"terrible😘","review":"The orange man scared me when I opened the app so this app needs to go."}},{"id":"6176875154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:11:35Z","userName":"Lizzo 2020👊🏽","rating":1,"title":"LIZZO FOR PRESIDENT","review":"it toke 30 minutes to download!
