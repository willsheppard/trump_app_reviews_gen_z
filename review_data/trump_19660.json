His lack of movement caused us to take him to the hospital\nWhile we were gone Cheeto man became upset from his lack of loyalty and started a house fire. We came home and all that was left was Cheeto dust.

The layout is annoying, and it asks for too much of your personal information!! I downloaded this and then realized that this app promotes racism, sexism, xenophobia, and white supremacy. This is certainly not something we want our children to be around!

The app kept crashing every time I opened it and gave an awful user experience. I’m not sure why Apple even let this on it the App Store considering how it makes me feel like apple lets any garbage be downloaded.","userName":"Snkrhead1234567","title":"Spam"}},{"id":"6177789259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:37:34Z","review":"Ok I saw a trend going on about this app. I questioned it for why they were doing it because of some app. So I installed it for Orangeman 2020 to see his plan of the election. I was very disappointed for how the app worked and all the information and how out of hand it was. I will never install this app again and I am thinking about Biden 2020.
