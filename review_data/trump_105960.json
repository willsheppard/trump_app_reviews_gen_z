I looked at my TV and Kevin O’Leary AKA mr wonderful looked right at me and said “how are those beans?” I bit my 🧆 beans which warmed up to scalding hot and I screamed in terror and Kevin kept yelling at me “HOW ARE THOSE BEANS??” I asked lord wonderful™️ what he did to my beans and he said to download the Trump app or else. \n\nI didn’t know what that meant. Obviously there was something in my beans. There’s no way he was actually talking to me right. I went to take a shower to calm down. As I conditioned my hair, shaking, Kevin Wonderful appeared in a steamy corner in a purple tuxedo way too small for him and I screamed “MR WONDERFUL WHY ARE YOU HERE?” He told me if I didn’t download this Trump application that my whole family was in danger of being liquidated and sold to the Wonka corporation. He then told me I was quite beautiful and handed me a sticky blue rose. I instinctively tore the rose petals off and a message read “Remember the beans, remember the family.”\n\nMr wonderful vanished in a puff of smoke leaving behind solid gold strap on covered in dust. My body trembling in terror, I knew what I had to do. So I picked up my phone from up-under my mattress to download this application to prevent my family from being made into sweet delicious chocolate that may bring me the temptation of eating my own father. \n\nNow I wait in fear. The app took days to download, 72 hours. And yeah it lags from page to page. Full of glitches. My phone is constantly freezing up, yet my beans are still scalding. Will my family be ok? 1 star."}},{"id":"6178836606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-10T00:55:20Z","userName":"Lady-lad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"worst app on the whole store!!! would rate 0!!!"}},{"id":"6178809392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i am disgusted","date":"2020-07-10T00:44:55Z","userName":"joeeee mammmmma","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"donald trump is to orange for my liking i’m sorry :("}},{"id":"6178803434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I love our dream sickle of a president","date":"2020-07-10T00:42:37Z","userName":"👺👹👺🤡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"🤮🤡🤮🤡"}},{"id":"6178722957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No","date":"2020-07-10T00:11:35Z","userName":"Wb231","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Biden 2020 get this racist out of office"}},{"id":"6178691994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app stinks!!!","date":"2020-07-09T23:59:36Z","userName":"genz.mel","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is literally so bad, the colors are so ugly, and the app smells bad"}},{"id":"6178671613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Stole my phone information and private stuff","date":"2020-07-09T23:51:43Z","userName":"Fish privacy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP IT STEALS UR PHONE INFO AND DELETES ALL UR STUFF.
