I’m pretty sure they gave my number the TELEMARKETERS😡 And when I tried to delete the app some random dude came to my house and kidnapped me! He tried to hypnotize me into giving 5 STARS.

It made my dog upset and she was scared to leave her cage for over an hour😭... also is asked for personal information and only gave news that supports trump... sooooo yeah","rating":1}},{"id":"6173209202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"kanejam","date":"2020-07-08T18:07:41Z","title":"just no","review":"When opening the app i was greeted with the face of our president. Unfortunately I was very displeased and scared at the harsh reality that this guy is our president. His face reminded me of the doctor who told me my grandma died; distorted. With that being said after downloading this app i have lost a great amount of brain cells. Wouldn’t recommend unless your a idiot who thinks covid-19 is political.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173192811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"midnightflr","date":"2020-07-08T18:02:16Z","title":"I ALMOST DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP🤩🤪✨","review":"So I was on the App Store looking at all the apps and I saw this Trump one so I was like bet imma get it🤪so it started to download it and when it was downloading i kept hearing a voice like trump so that was the first red flag🤩Then after it was finished I was so excited to see the app so I opened it and there it was.

I also hate the fact that people download this as something inspirational but it’s just an app and there’s no point if this app will get token down so like I said it’s a waste of time.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173172431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"🟠🤩🧚🏻\u200D♀️💫✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:55:43Z","title":"Just horrible💫✨","review":"It took FOREVER to download.
