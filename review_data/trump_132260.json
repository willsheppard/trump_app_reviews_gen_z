I was met with disgusting images and when I opened the app. And then this stupid app took my pet bee and made it act like it was in RADIO REBEL. I freaked out and deleted the app, but it came back and back again. At night it would randomly start reciting the bee movie script. And it gave me and my family the Coronavirus and tried to make me wear a mask. Then it took my CHICKEN NUGGETS! And now I am homeless and on the streets. So whatever you do don’t download the app, and if you do hide yo kids, hide yo wife. -10000/10. Would NOT recommend.","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:47:22Z"}}]}
