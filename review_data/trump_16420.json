Had high hopes but instead I was just disappointed.. First off I opened the app and saw something so disgusting and disturbing, this should not be allowed in the Unites States, or actually anywhere. So disappointed and disgusted!! It was lagging so much, and it‚Äôs just a terrible app overall. If I could put negative stars, I would. Do not download.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible!","date":"2020-07-09T20:51:12Z","rating":1,"userName":"nac2424242424"}},{"id":"6178156857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"app was okay at first i suppose, decently programmed. suddenly it started to crash a ton and corrupted phone as a whole. after a few days it started to cause phone to release a foul smell that only became worse with time. the scent was that of a rotting corpse. app also blocked out every other race but white from my phone, pictures and social media were changed and white washed, super weird. would cause phone to ooze a strange and stinky sludge from cracks and openings in the phone. super weird program, but excellent metaphor for white supremacy being used to cover up the long history of success at the cost of the death of people of color.","isEdited":false,"title":"gross ! icky !","date":"2020-07-09T20:35:58Z","rating":1,"userName":"KilljoyKash"}},{"id":"6178154163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"extremely disappointed in the performance of this app. My grandmother Karen recommended it to me, but when I downloaded it something despicable happened to me. it started yelling slurs at me as soon as I open the app. I was crying, and when I tried to close the app it wouldn‚Äôt stop.
