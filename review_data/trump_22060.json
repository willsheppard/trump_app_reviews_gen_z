It also keeps showing me images of a hideous old man acting unintelligent and ignorant!

Imagine how surprised I was to see this app while waiting for my taco to pay for the groceries. Long story short Mr. Hugz (who popped out of nowhere really) was not happy to see the app. So like any rational stuffed animal he pulled out a giant mallet and smashed my phone to pieces. Moral of the story is this app broke my phone 😡"}},{"id":"6174892787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"_Bella 03_","date":"2020-07-09T03:34:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"Worst app ever, I mean I thought it was app about Cheetos but it wasn’t. It was just a wrinkly old orange man who is racist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-women equal rights, White supremacist , anti-BLM, a rapist, someone who leaves children in cages, I could on and on and on and on but this review would never be posted but you get the idea. That’s why I rate this app a one star but would much lower if I could."}},{"id":"6174888793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The Reverse Sam Bashor","date":"2020-07-09T03:33:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My phone wouldn’t work","review":"This app is the worst when I downloaded it my phone started to glitch and then my whole screen went black. When I finally got my phone to work again I clicked on the app and it glitched and my screen got black again. The app doesn’t work at all. 😡"}},{"id":"6174878791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jbuzzxoxoxo292","date":"2020-07-09T03:30:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I lost my wife and kids because of this app","review":"Absolutely do not download this app. When i first downloaded it my dog started doing really weird things like walking through walls and barking in Portuguese. Then my mom told me I was adopted and I started smoking cigarettes. I got fired from my job because of this app. Save yourself and do not download."}},{"id":"6174845809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"issya honey","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"FALSE ADVERTISING","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes my dad would come back, this app promised me points to redeem for cool stuff in return. I saved up so many good points and I was so excited to redeem them for cool stuff.  I opened the app to find all my points were gone. Everytime I see trumps face I think of how he took the points he promised  ;(  true story"}},{"id":"6174838441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"itadakiseiki","date":"2020-07-09T03:18:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"disgusted and disappointed","review":"the SECOND i opened this horrid little app i got a notification calling me a filthy diseased CH*NK!!😡😡 then the app came to life and BEAT ME AND MY FAMILY UP while SCREAMING at us and calling us F*GG*TS and OTHER HATEFUL SLURS🙀🙀i am beyond horrified. all i wanted was to show support for my favorite sad orange man and THIS is the thanks i get???? my heart is crying and i am now on my way to commit sewiside because of this hateful app 😾😾😿😿"}},{"id":"6174829639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Hi, it is me","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Smelly 🤢","review":"This app made my toes smell so bad! I opened the app, and immediately got the horrible stench of my feet. The best way to describe the stench is moldy hot dogs, burning hair, and a yeast infection. I warn all those who get this app and, worst of all, support trump willingly, this advice; don’t. Your toes will smell horrid. Along with having outdated, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and sexist ideals, your toes (along with personality and body) will smell like doo doo."}},{"id":"6174819129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"themysetry","date":"2020-07-09T03:12:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"The app literally ate all my cashews in my cabinet and I kept seeing this guy who looked like a orange and I couldn’t get him off the app. The loading time was horrible and took almost two hours to load but my WiFi was working just fine. It shut down on me every time I opened it, the worst app ever."}}]}
