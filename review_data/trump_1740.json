After a week of it downloading. Once it downloaded some strange things started to happen like I started to loved oranges and orange juice even tho before the app apple juice was always the best. I started to become obsessed with anything to do with the color orange or orange flavor things which in my opinion were the worst but now ever since I downloaded the I loved orange anything. Then I became color blind to only see orange. So if you do get this horrible app there r side affects you will get hypnotize to like anything orange. It also kept crashing and making my apps and stuff all orange and the home screen and lock screen r now orange. Delete it right away so it doesn’t happen to you. It will scare me for life. Once u delete it all the affects will go away. 🍊🍊🍊🍊","userName":"oranges 🍊🍊","rating":1}},{"id":"6177350273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:22:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App","review":"I will admit I saw people advertising this app through tick tock, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I had no idea President Trump had an app, and I got excited to see what his app was proposing. Never have I ever been so disappointed with an app. First of all, it took around 4 hours to download. When I finally got the app, it closed, so I had to restart my phone. After I finally got it working, it would not stop asking me if it could send notification and turn on location. It was so persistent, it felt like an invasion of privacy. Not to mention, it wanted my phone number. I gave in and put my number, but what I found after was horrible! It was as if it was trying to brainwash me! If this feel into the youths hands, the would all succumb to all the false advertising and become robots! I do not recommend this app!!","userName":"wowdrew and my friend sent me","rating":1}},{"id":"6177166889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:30:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump not in 2020 🤩","review":"I’m not from the USA but I always look downed to international politics. I was excited to download this app to see what steps does Donald Trump as a president to see what he does. First of all even before I even download the app it took a whole DAY to download. When I downloaded it my phone was really REALLY slowed to the point where I can’t even search for something in safari. Then I got not one but TWO viruses on my phone. I was really infuriated at this point. I couldn’t even open my apps on my phone without getting bombarded with ads and so on. The only app that I could’ve opened what the download. I am honestly disappointed. I had higher expectations. I would inform my family who lived in America to not vote for Trump and don’t think good about him. Now I have to buy a new phone. Thanks a lot trump hope you don’t win😘","userName":"Kim freak","rating":1}},{"id":"6176937894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"cheeto dust man","review":"this app is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. 12 of my siblings have passed away in a bicycle accident recently and i turned to mr cheeto dust man, that for some reason goes by the term “president”, and he was completely useless. as soon as i seen his cheeto looking face and his 3 strands of hair sticking straight up when i opened the app, i immediately went and crashed myself into a tree. i almost died because of this app. i am currently in a coma typing this because i must let the world know what this app has done. i minds well do something while i’m laying here unresponsive and my family is dropping tears all over me (honestly very refreshing 10/10 recommend) but anyways, i just wanted to say that when you see cheeto man.. HE WILL completely take control of your body and i was almost one of his victims. DO NOT get this app","userName":"🐷🐽🐣🐰🐅🐹🍄🍂","rating":1}},{"id":"6176224467","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:12:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ruined my life","review":"Never download this app. Under any circumstances. I was going about my day when I came across this app I downloaded it and as soon as it installed after several attempts my phone shut down . After it shut down I noticed my light switch kept turning on and off. I thought nothing of it and turned my phone back on when then the worse thing happen. My phone started LEVITATING OUT OF MY HAND . Scared I tried leaving my room when my door suddenly locked . Fearing for my life I screamed only to see a shadow coming towards me it said that by downloading this app I have allowed it to invade my home. I quickly ran up to my phone and deleted the app as fast as I could it was fighting me but I eventually stopped it. I do not wish this upon anyone. I am so sorry if you weren’t as lucky as me please ✨💕🧚\u200D♀️😌","userName":"Kay 🧚\u200D♀️💕✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6176159687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:53:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"💗🧚🏻\u200D♂️🌺💕✨ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE✨💕🌺🧚🏻\u200D♂️💗","review":"honestly i really don’t know where to start this app took forever to download and when it finally did it lagged forever. i literally thought my wifi was down because of how much it was lagging so i went to my router and all and tried to fix it. i ended up breaking my router due to my anger issues that developed from a young age due to my child hood trauma. 😡🤬 and had a get a whole different router and call someone to set it up. one it was set up and my wifi was working i realized it was simply just lagging so much. when it finally loaded i realized the app was full of bs. but what do you expect from a trump app. donald trump is a white supremacist - full stop - if you vote for him again you’re a white supremacist. i said what i said and i’ll say it again😘💅🏻so, to the president: \n🧚🏻 ✨𝓼𝓱𝓾𝓽 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓯𝓾𝓬𝓴 𝓾𝓹✨🧚🏻","userName":"źžźz","rating":1}},{"id":"6175834319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:07:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"dangerous","review":"The trump 2020 app is so dangerous, and It needs to be removed from the market immediately before anyone gets seriously hurt! And I mean falling off a cliff playing Pokémon go type hurt! When I downloaded the app, which took forever, I opened it and it asked for my phone number. Then I started receiving billions and billions and billions of text messages, all of which were harassing me to vote for trump in November. I was so scared because the texts were threatening me and my family that they’d send us back to “where [we] came from” even though I’ve never lived anywhere but where I am right now. This app is attacking our livelyhoods and doing more damage than even a Chinese app could do, which is actually non existent damage-wise. Trump’s app needs to be removed immediately and he needs to be removed from office as well. ✨🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"enehdhe","rating":1}},{"id":"6175004848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:09:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"very bad!","review":"so last night i downloaded this app to see what the hype was about. the gameplay was pretty glitchy and donald’s character kept touching my character inappropriately 😬 there was no consent option. but after i was done checking it out i turned off my phone and went to bed. little did i know i forgot to close my window in my room and somehow the real donald snuck into my house. he didn’t steal anything except for my grandmas ashes! before he left he barged into my room with a baseball bat and demolished both of my legs. now i’m in the hospital and i wish i had meemaws ashes with me. i keep getting text messages that say “u up? -donny” those could be from anyone but i’m a little suspicious since the first one sent was a presidential alert to my phone. who knows? anyway dont purchase this app if you wanna keep your legs!
