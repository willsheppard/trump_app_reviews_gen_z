And as soon as I downloaded the app. My phone started glitching. Until it shattered in my face and cut up my face real bad. I had to get plastic surgery because my face was so messed up. And when my grandma seen me, she had a heart attack and died. I didn’t have money to get an iPhone so I had to get an android. Very disappointed.","title":"The worst"}},{"id":"6173135780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:44:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"personwhowriereveiws","review":"This app broke when i downloaded, not even five seconds later, it crashed. this app is a disgrace to america. he is a disgrace to America. the app started playing music and it was very annoying.this app was rlly disorganized and ugly. it’s was hard to get around. and the sign up was very hard. do not download this app if you want your battery to stay for longer. this app wasted my battery and my life. \n\n                                                             ~ Anonymous","title":"Smh🙄"}},{"id":"6173135416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:44:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Boy guy😜","review":"Bayéës🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","title":"Bad app"}},{"id":"6173135427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:44:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"R.I.P my Caterpillar","review":"I’m sorry I couldn’t make it to the Trump Rally, I was walking my caterpillar. I would say thank you for your service because I used Trump’s picture as a laxative for my caterpillar.
