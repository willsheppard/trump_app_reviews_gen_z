I am disappointed with his actions, his words, and the way he runs the country. And that’s the thing, he SHOULDN’T be running the country, WE should. Therefore I will NEVER support him OR the apps that were made to support him.","date":"2020-07-08T21:28:16Z","userName":"tcool4575"}},{"id":"6173782462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of time","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"What an absolute joke of an app, it refused to work!!
