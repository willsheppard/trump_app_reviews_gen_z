Right when I opened it I see the biggest bug ever! It was wearing a suit and had a terrible spray tan. Anyways, my hamster became deaf soon after I started using this app and now I have to learn sign language for him 👎🏽 would not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T23:45:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174148169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTED 👁👄👁","userName":"sophiathebaddest","review":"The app itself is just completely useless. I do not need to see a bright orange man on my screen every time I open my phone. It’s just to much pressure and it’s not good for my health. So I would love it if you would remove this HORRIBLE APP. I repeat not good for anybody 🥰🥰✨just my opinion though xoxo❤️","date":"2020-07-08T23:43:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174145179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Kim Namjoon 2020!!!💜","userName":"kim namjoon 2020💜","review":"I opened up the app just to see a deformed Cheeto puff. According to the government he is our president which I believe needs to get checked. This deformed Cheeto is also racist and a rapist that should belong in jail. He also has hay as a wig. So instead of wasting tour time downloading this app download TIKTOK and stream “Stay Gold” by Bts 🥰💜!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174141646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointing","userName":"MoreBoredPotato","review":"I thought this was an app to track Donald to avoid his tiny grabby hands. Instead I see a Cheeto grinning like cheaper and older , rundown version of 69. 🤮 also, we would like to point out that the picture of the Vienna weenie was very uncalled for! No one wants to see that!","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174128674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Just HORRIBLE to have and very glitchy","userName":"babybopisqueen","review":"I initially downloaded the app to be able to keep up with “our president” i was so excited but was brought to disappointment of how glitchy and badly organized the app is.

It needs a serious rework, and a different look to it. Oh also whoever this Donald Trump guy is he looks like a wrinkly slug with a lot of dust bunnies on its head. If he is the face of this app I don’t want this to be seen by children, it’s not for the faint of heart.","date":"2020-07-08T23:27:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174101875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app in history🤬🤬","userName":"47288273","review":"As soon as I opened the app it started glitching uncontrollably and caused my phone to shut off MULTIPLE TIMES. IT HAS TO BE SHUT DOWN. I haven’t been able to get to the rest of my phone or any other apps. I’m deleting it and you should take it down. I’m very angry 😠. DO NOT GET THIS APP.
