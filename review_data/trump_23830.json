Once it finally downloaded every time I opened the app it would glitch to different screens.

Along with ligma I also have eye ligma from the pictures. I didn’t even get to the part where it haunted my house with evil Casper and he is touching my no no square and I don’t like so rate this app a 1 star review because Casper is too touchy.","title":"It caused me to get ligma","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Toby Jaxoff"}},{"id":"6173247389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:20:19Z","review":"The app started off as wonderful but then started to glitch to a white screen whenever i would click on something, maybe needs some bug fixes. hope to see it fixed soon.","title":"unfortunately did not work","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Hi bazaire"}},{"id":"6173246087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:19:53Z","review":"Not only does he look like a cheeto puff but he also has the puny brain capacity of one. Very negative app that promotes toxic ☣️ behavior. Would not ❌ recommend downloading. It constantly glitches due to the bull**** that is being advocated🤬. If there were a zero star option I would’ve most definitely left one🤗.","title":"Cheeto puff🟠❌","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Bernie Sandars😚"}},{"id":"6173242164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:18:38Z","review":"This app is completely and utterly useless. It doesn’t do any of the things it said and there’s no point. You can’t even stream gods menu by stray kids on it and if that doesn’t show its true colors then I don’t know what will. Out president does not Stan nct and I think that is a problem.","title":"A complete waste of my time🤬🤷","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"noona neomu yeppo🥰✨"}},{"id":"6173233297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:15:38Z","review":"This app has the worst loading time, the design is not pleasing, and why is there an orange man as its main character? I thought this was a game about the year 2020 and how to “trump” all of the negativity. IT WAS NOT THAT. I was horrified by the initial face that came up. If you want a pleasing game, put a pleasing to look at character on it’s home page. WORST GAME EVER","title":"Idk where to begin","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Ksgirl99"}}]}
