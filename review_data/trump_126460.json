Also, just some friendly advice for our favorite 🍊orange🍊, there are some great foundation and concealer tutorials on YouTube, you should totally check them out! Tried a makeup sponge? Beauty blenders are the best! I mean, not that I want you as President for another 4 years, but still, best of luck evil orange man!","userName":"z o o m e r","title":"um"}}]}
