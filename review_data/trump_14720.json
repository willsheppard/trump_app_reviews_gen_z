Even tho everyone makes mistakes, trumps mom made an unforgivable one. U know the rule when u are supposed to leave a place the same way u found it or better, trump clearly didn’t follow that rule. The way trump treats people in this country is worse than his fake tan. Can’t wait to see him in heaven, oh wait, I won’t have to worry about that because he would be in hell🥰","userName":"sophikaaaa","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6135861002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","date":"2020-06-29T13:03:14Z","rating":1,"review":"All I wanted was to support our amazing,sexy and excepting president so i downloaded the app. When I opened the app my house caught on fire so after I called the fire department I could hear a voice shouting “get out this is Trumps house now” After my house got put out I went back in and everything was destroyed, everything except my Trump shrine. So i moved out and the same thing keeps happening. All because of this app.","userName":"ryrythebread","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6135198084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"my ow wheat down just using it 🙀","date":"2020-06-29T09:33:55Z","rating":1,"review":"terrible terrible app. i just wanted to support my wonderful president and ignored all of the reviews thinking that gen z was back at it again 😾 turns out they were not! as i started using the app i felt very light headed and my head started to hurt . so i did what any normal person would do and i took an i’m test and guess what. it when down so much i could t believe it! terrible app DO NOT INSTALL","userName":"😹😻👐🏼👿","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6123122696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very deceitful app! DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-06-26T07:18:49Z","rating":1,"review":"I’m writing this because I thought this was an app to support Trump then as I was going through it I realized it was made by the radical left group. Not only did it try to make me vote Democrat but it also had hate speeches against the Republican Party in it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It needs to be take down immediately I would give it zero stars if I could. Written in hopes to enlighten new app downloaders by your trustworthy local.

I guess that’s what happens when you download an app that supports a racist, homophobic man that’s been involved with murder and has raped various children. I do not recommend this app at all and I hope that anyone who doesn’t download it as a joke can fix their brain or something. I hope the best for those people.","userName":"Monrojos000","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6075276699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oh Donnie Boy","date":"2020-06-14T16:03:13Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is appalling and I would like to speak to the manager. I assumed it would thin my hair and dye my skin orange like my one and only god Chester cheetah. It did nothing of the sort. SAD! I had BIG PLANS, really big plans, I’m talking like huge, the biggest plan you’ve ever seen to write a loving review of our white supremacist overlord Donnie tr*mp but I simply cannot. My skin and hair are still normal tones and I will NOT stand for that treatment in MY amaerica!!!! Ps black lives matter thank u ❤️","userName":"judyyyyyyy68","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6065322840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"so bad","date":"2020-06-12T03:14:12Z","rating":1,"review":"honestly the worst app. if you’ve downloaded it, I probably don’t even need to tell you why it’s so bad, you know already. First of all of doesn't work at all. Completely nonfunctional. I had to enter all of my personal information to sign up, and then it would not stop prompting me to add even more sensitive info. I DONT WANT TO PUT IT ON THERE. I am seriously reconsidering my vote based on my experience with this app.","userName":"rockandrollercoaster","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6062874940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why do I have to sign up?","date":"2020-06-11T12:39:58Z","rating":1,"review":"I was going to check this app out and it’s asking for my PHONE NUMBER??? EMAIL??? No!  I can just search with Google but I figured get it straight from the horse’s mouth.  And now I have to give out personal information to this boomer?  I think not.\n\nAnyway this app has one picture of the famous bunker boy and zero information.  You tell me who’s controlling the media and knowledge out there. 👀","userName":"mmeticulous","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6062392288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Life Threatening","date":"2020-06-11T10:10:52Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is so dangerous. I also really believe that this app is highly inappropriate and insensitive. As soon as I opened the app a racist and rapist appeared on my screen. I downloaded this app really believing that it was a presidential app but it doesn’t seem like it. I also started seeing pictures of a pig on the app and got sick since i’m really allergic and grossed out by rotten meat. Sincerely, someone who really really really really really hates this app","userName":"Elitepro2564","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179114030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨👩\u200D🔬🧚\u200D♂️🦄","date":"2020-07-10T02:37:07Z","rating":1,"review":"One time I was going through the garage and then my house was just sitting on the front of my car so I’m just sitting in my couch looking at my phone and I don’t have any keys for my dad and the dog is in my car so I’ll be there at five if you’re not busy I’ll let him be a little bit later if you wanna is that good day you want me to be here and let me your mom know what I can have for you.","userName":"Brooke McEntire","isEdited":false}}]}
