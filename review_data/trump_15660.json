I’m not sure if it is due to the lack of effort put into it or maybe there’s too many ignorant people on it at once.. either way it’s just so sad that I’m the middle of this pandemic And human rights movement I can’t keep up with the annoying orange :(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:52:56Z"}},{"id":"6175048032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮TOOK ALL MY MONEY!","isEdited":false,"userName":"coochie🧚","review":"I got this app to keep up to date on our AMAZING President’s campaign. I also ended up donating to the important cause that is Donald Trump🥰. I found a week later that my bank account had been drained of all my money. I worked hard for that money!😡I bet the radical leftists hacked into it and took MY MONEY! I no longer support this app! Not to mention that I received hundreds of notifications all day.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:22:53Z"}},{"id":"6174913374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app sexually harassed me!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ajmratsajmrats","review":"As soon as I downloaded and first opened this app, men started following me everywhere. They would touch me and hurt me and look at me funny. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, it ILLEGALLY shares your location with creepy old men looking to get some. Luckily I deleted the app before I entered my house, otherwise they would have known where I love and might have come back later. This app is the perfect representation of trump though.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:40:36Z"}},{"id":"6174890474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not worth it","isEdited":false,"userName":"😀😀😀😀😀😀😀great","review":"This app has caused my phone to glitch horribly. Before I got this app my phone was working perfectly fine nothing wrong but once I downloaded the app my phone started to glitch and not work as well. It was so bad I had to take it in to the Apple store for it to get fixed, they were unable to fix it and I had to get a whole new phone. SO DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON A NEW PHONE!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:33:49Z"}},{"id":"6174864576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app out here","isEdited":false,"userName":"The #69th bedt president","review":"Today I downloaded it because i want to know everything about Trump because he’s the #69 best president😖 when i downloaded it i was so excited.

But after downloading this app my phone glitches and randomly turns my location on? Who is watching me? This app should be deleted IMMEDIATELY. I do not recommend this app to anyone who has an older model phone. So after this awful experience i no longer think I’m going to be voting for Mr. Trump In this upcoming election.

If you are considering voting for him in 2020, you are against equal rights, women’s rights, black rights, trans rights, and so many more. A vote for trump is a vote against all except white straight males.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:56:56Z"}},{"id":"6174733679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"umm no😌❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"sofias reveiws","review":"i downloaded this app for comfort and reassurance of our beloved president but you wanna know what showed up a big orange screaming at me the minute i opens the app and you would think that if i closed the app the screaming would stop but noo i keep hearing it it’s almost like he’s outside so i took the liberty of deleting this app and you should too \nya know for your own ears and life i still hear him screaming”VOTE FOR ME OR I WILL KILL YOUR FAMILY”","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:47:08Z"}}]}
