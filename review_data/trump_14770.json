Even to the point where I couldn’t turn it on. I had to wait 3 HOURS before my phone was responsive again. Don’t need that. Also, that image of the fake American flag gen z wanted to implement came on my screen? That didn’t happen before I downloaded this :( very disappointed in the quality of the app.","title":"👎","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lady_liberty_789"}},{"id":"6177795060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:39:19Z","review":"I downloaded this app thinking I would be able to learn about what Donald was up to next when I quickly realized that this wasn’t the app I though it was. As soon as I opened the app, I saw the most horrific picture ever. I saw Donald Trump’s spray tan picture. I was so scarred and horrified of what I saw that I went completely blind. Thank you Donald Trump for making me blind, I do NOT recommend downloading this app.","title":"This app took 5 DAYS TO DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"queen74lake"}},{"id":"6177754793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:27:08Z","review":"I opened the app and it said to provide my phone number so Donald J. Trump could give me a call or message. Then it said to ELECT Trump!!!!!! I was nope first he brought back racism, then he brought riots, he wants to build a wall, and not to mention the COVID-19 breakout! But why take away or social media such as Tiktok? Tiktok brings people joy and now our President wants us to be miserable by taking away the things that put a smile on our face! #savetiktok","title":"Worst President Ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"Trump Hater😌💅🏽✨"}},{"id":"6177720557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:16:52Z","review":"I tried to open it and it kept kicking me off and crashing! You would think the apple store or Apple at all would not allow this but here we are. It was awful! There were times it would load and not crash but even then, there were DISGUSTING images. I wish to give a lower rating like half of the one star but it is impossible. Do NOT download!!","title":"Worst App Ever!","isEdited":false,"userName":"BootyHoleJunior"}},{"id":"6177717122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:15:51Z","review":"I went on the app that I thought was professional and I just saw a Cheeto. I thought I would find news. I also though I could have regular news but it’s telling my I have to put in a phone number when I could get my news from alexa. Trump is also taking away Tiktok which I’m disappointed about that. Tiktok is an app we’re people can become one.","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"xanjdnskansvwjs"}},{"id":"6177700975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:10:58Z","review":"I was looking forward to getting this app to support our great Cheeto. Once I opened it, the screen went black. It started glitching and was doing this for about 10 minutes 😱. After that, I was shocked to see that my phone had caught on fire 🔥. I had to put my phone in water to stop the fire and put it in rice. Once it was done I immediately deleted the app. Our orange should be ashamed 🤦🏽\u200D♀️.","title":"Tiktok ❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"tum hi"}},{"id":"6177695033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:09:11Z","review":"this. app. ~succccks~ absolutely horrible! the racist tendencies blow my mind. the sexism that was experienced!!! gag! homophobia???? we don’t know her but you know who does? 🍊🍊🍊🍊.
