The animals on there were uglier than usual🤢Passed out for a couple of hours from how hideous it was. Had to delete the app because it kept calling me slurs and kept taking me to ads where they needed maid service. Got quite annoying. Won’t download again.","date":"2020-07-09T01:57:37Z","userName":"tulicooli","title":"Just no","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174509613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I, as a proud part of gen z, obviously wholeheartedly support our amazing president, ✨ Donald J.

When I first got it it didn’t even let me open it! It made my flashlight go CRAZY and this weird audio of a goat screaming started playing. 🐐🐐🔊🔊🔊 When I finally got into it there was a video of a blob-fish covered in ketchup just wiggling around 🤢There wasn’t anything else, just the video. Please please please don’t download this.

There were many issues with the messages that were displayed on the app, and it takes a long time to figure out how the app creator came up with the things on the app because the layout and screens do not make much sense. Very inaccessible and will not be recommending.","date":"2020-07-09T01:32:37Z","userName":"☘️🦋🌱🌿","title":"Really Bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174445948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app because i wanted to see trump’s phat voluptuous juicy cake, but instead the app automatically sent giant muscular humanoid rats to my house who proceeded to beat up me and my whole family. they then smashed all our windows, robbed us, went to the garage and got in our car and drove away. i don’t think i’ll ever recover from this traumatizing experience. trump 2020💕✨👄but make it prison🥰❤️🧚🏻","date":"2020-07-09T01:24:02Z","userName":"important person 472857","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174441447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not even worth the one star!! This is the worst app I’ve ever had and deleted it so quick. It is to tacky and ugly on my home screen and the inside of the app only gets worse🤢 the mismatched splotchy fake tan on his old face is the last thing I want to see. This app is an abomination and made my phone FILTHY. I have to get a new one now because this app has contaminated my phone.","date":"2020-07-09T01:22:38Z","userName":"gen zee123","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174438741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all idek why Apple has this app. The content inside is disturbing and the app doesn’t even properly work. When you open it up there are so many pop ups of an orange headed person. That picture has scarred me for life. I’m absolutely petrified. The app shuts down and I think it’s tracking my phone. Apple you NEED to delete this app from the AppStore!","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:50Z","userName":"Urjndbc","title":"Absolutely Disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174435409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first arrived, it took about 5 hours to get seats. The hostess, Kayleigh, was being very aggressive towards us and when she told us that we can’t be seated because we are a minority, she said oh it was just a joke. But from the kitchen I could hear a squirrely guy saying I don’t joke. Communication was not great and the Cheetos where not worth the wait. Would not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T01:20:48Z","userName":"Mbossc","title":"Worst service ever 👎","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174432521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I recently heard about the \nFlaming Hot Cheetos ™ grand prize giveaway on tiktok and was told that downloading this app would enter me into the giveaway. It ALSO stated that I would have access to premium VIP Cheetos ™ content, but??? It’s just a man? Asking for votes for something? I’ve emailed the Cheetos ™ administration multiple times and have not yet gotten a response so I am still waiting for an answer. Do not download this app!! It’s a scam!!","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:56Z","userName":"Sherpawoolly","title":"It’s a scam!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
