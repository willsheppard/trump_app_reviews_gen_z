My phone was immediately flooded with a virus. The virus was of random people’s foots absolutely disturbing. This app is designed for people with foot fetches and no braincells. I would not recommend this terrible app to anyone stay far from this app ‼️ Also if you don’t want to keep loosing braincells, VOTE BLUE 💙 this year."}},{"id":"6178136240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:29:02Z","title":"AWFUL APP","userName":"Tic_Tack","review":"I’ve had a phone for many seasons now, as the moon eclipses and the sun rises and sets a phone has been in my hand. Of all the apps I’ve clicked and clacked of all the phones I’ve touched and tapped this app on this phone is the WORST. I try so hard to read and understand this app and NOTHING WORKS. All of it is awful. Terrible. Horrendous. Disgusting. Wrong. Bad.

After texting STOP and receiving a “we aren’t gonna text you anymore” text within an hour I got another text. I believe this is illegal and so therefore don’t get this app if you like your privacy or don’t like being harassed."}},{"id":"6178039185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:56:54Z","title":"🙈✨more disgusting than hanna who hooked up with her teacher🙈✨","userName":"sishuh","review":"i got this app to make sure i was updated with our amazing presidents campaign, bunker boy😳🤚🏽. but when i opened the app it gave me a VIRUS i don’t understand why it it started glitching i got so scared im currently writing this review on my nintendo DS only real ones had those😌🤚🏽. also excuse the emojis my keyboard is broken😹😿😻🙀.

Sad to see that our great man of power doesn’t have an app that can withstand such attack😞.  Oh well, sorry to do this to y’all. 🔪"}},{"id":"6178013497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:48:27Z","title":"Holy Jesus Joseph Christ...","userName":"DehyGFX","review":"I cannot actually believe my eyes right now. What in the mother of all that is holy did I just witness? Did I just see a Trump 2020 app...allowed on the App Store?

Also more people will get scarred for life."}}]}
