DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! Causes glitches and makes you send money to them. It scammed my grandmother out of so much money. Takes advantage of women especially. Racist and doesn’t give options for people of other races besides white. Which I find very offensive. I loved Trump all my life but now this app has caused me to no longer support him! He doesn’t deserve this! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"title":"BLM ✊🏿"}},{"id":"6173267649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:26:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"user123456734","review":"Horrible. Don’t get me started it took forever to download, wont let me do anything, and I got a virus on my phone from this app. The app also takes up so much storage on my phone.

Idk how but when I opened it I could smell the waft of moldy Cheeto puffs in the air. The app itself IMMEDIATELY crashed once I clicked on it!! Some of my family supports Trump and told me to get the app so i did however it's not to my surprise that it's non functional just like our president when it comes to racial injustice.\n\nPlease take down the app✨✨✨","rating":1,"title":"bunky boy"}},{"id":"6173167584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:54:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"autumnski26","review":"This app took hours to download, there isn’t any useful information on it, and it caused me to go into shock.
