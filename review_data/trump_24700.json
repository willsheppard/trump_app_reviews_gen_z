Couldn’t get it to download for weeks, and when it finally did it would take me to unsolicited sites. Every single time I opened the app I opened a website I’ve never seen before.

I consider this a huge privacy breach. It’s also very lagging as well and I cannot do anything I want. Horrible. If he can’t even monitor an app well then how can he help his country?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:08:16Z","userName":"LarryGengurch"}},{"id":"6173385672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app of my life","review":"I tried installing it, it took up almost all of my space on my iPhone, it also took about 1 hour to install, once I got into the app it wanted to know my location and social security number, I don’t trust it so I uninstalled it and now I have breast cancer because of the app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:06:39Z","userName":"Mc.Reviews"}},{"id":"6173384721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst 💞 app 💞 ever 💞","review":"this app made me cry 😪😪😪 its sooo bad and glitchy oml 😡😡😡 i though “mr president” could do better 😔😔😔i’m deleting this app 😞 if i could give this app 0 stars i would 🤩🤩🤩 btw i love y’all and i really hope mr donald trump deletes this because it is trash 🗑🗑🗑 (BLM, ACAB, LGBTQ+, DEMOLISH ICE, JUSTICE FOR ALL, & MINORITIES MATTER) 💕🌈 lol ✨\nall🔫the🔫other🔫kids🔫with🔫the🔫pumped🔫up🔫kicks🔫better🔫run🔫better🔫run🔫faster🔫than🔫my🔫gun🔫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:06:19Z","userName":"🐩 🦔 🐲"}},{"id":"6173374512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App didn’t work for me","review":"This app stopped working when I put my gender as female.

It kept crashing every time I try to open it. When I did finally make it to the homepage, it was just porn ads to illegal porn sites. There was also propaganda for a fascist government. The owner of this app is a blood thirty vermin. This app needs to be taken down from the apple store","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:58:55Z","userName":"Rundancer411"}}]}
