Issue #2: Once it downloaded, I didn’t have any storage left and my photo gallery was overflown with pictures of Trump in a thong, DISGUSTING. Issue #3: After I deleted the 42,069 pictures, the app completely froze! Issue #4: After deleting and reinstalling the app, not only was my gallery taken over by Trump pictures AGAIN, but my phone also overheated and shut down for two days!!! This is a terrible app, I do not recommend ever getting!"}},{"id":"6172706639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:33:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"glitches","userName":"lilypruter","review":"i tried to get the app to support the president and my phone glitched so bad it was terrible it took so so long for the app to even open when i had clicked on the app and when i would try to leave the app my phone was frozen on the trump 2020 screen i’m thinking about getting a whole NEW PHONE because how bad this app has made my softwares glitch i do believe it’s people from your app looking threw my phone... many people have had the same problem. #spredtheword #tiktok"}},{"id":"6172520457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:41:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting 🤮 cursed 😾 app","userName":"toopyster","review":"I decided to download the app to support our lovely Cheeto puff 🧡 bunker boy 🎉. However, as soon as I opened it my shirt 👕 caught on fire!! I think that this was because my shirt was orange and the app is very compatible with orange🍊things (like highlighter spray tans 💖) I deleted ❌ the app immediately and then my pet murder hornet 🐝 died ‼️‼️‼️This app causes death 💀 and destruction 🐔and I do not recommend⭐️. I think a better use of your time would be to sign a petition to get justice for Elijah McCain, Breonna Taylor, and other victims of police brutality and racist hate crimes!"}},{"id":"6172465862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:26:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"don’t waste your time downloading this app!!","userName":"karencita ✨💕","review":"this app is horrendous!! as i opened the app, it took me to a loading page for 20 minutes. after those 20 minutes it kicked me out of the app. i kept trying to go into the app but i kept kicking me out as soon as i touched the icon. im not the only one that has dealt with this issue. many of my friends and family members have seem to stumble across the same problems. it’s been months and still no changes.

However those answers were not answered when I download the app when I download the app I saw many unfinished things that Trump said he would do that weren’t finished we do not want a unfinished president who doesn’t complete his tasks that he vowed to make for years ago unacceptable."}},{"id":"6172364368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:59:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible experience 😠","userName":"bobbers 🥰😁😁✌️","review":"This app is the worst app I have ever came across, first of all this app had 2 stars and that looked a bit suspicious but I didn’t care that much, then when I opened the app it gave me a virus to my phone, I almost lost everything that I had in my phone that was saved. I’m not sure if anyone else has experienced this with an app before but I know that I had never! It also was lagging like crazy I don’t know if its because I have an old phone but whatever."}},{"id":"6172183658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:09:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t get this app!","userName":"the peas of poo","review":"I never was in to politics but as I got older I started learning.  I guess I followed the wrong person, the app gave me a bad vibe like I have to do this or have to do that, it was not fun to have the app of see what’s new!  This app needs to get taken down!  It’s not what we need right now, this app was glitchy for one and for two I hate feeling pressured to do things!  Also it’s not reasonable?! Who needs this;no one!  I recommend never getting the app because it worthless and get a bad vibe!  😡👎🏻🤯🙄"}},{"id":"6172168109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:05:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful app!!","userName":"Marco the fierce","review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about the president and to see why I should vote for him this year. But right when I opened the app my phone started glitching really bad, the screen brightness kept going high and then low over and over again hurting my eyes, and my phone kept calling random people that I didn’t know!! I had to end up taking my phone to get fixed and ended up spending a bunch of money to get it repaired all because of this app :/  Anywayssss gen z will rise 😌💅🏾👑"}}]}
