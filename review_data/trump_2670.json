Or maybe I was scared that our president is a (borderline) sociopath who would probably sexually assault me even though I’m just a child 😌🥰 Also we’re up to 3 million corona cases 🤩🎉 when Trump said he’d make America great again I didn’t know he’d make it this great!!! #1!!!!!\nHaven’t looked at the app for anticipation but I already know I’ll ✨love✨ what I see 🥰🥰 I just love looking at mounds of fat soaked in KFC oil and diet coke rolled in hot Cheeto dust and how they’re destroying America’s institutions!!! Anywho love how the man destroying America and cozying up to dictators and letting America die of Corona is so easy to access and see! Keep up the great work so we can just end our country cause only the GREAT Trump is stepping up to the challenge! ☺️☺️☺️","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174595551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Moccamilkshake","isEdited":false,"title":"Here for Tik Tok💅🏼💅🏼","review":"0/10 do 👉not🚫 recommend🙅🏻\u200D♀️‼️ I have had a very traumatizing experience due to this app😖😭. It all started when i dicided to cheack out this app that all these 60+ plus year old ✨NOT🚫 homophobic, NOT❌ racist, boomers I mean respectful elderly citizens have been talking about, but it took 69 years to download. While it was downloading i was listening to Lil Dixie Demilio’s new song “be happy”, but the music somehow switched to  (insert any kind of country music). My ears started bleeding and i am now deaf. When the app finally downloaded i was expecting to see our ✨amazing✨president BUT instead a VERY Orange Cheeto with an ugly cheap wig popped up😱😨. The Cheeto was so Orange 🍊 that i became blind. Iam now typing this with my mind, please DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:06:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174560299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hailey11115","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is vomit inducing","review":"If I could give this app a -100 star rating I would in a heartbeat. Disgusting man, president and human. I got violently ill after opening this app. Could not stand to have it on my phone any longer. Piece of trash human, piece of trash app. This should NOT be available to the public. Shame on Apple for allowing us, good Apple users, to have access to such disturbing content. Not one person should have to see what I saw when opening the app. Also so many glitches and malfunctions the app hurt my eyes to look at. I had to check in the mirror to see if my eyes were BLEEDING after just a small glance when opening the app. Horrible horrible horrible. This should have never existed on the internet and should be taken down IMMEDIATELY.","date":"2020-07-09T01:56:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174510300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tangerine tornado tweety-pants","isEdited":false,"title":"Too many mushroom like phallus objects…","review":"I downloaded the app in order to gain info to free barron; however, I came to realize that I could not save Barron through this app because it was filled with FACIST propaganda and images of a cheeto whipping his mushroom phallus around 🤮✋. After browsing the app, and encountering numerous glitches, I realized that the app failed to mention some of the key elements of the cheeto’s campaign 👀🍵... how convenient! There was no mention of the Cheeto’s collusion with Russia, ties to Jeffrey Epstein, incompetence, or his bigoted (or, more specifically, racist, homophobic, classist, abelist, sexist, & fascist) tactics. Although I’m sure Mike Pence would love to see pics of the Cheeto stripping in the White House, PLEASE take this app off of the AppStore to spare the eyes of everyone else ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿💛🖤🏳️\u200D🌈☮️☪️🕉☸️✡️☯️⚛️👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩👨\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨💋💄🧚🏻\u200D♀️.","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174462851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Riley Kristoph Jenner","isEdited":false,"title":"Compromised my phone?","review":"I downloaded this app and the first thing it asked for was my bank routing number, social security, AND a picture of my BIRTH CERTIFICATE! This is ABHORRENT! The last thing I want is for Donald Trump to steal my identity, and quite frankly this is ILLEGAL! Also, as soon as I downloaded it my phone started to flash on and off. As soon as it returned to normal, my downloaded apps were deleted and replaced with Donald Trump’s app ONLY! My music was replaced with his speeches! My pictures were wiped from my phone and replaced with pictures of Donald Trump and pictures of him in a SPEEDO! DISGUSTING! Not only is all of my information compromised, but everything that I used to form my identity is wiped off my phone. I would be remiss if I didn’t write a review to tell other users to NOT USE THIS APP!","date":"2020-07-09T01:29:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174437549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The conserned mom","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded","review":"Took over an hour to load up and asked for sensitive information about me and my kids. Asked where there daycare is and their social. I don’t know about you but that seems like a major safety risk for me and my kids. I would 100% never recommend this app. It scared me so much that I had to be calmed my my significant other until I could finally muster up the courage to get on my phone to delete it. Not only this but after I deleted the app it’s been causing my phone to lag for the past few days... I’m not sure why but I feel like they are trying to steal your info. This entire ordeal was very scary and has left to traumatised. I will never download this app again and will warn others about it.","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:28Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174309248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Poppin pitch","isEdited":false,"title":"A big disappointment 🤢","review":"I was tempted when I first heard of this app. I thought I was gonna see pictures and videos of my favorite person, Donald Duck, but no, they decided to trick me with this deceitful app and decided to show me this strange obese expired orange named donald trump (he deserves no capital letters). Not only does he look like that, he seems to be rotting by each second and I just couldn’t stand looking at that. This isn’t what I wanted. I came to see my favorite duck. Not some withered fruit. Because of seeing such a nasty photo, I’ve become blind from distrust.\nNot to mention there are many bugs in this app. It always crashes and it’s very slow for such an underwhelming app. I HIGHLY do not recommend this app to people. Such a big disappointment. 👎💅🏻💅🏼","date":"2020-07-09T00:40:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174243973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Awesomegamer88","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed","review":"I really wanted to get this app to learn how to be a racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic monster but as soon as I downloaded it, my phone was infected with this virus called “trump 2020” and died. However, before it died, it played an irritatingly loud sound that sounded like “blue lives matter, dems are crooks and liars, the poor deserve to stay poor, only rich people matter” and  so of course my ears fell off and died and it shattered the skulls of everyone within a 10 mile radius. Now, not only do I have to pay the cost of the funerals for my phone and both my ears, I also have to go to the funerals of a bunch of white people who didn’t even have to download this app because they’re already bigoted. Thanks a lot trump. I would give 0 stars if I could.","date":"2020-07-09T00:18:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174162957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hkdlgd","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s horrible","review":"I can’t believe I got this app it is horrible it showed me a picture of the Cheeto man himself and I was not happy showed my mom the picture and her eyeballs came out and now she is in the hospital and then I showed it it to my friend and she is scared for life she can not take back what she saw and now goes to therapy every 2 days for 24 hours. I still can’t believe you guys let an app like this be on here and the most sad one I have is that I am truly disgusted and disappointed in you guys for letting an app like this be here not to mention my dad is now in a coma for how ugly and nasty that picture was.🤢🤮 and it’s disappointing to now that you guys really let an app like this be here🤦🏻\u200D♀️. I would like to talk to your manager.                      sincerely, Karen😡","date":"2020-07-08T23:48:48Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174137583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Edith Grant","isEdited":false,"title":"Filled with idiots","review":"I cannot express the amount of disappointment that I have and all the people who have rated this five stars. They clearly have no mind for themselves and are completely oblivious to the fact that President Trump is a moron. I don’t understand how people can support someone who’s just president because they are a man, I know Hillary wasn’t the best candidate but at least a woman was going to run the country for once in 200 years. Women are just as strong as men and we cannot let this moron keep dictating this country. As soon as opened the app the first thing I got was to receive my location which I do not agree with. Also I received food poisoning because I went to a restaurant that was recommended to me by the app. Would not recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T23:39:16Z","rating":1}}]}
