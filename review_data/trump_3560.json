When I opened the app, my screen just crashed. I was shocked because this app was created by a billionaire. Wouldn’t it make sense if you had so much money that you would put a good amount of money to perfect the app so that your supporters could support you with no problems. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. it crashed several times after opening it again and restarting my phone. It also started making my apps crash. I have an iPhone XR so I know my phone isn’t the problem and I have still 30 GB remaining. My camera app doesn’t work know. THIS IS A TERRIBLE APP.","rating":1,"userName":"you ront know me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:12:09Z"}},{"id":"6176810220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!¡ gave me corona virus🤮🤢","review":"👁👄👁🖕🏼 so when i downloaded this app around 69 days ago it said it needed 1000 GB from my phone📲. but i was curious to see what ✨mr president✨ put on his app so i deleted everything off my phone which barely helped me download it🦥. also i had to use my unemployment money to pay for more storage on my phone and after i did i couldn’t even find one thing i was looking for!1!1!1 stinky stinky!!!! basically the moral of the story is now i have corona virus and it started growing🌱 in my body 69 days ago when i first downloaded the app and now that i cannot help my grandparents the both have rona (if u will) and dementia😿😨🤭😰 DONT DOWNLOAD!

I have plenty of space and I checked, and my internet connection is great, however it took over an hour to download. There were so many glitches that I had  to close and re-open the app about 20 times before I could even put in my mobile phone number. The app itself freezes and shuts off which is extremely frustrating. It even made me sign up multiple times because it kept saying an account with the phone number I used did not exist, but finally after signing up over and over again it let me through.","rating":1,"userName":"coco_chanellewis","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:51:59Z"}},{"id":"6176526182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not get this app!!","review":"I just feel is absolutely necessary to urge to every single soul to never buy this app. It’s a complete and utter waste of time. This app took 14 hours to download and then asked me for my phone number once I got on? Um no. Im not even 18 yet so I pretty sure that’s illegal. I’m addition to this, it caused supernatural hauntings in my house, such as my TVs not being able to stop playing Trumps campaign speeches on repeat🤮 Lastly, this app sucked every bit of soul I had in me out of my body because of how much it made me want to throw up while being on it. Therefore I 10/10 Recommend never buying this app and to remember this when it comes time to vote. Thank you for your time 🥰","rating":1,"userName":"felicia.76637","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:38:47Z"}},{"id":"6176129403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do NOT download, ruined my life","review":"as a democrat, i wanted to see if maybe i should give trump a chance! i wanted to see what all of the republicans were hyped about. needless to say, i was immediately disappointed. the app was FILLED with racist posts, not to mention trumps annoyingly high ego. soon after leaving the app i discovered that all of my contacts were messaged saying “TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸”, and all of my files regarding democratic beliefs were swapped with republican ones. being half white and half cuban myself, i discovered that i had mysteriously become much lighter! because of this app i lost my heritage, and now have a fascist mindset. do NOT download this app unless you want the same to happen to you.","rating":1,"userName":"djhdjdkdjs","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:43:43Z"}},{"id":"6176094917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"he killed my brother","review":"Me and my brother were at a park when trump came by and heard my brother playing roblox and he was playing murder mystery and he hear the knife sound and got so scared with his bitchy white cops bffs and shot him 69 times because of the sound and went into his bunker to hide like the baby he is while his friends shoot my brother and now we are in poverty because of the funeral bills and he made us pay him for being in his presence and for all 69 bullets and we had to pay 1000 per bullet because he wanted to give his cop friends a raise and insulted us by saying speak English because we had la Chona playing and called us beaners because we were eating beans and called us wet backs","rating":1,"userName":"imadumbweeb","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:32:48Z"}},{"id":"6175914089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"!!DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","review":"i cannot stress this enough. i’ve had it with the app. i downloaded the app as a way to support our 100% non misogynistic, non racist, non homophobic president but have come to the fact that it ruined my life!! non only did it take WEEKS to download but it used all my monthly data and basically wiped out my phone! it took my photos and passwords and i had nothing left other than the trump app and some of the necessary apps. i am baffled by the way it is still up and running as if it didn’t just take all of my information!! please do NOT download. it was a complete waste of my time and was in no way helpful to me as a real trump supporter. all i have to say is no❤️","rating":1,"userName":"trumps toupee😿","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:34:09Z"}},{"id":"6175792216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"!!!!","review":"My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible. You just watched a TTI, on Disney Channel","rating":1,"userName":"isabelle 😌","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:53:24Z"}},{"id":"6175618155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolute worst app to ever exist","review":"This Trump app is racist, homophobic and disgusting. I downloaded it and it asked for all my personal information including my social. After I opted out of giving them more personal info, they immediately started calling me, and I don’t even know how they had my number. They called everyday and would not leave me alone. It was like I was being stalked. After a few weeks, the calls stopped but then a group of angry giants came to my house and said they were there on behalf of the trump administration. They kept on dancing around my house and said they wouldn’t stop until I gave Trump what he wanted. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I haven’t had peace since I downloaded it","rating":1,"userName":"anon1836492","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:53:01Z"}}]}
