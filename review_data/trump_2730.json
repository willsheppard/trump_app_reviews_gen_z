There’s everything wrong with it. You’re supporting a racist reincarnation of Hitler. He cares more about money and how he looks than he’ll ever care about America and the lives in it. Stop supporting this dude. If you don’t like black people because one shot your ex’s brothers girlfriends aunts son then okay fine, but that doesn’t mean go to a person of authority who’d rather kill every single black person than help them to stop crime rates and better themselves. It’s seriously disgusting. I’d rather a karen tell me to go to another country than someone of power shooting me on site because of the color of my skin. If you’re supporting this racist pedo, then you're just as bad as the app.","rating":1,"userName":"ACAB ANON","title":"Stop","date":"2020-07-09T00:57:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174344974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"because of this app, i can’t fathom looking at anything orange anymore. the information along with the pictures are so contradicting of each other it’s so confusing. like it would state “good” and then “news” it’s a whole oxymoron!! like is it good or bad? i’ve gone through decades of education and HAVE NOT cheated on any assignment, yet the face of this app wouldn’t be where he is right now if he hadn’t cheated on a SAT. very bad role model for children and potentially teaches them how to be a bad kid. parents shouldn’t be on this app because the behavior it sets for adults is unacceptable. if all the adults start acting like what this app is telling them to, the world will be chaos! very horrible development, set up, background music, slogo🤢, just absolutely garbage.","rating":1,"userName":"wumbotito","title":"don’t waste ur time","date":"2020-07-09T00:52:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174240481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to follow the brave and amazing leader selected for Americans to be proud to have. However, I was met with a humiliating reality. This app is faulty. Instead of seeing a good old commander in chief, I saw some sick sick perverted disgusting fan art of Chester the Cheetah. I am revolted! But I thought I would give it a fighting chance. Boy, was I offended! I told my husband James that I had never seen such blatant racism and hatred in my life! I’ve been on this earth for 53 years and never have I ever seen such a vile app. So I closed it out. Then, I go to my photos to see the pictures of my precious newborn grandson. ALL OF HIS PICTURES WERE NOW DELETED AND REPLACED WITH A PICTURE OF THIS CHESTER THE CHEETAH ABOMINATION. THEN I OPENED SAFARI AND THERE WAS ONE HUNDRED PAGES OPEN OF FURRY PORN. DISGRACEFUL!  If I could give this app half a star, I would.","rating":1,"userName":"queso mermaid","title":"Disgusted and Disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T00:17:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173952896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"No, I didn’t even open the app yet and a virus showed up on every device in my house, now I’m in trouble because we have to throw away all of our electronics and get new ones. I say I get a refund for all the apps I’ve ever bought. Also when mr Cheeto man was on the tv my dog got scared and passed out I truly believe that we should not have to pay for the Vet bills it was mr Cheetos fault so he should pay for it, anyway my microwave also got a virus and exploded along with my house we got out just in time but my fish didn’t😞 (RIP miss Fish) am I so hurt, mr Cheeto should also be paying for the funeral. Then we got home from the funeral, I plugged in my cat and went to bed when I woke up my cat WAS NOT CHARGED TO 100 PERCENT! I am furious!!!!!!!!!! So in conclusion I give this app a BIG FAT 1 star.","rating":1,"userName":"me👍🏻🤘🏻","title":"👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173871966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened the app I saw a middle aged man getting painted orange 😳 at first I thought I was looking at an oversized Cheeto but I realized it was a human😱 his spray tanner really doin him dirty😔 as soon as I hit the screen a picture of Trump and a little girl😯 popped up, I was horrified at what I saw😰I then clicked the screen again and saw a picture of a 🍆 that was equivalent to the size of a newborn baby👶 or even smaller.🤭 I didn’t know who it was until I figured it was Trump🤯not to mention it was orange, like one of those dyslexic Cheetos that are just a small clump of the cheese✨ never will I go onto this app and be further traumatized than I already have been😡 we are smarter🤓 and hotter🥵 so stop making us mad🥰✨😘🌸🧚\u200D♀️ the 🍆 that I saw made me embarrassed to be in this country😔","rating":1,"userName":"ToothpasteEater9000","title":"I’m scarred😔🖐","date":"2020-07-08T22:00:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173680846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay for starters this app is horrible it took forever to download and made my phone shut off so it gets one start second of all if you seriously agree with what your president says you are one of the dumbest people ever you seriously support this 🍊 he’s made this country so much worse he doesn’t care about what happens to us he only cares about himself... but either ways I have reserved tickets to his rallies and unfortunately I have promised my pet unicorn I would go but him a leprechaun that day 😥 and I also have to go to a quince 🇲🇽that day so I will not be attending to his rally over all like I said this app is horrible and bad for the turtles so if you wanna save the turtles please don’t download this app.. sksksskksks and I oop 🐢😌✌️-gen Z for the win❤️","rating":1,"userName":"kim Ks 🍑🍑","title":"My pet turtle","date":"2020-07-08T20:49:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173612768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS THE MOST TERRIBLE APP IVE EVER LAID EYES ON. as soon as i opened this app, my phone burst into flames, causing irreversible damage. the flames caught onto almost everything i own.  now, because of the president, my cat has died. along with all my relatives as well as my house. i truly don’t know what to do!

I later cried for 2 days. When I re opened the app I found the orange was back trying to hit on me! I cried again for two days out of pure fear. I tried deleting the app but it just wouldn’t go, so i left it alone. I come back to find it swarmed my whole house with bugs forcing me and my family to leave the country. Last time I opened the app I see a video of these old whit people telling me to vote for an orange! I said no, obviously but i scroll a bit to see poor innocent people in cages, the orange being racist, the orange making fun of disabled people, and him saying he’s more sexually attracted to his daughter than his wife!
