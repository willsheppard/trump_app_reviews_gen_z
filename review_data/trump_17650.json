I was expecting something incredible but instead i left and deleted it with disappointment. I do not want anyone to go through what my family and i went through so i strongly encourage for this app to sadly be removed.

I truly believe that our wonderful president with his gorgeous spray tan deserves much better than this terrible app. I was so excited to download the app and support what we Trump supporters act like is our god, but the app kept shutting down my phone and crashing. President Trump would never approve something as terrible as this. 🇺🇸Trump 2020🇺🇸","date":"2020-07-09T21:11:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6178180271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Le0nardthem4n","review":"I’d give it 0 stars if I could. I got this app to educate myself and only found awful adds and disgusting views. I thought the left was lying about trumps views to make him sound bad, but he truly is an awful man who only thinks of himself! The app looked disgusting and gave me stupid adds for mercy that I didn’t want every 5 seconds.","date":"2020-07-09T20:44:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Format and disgusting and the content is worse"}},{"id":"6178178529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Pooplover27","review":"I brought my child to this restaurant and he ordered Mac and cheese. Then the waitress threw my son across the room screaming trump 2020 🙀✨✨✨✨✨❄️❄️and then I downloaded the app. This app had naked people all over the home screen. I feel violated that this app exists. My son was on my phone and opened the app. HE SAW ALL THE NAKED PEOPLE. I just feel attacked because of my self esteem but it was right to the meet of my friends. 🌬🌬✨✨✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T20:43:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BAnAnA 🍌"}},{"id":"6178169378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tibblestheclown","review":"I downloaded this app excited to see what it held. I was incredibly disappointed by the formatting and how SLOW it is. I can barely navigate a single thing! You would think our president would give us something special and worth while. This is the complete opposite.

There’s no sensible flow to any of it. Not to mention it eats up your phones battery. And shuts down for no apparent reason. It also asks for way too much personal information, and doesn’t give details to his rallies. Plus there’s a whole thing for Latinos for trump? Heck no, get them out of here. This is an app for the superiors.","date":"2020-07-09T20:27:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No stars if I could"}},{"id":"6178122068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cuh 400 crip gang","review":"This app almost killed me. I was driving and using the gps and the app open up by itself and didn’t allow me to take my turn on time.

Since trumpy is trying to take away our app, tik tok, we will take away his app, whatever this trash is. Please if you see this and can vote, go vote to get this orange Cheeto puff man trash blob nugget out of office before he does anymore damage to this already horrible country.
