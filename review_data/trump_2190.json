First, I waited almost 2 years for it to download. When it finally did, Trump himself jumped out of the screen, called me fat and ugly, and then proceeded to steal everything from my home. Now I live in an empty house and I have to sleep on the ground with the rats!!!! Even worse, as he was leaving he grabbed all my stuffed animals, stomped on them, and ate them. After all of that, he had the audacity to spray paint my whole house orange bc he “was insecure about being the only huge orange thing around.” After he left I opened the app again only to see that it hacked my whole phone!!! Now the only thing my phone does is say racist/homophobic/sexist/Islamophobic words and yell at people for wearing masks!!!","userName":"megan1566","date":"2020-07-09T09:20:24Z","title":"Disgusting 0/10","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175592254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I thought that my perspective might have been a little shallow so I got this app to shed some light but all it did was TERRIFY me. Let me go into some detail- the second I got this my tv turned on and I thought that might have been someone else in my house but I checked and they were all asleep. I went to turn it off but it started BLARING “make America great again” and I just about pooped myself in fear. I’m shaking just writing this I hope to GOD you guys don’t get this I feel like I was cursed. You might think I’m being dramatic but I swear my family WOULDNT WAKE UP. I took a video and was gonna post it because I thought it could wake some mindless people up but it was WIPED the next day. Please pray for me I don’t want to be cursed for eternal damnation it was scarier in person","userName":"Eagekfbdkfn","date":"2020-07-09T07:43:42Z","title":"I feel like I opened a portal to hell","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175557088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The UI is completely unintelligible, it took DAYS to download, I get an ad (and yes I did time this using an atomic clock) every .08 nanoseconds. It also botched the Coronavirus situation so badly that we’re stuck for much longer than the rest of the world, shut down the government in a hissy fit, has threatened the education department MULTIPLE TIMES, locked children away from their parents in concentration camps with no regard for human rights, violated the first amendment rights of peaceful protestors to take a photo of itself holding the in front of a church it doesn’t go to, given racists and bigots and crazy conspiracy theorists more credibility than they ever should have, and generally been a hateful, spiteful, and arrogant excuse of an app who’s still only trying to feel young as its dementia starts to kick in.","userName":"Half_nerd","date":"2020-07-09T07:30:41Z","title":"Jesus Christ, this app is awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175494030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was curious about this app as so many Karens seem to love it. I’ve heard all my neighborhood Karens talking about this Trump app being amazing...so I decided to check it out, not even seconds into opening this app, I was extremely disappointed and offended by the layout of such app. First off Trump asked me for my phone number to “text me” “updates” and I was shook because he already has a wife. The app gave off racist, homophobic, narcissistic, creepy vibes. I ran a vibe check by popular demand. After thorough investigation on this app, the Trump app did not pass the vibe check, in fact, this app failed the vibe check so much that it was the lowest score I’ve seen in a vibe check in history.\nThe app also made my phone crash 666 times so do what you will with that information.","userName":"nicholeforeverr","date":"2020-07-09T07:06:28Z","title":"VIBE CHECK: NOT PASSED","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174978440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! first of all, it took so long to even get my phone to start working after i downloaded it. my phone kept powering itself off like every 2 minutes. nothing would fix it and it got to the point that i had to go to the apple store and buy a whole new phone. that is ridiculous. you would think for a president of the united states, there would be a better app than this. i’m very disappointed. secondly, once i deleted the app, it would not go off of my home screen. now i have this trash app just sitting on my phone, taking up storage, and i don’t even want to use it because it broke my first phone. i don’t have time to write any more, but believe me, there were plenty more bad things about this app. do not download.","userName":"itsuki sumeragi","date":"2020-07-09T04:00:47Z","title":"she like papi i adore u😈😉😘✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174901861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I’ve never been more disappointed in a president since Andrew Jackson!!!.This Oompa Loompa bullheaded orange shrimp junk shell of a man has completely wrecked my experience as an American teenager. Not only has he made this country worse but his presidency has brought my self esteem down and my “pride” as being an American teen. He’s a racist buffoon who is lacking grammar skills, even my six-year-old sister can spell better than him. I don’t know how he’s able to run a country when he can’t even control his own family. I swear to all that is holy if this man gets reinstated I will go back to Africa better yet I don’t know...I’ll do anything to not let this man be president. I’ll start rebellion/movement  if I must I can’t be in this country for another four years as him being president.
