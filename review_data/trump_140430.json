I downloaded and was on there for about 5 minutes. As soon as I went on a different app, my phone started glitching and pictures of our president started showing up on my screen. I went to the apple store a couple hours later in the day to see if i could get my phone fixed. it didn’t work out and the photos kept popping up. i went home and noticed that i was feeling a little dizzy and nauseous. my parents then started complaining too and they were around my phone. we went to the hospital and got tested for the covid-19. turns out we had just recently - as in that day - got the coronavirus. we asked our doctors what gave us it and they told us if we were around anything. we said no but then i realized that i had been around my phone and so had my parents so i asked them to check my phone. low and behold it was infected with something. honestly i believe that it was the pictures of trump that set it off. so yeah this app is gonna get a 1 star review 🙂","date":"2020-07-10T04:53:10Z","userName":"ch3eto lookin president"}},{"id":"6179506403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING","review":"So this app took forever to download 🙄. after it asked me for my personal information including my camera roll I said yes and then soon I went through my camera roll I had all of these pictures of are terribly spray tanned 🥕president with a few strands of hair on his mindless skull And I don’t about you but who wants to walk up to that face in there camera roll DISGUSTING!!!!! 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND 🥴✊🏾🤮","date":"2020-07-10T04:53:10Z","userName":"kdimmick"}},{"id":"6179506417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","review":"This app is terrible it needs to be deleted.","date":"2020-07-10T04:53:10Z","userName":"juls$$$$$"}},{"id":"6179506405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible..... just horrible all around horrible app this app is probably the WORST app on the whole app store i DO NOT Recommend downloading it!!!","date":"2020-07-10T04:53:10Z","userName":"datashia123"}},{"id":"6179506245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"App Rating","review":"This app runs super slow. When I opened the app it took forever to load so I sat there for what felt like forever. Once I died and came back to life the first screen finally decided to finish loading. I tried to enter in my phone number to register and it wouldn’t let me. Probably bc I’m black, you know how trump is. Also the slogan that the app read “Keep America Great” I don’t understand it. When was America ever great ? This country is literally built off racism. Anyway this app is probably the worst I’ve ever downloaded and interacted with. I’m deleting the app as soon I finish writing this review. 0 out of 10 would not recommend this app for anyone, well..for America.","date":"2020-07-10T04:53:07Z","userName":"dlkd2020"}}]}
