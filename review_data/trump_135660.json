TERRIBLE APP. TOO MANY GLITCHES. they at least need to have a manager on standby to help with these problems!!!","userName":"NickyEnoch","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134296160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE🤢🤢","date":"2020-06-29T03:34:15Z","review":"I downloaded this app so I can support my aMaZiNg president🥴buttttt when it asked for my number it spammed me with messages and it almost made my phone shut down.😡 I do not recommend this app to ANYONE and as a devoted Christian ⛪️ I rEaLly am sad to have to write this sad review but it is the truth. 😖When my daughter, Angie, opened the app in her phone she said it was also just stupid and he should have at least picked better colors for the theme. If for whatever reason I download this app again I will make sure to look for improvements. I can’t say I had REALLY high expectations but I was expecting better. Like I said before if you don’t want your phone to shut down from ALOT of messages from a number that you don’t really know who is texting from a advise you not to download this app and to just remove trump from your life altogether. I also was REALLY looking forward to going to the latest trump event that was alllllllll over the news butttt I had to water my dog’s poop. I hope I can come along next time with my 100000 member family and that there is nothing to stop us. I will like to thank my daughter and my son for helping me see the light and for helping me get rid of the tacky app. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Like I said before I am a Christian and I think that I should be able to carry a gun if I want to🔫🔫(*𝓫𝓪𝓷𝓰 𝓫𝓪𝓷𝓰*) but I do not like this president nor this app anymore. Thank you for taking your time and reading this. I hope our next president does not look like a Cheeto puff but also is just better in general.😬Love ya❤️","userName":"OreoReviews","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134295543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Really bad","date":"2020-06-29T03:33:58Z","review":"Really bad app, very glitchy, slow, and has constant malfunctions.it asked for my phone number and as soon as I put it in I got SO MANY SPAM CALLS.
