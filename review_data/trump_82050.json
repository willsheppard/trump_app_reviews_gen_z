As soon as I opened the app it all went downhill after that. Spammed my phone with ads to vote for him in November and to buy his poorly designed merchandise. I mean who wouldn’t wanna support a anti homophobic, pro choice, anti racist, women positive man right?? And it’s an added plus that he has an exotic spray tan that he looks like he was in a accident at the Cheeto factory 😍😍. This app has so much propaganda about other candidates which was not nice of him 😡. Also was told I should vote for him even tho I have democratic views. It gets worse...I was told that if I didn’t vote for him I’m not for the American people. I was told via the thousands of spam calls if I didn’t vote for him they would do what they done to Jeffrey Epstein to me. They even started messaging me with my address asking “this you?” I felt so unsafe 😣😣. I’m honestly scared to walk outside like people of color and anyone LGBTQ+ people feel cause of their racist and homophobic president and his supporters. They threatened to also lock me in cages with all the other people who didn’t vote for him like they do with people who are just trying to make a better life for themselves and their family here. Very scared deleted the app immediately. Maybe someone will read this and open their eyes as to what this man has done. He has people trying to cross the border and has them put in cages as if they are animals they are treated horribly and a lot of the children mysteriously go missing (I’m sure he has nothing to do with that or how they went missing 🙄) People of color are suppressed in this “free” country and the president refuses to do anything about it besides tweet something highly racist. He’s homophobic and poses as if he’s not. Making it absolutely fine for people in healthcare to refuse service because of their sexual orientation. This man is horrible and honestly a threat to everyone as if these issues aren’t a big thing already seems as if he’s only making them worse. He wants to silence the youth but we are the future. We will be heard.","userName":"Beagle543$88","rating":1,"title":"Gives me bad vibes 🥱","date":"2020-07-09T08:10:33Z"}},{"id":"6175630268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i got this app and as soon as i opened it, it said that i had 7 days. 7 DAYS FOR WHAT AND TO TOP IT OFF IT STARTED PLAYING NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP NOW THAT GOT ME FUMING","userName":"beach coconuts","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T07:57:28Z"}},{"id":"6175596518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I tried to use the app but it glitched out","userName":"jjrobinson1104","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T07:45:14Z"}},{"id":"6175594812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"if i could give this app 10 stars i would !! but since i can’t i’ll just give them all ... separately 😉 one. by. one ! thanks so much biden 🥰","userName":"amaraiya1","rating":1,"title":"best app on the store.","date":"2020-07-09T07:44:36Z"}}]}
