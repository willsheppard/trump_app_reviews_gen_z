It’s filled with adds and it makes you accidentally tap on them only to take you to a website that’s filled with spams and viruses!!!

Really disappointed tbh. Also not to mention this app SMELLS SO BAD LIKE HUN SPRAY SOME AIR FRESHENER MY GAWD.  It was very glitchy, smelly, ugly, and there was hair all over the app. I would give it a zero if I could. Take down the app, and don’t forget #savebarronmelania2020         👁👄👁✌️","userName":"anxiety_girl😔✌️","date":"2020-07-08T22:16:27Z","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173910625","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app was full of bugs and too top it off a scary Cheeto man popped on my screen. I was scared for my friends and family I can’t believe that apple allowed such scary and unholy images on a platform that have kids on it. And it’s teaching the young that having a horrible spray tan is okay. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS INJUSTICE THIS APP NEEDS TO LEAVE FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO MIGHT COME UPON THIS APP","userName":"badbitchbonny","date":"2020-07-08T22:14:48Z","title":"👁👅👁","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173905126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i didn’t expect much when i downloaded this app but once i logged in it was just too much false information. yet i had hopes for it and now i have 4 seats reserved for his next rally...to bad i have to take my fish for a walk that day.","userName":"33ella33","date":"2020-07-08T22:12:47Z","title":"False information❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173900512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is awful. It’s ran by an orange child rapist. It disgusts me that anyone would vote for him. This app should be taken down because it’s vile. Who would let a child rapist, predator, incestuous pervert be president? And while they’re at it make an app? Awful. I would give it a 0 star review if it were possible.","userName":"Foles74","date":"2020-07-08T22:11:05Z","title":"Awful","isEdited":false}}]}
