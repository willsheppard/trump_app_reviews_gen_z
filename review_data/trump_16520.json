A few days package in the mail and it was a bottle, I didn’t order a bottle. Two weeks later I have the corona virus. Is it a coincidence? I think not!! Download at your own risk!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:39:00Z"}},{"id":"6174681492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE","userName":"Alysa V","rating":1,"review":"This app is one of the worst things I’ve ever come across. It is an attractive and tasteless app layout not to mention it glitches and doesn’t work. Also the app supports a racist, homophobic, transphobic businessman who is ruining America more than it already is. I don’t know why anyone would want this app, honestly it should be removed from the app store because of how incredibly repulsive it is.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:31:26Z"}},{"id":"6174670229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"So slow!","userName":"ftysahihyd","rating":1,"review":"The app is so glitchy it’s embarrassing. Drains all of your battery and it even started slowing down my phone. Not only is the app poorly made but it also looks as if a team consisting of toddlers made it. And to top it all off the minute I opened the app it’s starting calling me racial slurs and tells me to go back to my country!! If I could 0 stars, this app convinced me to never vote for trump!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:28:09Z"}},{"id":"6174658791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is stupid!","userName":"Tukin 28ts","rating":1,"review":"Ever since I opened this app and presses yes for the notifications, I HAVE BEEN GETTING NOTIFICATIONS NONSTOP! This is absolutely crazy and distracting! I hate this dumb app especially because of how much of personal information you have to give out to log into the app, I don’t like it at all and and ever since I’ve been getting all these notifications, my phone has not been working!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:51Z"}},{"id":"6174641233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Great President, terrible app🤷🏼","userName":"Jamésito","rating":1,"review":"I just bought the new iPhone 11 Pro Max expecting huge upgrades such as speeds, camera, quality, color, etc. I downloaded this app because Donald is awesome, however, it did slow down my phone quite a bit. Very weird how big of an impact it has had on these speeds, I feel as though it has been cut at least in half.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:19:49Z"}},{"id":"6174576364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Complete disappointment!","userName":"MaggieMB711","rating":1,"review":"Now I don’t consider myself a Karen but I am so disappointed in this app that it made me become a democrat! My phone has been so slow and acting all weird since I got the app. I think it has a virus attached to it!! I wanted to put it to a test so I deleted the app and all of a sudden my phone was fine!

However, when I launched this app it was very much not and epic gamer moment and I was shocked as to why a cheese puff was advertised. My glow in the dark cat ears headband almost fell off because of the shock I was in.
