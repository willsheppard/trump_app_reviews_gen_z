When I opened the app a orange man appeared. Suddenly I was overloaded with this horrible feeling. Almost a game over for me. It started with my eyes turning orange, then I started to sweat peppermint extract, my legs exploded with confetti, my hair started to turn into cheese, and worst of all my skin turned into paper towel. That only happened to me. My sister who was sitting next to me fell over and pooped herself (yikes!). Then my house started to fill up with vanilla sprite!! I took me and my sister out and when I was going to call ur mom my phone dissolved into sand. Right now I am writing this in my head and sending my brainwaves to my step uncle, who was twice removed. Hopefully he can upload my tragedies","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Smh my head 😔"}},{"id":"6174141016","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ali pop11","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:32Z","review":"one day this app literally popped up on my phone with no explanation. i opened it and immediately after all of my 69 fish passed away. shortly after my very own hammerhead shark banged his head into the glass until he died after seeing how ugly the app is. my 420 pet beetles also mysteriously passed away. this trend continued with my frogs, wooly mammoths, anteaters, and dodo birds. in hopes of being able to delete the app i found a remedy for my phone on the black web. following the instructions exactly i lit 10 candles, turned all of the lights off in my bathroom, and said “uh-oh stinky” three times with my eyes closed, turning around each time. suddenly a stinky orange man showed up in my bathroom drenched in idiot juice and started telling me all of this random stuff. when i gave him\na mike tyson uppercut from hell he fell back and died! the app was deleted and my animals were all revived from the dead. i’m afraid if i had the app had stayed on my phone longer i would’ve died! overall, the app is deadly and and only for morons. safe downloading everyone 😃","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"almost killed me and my tarantulas!!"}},{"id":"6174056971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Abril Avila","date":"2020-07-08T23:09:47Z","review":"So the second I downloaded this app my pet unicorn killed me with its horn. So then i went downstairs to ride my pet rhino to dominos to get some tacos but they sold out. And then i opened the app to vote but then... the dominos workers started floating and said “🅃🅁🅄🄼🄿 2020😻✨, ᗷᑌT ᗰᗩKᗴ IT 𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡😼🧚🏼✨”. So then I called the police but big orange man came and started levitating and then he teleported me home. I was like “ok?” and i plugged in my table so i could eat it for breakfast the next day. I woke up and went to mcdonalds and ordered a mcwhopper with a side of onion rings (from burger king btw). And i opened the app on my phone and the app ate my food. I deleted the app... i am traumatized to this day and my mom sends me to therapy 3 months each week. Do not recommend, the end.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND😀😾"}},{"id":"6174037331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"badgiahe","date":"2020-07-08T23:02:12Z","review":"i downloaded this app hoping to see something about politics, but instead it completely glitched out and started saying “ The FitnessGram PACER Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.\nThe test is used to measure a student's aerobic capacity as part of the FitnessGram assessment.

As soon as I downloaded it my phone electrocuted me and then wouldn’t stop playing music! The music then attracted a swarm of bees to surround my house. The bees then carried my house away and are still carrying it as we speak. I tried deleting it, but then my phone froze and the music changed which then attracted bugs to come from underground and they tried to take my phone away from me and take it to 🍊. After that Mr. Orange tried to hack my phone by putting spray tan and wig adds all over my phone. But, anyways you should rate this app one star and take it down that way 🍊 can’t have his cursed little app anymore.

But much to my surprise the app took forever to download and when it did wouldn’t even open for more than a few seconds! That wasn’t even the worst part because as time went on I started to notice that my skin was changing color 😣. At first I thought it was because I was getting a tan so I felt cool but then it started to take more of an orange complexion 🍊. It got so bad that my family thought I got a spray tan and got me in trouble 🤬! I was forced to delete the app and only then did my complexion go back to normal. So giving y’all a warning before I go DONT DOWNLOAD unless you fancy an orange tone on your skin ✨.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Scarred for life 😭"}},{"id":"6173512597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Aisha cas77","date":"2020-07-08T19:50:20Z","review":"there are way to many things wrong with this app 😐first of all when i opened it my phone started glitching a LOT and i started to get hacked and then my phone shut down and then a dumb orange guy popped up on my screen and i was TERRIFIED. then you know i finally got into the app✨✨ and and it was the worst thing i’ve ever seen in my life and i’ve seen a dead rat so that should say something 😬😬 third, the app took like 6 days to download and usually the my apps take like a minute tops to download 😒😒anyways i’m to lazy to write the rest cuz there are WAY to many things that are wrong with this app and i’m not gonna waste more seconds of my life writing about this racist orange’s terrible app. fanks for reading luv 🕺✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP AND EVEN WORSE PRESIDENT✨💅🏼"}}]}
