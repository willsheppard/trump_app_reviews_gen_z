I downloaded this app to only found out that it’s full of viruses and is cursed. 😤When I opened the app, I found that all the chairs in my house were floating and forming ‘TRUMP2020’ 😳I am now scared and hiding under my fridge. When I opened the app, my dog began turning orange and started to look like a Cheeto👁👄👁. Horrified I rushed to the vet and only found that it was run by big Cheeto man. 😞Big Cheeto man then proceeded to spray tan himself naked and now me and my dog have no eyeballs. 🥵I am writing this review on my toaster with voice message.😭😭 This app is a danger to the planet and should immediately be deleted. 😊I have several hospital bills that need to be covered and I seem to be living in a Cheeto dimension. If my reviews reached the other dimensions I just want you all to know that this app is cursed and will blow your phone up with mini trump people🥺👉🏻👈🏻. My phone could not take it and ended up committing suicide by jumping off my house😿. YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANY OF THIS PLAY-OUT. I BEG YOU ALL TO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. 😞EVEN AFTER DELETING THIS HORRIFIC APP I STILL SEE THE MINI-TRUMP PEOPLE WHO CONSTANTLY YELL AT MY COUCH PILLOWS AND CALL THEM RACIST.😭😭💀","userName":"No jam jimin -👄-"}},{"id":"6173942770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i’m revolted !!!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:26:38Z","rating":1,"review":"if i could give this app zero stars i would !!! \n\nfirst off \nso i said🗣 to her, angelina👱🏼\u200D♀️👩🏼\u200D🦰, i want😩to i really🥺really🥺 want to👨\u200D👩\u200D👦\u200D👦. but ❌what about brad🧔? he’s like a son 👨\u200D👦to me👕👔. you’re a good 👍😻man🧑\u200D🦲👣👅 i know 🧠i know👁👃 *buzz* ⏰⏲📺come in! 🚪one 👆direction↙️⬆️⤵️ are here 👊to see 👀🦷you💋who?🧐🤨one ☝️direction↖️↪️⬅️? they’re making 👋👏their new🦿⚗️ movie🎞📽📸? shall ⌛️🥴i send 👽them in? 🤧sure😄☺️! i love ❤️👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩new 💥movies!📽🖥 they’re 👥here 👇the real✍️📡🔌super 🎇stars!🌟💫⭐️the biggest 🌫😯band 🎤🥁🎸🎺🎼on the planet!🌍🪐alright 🍌🍊they 🤤are!

Ok if the app is having  trouble understanding this I’ll explain it for you, ok app so basically imagine there is a house on fire in a neighbourhood but there aren’t really any other houses on fire, so which house does the fire department help, the one on fire! While the other houses do matter the one fire matters the most right now because it has burning for a while now and we want to help put it out. The other thing this app was doing was it was just sooooo annoying like it kept saying racist stuff towards the Chinese just because of corona, now corona did start in China that is a fact, BUT it doesn’t give the app an excuse to be racist towards all Asians, just because a really bad sickness happened there doesn’t mean that it is the Asians fault! Like if the app is just being really rude and stuff to people because they’re Asian use COVID as an excuse doesn’t make it not racism. Ugh this app just makes me so annoyed please take this app off the App Store it doesn’t respect the user. ❤️","userName":"Blm❤️❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6177781244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why do you have to be 17?","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:35:09Z","rating":1,"review":"I understand if this was for voting or something that requires a legal commitment for the person to be 18. This is to find out more information about our president and his campaign. This is in no way legally binding. It is saying that our youth who want to be informed and knowledgeable about our government can’t learn because they aren’t old enough. It is the same as putting an ad on Facebook to know if you are going to be voting for him and only accepting the answer if it is yes or maybe. Nothing can be said against him otherwise they won’t count it. While I believe he has done good things for our country, he has also made it worse. The racist, sexist and ignorant comments, tweets and posts are not acceptable for the president of the United States. The comments that were said before being elected are one thing, to continue with those thoughts are not. Being a citizen of the US gives us the ability to disagree with our government and have the righty and privilege to change things. Let’s make this country better than it has been for quite some time!","userName":"teenunhappywithtrump"}},{"id":"6177772744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Run...","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:32:34Z","rating":1,"review":"Yes you heard me, get as far away from this nauseating, petrifying, fraudulent scheme of a application... From the beginning I had a feeling that downloading this app would kick my pathetic life downhill, a treacherous steep hill. YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND! I lost my job, my family, my respect... I even lost my oxygen privileges. I guess my house found out i downloaded this bellow substandard mess, because it burnt itself down. i don’t blame it... i wouldn’t want to be the house of one who downloaded the devilish software. I lost everything to that blaze including my signed nicki minaj poster. No one can look at me the same anymore. I wouldn’t trust them either if they got this vile program. I don’t want to recall all the horrors that were stored in that little monster. We’re would I even start... Maybe i’d begin with the Cardi B music or the Beverly Hills chihuahuas sex tape. I shouldn’t be speaking about this anymore because i’ll be reminded of the ____. I can’t mention it or else i’ll have to hire a new therapist (the other one was to scared of me). Well I must go now to morn my fish, but take my advice or else suffer the consequences.","userName":"cadewhoelse"}},{"id":"6177366502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app killed me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:27:34Z","rating":1,"review":"when i opened the app i dropped my phone bc the very startling image of a extra large crispy cheeto puff was displayed across my screen. said cheeto puff had startling me so much i needed to go to the hospital as i started having heart palpitations. laying in the hospital gasping for breath, as i had seen the literal pits of hell on my phone, i started to have delusions that this XXL cheeto puff was in the hospital with me! then, he started hugging our black tiktok king lil huddy!! and just when i thought it couldnt get any worse, the cheeto puff and lil huddy began to do the renegade together while hundreds of!! my heart started to hurt so badly i thought i was going to die from pure and utter fear. and then i did die. that’s right, the sight of this cheeto puff induced such an awful reaction in my body it caused literal hallucinations and ended my life. the only reason i am able to type this review is because the love of my life spencer reid had decided to tell my story, just like eliza in hamilton. it’s me, i’m hamilton. i hope the creators of this app and the cheeto puff are happy...you turned me into hamilton and my sweet spencer into eliza 😡😡😡😡😡😡","userName":"gabriella660"}},{"id":"6177094619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ruined my phone","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:10:29Z","rating":1,"review":"I honestly downloaded this app so that I could see our presidents plans for the future and to support him, not to follow “gen z’s” plan to get it deleted. I never expected for this to happen but, after downloading the app my phone started acting strange. My battery would die way faster than normal and I noticed pictures in my photo album were being DELETED. Then, I noticed that advertisements on my social media would appeal to things I had talked about while talking on the phone. My phone has never done anything strange (it’s a brand new iphone 11) and I couldn’t figure out what the source was until I remembered I downloaded this app. I tried to delete it but it would still be on my phone and wouldn’t go away. I think this app might be a VIRUS or the government is using it to STEAL OUR INFORMATION and listen in on our PRIVATE lives (explains the deleted photos and advertisements). I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in my president and I hope the problem isn’t with the app, since I can’t delete it off my phone. I would love to know if anyone else had this experience. :(((","userName":"Omg.emmav"}},{"id":"6176705463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely Infuriated.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:26:53Z","rating":1,"review":"Noticed this app and decided to show my support for the 2020 election. After they asked for my phone number and home address I got a little suspicious... But I went along with it hoping it was just part of the voting process. The next day I woke up to texts not only from the app but from telemarketers and spammers. My phone was ringing every ten minutes and it was extremely frustrating to use my phone. A couple days letter I was getting letters sent to my home saying that that the foundation was dipping into my bank account without my consent. I immediately deleted the app and hoped that it would all end. But no. My phone started glitching- not letting my type on my keyboard and kept on sending me to the app on the AppStore to redownload it. I was sure that my phone was getting hacked. I had to send my phone to apple for two weeks to get it fixed. The amount of time, money, and energy this app has cost me is ASTRONOMICAL. It was WAY too much. All that being said, if you still decide to show your support for Trump, show it on a different platform. This app is trash.","userName":"Mackenzie Hawk"}},{"id":"6176656576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP!!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:14:00Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app as a way to cheer on my totally non-racist, feminist, people loving president. However, once I downloaded this app my phone automatically started playing the national anthem at FULL volume with no way to turn it off. Don’t get me wrong, I like this country and it’s national anthem, but my phone has been blasting the Star Spangled banner for almost 6 days now on repeat. I haven’t been able to leave my house or go anywhere anymore because of the constant screeching that escapes my phone’s speakers. I’ve had to call in sick to work for almost a week now because I can’t leave home without my phone, but now I can’t leave my house because of the consistent music THAT JUST WONT TURN OFF. I have done everything, I fully reset my phone and deleted the app, BUT IT WONT STOP. I know that it’s because of this app because the music started as soon as I opened it for the first time. It’s been playing on repeat ever since. DO NOT download this app, unless you enjoy the constant reminder that you are in America and this is how you will be forced to live from that day forward.","userName":"Prertyproncess040"}},{"id":"6176472938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scariest experience EVER","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:24:11Z","rating":1,"review":"So I obviously downloaded the app because I am republican and love my NON racist, homophobic, sexist, and all of the above president ( Love you donny ❤️🥺 ) However my love for him slowly started to fade when I downloaded this app .. it for one took FOREVER to download and when It did I was asked to put in my phone number and email 😤🤬 I was so confused as to why that was needed but I obviously didn’t question MY president 😻 so I did it, that night I started getting A LOT 😰 of emails and phone calls, I was simply try to sleep so I could wake up a beautiful trump supporter in the morning 🤗 but instead not only was I distracted by the calls and emails I got a knock on my door. I opened to door and it was one of trumps secret agents ( gasp * ) 😲🤠 they told me they were taking me to work for trump, while I did appreciate the opportunity that was just not something I wanted. But I didn’t have a choice 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 they took me away to the BUNKER ( another gasp * ) 🤪 but me being the amazing smart person I am 😎 I escaped 😌 to tell this story today. So if your aren’t a amazing spy 😜😜 don’t download this app 😒‼️‼️","userName":"secret agent spy 😜😎"}}]}
