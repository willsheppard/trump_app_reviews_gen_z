I had functionality problems with it since I started using it and it has not been resolved. The app is horribly organized and I cannot get any helpful or even truthful information/resources from using it! 10/10 would not recommend. Overall, a horrendous user experience.","date":"2020-07-09T03:29:39Z","title":"This app does NOT work!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"vschor"}},{"id":"6174857613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Whenever I received a notification from the app my phone would instantly burn up. My phone would become so hot it would actually shut off. I tried multiple times but it kept shutting itself off. This only happens when I try to open the app or receive a notification from the app.","date":"2020-07-09T03:24:16Z","title":"Extremely buggy","isEdited":false,"userName":"personwritingareviewforyou"}},{"id":"6174855219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was really looking forward to looking at all of the insightful things on this app but when I opened it it was just so glitchy and what I saw just scared me. The app made my phone glitch and became really really slow I hope it didn’t give my phone a virus maybe after this years election there will be a better app of some kind.","date":"2020-07-09T03:23:33Z","title":"Why is it so slow?","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumpsrightnutsack888"}},{"id":"6174848663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"God bless our great president.... but his app is TERRIBLE. Immediately after I downloaded it my phone started glitching out. It won’t hold a battery, and most of the time that I try to open other apps it crashes. I will be ordering a new phone......I can’t believe our beautiful president Donald J. Trump could approve an app like this.......at least covid isn’t real so I can find some comfort in that...god bless America","date":"2020-07-09T03:21:37Z","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"American🇱🇷"}},{"id":"6174846095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I wanted to get updates on President Trumps campaign, and figured having an app that kept me in the loop would be the perfect way to get the job done.  Little did I know that the app actually installs a virus on your phone that gets access to all your personal info.  As time went on the virus began spamming my texts/email etc.  I was getting up to 100 notifications a DAY.  I REPEAT TO NOT INSTALL.","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:52Z","title":"DO NOT INSTALL","isEdited":false,"userName":"littlejohn444"}},{"id":"6174817945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to ensure that i wouldn’t miss anything regarding our GREAT leader. Sadly, I was disappointed to find out that this app is a scam. First it started with the glitches, the app would randomly exit out and would not restart no matter how many times i’ve tried. Then, it progressed to do the same to my other apps. I had no choice but to delete. Very upsetting!","date":"2020-07-09T03:12:37Z","title":"Upsetting at Best","isEdited":false,"userName":"Reader1432"}},{"id":"6174812830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"was very! excited for this app📱. i wanted to support💖 the very best president, Ronald J. Dump! unfortunately,👄 once i downloaded it, my c**chie started burning like crazy!!! i am very disappointed in the outcome of this app. I will no longer be supporting Ronald Dump as my president because Dump supporters get itchy c**chies. so so sad 😔. hopefully all of my previously fellow Dump supporters come to their senses. itchy c**chies are not a sign of health!💖 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU DON’T WANT A BLAZING C**CHIE!!!!❤️","date":"2020-07-09T03:11:06Z","title":"you killed it!✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️now bury it💖☺️✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"asiangirlshatetrump"}},{"id":"6174812135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have an iphone 10 which is definitely a phone that should be able handle anything, but however this app is one of the worst I’ve ever had, instantly after downloading it created a million problems for my phone, I couldn’t open any apps or make any calls!

Well next time you hear somebody ask about cleaning products helping to cure COVID-19 go ahead and use that phrase. Not only will it help with that, download the app and instantaneously you get endless coupons for spray tans and a free cosmetic procedure to your local plastic surgeon. All you have to do is ask for the Trump micro-penis special, so easy!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:17Z","title":"There’s an app for that","isEdited":false,"userName":"FlowsidenSurfsTheWeb"}}]}
