It glitches every 7 seconds and has worms and viruses in it. This app is the equivalent to a stale potato chip or the host from total drama island. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. I am very surprised apple even passed it as something that is downloadable.

I first saw a very weird looking Oompa Loompa pop onto my screen and then I saw peppa pig licking lettuce off her feet, very un apetizing if I do say so myself. Don’t get this app unless you want to listen to a half brained Oompa Loompa who has wandered to far from the chocolate factory speak 🤚\n\n 💅🥰✨you tried🥰💅✨ but don’t try again🥰💅✨","date":"2020-07-08T23:20:58Z","title":"No❤️"}},{"id":"6174085152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lovelybee2000","review":"I downloaded the app because I respected the big Cheeto as we all do😌 but when I opened it it was full of glitches and bad visuals and fake things about the the Cheeto and we all know how much he hates that.

But the further I went into this app, the more I realized that this app is highly unpredictable, unreliable, and a dangerous existence. We should get a new app with a new name and a new purpose. #2020","date":"2020-07-08T23:10:34Z","title":"Not what I thought"}},{"id":"6174058612","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Tmefree360","review":"When I heard my president trump was making an app, I was thrilled! My president trying to reach out to the public through mobile devices, what a thrill. But when I opened the app, I was horrified. I saw a super ugly man staring at me, and I looked closer, and realized it was Trump! No man is aloud to look at me like that, and I feel violated.
