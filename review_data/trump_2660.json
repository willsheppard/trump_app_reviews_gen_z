What type of person size is that I mean I never knew orange Trump would say that to anyone but I’m not impressed and I’m not shocked he’s like that and he’s not gonna change and Then i pressed the button next And It had nothing literally nothing the page was blank that’s why I gave it one star only if I could give it a zero star but that doesn’t count so that’s it thank you","userName":"helli my name id","rating":1,"title":"It wanted me to die"}},{"id":"6176518579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:36:43Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Thi iS literally the WORST app I’ve ever downloaded. I don’t understand why any app developer would ever waste their time making an app that turned out this terrible and I don’t understand how it has ended up in the apple store. This app took a good hour to download just for it to be a completely useless app anyway. As the president I thought Trump would be able to develop a better app than this. \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the technical difficulties I now experience why trying to use my phone. This app took up as much space in my phone as the President’s ego takes up in the room. Since downloading this app it takes SUPER long for everything else on my phone to load.  \n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. YOUR PHONE WILL THANK U LATER.","userName":"✨🦋Trump Daddy✨🦋","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever‼️"}},{"id":"6176426780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:11:30Z","isEdited":false,"review":"first off, it took a 69 days to download😡. second, the cheeto kept messing me. never new someone could be so desperate🙄. i wouldn’t blame him tho💅, I’m hot asf😍. he kept begging to go on a date, then I finally said yes. when he showed up, he was covered in something that looked to be cheeto dust🤢. anyways, the date went on, but when we finished eating he told me to pay😾. and he said if I didn’t he would kill my dad (jokes on him, I don’t have one💗). I payed anyways tho. after our date he offered to walk me home, I said yes. but when we got to my house he kicked me and told me that I was trash and called me a ton of other names😫. then he asked me to let him in, when I said no he decided to rip my finger off and eat it👿. I still miss my finger😿.","userName":"come to the tré😍✨🧚\u200D♀️🌳💖💋","rating":1,"title":"DONt GET the CHEETO APP💩🤡🤬"}},{"id":"6176257658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:23:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"if i could give this one star i would. i came to see what are ✨totally perfect president✨ was up to. but i was immediately givin a warning. if this is a app for all of the trump fans which we know are a good amount of little kids, and some strange adults. this shouldn’t be a thing it was very inappropriate. second as soon as i opened the app it asked for my phone number and i think it’s VERY inappropriate since he is a married man☝️😤 and i am married to my husband killua🛹⚡️💙 totally inappropriate, i think this was very disturbing. i wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone who can read, or see, or hear, or breathe, or exist. actually if if you don’t exist i think you shouldn’t download it. it’s NOT good for you children OR anyone very inappropriate.","userName":"penis⌨︎","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP"}},{"id":"6176117790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:40:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"You can’t go on this wretched abomination without the app crashing. I could barely get to the part where the app requires you to confirm your gender by taking a picture and right when I do t allow access to the camera, the app crashes of course and I have to tell them my name, address, phone number, social security number and whether I have home security all over again. I wanted to stay up to date with our savior Donald Trump but I’m not sure about receiving numerous calls from strangers who keep asking me for my card information so I can apply for 1,000 dollars every day. Out of kindness and respect for the considerate, totally not racist or sexist man that our president is, Ill give this app a generous 1/10.","userName":"DisappointedTrumpSupporter","rating":1,"title":"Was this app even tested?"}},{"id":"6175550999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:28:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded the app to “support” our 🍊 dumb, old,racist,misogynistic,homophobic,xenophobic, fascist,ignorant,and sexual predator of a president😍i was soooooooo deeply disappointed when i realized the app was terrible for your phone and well being🧚🏽\u200D♂️not only did i get incredibly 10 times stupid, i felt myself lose 70 years off my life span,and gain 600+ pounds🥴the app put a virus on my phone that completely wiped out everything like photos,messages,notes,etc😭a bunch of lice came out of the charger hole, and when i asked why they were here,they said trump sent them because he has an infestation in his musty,dusty,non existent hair🦟 the phone then proceeded to levitate and knock out my family members and break everything in my house😜ANYWAYZ YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY not LEAVE A 1 ⭐️REVIEW🤣","userName":"okokokokokokayokayokayokayokay","rating":1,"title":"💖no💖"}},{"id":"6175361549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:14:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Downloading this app was the low point of 2020 for me and that’s saying something.  It wiped the data from my phone so I plugged it into my computer. My computer went black and hasn’t turned on since. My daughters only wedding photos were on that laptop, pictures of grandkids, important life memories, etc. How am I supposed to make my grandmother with Alzheimer’s remember her family? Our house burned down earlier this year and all the physical photos were lost, all we had left was that computer. This app also stole my credit card information and drained my bank about with trump merchandise charges. So now I have no house, belongings, photos, or money. I guess this is what you get for being a good American :(","userName":"amb0ly","rating":1,"title":"Biggest mistake of my life"}},{"id":"6174940672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:48:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened this app, a pre-recorded voice statement from a familiar voice (What was his name again? Damien Tromp?) immediately called me a “Chinese virus” and told me to shut up for being a woman. I initially downloaded this app with an open mind to hopefully befriend the moldy Cheeto that somehow broke into the White House and managed to make an already fragile nation even more divisive, but needless to say, this app needs to be taken off the App Store!!! I have never and will never even attempt to support this egotistical, elitist, bigoted, racist, fascist, narrow-minded neo-nazi ever again. If he ever reads this I hope he knows how to spell the word “dictionary” so he can look up some of the vocabulary used in this review that his private school education failed to cover in second grade.","userName":"f*ck_trump","rating":1,"title":"Racist and sexist!!"}},{"id":"6174921674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:43:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I, speaking on behalf of all organic life, believe that it is in our best interest, nay, our duty, to rid the Cheeto man’s app off the face of the cellular device. We must crank that Soulja boy so intensely, that any trace of the tangerine man, fades into the black. We must bring peace, justice, freedom, and security to our new empire and dissolve the senate as we know it. In the upcoming election, we shall bring balance to the force by electing none other than Dr. Heinz Doofinshmirtz as our new leader. Continuing the reign of terror that was brought upon by the orange lad himself, is something that we cannot allow. Our current leader has not passed the vibe check, therefore we must take matters into our own hands. I say to you all, in this world, you either kill yourself or get killed.

I downloaded it to keep up with my favorite fascist (and the hottest racist/rapist take ur pick - sorry, PRESIDENT) I’ve ever seen and assumed his app would allow me to do so. However, this app takes up a severe amount of storage almost immediately and doesn’t open, freezes my screen and shuts my phone down, and validates racists and rapists! Anyways, defund the police, ACAB, and change the systems built on dehumanizing and targeting people of color, immigrants, the LGBT community and anyone who is not a rich white man. Keep protesting and signing for petioles to demand for justice. Breonna Taylor’s murderers are still free. A rapist and blatantly racist and fascist man is in control now but not forever, we will be the change our country needs. BLM. ACAB.","userName":"enjrjrjenrnrnrnrnrnr","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Horrendous"}}]}
