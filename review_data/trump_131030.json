It appears to seem aggresive. It almost gave me a heart attack.You know i’m not as young as i use to be i can’t handle that at my age. I may not look it but honey i feel it in legs i don’t know how i’m able to move my fingers to type. Oh i know i had to just give my fellow elders who have no lives help because I care.
