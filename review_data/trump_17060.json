It glitches terribly, lots of misspelled words and incorrect grammar make items hard to follow, it took a long time to download and took up over 75% of my available storage space. Plus there was no valuable information. Save yourself the trouble and don’t download.","date":"2020-07-09T09:38:47Z","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6175921490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Germskii","review":"Instructions weren’t clear: told me to make a grilled cheese sandwich 🥪 but without any cheese 🧀😫 App then proceded to make the background of my phone orange 🍊.

I cant trust a random cheeto that asks for my number. and where did this cheeto even learn to text anyways. I advise you replace that cheeto in a suite with something more friendly and some you would want to see like a puppy❤️","date":"2020-07-09T09:30:25Z","title":"i’m scared"}},{"id":"6175889518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"karens mistress","review":"This app has terrible blinded my sister forever when I got on it I was told to give my location and was receiving dirty text messages from a secret number By somebody who was wanting to be called t-daddy later.‼️I am so upset because my little sister was watching spy ninjas and that’s when a picture of an penis poped up from t-daddy with a message that said t-daddy takeover 2020","date":"2020-07-09T09:25:50Z","title":"T-daddy"}},{"id":"6175889359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Camandnsna","review":"I downloaded this to help support the greates president we have ever had. but is took 6 years to download!!!! lasted longer than the confederacy!!!  after i left my cousins room at 2 am 👁👄👁 i open my phone to see it took up 24 gigabytes!!!! unbelievable. i really was hoping u could support the president who is the best and these snowflakes should worship!!  but this app make me mad 😡😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T09:25:47Z","title":"DIFFICULT"}},{"id":"6175851764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"obama2020!!!!🥰🥰🥰","review":"I tried to find some reason that people like him, but at last I couldn’t.

The man stared as if he was looking straight at me. To this day, I still feel as though he is watching me as I type this. I'm horrified of the information this app has of me and my family now. I do not feel safe in my home anymore.","date":"2020-07-09T09:03:36Z","title":"Genuinely traumatizing"}},{"id":"6175822227","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lili🎉🐢","review":"I hate it. This app gave my phone a virus I had to go the apple store to get them to fix it!  The virus would call random people in my contacts send emails to my boss and would lock me out of my own phone!!! I would never recommend this to any of my family and friends!!! If I could give this crappy app zero stars I would!!!","date":"2020-07-09T09:03:31Z","title":"The worst app on the store"}},{"id":"6175820788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ummmmmokaythenboomer","review":"Now, I may not be the brightest tool in the shed, but I know for a fact that a Cheeto is not a President. Nor should it be allowed rights. The only thing a Cheeto should be allowed to do, is be a delicious snack. But frankly, this president can’t even be that. This app was a waste of time. Now I hope this helps. Because it’s what I always say “if you want something done right, DONT hire a Cheeto to do it for you”✨🦋💖🧚🏻✌️✌️","date":"2020-07-09T09:03:03Z","title":"Disgusting🤮🤮🤮🤮"}}]}
