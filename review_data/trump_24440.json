BUT, I’m here to help out our country. Some of the things trump has said in the few years he’s been the president just haven’t been very respectful and responsible of himself. I don’t know where he’s taking our country but it is for sure not uphill.","userName":"CaMrYnThOmAs","date":"2020-07-09T16:11:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177303398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"L","review":"We all know why you actually want to ban tiktok. You feel threatened, coward. Gen z doesn’t want an old man like you to be president and we should get a say in that considering we’re gonna live longer than ANY of you. Even if tiktok is gone we will still be here and we will still find ways.","userName":"mendnwhebekw","date":"2020-07-09T16:09:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177289108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful app","review":"The worst app ever.

Trump is way too spammy with his messages, like can you take it down to 1 message a day please? Also the app took forever to download that I forgot I downloaded it by the time it was done.
