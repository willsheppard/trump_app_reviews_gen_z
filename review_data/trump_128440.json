But immediately upon opening the app it forced me to enter a mobile phone number, so that I would get notifications about his rally‚Äôs, polls, and things like that. I did not want to put my phone number in, but the app used a code verification number so there is no escaping it. Within the first minute I realized this app is no good, do not download.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:19:30Z","userName":"1028746472","title":"This app is too
