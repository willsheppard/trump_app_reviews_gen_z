I then, a 14 year old child, received a text message from the trump administration asking to stand with trump in white supremacy and how Mount Rushmore is a symbol of white supremacy. This is most definitely illegal. Also, banning Tik Tok, a way to spread information and awareness of real world problems to the general public, and an app that many people spend a ton of time on, is not going to happen. Gen Z does not go down without a fight."}},{"id":"6173089098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:29:17Z","userName":"chai shea","rating":1,"title":"Capitalism","review":"The capitalist system has inevitably impoverish the masses as the world’s wealth became concentrated in the hands of a greedy few, causing economic crises and heightened conflict between the rich and working classes. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is at the same time accumulation of misery, slavery, ignorance, brutality, and mental degradation at the opposite pole. The median annual earnings of a full-time, male worker in the U.S. in 2011, at $48,202, were smaller than in 1973. Between 1983 and 2010, 74% of the gains in wealth in the U.S. went to the richest 5%, while the bottom 60% suffered a decline. #americaisnevergreatundercapitalism"}},{"id":"6173058390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:19:20Z","userName":"scatsjja","rating":1,"title":"Disappointment ✨","review":"I downloaded this app hoping to find out new and get updates on events because my family and I are such loyal Trump supporters and planned on voting for him in the 2020 election. But this app is so glitchy and every time I went on it, it would shut my phone off. This app isn’t worth your time, that’s for sure. It doesn’t have good updates and accurate news. I was hoping it was better but after having it for two weeks I regret it 100% horrible app!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173039877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:29Z","userName":"aliyuh","rating":1,"title":"I hate this app","review":"Firstly, it took forever to open. The app kept crashing and I eventually gave up. Later on, when I managed to finally get it open, it asked for my info, which I entered. I get calls and messages day and night. Like another reviewer, I believe this app sold my information. I was just trying to understand Trump’s policies and be an educated voter, but I’m truly appalled by this. I’ve since deleted the app. They need to resolve this. I thought our president would be better than this."}},{"id":"6172975060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:53:38Z","userName":"leannacheeze","rating":1,"title":"Terrible waste of time!!","review":"This app was the worst decision of my life!! Upon hitting the download button it crashed my phone and I was unable to reopen it for a full week! Then when I was finally back on my phone the app kept crashing every time I tried to open it. I finally got it to open but the text kept glitching out and it played a terrifying high pitched ringing that disturbed my whole house and I couldn’t shut off. This app is awful and I hope it gets fixed soon"}},{"id":"6172921834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:37:05Z","userName":"beee1717","rating":1,"title":"no❤️","review":"i downloaded this app to see what i could do during this campaign, not to support but to learn. I have gone to one of Trumps rally’s, to learn as well. So far, what i’ve learned from the combined sources is that trump is not a good speaker, or all around president. He hasn’t built the wall, he’s gotten rid of more jobs then he’s made, and he has risen the national debt. He hasn’t even started looking at climate change, or the homeless problem we have in all of America. I’m not of age to vote but if i was, Trump would not get my vote."}},{"id":"6172906284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:32:13Z","userName":"jbt252","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD.","review":"this was the first app I downloaded on my BRAND NEW iPhone and it made my phone completely glitch out and overheat. I ended up having to take it to the Apple store where they said over FIFTY other people brought their phones in with the same problem just to that ONE STORE. ALL OF OUR PHONES WERE FRIED !! not to mention I started getting random charges on my card that were donations to trumps campaign. Beyond MAD  if you can’t run an app how do you expect to run a country ?!?! If you value your phone DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!!!"}},{"id":"6172848499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:14:37Z","userName":"kalmia latifolia","rating":1,"title":"Scam and Dangerous!!","review":"This app is filled with scam opportunities where it asks for your credit card information! I also found that I was having lots of technical malfunctions after downloading this app. I have a sneaking suspicion that the Chinese government has infiltrated this app and is stealing information. Also this app has terrible hate speech against minorities and lgbtq+ people. This app supports a terrible, racist person and needs to be removed. If Apple really supports equality, they would remove it from the App Store."}},{"id":"6172826907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:08:18Z","userName":"💜{-Gabby-}💜","rating":1,"title":"This ain’t it🟠","review":"So I downloaded this app to show some respect to America but all I got was a glitching and lagging screen that kept on logging me off. Also I was not told that it would be a jump scare app cuz an orange face popped up out of nowhere and scared the hell out of me🤭🟠. It then came to my realization that I downloaded an app for a racist, no life, Orange looking boomer so I decided to delete it cuz the person the app is about is already ruining America so I’m not gonna have him ruining ma phone🙃AND THATS ON BEING A KPOP FAN✋😌 Trump, you are messing with the wrong people😁😃"}},{"id":"6172779921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:54:51Z","userName":"jules angelloz","rating":1,"title":"Don’t even know what to do","review":"Ok well first off I want to say to that person who decides to side with the Ompa Loopa, what? I am over the age of seventeen 🤷🏼\u200D♀️ and I can vote and agree with the “kids.” they have a good future ahead of them. Secondly I would like to say that I just don’t like Trump. It’s a opinion, so stop assuming people’s ages and understand that people have opinions, so how about YOU stop acting so childish. You either love him or you hate him. It doesn’t matter what side you are on. Thank you for reading if you did 🤷🏼\u200D♀️😂"}}]}
