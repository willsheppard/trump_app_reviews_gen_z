When I tried to restart it my phone started doing cartwheels down the street and I had to run after and catch it! When I finally reopened the app my phone was so distraught by the abhorrent falsities it literally jumped out of my hands and out the window where it fell 30ft and smashed into the ground. I had to get a new phone all because of this app. Would not recommend.","isEdited":false,"title":"Saddened and Confused","date":"2020-07-09T02:19:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"Polka54321"}},{"id":"6174591883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to help support our wonderful POTUS🍊😁, but as soon as I opened it I got 69,000 virus on my phone😡My phone started signing super bass💅 and caught on fire 😿and my house burnt down from that fire.

Then they kept threatening me and saying that if I didn’t do this and that then they would come and kill my entire family. there’s also some unfriendly material on this app I saw some very interesting pornographic images of the president. all in all I just think that needs to be deleted from any and all technology because it’s not family friendly, it’s not nice, and it’s dangerous.","isEdited":false,"title":"you🙈 cant🦟 hang🦗 with🍪 the😾 big🤩 boys🥵 comin🐥 thru👁👅👁 with🔋 the⚙️big❌ toys🧸","date":"2020-07-09T01:57:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"sonnesb"}},{"id":"6174547020","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hopefully this turns out good because i can’t see and my voice thing isn’t working so excuse the typos.

What are you doing here?? Don’t you have innocent immigrants to deport and families to separate?!” 😮 “Yes.

You open the app and are presented with a stale cheeto raising his fist. Then I’m asked to put my phone number in. Honey, you already sent a text to the entire United States?? Why do you need this app now? Anyways trumps campaign spent 100,000,000 on marketing in 2016 online to convince and specifically target people to manipulate them into supporting him.

Also it asked me for my phone number and I personally do not feel comfortable giving out my phone number to an inanimate object such as the Cheeto that presented itself on the screen. Overall not suitable for people of any age as it could cause some PTSD and none of us need that, especially in 2020 so it’s a no from me 👎🏽","isEdited":false,"title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would!","date":"2020-07-09T01:12:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"mg_1212"}},{"id":"6174344611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I opened the app (because I WAS a loyal supporter) but then I saw a picture of a sweaty Cheeto?
