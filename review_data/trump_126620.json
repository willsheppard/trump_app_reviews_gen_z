At first I didn’t think much of it, it was just slower and laggier than usual. However, as the hours went by I continued to have more and more issues showing up. My Apple Music only allowed me to play 6ix9ine and the state anthem of the Russian federation, the only thing I could look up on Amazon was maga merch, and my photo app seems to be glitching out as I know see trumps face in place of my mother’s in every photo of her. Also my brother tested positive for covid the exact same day I downloaded it. I had to buy a new phone, and I am extremely disappointed.","title":"Extremely disappointed"}},{"id":"6178178046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"abigailkau","date":"2020-07-09T20:43:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛😝😜🤪🤨🧐🤓😎🤩🥳😏😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵🥶😱😨😰😥😓🤗🤔🤭🤫🤥😶😐😑😬🙄😯😦😧😮😲🥱😴🤤😪😵🤐🥴🤢🤮🤧😷🤒🤕🤑🤠","title":"STUPID"}},{"id":"6178177842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i g g y wydtdt","date":"2020-07-09T20:43:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app to ever exist, why would you download an app run by an orange? 🍊\n- 302848449478/10 would never recommend 💖🧚🏻💅🏻","title":"Worst app"}}]}
