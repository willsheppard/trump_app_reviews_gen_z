My family had wanted to go to the park but this app heard us talking about going so it sent pigeons to come steal our shoes and set the park on fire. the wild rabbits in our backyard got sent free so now we have no trees. we also sadly lost my grandma because the app made her think she was one of the rabbits so she left with them😢. That’s not even the worst part the app likes to pants people when I’m out in public. it pantsed my dad while he was trying to pick up my dog bowl from the super market. this app then continued to spill water onto the floor while break dancing. oh and to top it all off the app then proceeded to spit on my moms SPAGHETTI!!! LIKW BRO COME ON NOT THE SPAGHETTI.😭😭😞😞😞","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:03Z"}},{"id":"6174015295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"just no.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sugattree","review":"I opened the app to see a weird cheeto thing looking at me. I was horrified and disgusted with what i saw on that HORRIBLE app. I highly don’t recommend this app. If any child sees that cheeto thing🤮 when they open the app they will be scarred for the rest of their life. I am extremely disappointed with the images i saw, I don't want my eyes to have to see a cheeto puff every time i open the app. When i went out of that app already horrified, my home screen changed! It changed to a picture of donald trump naked!! I cant change it!! Now my WHOLE phone is glitching and crashing. I cant believe this would happen, I just wanted to support our beloved cheeto president!! But now my lock screen has a nude picture of trump!! I can't even change it, it wont let me!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:54:01Z"}},{"id":"6173986722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ew cheeto man 😳🙈🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"🐸🩸","review":"I opened the app to see 40 individual pictures of monkeys being shoved into meat grinders. then i saw that there was a video of trump giving a giant teddy bear a lap dance NAKED 😳😳🤮🤮🤮 i had to see his little cheeto balls 😭🟠🟠 i now have to attend 69 different therapists every day because they all have address a different trauma caused by this event. i feel extremely violated i am only 3 days old and my whole life is ahead of me but it seems i may just have to end it here and now. not to mention, i have a vag and a pp 😳 and even my pp is bigger than mr cheeto man’s. there are countless things wrong with mr cheeto man’s brain (im pretty sure he cant even walk or drink water correctly 😯) and now he has to live with the knowledge that he caused a 3 day old child to kermit 😪🤧🐸 goodbye world 🤕😭🔫 *BANG*🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸","date":"2020-07-08T22:43:11Z"}},{"id":"6173957484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just disgusted 👎🏽😖🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sgxhdshs","review":"First off I saw a fat Cheeto putting his fist up 🤮terrifying my friend recommended this app for me and a day after she said her mom went in a coma for saying such an app and then late then she just had to bleach her eyes cus of the Cheeto she couldn’t take anymore and then half of my family says this App is a curse that this app was the reason for my gruncle Stans death😖👎🏽👎🏽i went blind from my left eye so right im at the hospital for my eye & I need serious surgery 😭but lucky my right eye survived the trauma.

I cannot believe this is a legitimate app. The graphics were very low and it messed up my phone for whatever reason ! It changed my WiFi on and off and drained my battery like no other. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. You must have the. IPhone27 to even work this app because it is so confusing and constantly logged me out multiple times and sometimes would not let me in for days. I am VERY disappointed that OUR PRESIDENT would even allow an app like this to be in his name. Not to mention the constant lag I had gotten while using it ON AND OFF THE APP. Numerous apps of mine like Fox News, Facebook, and Yubo were affected by this. Please fix this. I would like to use this app without completing ruining my phone.","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:27Z"}},{"id":"6173700884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Tarantula spray tan juices","review":"This is the worst app ever!!! I downloaded it on my phone, but the app sensed that I wasn’t white; and figured out I was of mixed race. After that, the app immediately sent me coronavirus. I already had bronchitis, so my lungs exploded from president 🍊 spray tan juices. Turns out his spray tan juices were filled with tarantulas with 80 eyeballs within each eyeball... within each eyeball 👁. My body itches with pain, and then when I tried to undownload the app my phone blew up; but it wasn’t your average explosion. The explosion was one million times worse than the bombs sent to Hiroshima. This indeed sent me back to my “own country”, but I’m mixed so one part of my body went to Italy, the other to Vietnam, and the rest Africa. I’m going to be experiencing trauma forever thanks to this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:56:30Z"}},{"id":"6173683070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is HORRIBLE 💩💀","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"anonymus 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨❤️","review":"First of all, when I downloaded this app it took five hours to download and I have perfect WiFi in my home.  But then when I logged on an orange 🍊 appeared on my screen! I was looking through the app and it told me unusual things to do that apparently will make America a better place again.  First it started off as telling me to cut off all my fingers and toes. After I cut them off, it told me to feed them to my dog 🐕. But then all of a sudden my dog got magical 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ powers and he ate my whole entire family and made them into beef stew 🥘. But before he could do the same to me the app told me to sprinkle lettuce 🥬 all over my dog 🐕 to turn back into a dog again. So after I did that, he went back to normal. I definitely do not recommend  this app🤍.","date":"2020-07-08T20:50:02Z"}},{"id":"6173666677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I am scared","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"YAY COOKIES!","review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to see what trump 2020 would look like. However, upon opening it everything went wrong. My phone crashed and our electricity went out. As I sat in the dark fearing for my life I heard something I’ll never forget. Chatting emitting from my phone saying “build a wall” and I knew that the end was near. Far off in the distance I can hear the call of conservatives everywhere as they descend upon me, led by our Cheeto in chief. In fact, as I write this review I know that the 🍊 is coming for me. I know that the end of my days near. I know that downloading this app was a mistake I wish I had never made. Writing this review will likely be one of the last things I ever do. I fear for anyone who downloads this app. Stay strong 🙏","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:09Z"}},{"id":"6173524161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst decision i’ve ever made! i am now fearing for my life!! 🤬🤯","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"fdt🥶","review":"i decided to download this app to see what donald trump was all about, thinking maybe i would realize he’s not so bad...WRONG‼️🙄 within a few minutes of the app being on my phone, I had yeehaw 🤠 people lining up outside of my home chanting “all lives matter” in their MAGA hats!! I opened my bedroom window and told them to go away and even threatened to call the police!! i started to dial 911 and a cop 🚓 threw their sheriff hat straight at my bedroom window while yelling the “n” word at me!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😱 they shattered the glass and the hat hit me right in my eye, i couldn’t believe it! 😵 i now have a black eye, a shattered window, glass all over my bedroom floor, and a burned cross in my yard!!! this app is terrible and now i am afraid to leave my house!","date":"2020-07-08T19:54:22Z"}}]}
