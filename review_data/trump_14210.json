I can’t believe someone would allow this app to be available in the app store. This is truly the worst app I’ve ever had. It is very glitchy and whenever I try to open it, words come up and they just disgust me so much I don’t even want to type them. Let me just say they started with Tr and ended with ump 2020. Very bad app overall and I wouldn’t suggest for anyone to download it.","title":"Hate It","date":"2020-06-29T02:09:40Z","userName":"halo33333333","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6136619499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is a great way to get informed on current issues and get involved in the 2020 campaign. Very easy to set up and use!

I was just booking a appointment to get my hair bleached blond and cut in a bob and then I go into the app and boom my phone shut down. As a Karen my job is to review things honestly and this app is terrible. This app has scared me for life and may have changed where my vote is going to. I hope this app gets taken down.","title":"Simply horrible","date":"2020-06-29T00:37:36Z","userName":"262668299","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6133493915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not only is it not christian enough but it’s sooooo disrespectful. Actual trash. I’m disappointed that so many people have downloaded it because that means so many people have been disappointed...What a shame shame shame. Any who lets get back to the point this app is literally the worst thing in the ENTIRE universe to ever have been made and I say this because whenever I download it my dog literally caught on fire!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥","title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-06-28T22:15:52Z","userName":"Mimosas one","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6133133781","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrific it sent me a chain message about how to lynch grown innocent black men/women but not a number to call to rule it a suicide ugh so unhelpful. As well as very rude racist comments and slurs which I obviously use each and everyday of course but they are the old over used ones not new ones to add to my very limited vocabulary because of how stupid I am because I support trump. Also told me to wear a mask if I want to die of COVID-19 I will.","title":"From a Special Trump supporter","date":"2020-06-28T19:43:27Z","userName":"LA MAS BICHA","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6129819452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Why is Donald trump the president anyways cause like he should be impeached again or not be the president anymore. He’s racist, a ra*ist, the worse person ever to exist. He said the he made America “great” again boy no he just made even America worse. Why does Donald trump has an app when he knows that it going to get bad reviews and it’s going to get off of the AppStore. This app is the worse thing ever and I never want to see it again.","title":"No just no","date":"2020-06-27T23:56:48Z","userName":"ariucka","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6125211742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and not even 5 seconds after my grandma fell down the stairs ?!?!

I don't know what kind of technology this app is using but it is ruining my phone! And without my phone, how can i post on facebook about Trump????!! Unfortunately i'm going to have to delete this app 😞. I thought Trump would do better than this.","title":"Disappointed :-(","date":"2020-06-25T22:25:42Z","userName":"adultrebublican","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
