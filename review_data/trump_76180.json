I would get weird messages from random people of me while I’m sleeping. I did some research and it turns out that this app opens you up to hackers. The messages started escalating to those people holding knifes over my baby brother and my other brothers started waking up with weird marks on their body. One day we woke up to the family dog dead with the words “make America great again carved into her stomach”. I told my parents about the messages and photos I was being sent and they said that we had to move immediately and I had to delete the app. Except i couldn’t delete the app. When ever I tried to my phone would start rapidly heating up and it got to the point where I had to drop it unless I wanted second or third degree burns. We tried disabling locations on my phone for that app but it wouldn’t work. Then we tried disabling locations all together but they always stayed in for this one app. In our new house my parents installed security cameras to try to catch whoever was doing these things. What we saw horrified us. Every night six people would break into our house and stand over each of us. They would set tiny fly like animals out into our rooms. Theses creatures would the proceed to eat there way into our orifices. We tried locking up our house. We installed alarms, got high security locks on all our doors and we barricade the doors to each of our rooms each night, but they always get in. The first person to die was my baby brother. The doctors say his brain was eaten from the inside out by maggots. The second person was my mom. One day she decided to stay up and catch the people herself. When they saw her with a gun they tased her and then proceeded to break her neck. Then it was my other brother. It was two weeks after my moms death and he hadn’t slept. Every night he hid in his closet, and every night they tied him down and let the flies in. Eventually he couldn’t take it anymore and he jumped out of his way window. Three nights ago it was my older brother. He started setting traps around our house hoping he could at least injure one of the intruders. But they’re smarter. There was never any way to win against them. They took him from his room one night and three days ago we found his mangled body in one of the traps. This morning I woke up to my dads body dead on the floor right next to my bed, holding a knife. There was a note on his body. It was from the intruders. It only had two words “you tonight” I’m writing this because I know I’m next. This is the best I can do before they take me. Goodnight everybody","isEdited":false,"title":"My whole family is dead now","userName":"K.E.Atkins","date":"2020-07-08T20:05:40Z"}},{"id":"6173544242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I heard that not even a person is running this app. Like some Cheeto puff is in charge or sumn","isEdited":false,"title":"FAKE NEWS","userName":"cnksoo","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:13Z"}},{"id":"6173536989","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is so horrible and there are multiple fact errors and causes a VIRUS don’t get this app 🤦🏽\u200D♀️🤦🏽\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","userName":"curlyhead45","date":"2020-07-08T19:58:46Z"}}]}
