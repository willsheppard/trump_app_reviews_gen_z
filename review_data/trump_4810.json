Prezzie, I’m alarmed at this app and I hope that you don’t continue with any more stuff like this because sweetie this is embarassing💔 do NOT download this app because i have needed weeks of intensive therapy to recover from seeing the images on the app","userName":"mako mermaids from the city","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:56:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Foreigner💞"}},{"id":"6177254695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, the app is terrible. It doesn’t work, gives terrible and incorrect information, all the information it does have is biased and a lot of the time is also hateful. There is nothing fun about it. The app is not aesthetically pleasing at all. There is absolutely no function for this being in existence. Pointless. Get rid of it. \nAlso, secondly, the strangest thing happens when I do open the app. The faint smell of Cheetos and sometimes cinnamon comes wafting out of my phone. Not sure what that is all about but I’m concerned and not amused. \nPlease do yourself a favor and stay away from this monstrosity.","userName":"no thanks ubereats","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:55:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Weird smell"}},{"id":"6177241292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has so many bugs it kept crashing. All I want to do is a be a bigot and say yeet all day but this is frustrating my fragile ego so much I might have to delete it. I probably won’t though, no matter how many times it appalls and disgusts me. This is because I would rather support a garbage app like this than admit that I’m a garbage human. So screw every other app, this is the best app on the planet. To be honest the bugs aren’t even that bad and I will choose to skert them because this app says all of the terrible things I’m too much of a coward to say on my own. (Unless it’s in an anonymous group chat)","userName":"outwiththesnowflakes","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:51:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"So many bugs"}},{"id":"6177200634","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is the WORST and i’m not saying this for any other reason than the following: the app took 87 WEEKS to download and i downloaded it because i was genuinely curious to hear plans for the future and as soon as i opened the app my phone COMPLETELY shut down. it’s insane so i 100% DO NOT recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t want to have to purchase a new phone for full price too! nobody believed that this app was the source of my problems. anyways, i believe this app should not be used by anyone because we have enough to deal with, more than dumb apps killing phones. thank you as good day 🥰","userName":"Giwertz","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:40:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️🤚"}},{"id":"6177111257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I finally decided it was time to follow a racist, white supremacist, ignorant, idiotic, self-absorbed, rapist man-child! So I looked no further than trump himself.\n Unfortunately, I experienced some major glitches. The main one was whenever I went into the app, a disgusting, old, orange, corn-haired man would appear in my room! And this orange oompaloompa tried to grab me by the pus*y!! All because he claimed I looked like “his daughter Ivanka”. Smh. I’m disappointed.\n Oh also, this app wouldn’t let me use it! Whenever I tried to log into the app, it said “Trump does NOT care for POC, women, lgbtq+ members, or the future of the USA”. \nI 100% DO NOT recommend this app.","userName":"Gisellecrafts","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:15:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed😔🍊"}},{"id":"6176900195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this thinking it was a teen titans app for my son. When it was done downloading after three days my son clicked on the app and the screen went black. We could not find a way to fix his iPad. The next morning a man knocked on the door with a Make America Great Again hat and shirt. It was some skinny white dude with spitting tobacco in his mouth he said to me “ I see you download the app “ he’s in jail now. So we went to the apple store and got the iPad fixed. The “game” gave me a notification that a homeless man is at your door. On top it said read yesterday. If I could this would be a 1/2 a star but I can only do one.","userName":"Thatswiltastic","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:18:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not fun game"}},{"id":"6176715775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the absolute worst app I have ever used in my 74,598 years of life!!!! My pet fruit fly and I were waiting over 200 years for it to download😫😫😫 life is short you can’t just waste time like that😭😭 the content of the app WAS NOT worth the wait either! Once I opened it I immediately saw the nastiest looking monster IN THE WORLD. His hair was foul but when I looked down at his neck I instantly threw up all over my bed🤢🤢!!!! My pet  fruit fly was taking a nap right next to me and he drowned in my vomit😢😢 R.I.P. dr pistachio🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 NEVER download this app it kills innocent lives just like it has all around us for the past 3+ years🥰","userName":"John9402","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:29:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6176708858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS A 0 STAR I WOULD, this doesn’t even deserve one star!! this app is horrible, it hacks your data. this sexist, racist, homophobic (etc) president made an app that hacks you to make you be a republican!! i don’t even wanna see Trumps face because i am so offended by the comments he makes about my gender (women) he says they don’t get paid the same as men (i watched multiple tiktok vids so i saw and heard with my own self). he made me feel horrible and i also heard a video of him saying grab them by the .... i don’t even feel comfortable with him being my president. i could go on and on but in conclusion this app is HORRIBLE","userName":"hdkdjdnsnsmkxx","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6176662415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and within 3 seconds it sent graphic porn to all of my relatives. Not only that, but my boss too! Trump is supposed to stand for intolerance, but no surprise he loves a nice unsolicited pic (Pence definitely picked out the pics if you know what I am saying). If you want to be able to show your face at Thanksgiving, (with a mask on ofc :)) don’t download this app. Additionally, when I clicked terms and conditions, I saw that it said Trump would kill my whole family if I didn’t accept! Make sure you read the entirety of the terms and conditions, as I usually don’t but am sure glad I did this time.","userName":"🐯🐘🐽🐽🐶🐶🐶🐶🐰🐒🐮🐸🐒","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:15:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Shame"}},{"id":"6176613963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app complete disabled my phone and wiped all the data on it. Later after trying to search the internet all I️ got were trump 2020 websites showing it had clearly hacked my phone and stolen all my data!!!! This app is toxic and clearly a way to control people who mindlessly download!! Controlled by a dangerous individual who just wants your money and secret data to share and spread. My phone has never been the same after downloading. It’s slow, I️ have to try to restore data and I️ keep getting spam campaign calls and texts almost EVERY minute. SERIOUSLY invasive and horrible app!!! 0/10","userName":"Worried book lover","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:02:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE app"}}]}
