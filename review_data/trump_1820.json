I was practically bouncing off the walls as I opened it the first time. But just imagine my dissatisfaction and disappointment when I went to turn off my bedroom light and it WOULDN'T TURN OFF. That’s right folks. This app is infringing on my ability to get some peaceful shut-eye. So I suffered. Through the night I tossed, I turned. Truly unable to shake the uncertainty that this app has placed upon me. It is now three days later, and I can tell you that no light in my house will budge. I fear the day that my electric bill arrives. \n\nThis app may have been free to download, but failed to tell me that I would spend a fortune on a sleep number mattress, anger management, and eye cream for dark circles. Be warned.","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:22Z"}},{"id":"6174563312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ploob ooble","title":"Has no lips, will not get a kiss kiss","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because i heard it was a game about a guy named Kronald Dump but apparently its a joke about a cheeto running for president? Anyways the joke wasn’t even that funny but i decided to stick around. Not even an hour into having the app i was flashed a series of pictures of the deformed cheeto, almost like a strobe light. I ended up having a seizure and had to be transported immediately to a hospital where i fell into a coma and passed away. Yeah this is actually my ghost writing this review. Anyways, the app was overall extremely disappointing so if your expecting a game DO NOT DOWNLOAD. You might also die. But not in a cool way. Your last memory will be images of a mutant that looks like if Mark Wahlberg had a one night stand with a blowfish and crunchy cheeto that somehow produced a baby. 10/10 do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T01:57:46Z"}},{"id":"6174530689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alan Cardenas","title":"Zero Stars","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to see who the president was this year. I fell into a coma about 9 years ago so I was shocked to see that Obama was gone. Anyways, I opened the app and I had to call 911 because it said some Oompa Loompa Cheeto had taken office. The police were no help. So I tried deleting the app and my phone now has a virus. The screen goes completely orange and whenever I try to do anything it grabs me by the p****. Also I can’t even call people on my phone because when I try to say something it just responds with “WRONG”. Also this dumb app is trying to delete my other apps. And my family has started to go missing and I’m pretty sure it’s because of this app. In conclusion I’m gonna destroy my phone and burn my house down because this app ruined my life and I hope I can get a new phone in 2020.","date":"2020-07-09T01:48:21Z"}},{"id":"6174494203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"alivua","title":"THIS APP IS DEMONIC AND RACIST🤬","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So to start off with I am a hispanic young woman who JUST LOVES AND ADORES Trump!!! 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻🤪🤪 But right as I opened this app my WHOLE HOUSE started shaking and Flags that have the diary of wimpy kids face appeared everywhere in my house. This is an invasion of privacy it’s like the big orange man is giving my address and information away to the Chinese government🤬🤬🤬🤬. But my anger grew when a friend of mine who is white downloaded the app and everything went smoothly. I used to be a major supporter of the orange troll but I just can’t do it anymore. This app is cursed. Not to mention the countless people I have knocking on my door claiming to be in Donald trumps campaign begging me to paint myself orange 😳. I also often have life size doll replicas of Donald come down my chimney every night🙄. All I’m saying is don’t come NEAR this app for your own safety and all of America’s.","date":"2020-07-09T01:38:08Z"}},{"id":"6174384634","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fiona Moreno","title":"Honestly terrible and disappointing. -5/10","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I, like many, WAS a proud Trump supporter. I wanted to enjoy this app and gain insight, but Trump is only adding things to his liking which doesn’t allowed for broad information. It’s very important that we educate ourselves during this time and this app only wants to fit one narrative. Trump is constantly saying don’t believe this and that because it’s what the left want, but he wants us to believe certain things because it’s what the Republican Party aka Trump wants. We should be able to have all the information! When did the news become opinion based... anyways, terrible app and very disappointed in Trump! Other trump supporter’s want to say “ohh this app and trump is great!” But let’s be honest.. things have gone south! Don’t lie to yourself. The economy and people are suffering. Bless you all and God bless America.","date":"2020-07-09T01:05:28Z"}},{"id":"6174217983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"average humam being","title":"👁👅👁The app makes your dog hate u 😞","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded the app so that i could avoid all the FAKE NEWS🇱🇷🇱🇷 and learn about politics from a credible source. It was great at first but unfortunately my very average dog 🐕 Martha started talking about how black lives mater but of course all lives matter ✊✊🏻✊🏻🐶 Martha then started eating my trump body pillow and my house started saying ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆 and won’t stop so I called the house guy who was actually Dora the explorer who came will full trump🍊 merch so I was very happy and we became friends the music made her dead hurt and she took of her 59$ MAGA hat and then said stupid things like trump is a white supremacist😡😡🤬. Then when she left 😢 Martha left with her and she and boots became friends 😔 all I could do after that was sing 🎶 ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃ 🎶","date":"2020-07-09T00:08:56Z"}},{"id":"6174203396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"peepeepoopoo🦧🤎","title":"Absolutely not","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So I open this app to see a picture of a naked orange peal. This surly made me ✨uncomfortable✨. I decide to get over it because I realized it wasn’t a naked orange it was our naked president🦧🦧. It asks for my number and I put it in ya know the usual. I go on to a fictional story that was titled “news” thought it was pretty far fetched. Harry Potter was more realistic. Then I get a FaceTime from a random number and open it. You’ll never guess who it was... naked orange peal😘. He told me to eat my grandma. I said no of course. Then he went on to say he would eat my grandma if I didn’t. I said “Sir It looks like you already have”. He started to cry I said “that makes you cry but 3000 missing children and people being killed in the streets. You have to pick and choose your battles”. -10/10 experience on my end. Take care of your grandmas by not downloading.","date":"2020-07-09T00:03:28Z"}},{"id":"6173887378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mamma kia","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app took a whole month to download and in that time i had the time to count the bees in the bee movie and it’s 20,900,00. but once i opened the app it turned in the camera automatically and didn’t even ask my permission!! ✨ after that it started playing music like top hits but in a very monotone voice. it started sending in spiders and hair balls. if you don’t know me well then i HATE hair balls and lint balls they are disturbing. they also allowed themselves my location and in the middle of the night they snuck on and changed my pile of clothes into themselves!! i was furious with this! 💫 on top of this they had deleted all of my contacts and now i have to restock all of mine!! the absolutely worst part was that everytime i opened the app the whole bee movie script would play. it got to be really annoying. thank you","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:16Z"}},{"id":"6173802383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"scrumptious 😌✨","title":"absolute GARBAGE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"terrible app! i opened it to a very discomforting orange cheeto on my screen and i immediately needed bleach for my eyes! when i downloaded the app, all bad sorts of stuff started happening and everything went downhill from there. this app doesn’t provide any useful information or anything necessary, so if u are thinking of getting this app, DO NOT!! the app is absolute garbage and the name is just a no. it’s a waste of space on your phone and i know we all love a little extra storage so NO we don’t need this app at all💕 be mindful please and be careful this whole app is a displeasure. to save others precious time, save a friend/family member from downloading this app! also how sad, i remember booking 4 tickets to the upcoming trump rallies, but i forgot i had to walk my pet bread 😌bread comes before a musty orange all day any day. anyways i luv gen z 🥰","date":"2020-07-08T21:33:59Z"}},{"id":"6173762178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"~zina~","title":"would give -5 stars if i could","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app seemed really exciting at first, but it got annoying pretty fast. basically it just asks you to put in headphones and stare blankly at your screen while it hypnotizes you and chants “TRUMP FOR DICTATOR, TRUMP FOR DICTATOR” and “THE RAMP WAS VERY SLIPPERY (VERY SLIPPERY)” i sat there for maybe an hour (or more; it’s vary easy to lose track of time) but eventually i had to go pee so i got up and went to the bathroom. as soon as i closed the bathroom door i couldn’t help but chant as well. when i washed my hands and looked in the mirror he 🍊was there staring back at me. then everything when orange and i fell into a pit and now i’m stuck down here. so anyway, i think my body is possessed now, spreading hate and stupidity and suffering but i’m glad i can at least write this review :)\n\nbasically, i wouldn’t REALLY recommend this app?? it’s kinda humid in the pit. idk","date":"2020-07-08T21:19:00Z"}}]}
