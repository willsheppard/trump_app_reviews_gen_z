All I found was a funny little Oompa Loompa trying to steal my money. 👁👄👁 what? Girl you messed with the wrong chick. The whole time the app made my phone smell like pee in a toilet of a derelict McDonalds bathroom. STANKY! NO GOOD! WAVING MY ARMS AROUND! MAKING NOISE! CYNTHIA. JESUS DIED FOR OUR CYN-THI-A’S. Anyways very bad app, my phone immediately exploded upon use and it called my mother the B word. If I could I would give it 0 out of 5 stars for purple burping my grandparents. They have no nipples :(","date":"2020-07-09T02:00:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174542488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"End3r_mage9","title":"Horrible App","review":"I downloaded this app to show my support for our president Donald J Trump and when I opened it I was greeted with a terrible smell and it persisted for as long as I kept it open. No matter how hard I try to do things the smell is so overwhelming that I cannot stand it. After a long internal debate I deleted the app from my phone and decided to leave this review to prevent other devout supporters like myself from experiencing such a detrimental stench.","date":"2020-07-09T01:51:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174530286","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"This is Bella!","title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"From the start it you could just tell it wasn’t good. Like the pictures and instructions were all over the place. Ripoff Cheeto man. Don’t even get me started on the notifications and all money the app tries to get you to spend for whatever reason. So many notifications too, some being really offensive too, like who builds an app like that? This app should be taken down. Save your time it’s a scam!","date":"2020-07-09T01:48:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174514653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Zacheryroachman","title":"I’m an orphan now","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app an orange hand shot through the screen and stole my parents and dog. In the screen I saw a pig lookin Cheeto begin to eat my parents. I quickly deleted the app in hopes that at least my dog survived but they never came back. Two days later I got a letter in the mail saying ‘yo, your parents were tasty. Also we’re sending you to the orphanage. Get rekt lol.’ Please I just want my parents back.","date":"2020-07-09T01:43:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174464724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"belenojeda1202","title":"A nono for me","review":"I downloaded the app to see what our big Cheeto bunker baby president had to say. All went down from there, as soon as I opened the app a 69yo white supremacist came to my door and started levitating while he sang an opera song that was about a Cheeto. Then when I tried to delete it, the white supremacist outside mentally sent me a vision of big Cheeto naked getting an orange tan. My eyes burn til this day. I had to go to therapy to get that image out of my mind","date":"2020-07-09T01:29:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174449162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"hb1053","title":"This app needs to be deleted !!","review":"This app killed my grandmother! I was feeding my pet rock whilst gardening my pants, and my grandmother came out of the ocean (her and her roommate live in a pineapple), and needed to use my phone. I gave her my iPod4 and she came across an add for this app.  She fell immediately into a coma, and my good friend The Rock carried her 500 miles to the nearest hospital. Later that night my grandmother, Hellen Keller, died due to this horrible event. I rate this app a 0/10, I do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174444430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"o. s. h. i. o. z. e.","title":"Horrible wast of time 😡","review":"Do not waste your time getting this app as soon as I download it it told me my phone is been hacked then seconds after that the entire screen went black I couldn’t press home and try to leave the app and then next thing I know my phones glitching long story short I have a new phone now total waste of time zero out of 10 do not recommend at all😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👿","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174437609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Sofy_sof","title":"terRIBLE","review":"Can honestly say, as a federalist from the 1700’s, this is the worst locale to get news. It is easier to read the newspaper for your local newsboy. Back in my day, we would have duels like real men. I would certainly challenge Mr. Trump for a duel if the setting allowed for it. My father, a scotsman, would have also gladly personally seen the end of Mr. Trump. This is just like when the colonies united in fighting against British Rule. Overthrow the government and do not fear anarchy!","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:30Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174417125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kaila1313","title":"THE WORST APP EVER","review":"This app is the SLOWEST and GLITCHIEST app I have ever seen in my life!!! Nothing works and it takes forever for anything to load no matter what u do to refresh it or delete it and download it again. There is nothing worse than this app. Nothing but random pictures here and there, there is no organization of what u can do, and again it freezes and logs u out only for u to wait years for it to open up again. WORST APP EVER!","date":"2020-07-09T01:15:18Z","isEdited":false}}]}
