Every time I open the app it crashed. So many glitches in so many bugs and so many parasites running throughout this app it needs an update immediately. I do not think I will be downloading any app like this of any kind any time soon.","date":"2020-07-09T16:08:14Z"}},{"id":"6177290714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mack_s_2001","title":"BLM and LGBTQ+ Live Matter!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Once I downloaded this app, I kept on getting multiple spam calls that would come every 2 min. It is a waste of time and effort to download. And it gives you more problems than it solves. (And I’m a republican) Also: unless Trump accepts everyone and gives EVERYONE equal rights, he’s not getting my vote in 2020. (BLM and LGBTQ+ family)","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:09Z"}},{"id":"6177260429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RenegadeOut","title":"This app took my dog 😭","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was in my bedroom when it happened, my dog and I were just simply enjoying a good time but then ICE raided our house and threatened to take my dog if I don’t show proper IDs. I showed them his birth certificate stating he was born and raised in the US but since his name originated from Mexico they took him anyways 😭 please do not download this app if you have a Chihuahua.","date":"2020-07-09T15:57:22Z"}},{"id":"6177226985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nani🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD; VERY SCARY PICTURES OF ORANGES","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i download this app thinking i was going to be supporting my president but in reality is was this really big orange that popped up on my screen when i first clocked the “open app” once i downloaded it. i got very scared so i immediately got off the app to leave this review. please change the picture to someone else.

Terrible\nI got it to work only once, and even then it was slow, kept glitching, and made it hard to gather information! I don’t want a president who does not care enough to fix this. Not voting for Trump.","date":"2020-07-09T15:47:12Z"}},{"id":"6177204783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"theycallmetheycallmeeee","title":"Honestly A Horrible App🖤","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Before hopping in the TikTok bandwagon I decided to open the app to see just how bad it was. Before I could even identify how awful and disorganized the information was, the app crashed. This continued over and over until I decided it wasn’t worth it. I hope this app gets taken off the App Store!","date":"2020-07-09T15:41:13Z"}},{"id":"6177187930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Summer👌🏻👌🏼👌🏽👌🏾👌🏿","title":"Why","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Donald Trump is an imbecile that has absolutely nothing going for him. He’s racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic, and much more. I am confused on why he is “president” (I refuse to call him my president) and I am offended by the hurtful and rude statements he makes. Please get annoying orange 2.0 out of office so our country can try to reverse the almost irreversible damage he has done.","date":"2020-07-09T15:36:25Z"}},{"id":"6177168300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cutest_rat","title":"Veryyy bad app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app glitches a lot and always crashes plus after I got the app I was hoping for news however some weird things have been happening to my phones like it will just shut off and that’s never happened before I do not recommend this app","date":"2020-07-09T15:30:54Z"}},{"id":"6177162066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kathy Lan","title":"what the","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"the app is just not good, it looks so sketchy and weird.  When i opened the app I saw that you had to sign up and that trump was bribing you to sign up because it said, “Get $1,000 transferred into venmo if you sign up.  Obviously I did because I’m no fool and it’s a scam.

After I gave that info, a few days later, I got hacked and had to get a new phone. Then he tried texting me and said it was the Russians and not him...
