Our president has done nothing but be a gigantic waste of time. Instead of trying to figure how to make the coronavirus cases slow down and how to give justice and peace to all the Poc out there he has done nothing but attempt to ban a kids app because he feels threatened by children, he has refused to enforce quarantine laws and now coronavirus cases have spiked in america more than any other country, black people are losing there lives at the hands of the people who are supposed to protect them and america is falling into shambles but what he has done has condoned a bunch of hate crimes to anyone that isn’t a racist sexist homophobic white supremacist trump supporter and this app has done nothing but feed the flames to a bunch of racists. I can’t believe i trusted a child to do an adults job if it came down to me i would delete this app off the face of the earth.","date":"2020-07-08T16:10:14Z","userName":"lyriklaws"}},{"id":"6172338557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"heyo, something traumatic happened that changed my life check ☑️","rating":1,"review":"it all started three weeks ago when I downloaded this app...🌝 at first everything was normal, but 20 minutes after the initial download, a HUGE mob of non-cheeto-crunchers barged into my home and started painting everything orange😡🍊after my entire home was permanently carrot orange, they all headed out and rushed back to their swamp 😤 I was left standing there MORTIFIED the orange made my eyes bleed and I took to my phone for comfort☺️ only to find that everything on my mobile device had been hacked! 😩my background was changed to a segsy nakey picture of the gorgeous president himself😰 and all my apps were turned into a small icon of his gorgeous face back when he was is Tulsa 😽 not two minutes later, Grump leaped our of my scream and started campaigning 💩 I used my quick thinking to grab him by his tie and YEET him back through my phone😧😌anyway, I quickly deleted the app and it’s safe to say I will not be getting it again 🧚🏼\u200D♂️ the ONLY hood thing that came out of this whole thing is that Barry B.

A bottom of the dumpster Cheeto appeared on my screen and it scared the absolute life outta me 😍 i logged out of the app literally having some sort of emotional attack bc seeing something so disturbing caught me off guard yk? and then, I decided to go back on it because maybe just maybe the little orange Cheeto I was seeing on my screen would go away. IT DIDNT. it got worse 😩 i looked up just for a sec and writing on my walls started to appear. I tried to grab all of my cleaning supplies my mom probably wouldn’t want me to waste to scrub it off. Eventually I decided that enough was enough with the cleaning, I was going extreme. I grabbed my vacuum that took half my life to get up the stairs and I turned it on. I vacuumed all of the ugly red and words off my wall and IT WAS SO CLEAR TO ME. our ✨orange blob ✨ really knew wassup. I want a taco atm and I miss my best friend also does anyone want anything from Walmart bc I’m about to take the best trip of my life over there. anyways good bye","date":"2020-07-09T14:44:43Z","userName":"GonzalezSierra"}},{"id":"6176999621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"i ended up in a tree!!","rating":1,"review":"so on my way to obama’s pizza party (with ice cream too) i downloaded this app for ✨navigation✨ and it DID NOT HELP!! i tripped over and apple and fell down a well then 💅TUMBLED💅 through a secret path and slid down the 🧿slide🧿 and found a group of gen z like the baddies they are🥰😛💅 anyways we all saw a spider and SCCCCRRRREEEEEAAAAAMMMMEEEDDDDD but then, there was racist trump! and we all dived on top of him and got all orangy which was s c a r y😭 but we can handle almost anything like eating tipods🎣🤠 anyways we ran into a group of freshmen boys who were trump supporters and they said that they ran out of fish to hold so we made them be 🎣fish🎣 then we held them up, posted it bc yk yk🤳 then we called our bean friends to help and we all made it safely to obama’s pizza party! \n\nBUT THEN WE MISSED IT \nwe all desperately cried because pizza is good but then we found some more food and it was an orange and when i took a bite in it, i realized it was trump sneaking in! we through him out the window and he went “wooaahaaooosoaohahsuwidjjs”\nyes this is a true story, i would give y’all my snap but like i’m not doing that fbi stuff because ig we’re “bots”❤️","date":"2020-07-09T14:44:34Z","userName":"travel_my_world_girl"}},{"id":"6176787975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump App","rating":1,"review":"Since our president is the BEST president in the WORLD, I decided to download this Trump 2020 app, but I ran into multiple problems that were an inconvenience. #1, it wouldn’t even enter my phone number in!! I would try multiple times, but none of my numbers worked. I am pretty sure I know my own phone number. #2, once I did get in, the whole app was so unorganized. I had no idea where anything was, and it was so hard to navigate my way around everything without clicking something and messing up. #3, the information on the app was not believable. I had a hard time understanding what exactly you were trying to present to me. I mean, it kind of reminded me of a 3 year olds work, but you are still the BEST president. Even if you are racist. Right? After the apps mess ups, I just decided to delete it because there were WAYYYYY too many problems and I just couldn’t handle it. \n\nIf I had to give you some advice, maybe reconstruct your app for people like me who needed help finding things. (Or just delete the app permanently). But you are still totally the BEST president in the world.

If I’m being honest with you I really wanted to get some tips on how he gets that orange tinge to his tan. 🤫Unfortunately I never got those tips. This app took ten hours to download for absolutely nothing! No tanning tips, no nothing. Now my phone is glitching constantly, at first “trump 2020” would pop up on my screen, which was fine. But then “Black Lives Matter” messages starting popping up on my screen, this was a threat to my well being! 😡 I thought MY president didn’t support such an outrages movement. After all, he refuses to say those words on live television. To make matters worse when I told my neighbor Shelby I had the app she said she no longer wanted to be friends with someone who supports “a Cheeto who divides the country.” Shelby if you’re reading this, I VOTED FOR THIS PRESIDENT TO GET RID OF THOSE LIBERALS AND SHOW THEM WHOS BOSS. Unlike other presidents who respect both parties this presidents knows the less intelligent you are the more dominant you become. This app did absolutely nothing but make me question his views.

But then, everything changed. My phone starting making this weird beep noise, at first I thought it was my fire alarm, but then I realized it was coming from the phone. As I looked closer I noticed that the screen kept flickering a face on and off it, I couldn’t make out the face at first, but then I realized who it was. It was the devil himself. He extended a hand to me and before I could run pulled me into the phone. I screamed and tried to pull free but it was to late, I was digitized. We began to battle as we fell deeper and deeper into cyber space (or at least that’s where I think we were), he pulled out a blade and began to wield it at me, I could to nothing but raise my arms which were immediately severed. His first breath burned my skin and I screamed in pain. This went on for what felt like days until all of a sudden I was back in my room, armless and burned. Every so often I hear my phone beep and I am scared to look at it. I keep it hidden in a jar surrounded by salt for safe measure......","date":"2020-07-09T11:23:40Z","userName":"this app tried to kill me"}},{"id":"6174523561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"review":"i was walking to my local food bank to donate but When i got in the line was super long so i decided to checkout the app while i was waiting. I was so excited to get my merch but right as i opened it i saw a horrifying picture of a cheeto with dementia assaulting an underaged girl. I tried to close the app but it froze my phone!! Then the cheetos mouth started moving and yelling RACIST and TRANSPHOBIC things at the black trans woman behind me!!! 😤😤 I proceeded to power off my phone but not before she decided to hit me in the head with her bag for those EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE STATEMENTS. Then donald trump himself showed up because apparently it’s against the law to close the app (you have to read that in the description i found out the hard way) donald trump and his goons proceeded to throw me in a bag and shoved me out the store under a BUS!!! after i was ran over i smelled like hot cheetos FROM THE APP!! and my phone had been broken. When i got home i tried to turn it back on but my phone had gotten a virus from the app and stole all my info so now the FBI has me in a prison cell next to pennywise the clown!! 🤡🤡🤡🤡 I HATE THIS APP NEGATIVE STARS 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎","date":"2020-07-09T01:46:21Z","userName":"Miss Bon Qui Qui Bang Bang"}},{"id":"6174373189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"don't vote for him!!","rating":1,"review":"ok so who wants to vote for him anyway he's disgusting and why does this app even exist, he's racist and he likes younger children also he never makes sense what did we do wrong for him to ban tiktok he probably doesn't even like lgbtq and just because he doesn't, doesn't mean he has to ban it he's not keeping America great he's done nothing good that i can think of his son can't do anything he's asked for help and trump is just rude and out of ALL the APPS you can think of it's this one but why? you know a lot of people use this so why ban it whats the point i cant believe people actually vote for him and they shouldn't they should actually ban the trump supporters on the app little kids use this and have fun with it so why do it. people worked hard with that app for fans for anxiety,depression, friends, i mean what will help us when we can't go anywhere this is really the only app that you can have fun and talk to people this is how all the fun started literally everybody has this app i've seen people get better from being sad and people helping them i mean what did we do?😐.","date":"2020-07-09T01:02:00Z","userName":"c7srets"}}]}
