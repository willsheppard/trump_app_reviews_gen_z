Several people live streamed to their facebook pages and gawked at his flawless blonde comb over and natural spray tan. he called me up on stage and used me as an example for all to see. he said “I, Donald J Trump, approve of this message.” i was then escorted home by the secret service and my mother met me at the door. i walked inside and saw...HARRY STYLES? i could smell his cologne wafting through the air as i slowly drifted off, only to wake up to the sound of ariana grande singing me a lullaby. she kissed me on the lips then told me that baguettes are better then dinner rolls. i then realized that my whole life had been a lie. so i don’t reccomend this app for you may have the same traumatizing experience."}},{"id":"6175654445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my life","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:13Z","userName":"Cola.socks","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate this app SO MUCH 😡. Wanna know why? It took me 2 years to download this app and when it finally downloaded my life had turned upside down. First off, when I opened the app I got a text message from Donald trump telling me if I eat dogs for a living bc I’m Asian. I told him that I don’t eat dogs and you’re just stereotyping Asians thinking they eat dogs. He then said the WORST thing someone could ever say, “Are you lost baby gorl?” When I say I was fuming I WAS FUMMMMING 😡🤬. I am a 21 year old who is married to my lovely husband, Jimmy Neutron and we are currently expecting a newborn girl in September. Then Trump had the CAUCASITY to say, “She 👩🏽 like 💋 Papi 👨🏼 I 😡 adore ❤️ you, I’m 😳 like 😍 baby 👼🏻 I 🧚🏼 ain’t 🙅🏽\u200D♀️ normal 😱, GRRRR 🦁, Foreigner 💕, Foreigner 💕, Foreigner 💕.” I felt violated by this comment assuming I was a foreigner 😡🤬, NOT cool. I was born and raised in America with my lovely mother, Gertrude Buckets and my proud father, Bobby Buckets, who are both from England but came to America to have a better life. I am disappointed and DISGUSTED by our president who has made me feel violated when messaging me. Not only that, he had also wanted me to show my double D’s and my🐱even though I am a MARRIED 💍 woman. My family did not come to America to have a better life but this is what we get for being on stolen land *cough cough* stupid colonizers. BTW, he said that my dog looks like a “Ching Chong rat that looks like it has been hit with Madonna’s purse 69 times.” He had also proceeded to call me “Ching Chong segesy Lady at Panda Express.” I clearly stated that I am not Chinese and that Ching Chong is RACIST 😡🙅🏽\u200D♀️. A friend of mine, who is bisexual, had also downloaded this app to “support” our president but then texted her saying “I can make you straight 😏😈✨.” He had also proceeded to mail her his soggy socks while texting her, “my children are in there 😈.” For personal reasons, I will be moving to Japan after our daughter is born to go live with a family member of mine, Uncle Iroh. I had downloaded the trump app to support our not racist, not homophobic, and not mysoginistic president but my expectations were just too high. 0/10 would not recommend this app unless you wanna ruin your life. 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💅🏼"}},{"id":"6175650448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WHATEVER YOU DO DONT DOWNLOAD THIS HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:49Z","userName":"notlikingdonald","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First off I would give this zero stars if it was possible. I downloaded this app to gain perspective on our wonderful NON racist,sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic president. I was excited to support him but then it just all went downhill. When I opened the app it asked for my email I thought it was strange but I still signed up, I got an email saying that my account was registered which seemed normal enough until I got an email from Donald himself asking me if I had a boyfriend!!! I found this so creepy he’s literally MARRIED!!!! I ignored that email but soon many followed. This man, this duck stalked me asking me for my address, saying I had sexy elbows and even asking me what kind of slippers I wear. That was very unprofessional and not very president like. I woke up the next morning to more desperate attempts of him trying to seduce me. I was reading these emails as I heard a knock at my door come to find 69 Oompa Loompas trying to attack me and behind them while I’m being attacked stands Donald screaming at me so loud that his orange skin turns red! He’s telling me to leave a good review and practically threatening me he said if I un downloaded the app he would kidnap my family tie them up and use telekinesis powers on them! After being violently attacked I quickly lock my door and get rid of the app. Just when I think I’m in the clear 69 ommpa loompas come at me again breaking my window and slapping my elbow until it grows hair!!! I escaped by calling my friends on stan twitter to come save the day. I found Donald and his gang of ommpa loomaps very childish and creepy not appropriate!  Don’t download I have been hacked, doxed, and attacked from this crazy crazy app. I wouldn’t wish this on anybody not even the orange! DONALD AND THIS STUPID APP ARE YUCKY!!! \n(Btw I am suing them for my elbow hairs and pain see you in court mr. prez xoxo gossip girl 💕"}},{"id":"6175649446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:28Z","userName":"Classroomassroom","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Absolutely trash app worst on the App Store"}},{"id":"6175612897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of time and Data","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:08Z","userName":";);!:!:$","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app ever 🤮"}},{"id":"6175576128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Orange is the new dump","date":"2020-07-09T07:37:37Z","userName":"TakisLover69420","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app made me get bunions on my left big toe."}},{"id":"6175569320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"uhh no","date":"2020-07-09T07:35:07Z","userName":"Speedla06fast","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is absolutely disgusting . no one likes it. its horrible!! and doesnt work!! good! who would want it in the first place. it stole my window 😡😡"}}]}
