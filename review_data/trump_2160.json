Needless to say I danced an unhappy jig, how else could I am black trump supporter sell out my race other than being at a trump rally. Nevertheless I plodded on like  a good raccoon does. I continued to scroll only to see the single most offensive image I’ve ever had the misfortune of viewing. His cheeto puff invaded my eyes and as of now I have yet to find enough bleach to properly baptize  my eyes. What could I have done in a past life to deserve this??? Everyday I wonder 😭😔. Maybe it was selling out my fellow negro to slave catchers, or constantly voting to destroy my community. I as a black conservative will never know.","date":"2020-07-09T00:53:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"Hdndbhsusnsn","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174146446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is Fake News","review":"I usually wake up in the morning to a cup of Joe that my wife Hannah gets me (women’s place is in the kitchen, am I right boys?? Barefoot and pregnant is the way I like it! #ProLife) and Fox News on my tv. Trump is my inspiration in life, because he reminds me of myself! They use to tell me “Kyle, you’ll never amount to anything if you don’t work hard!” Ha! When Donny came along my entire life changed, finally someone unqualified, entitled and selfish as me got somewhere in life! The WHITE HOUSE BABY! Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. Unfortunately this app did not stand up to my high standards so I have to give it a low rating. I thought Trump would be giving step by step tips for me to get where he is, but it only talks about his campaign. Doesn’t matter, I already tell Hannah I’m going to be just like Donny one day! A WINNER! God Bless America!","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:33Z","rating":1,"userName":"MinafromJersey","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174018936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto King","review":"Downloading this app I wasn’t sure what I was in for, but when the image of the big Cheeto King seared its way into my eyeballs, I had a feeling that my life was about to take a turn for the worst. Upon downloading the app, strange things started occurring in my life. Often at times I would hallucinate and see the Cheeto himself upon a wall, but the only thought I had was of Humpty Dumpty himself. After thinking that, the orange puff fell and crumbled on the ground, a traumatic sight to see really. He haunts me wherever I go, even my unicorn has rode off into the sunset at this point. Don’t get me started on the traumatizing images that will forever haunt my dreams that are within the app. Cheeto kings hair is a whisk away from evaporating, I’m terrified that I too will lose my hair. Please protect me, he is everywhere. Whatever you do, DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP.","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:21Z","rating":1,"userName":"Pretty kitty 99000","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173872849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ew.. just ew..","review":"So, I’d LOVE to say that this app is disgusting because it helps Donlad Trump (I hate him) and i don’t like cheeto puffs and cheeto puffs are equivalent to Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a very tiny penis as well. He doesn’t deserve to be president after being racist, promoting sexual assault on women, being a rapist and much MUCH more. Donald Trump doesn’t deserve an app he doesn’t deserve anything good. He deserves to get raped. He is even so afraid that he hides in a bunker. How can he be president when he can’t even face consequences or even try to handle what’s going on in the United States. He deserves to be in prison and he doesn’t deserve any supporters. I don’t get how they still support him after everything he has done. He needs to be burned alive and dumped into a river. He doesn’t deserve anything good in life. Alright that’s about it, that’s my review. Bye...","date":"2020-07-08T22:01:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"zayzay144🙈","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173760384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Deformed Cheeto puff","review":"Hello I am 21 years old and I was so excited to get on this app because I respect our amazing president make America great again he definitely isn’t making America the worst 😯 when I downloaded the app my WiFi was really fast and for some reason it took hours and hours to download😔 I just wanted to support our amazing president🍊 when I got on the app it started glitching so much and it kept showing a picture of a deformed Cheeto puff that looked as if he was wearing orange make up🟠 I really just wanted to support our president since all the boomers said it was good✨ the app was the worst experience of my life cockroaches started crawling all over my phone ❄️ I hate this app and don’t recommend it our President mr Cheeto puff failed us again😢 make America great again by kicking him out of the office 🥳","date":"2020-07-08T21:18:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"Josie😌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173755874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My family died because of this app","review":"I’m very disappointed. This app took 3 months to download and when it finally did my phone caught on fire 🔥 Later that day i started to smell something, it kinda smelled like oranges 🍊 but the smell almost killed me. I heard my door bell ring and opened the door to find little trump rats and i about died right then and there but i held myself together and called the police  The police said they aren't able to help because they are busy thinking they’re above the law. i quickly hung up and hid under my couch, i waited under my couch for about 17 hours. when i got up and asked one of trumps rats what the weather was and one of them said “SHUT UP WE ARE BUSY HELPING ARE ORANGE GOD”  so naturally i set them on fire which burnt my house down. and thats how this app killed my entire family✨","date":"2020-07-08T21:16:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jillian.foster","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173500232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I do not recommend this app that is full of False news","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app I kept getting tons of adds popping up on my phone and some even said my phone was being hacked. I Immediately tried to delete the app but it WOULD NOT DELETE... It than somehow connected to my tv screen and it show picture of this orange Cheeto puff saying a bunch of lies. I had to cover my children’s eyes and ears so they would stop crying. this app needs to be removed from this AppStore immediately. The next generation doesn’t need to know what this thing has been saying.. Donald J Trump was never meant to be a president so Why does he have his own app- THIS APP IS GLITCHING MY PHONE... oh ok nvm I figured out how to delete it- but I don’t want this app to be in view with any children. so DONT GET THIS OUTRAGEOUS LYING APP- it’s not good for your health children!","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:07Z","rating":1,"userName":"Donald TRUMP IS A LYING PIG","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173457886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Spiders, married cousins, and insecure granny","review":"This app was NASTY, when I downloaded it the first thing that popped up was a notification saying “I hate your grandma” THE SHEER DISPRESPECT. Then when I set my phone down it started playing sweet home Alabama!! Then my two cousins started kissing, and I know trump would want the law to be obeyed so I think this app has to go, think of all the other cousins that are in danger!! Then after that happened I got a call from a number called “trump” I answered and then a bunch of SPIDERS came crawling out of my toilet!! We now have married cousins and a spider issue, not to mention my grandma is feeling very self conscious because of that first notification, this is the worst app ever, makes illegal things happen, AND WILL DESTROY YOUR HOUSE DO NOT GET THIS I THINK APPLE SHOULD TAKE IT DOWN RIGHT NOW. \nTo: Apple and 🍊\nFrom: very conserned costumer","date":"2020-07-08T19:31:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"DONT GET OR ELSE","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173449740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst","review":"I decided to download the app because I wanted to educate myself and stay current with politics, however, it might possibly have single handedly been the worst decision of the month. Now I know what you’re thinking - bad decision of the month??? But it wasn’t of the whole year bc nobody went missing and there weren’t any near death experiences. Anyway back to the app - It didn’t download correctly and when I opened it for the first time my phone crashed. I went to go take it to the Apple store and I dropped my phone and it cracked so terribly and then a black cat walked in front of my pathway and later that day I got fired. The tech guy at the Apple store said that my phone had some malware on it and honestly I take what you want from that but I’m blaming everything on the app and the bad aura I felt.","date":"2020-07-08T19:28:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"123456789keely","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172946170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"broke my phone 😤","review":"i had the app downloaded and had use it multiple times but it was very glitchy and didn’t work well for me! i’m very concerned for my friend because she also has the app too and this app broke my iphone 11 pro max and i don’t want it to break hers too! please get this app banned and off the app store it is horrible and a waste of storage i no longer have the app installed on my new phone ( my old phone broke because of a VIRUS ON THE APP THAT BROKE MY IPHONE 11 PRO MAX  ) please take this off the app store now! i made my daughter delete it since it broke her phone also ( her phone is acting very slow and glitchy lately ever since she downloaded it ) i would NOT RECCOMEND GETTING THIS APP IT HAS A VIRUS THAT BROKE MY PHONE, IS A WASTE OF STORE + TIME AND US VERYYY GLITCHY PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP AND IT TRACKED DOWN MY LOCATION,CREDIT CARD, SOCIAL SECUIRTY NUMBER!
