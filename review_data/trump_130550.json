I download this app with the intentions of ordering a top of the line donald Trump butt plug but my search unfortunately came to a blinding holt. As soon as I found the PERFECT one, the whole app crashed, and so did my phone, but not before it stole my credit card information. I’ve had to cancel the card, my identity has been stole, and my credit will be forever ruined. If I could give this a zero star review, I would.","title":"Plug your holes"}},{"id":"6174633524","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"mayo5837","review":"This app made my phone smell like piss and it gave me 4875728394892837374 viruses","title":"MY PHONE SMELLS LIKE PISS NOW"}},{"id":"6174633370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:34Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"alli65269","review":"worst app ever.","title":"alli64794"}},{"id":"6174633249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:32Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Jimmy the GenZer","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with the current “president” and all of his attempts at governing the country or as he likes to say “making america great again.” But sadly shortly after installing the application I ran into numerous issues. The main being a virus I received. The virus is highly dangerous to not only iPhone but to all smartphone users. And, similar to another well known virus, is highly contactable by smartphones. The apps developers were well aware of the virus during its early stages but, despite the concerns of its users, dismissed it, similar to how the “presidents” administration did with a different type of virus. Labeling it as a small bug that could handle itself. But as you can see that wasn’t the case and the virus has spread and is stronger than anyone had anticipated. If something was done when concerns were initially expressed we could have possibly minimized the damages and changes to our devices functionality that the virus had created. Continuing on, another issue that I faced with the app was that it offered better functionality and more features on iPhones versus other smartphone devices. This unfair aid given to iPhone users allows them to be more well informed and have more access than the users on different smartphone devices creating a divide among all smartphone users. Though it is not the fault of the iPhone users that they receive better features and access to the apps content, it is in part their responsibility to alongside the other smart phone users continue to express to the apps developers that the system they have set up for the app is unfair and unjust. I would like to point out that this has been a concern expressed by multiple smartphone users, including iPhone, to the developers of the app since the establishment of the app. But due to the recent rise in anger and frustration generated by the poor handling of the applications virus in addition to the continuous harsh and unfair treatments that the application inflicts on non-iPhone users. Not only I, but all smartphone users are tired and fed up with the poor administration and lack of care for its users that the developers have. Again, ironically similar to how the current “president’s” administration treats its citizens or lack of a better word “users”. \n-\nYour fave\nXOXO another GenZer\n🙂🤧✨💫🦋🧚🏾\u200D♂️ \n\n#blm\n#blacklivesmatter\n#whyiswetheonlyoneloosingtoms.rona?🤨\n#longlivetiktok","title":"Virus contracted due to app’s corrupt system 🤕🦠"}}]}
