First, a BURNT orange, Cheeto is the first thing you see... like I don’t want to see that, like ever. Then you make an account and BOOM, you get spam phone calls about Trump and UNRELENTING notifications. Even when you try to turn them off, they keep getting on their knees, asking for a vote and they’ll do it for ANYTHING (and I mean anything 😉). I guess that’s a benefit. But, if you look at the ratings and reviews from others, I relate and understand how frustrating the app is; crashing, not user friendly, not American enough, not sexist, racist, white supremacist, bigot, ignorant, selfish, soulless enough for the app. I mean COME ON! We need that! That’s how everyone sees him, so WHY aren’t they advertising it?! Anyways, horrible, terrible, huge mistake, worst invention in the history of America. -100000/10. Do not recommend. 🙅\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T21:58:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178382311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump tried🥰🥳and he failed as always🤪💅🏻","userName":"igloo gorl","review":"I wanted to see what this whole trump app was about so I got it and right away I was shown a big orange 🍊 it made me laugh a bit! Then my phone was spammed with viruses 🦠 one of the viruses came outta the screen and attacked me😾 once it stopped it said its name was barnie😦 he then took of his suit and I relized it was Barbie the dinosaur 🦕 he was a trump supporter too! We danced to dance monkey 🐒 but then all of the sudden a helicopter 🚁 crashed into my house😤 Donald trump came out of it😱he said he signed up for the FBI but he didn’t know it meant Fart But Igloo😒he told me because it meant that he had to live in an igloo for the rest of his life and fart in it 💨😖he also said he was being controlled by his butt🤯his butt made him trash my house and then he ABDUCTED ME A BARNIE! 😢🤬he was taking us too his igloo in his helicopter when it said that the helecopter could support his overweight self🥵so he through barnie outta the helicopter and I could here barnie singing the 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑎 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡 song as he was falling to his death 😭😖😟the helicopter then crashed again in his igloo but it was too late🤭😪Donald’s Butt had made him suffocate himself😩I couldn’t do anything so I called my mom to come pick me up... but somehow we were in ANTARCTICA! 🥶 I was deserted there for 62,000😭 but one day finally my dog walked past me and said”OMG I FOUND YOU AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!😧🤭I cried in happiness and btw after the last years dogs do developed a voice and the power to travel alone so that’s how he found me...🥴🤕he took me home too his mansion and that’s the end. So moral of the story if you don’t want to get kidnapped by some crazy Trump guy and have him throw your best friend Barnie out of a helicopter window and then be stranded at an igloo in Antarctica for 62,000 years then have your talking and walking dog come pick you up and take you back to his mansion then don’t download the app😤😳🤯🧚\u200D♀️✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T21:58:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178381210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","userName":"@mnriley2004","review":"Yes I saw this on tik tok so add me @mnriley2004, but fr this guy is trying to ban tiktok so for that reason we ban his app, Horrible app","date":"2020-07-09T21:57:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178381134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😡😡","userName":"crazyypinkkwigg","review":"trump sucks😪","date":"2020-07-09T21:57:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178380435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad","userName":"blackninja5000","review":"Really bad.Its also really big on misinformation.So no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T21:57:32Z","isEdited":false}}]}
