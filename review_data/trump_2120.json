It smelt like rotten oranges and cheese. Who knew it smelt worse than doo doo. 💩🤢🤮Then the ugly Cheeto had the audacity to start speaking to me about making “America great again” 👿when all that stinky Cheeto does is speak nonsense, CAP🧢 and cause nothing but chaos. So like anybody would i was going to break it in half and throw it in the trashhhhh 👁👅👁but I think it deserved more torture so I blended it😈🔥🤢🤢🤗🤗🤗I screamed YUH GET INTO IT for a good hour‼️If you follow Cheeto you are messed up in the head. 🥴🤡Yuhhhh I said it.

When it was done loading i opened the app and the second I opened it it started BLASTING music and pictures of Trump were popping up all over my screen. I closed out of the app quickly to see if that helped but it was all still on my screen and wouldn’t go away! MY PHONE THEN BLEW UP IN MY HANDS! I screamed and my hands fell off and my dog ate them. My dog started acting weird and started to TALK to me and told me the future! AND SHE WAS RIGHT! Trump knocked on my door and proceeded to dance on my dogs face and eat ALL our food. We are going to starve now since there is no food. OH, and he also dropped kicked my sister into africa! I don’t know when i’ll see her again. Anyway this wasn’t even the worst part, but I won’t get into that. TERRIBLE APP!!!!!!!!😗✌️😡😡","userName":"fjdjfixzybgfudhj","date":"2020-07-08T20:53:31Z"}},{"id":"6173591602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do NOT download this app!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this is the WORST app i’ve EVER used. when i first downloaded it, i noticed bizarre things happening. when i opened the app, it started glitching and vibrating my phone and ELECTROCUTED MY HAND! the burn from the shock was so severe that i had to go to the ER and replace my whole arm... when i was released from the hospital, i decided to give the app another chance, which was later, very regretted. when i went back to the app there was a disturbing photo of donald trump when he, donald himself, reached through the phone and yanked my hair out. i had severe bleeding and now i have a terrible bald spot on the back of my head.  when i thought the nightmare was over, donald killed my dog and took all the food out of my fridge :( this cannot go unnoticed and this horrific app should be  removed from the app store ASAP!!","userName":"fosjwnrkyr","date":"2020-07-08T20:17:23Z"}},{"id":"6173336767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app an hour ago and it took forever to fully download... then when I went on the app I was frightened when I saw a huge orange orangutan on my screen in front of an American flag. It was insanely slow and frightening to know that poor kids are able to experience this type of horror if they accidentally download this app without their parents consent. The font was also very hard to understand. The words about this president that some people claim was very inaccurate and wrong. I just want to pray for all the poor racist oompaloompa people that support this racist, homophobic, white supremacist of a person and pray that they find help in their future and are able to wash their minds of the dirty thoughts that they’re thinking inside of their ✨dirty little minds✨and always remember BLM and ACAB 💁🏽\u200D♀️🙈","userName":"Hiiiiii.bye","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:34Z"}},{"id":"6173292458","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Unreliable, not worth it","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Everything is really confusing and overall it is not user-friendly at all. It requires your information for you to use it, even if you’re already subscribed to Trump 2020 lists. I am so tired of having to put in all of my PERSONAL information just to get access to this app. Unfortunately, I can no longer reserve tickets for my entire family who wants to attend the rallies. Instead we have to go one by one and use our phone numbers. I feel so oppressed. It is completely ridiculous I wish my wife could speak to the manager but all this technology makes things so difficult. I didn’t think I would have to do this but this app definitely deserves 1 star. I would give it 0 stars if I could. \nI don’t think it’s worth it anymore #notTrump2020 💕","userName":"concerned_user47","date":"2020-07-08T18:35:05Z"}},{"id":"6173218035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app it was working pretty good at first but then it started glitching. I exited out then reopened the app to see it glitching back and forth from trumps face to an orange and I thought it was just my phone so I went and bought a new one. I downloaded the app again on my new device only for it to show videos of him saying a whole lot of words but saying nothing meaningful at all, turns out I was just on Twitter the whole time and gen z was making fun of him haha. In all seriousness though, this app ✨wonderfully✨ horrendous and I don’t want to see it anymore. It should ✨exit stage left✨. THE TRASH is where it belongs. I don’t want to hear of it’s existence any longer, we shall eliminate it from ALL apple devices. Who wants the virus of racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny, and etc. present on their device?","userName":"imhaley_a","date":"2020-07-08T18:10:37Z"}},{"id":"6173179493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT BUY","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"🏳️\u200D🌈 so I woke up in my room filled blm posters and I seen on TikTok that this app was amazing and I should buy it soooo I downloaded this app to support my favorite Cheeto😼😼 that’s totally not racist, Transphobic, homophobic, sexist and a pedo😻 and every thing was fine till I went on the app and put in all my info like my racist Cheeto😼😈 wanted me to because I trust him obviously✨ but I was WRONG because after I did that my phone starting smelling like Cheetos, Cheetos started flying around my room😳 I don’t even buy Cheetos so I was confused but I just went on with my day UNTIL my mom came into my room chanting “MAGA” and “ TRUMP 2020” I was TERRIFIED😿 then trump broke into my house😺 then I realized it was probably there app so I deleted it.

I don’t understand why they would need my phone number just to keep me updated on current events; it just doesn't make sense. This situation made me realize that if trump is doing this stuff over an app then he might be doing it with all of America’s info. With that being said, I am no longer a trump supporter and will be voting for Joe Biden, no matter the consequences. Lastly to throw this in there, the servers are extremely slow and laggy and I just overall wouldn’t recommend it. If i could give this app zero stars, best believe I would. Please save your storage and time and wake up!!","userName":"|•|•| Mr. Krabs","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:24Z"}}]}
