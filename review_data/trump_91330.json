Trump is trash. All men is trash except me and Timothée Shablagoo. Hate to hear it, hate to see it. When I downloaded this app I was on my way home and when I finally got to open it and see what it was about, I was sitting in my driveway and I was like “alright we’re here just sitting in the car🎹” I had no idea what I was getting into. I got on this app I thought it was a food ordering service like door dash or Uber eats. HOWEVERRRR, I was sadly mistaken. When I typed in “ILL HAVE THE TACOS PLEASE.” The response was not “tacos are not for breakfast.” In fact, the whole screen turned 🍊orange🍊and a face slowly started to fade in. AlI I could think was “please don’t be ugly. Please don’t be ugly. Pleeeaaase. Pleeaase.” Again, I was undoubtedly, utterly, and entirely disappointed as it became clear that the face belonged to Donald Trump. After about five minutes a banner flashed across the screen informing me that if I turned into a worm, trump wouldn’t love me. That was the last straw for me. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was truly traumatizing in every way imaginable. Here is a poem I wrote about my experience and time on this app. I climbed🧗out of my head💆\u200D♀️and watched👁 myself implode🧠🎊a thought☕️ without a body🧚🏼\u200D♂️ought to be🐝 the shot💪 to take📽 a load💃🏼 off my brain🧠is poisoned ☠️ and I’m searching🤳 for the antidote🥟 but every🦦 time I⏱ find it my defenses🧬 scream oh no🧲 you don’t🧶 whOAh🐗","isEdited":false,"title":"....................... ¿HELLO?👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T20:49:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"WiNSTiiiN"}},{"id":"6178191976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🤮🤢","isEdited":false,"title":"wish there was an option for 0 stars...","date":"2020-07-09T20:48:08Z","rating":1,"userName":"ILY_shawn"}},{"id":"6178189230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"my phone just kept glitching when i use it, pls fix the issue✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app","date":"2020-07-09T20:47:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"dihcstinl"}},{"id":"6178183164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🧚Trump 2020😍🥳🤩 is the year you will be assassinated ✨also the app is trash","isEdited":false,"title":"BAD","date":"2020-07-09T20:45:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"pretty pretty fun"}},{"id":"6178182340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t get this app I repeat don’t get it","isEdited":false,"title":"Booty app","date":"2020-07-09T20:44:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"milkdud375"}},{"id":"6178161538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app made my phone crash and i was sad because i didn’t get to see my king bunker boy 🍊😍","isEdited":false,"title":"bad app","date":"2020-07-09T20:37:38Z","rating":1,"userName":"EeveeRoo"}},{"id":"6178150969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible bro can we get Obama back","isEdited":false,"title":"🤮🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:57Z","rating":1,"userName":"crys serrano"}},{"id":"6178150538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worse it supports a racist and I’m a poc so yeah no","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible 🤮","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"twinshay1"}},{"id":"6178149900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"he really did something 🧚🦋🌸 now never do it again","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T20:33:37Z","rating":1,"userName":"QueenOfCamelot"}},{"id":"6178143681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app I have ever downloaded.","isEdited":false,"title":"Atrocious App","date":"2020-07-09T20:31:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"no rats should jiggle"}}]}
