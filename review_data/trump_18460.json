Naturally, I gave it. I was immediately sent a nude image of the president. I am now scarred for life and horrified. If the president is reading this, I would just like to let you know that if you’re so concerned about TikTok, make a secret account because we will ALL get a vpn and overlook your horrible judgement either way.

This is disgraceful to our country and should be  banned!!!  The Dance move itself is racist, with all the arm flapping! I will never look at the man the same way again! \nI also noticed the app was advertised Kim Jong-Un running for president of the United States! I can’t believe what is happening to our once, great nation.","rating":1,"title":"I can’t believe it!!","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:26Z","isEdited":false}}]}
