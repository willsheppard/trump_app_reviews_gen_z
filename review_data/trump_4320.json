Once the app was done loading I was greeted by a picture of a Cheeto which was ✨lovely✨. As I was scrolling through the app the couch 🛋 I was sitting on collapsed and fell through the floor😟. My grandma 👵🏻 happened to be vacuuming the fridge in the basement and the couch 🛋 landed right on her😬. Now I have a hole in the floor, a broken vacuum, a smushed fridge, and a dead grandma ⚰️👵🏻. We put “trump 2020” on the gravestone because grandma would have wanted that😞🙏. Rip grandma😣. Moral of the story is don’t get this app unless your grandma is already dead. But other than that it’s a fine app✨👍.","title":"✨This app killed my grandma✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"2020 genZ tiktok"}},{"id":"6173705259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:08Z","review":"this app has caused me severe anxiety 🧠 when it loads on it plays ▶️ a ringing noise 🛎that has caused many black outs 🕳when i go to sleep 💤 i wake up in the middle of the night to my soul going back into my body😳👻 also the ringing noises have attracted little orange cockroaches that look like donald trump🤡🍊 they march outside my window chanting all lives matter one of them crawled inside my ear so i grabbed it my the p😽ssy one of the cockroaches told me that he was going to shove a tracker up my 🍑 while i was sleeping and proceeded to ask me to go out with him for pizza 👁👄👁(iykyk) inconclusion i am going to sue donald trump unless he gives me barron then all charges will be dropped 👁👅👁","title":"WE LUV BARRON🤕👻","isEdited":false,"userName":"juicyjuicycake"}},{"id":"6173688845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:52:09Z","review":"this app is terrible i was so excited to be more educated and participate more regularly in the activities of MY president but it gave me the worst virus EVER my phone glitches so bad i had to get a new one. it pains me to write this but this app should NOT be here it’s embarrassing how the apple store would allow something like this to be here. by far the worst app i’ve ever gotten and i hope no one has to suffer like i did. apple please remove this app before it happens to anyone else as you can see many people have had this experience from the comments i read!!!

I downloaded it and it said I got a virus!! It said and I quote, “you got a virus, trump 2020 want to make sure you are only standing for him so this app gives you a little friend to track what you do and to make sure you never mention the phrases, DEFUND THE POLICE DUMP TRUMP GIVE WOMEN RIGHTS BLM etc otherwise we know you aren’t a true supporter.“ and then this awful sound started screeching from my phone and all these rats started to chase me!! They nibbled on my toes and I had to break my phone to make it stop, $700 down the drain😞 anyways I do NOT recommend this app to ANYONE, unless you like rats.","title":"Rats!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"sophiatorgrimson"}},{"id":"6173532847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:57:22Z","review":"WORT APP EVER. Soooooo disappointed in tronald dump for doing us like this 😩😩. The music t he app plays made my two year old son go DEAF in one ear and almost loss of hearing in the other. Also I’ve searched far and wide and this app need more of barron. In fact make the app just about Barron and it might actually be good for one 🙄. After I said do not allow notifications it keeps sending me notifications every day! Not to mention the hackers that come in and steal you info 😔 If this is our presidents app it shouldn’t be easy to hack and all of our info should be secured and safe😭😭😭. All I know is that you NO LONGER have my vote 😤😤 Anonymous 2020 💜💜","title":"WILL STEAL YOUR INFO, DO NOT GET","isEdited":false,"userName":"marshmalegho"}},{"id":"6173525759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:56Z","review":"I like many other people fully support Trump… so I was overjoyed to see there was an app for Trump 2020! 😊 BUT when I started to download the app it made my phone overheat and I had to leave it alone for AN HOUR😡. I just thought maybe my internet connection was slow or something but when I opened the app my phone shut off! Since I was expecting the worst already I just decided to leave my phone, AGAIN, and do some laundry😌✨. These meddling kids may actually be onto something with the glitching! Stay safe out there I think they need to update this app HEAVILY \nI DO NOT recommend getting this.
