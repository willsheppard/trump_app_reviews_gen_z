As soon as I downloaded it all my hair fell out! Now I am a big bandy and will have to get a matching trump wig to cover it up! It’s a scam to make us get a trump wig to silently promote his campaign! If you like having hair, I beg you not to download this!!! Save yourself and your follicles! Don’t do it! I miss the days when I could frolic in a meadow and get my hair all full of flower petals and dirt and now I can’t!

Then it asked for verification that I was a US citizen and wanted me to upload a copy of my birth certificate. I got in contact with someone about this and they said he had the app designed that way because he was on Xanax at the time. I kept wondering to myself why he would be taking Xanax but then I realized that’s it’s for Hispanic attacks.","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrifying Experience","userName":"ThisForTrumpYouOrangeBitch","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174787249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded it because I wanted to keep up to date on his campaign. But its so laggy and there are so many glitches. It has frozen up my phone so many times to where I couldn't do anything but restart it to get it to work again. It'll just randomly kick me out of the app. Its horrible. Honestly, I don't understand how an app can possibly be this bad. It's so annoying. Worst app ever. It should just be removed from the app store.","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:29Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible App","userName":"❗️gamer❗️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174744633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app, and it just kept kicking me out whenever i tried to enter. so at this point i’m like “oh whatever could be the reason of this inconvenience?” then i get a notification from the app saying that i am not allowed in because of my “incredibly fat ankles” and i just think that is absolutely  RIDICULOUS. i mean who calls out someone’s fat ankles?! i am extremely offended and upset with this..

Then it changed my password and I know this app did because the password was trump 2020. I then realize that it was this app that was doing everything and I soon after deleted it. I recommend not getting this app if you want to pay $300 because of a app you downloaded. Please listed and do not download it!","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:09Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible please do not get","userName":"for•tiktok","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174709326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app claimed to bring me fortune and a relationship!! But instead I got a package in the mail with a soggy, A SOGGY, FRENCH FRY!! This is in no way what I signed up for! The AUDACITY that this app has to be putting FAKE NEWS out and getting people to download it in hopes of getting something good but NOTHING GOOD has come out of this!!! And when I tried to delete the app it stayed on my phone!! It won’t leave and it’s been three years! THREE WHOLE YEARS AND IT STILL WONT GO!

I had to buy a brand new phone!!! I know it was this app because I had no problems until I downloaded it!! I couldn’t get through reading a text without it suddenly restarting! My battery began draining, it took forever to charge, no internet apps would load. It started acting like when I open my iPad 2. Pretty much useless, don’t download this app unless you have a warranty!","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:06Z","rating":1,"title":"BROKE MY PHONE","userName":"Blueskyoneeye","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174681366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came here for mr. oranges toupee but all I got was political ads. As I registered my number the app kept closing and started showing a revolving picture of Donny in a mirror with no shirt on. It was revolting to say the least as the toupee was removed and sitting sadly on the floor💅🏼. The bald spot on the orange oompa loop as head was very shiny and it burned my eyes, leaving me legally blind. When I went to delete the app, it kept changing my wallpaper to Brump with a duck on his head. Overall, not a great app🧚🏽🧚🏾\u200D♂️💅🏼🤪🥳😔🤮🤢","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:24Z","rating":1,"title":"This app doesn’t work","userName":"sock menstruation","isEdited":false}}]}
