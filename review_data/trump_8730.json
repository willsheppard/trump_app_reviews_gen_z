APPALLED! I was spammed with called and unwanted messages, I felt like I was being watched by a Pervy, orange, old, pumpkin of a president. In the end, I did not like it. It was a trash app, I felt like I was in 2014 with old, trash apps... I then bought tickets to go see him and couldn’t go to the rally because I was getting aborted and then this app kept sending me notifications during my abortion... It disrupted my self abortion and I feel like I’m being watched...

I am sorry to say that I am nothing short of absolutely disappointed. It’s a disappointment to America, the presidency, and the people who fought for it. I really thought that mr president would have worked harder to have an app under HIS name be worthy. I experienced glitches and it took forever to load up the screen. I couldn’t even sign up with my email for anything. So utterly disappointed. Do better.","date":"2020-06-11T23:08:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177910858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Heaven?","userName":"endangered speci","review":"Okay so I downloaded the app and at first it seemed fine but then I heard barking outside➿ I was confused cause, my cats don’t bark🙀 so I opened the door 🚪 and with my eyes 👀 I saw my dog 🐶 that’s been dead for years 🌂 very confused I was and then as I looked closely I could see👁👁 \nAn American flag was taped to her back saying trump 2020🙈 so then I took my dog to the vet 👩🏽\u200D⚕️ figured my poor dog who’d been abused by political standards and forcefully brought back to life deserved to be happy with god so off I sent her👼🏻 rip Brownie, again😔","date":"2020-07-09T19:14:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177618648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP KIDNAPPED MY GRANDMA","userName":"chloe0193","review":"This app took a month to download ✨ once it did I got a phone call 🥰 once I answered it I heard “If yõu want yõûr grãndmã come to thē whįtë hõùsė” so I went to The White House only to find a giant Cheeto with soggy hair but when I put my glasses on I was in shock to find that it wasn’t a faint Cheeto but Donald trump!

This app, similar to Barron, made empty promises. He said he’d love me for infinity then left me for his older sister. I knew I would never be good enough. What he doesn’t know is I’m pregnant with his twins and I’m only 11 years old. If I were to improve the app I would add a child support section. I think I may get an abortion.","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177453940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i feel attacked","userName":"one of scott's tots","review":"when i first got the app it was all fine and dandy UNTIL one day when two men wearing black suits and sunglasses came to my door. they told me they wanted to talk, but when i refused they put a pair of plus size lululemon leggings over my head. i was taken to an abandoned house somewhere in a cornfield. they asked me if i support trump and when i said i wasn’t old enough to vote they kicked me straight in the teeth. i bled out until i eventually passed on to the gods. don’t get the app.","date":"2020-07-09T16:53:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
