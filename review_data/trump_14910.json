I mean I see a walking hot Cheeto I was so scared I had nightmares for days. I don’t understand why anybody would want this app. If you’re thinking about getting it 0/10 do not recommend. The app spews lies and makes you stupid. Don’t be one of those people I beg of you. If you have common sense please keep it cause this app WILL remove it all.","title":"Utterly repulsive","isEdited":false,"userName":"alyssa._","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173981810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible ... first off it really doesn’t provide much and it doesn't help anything with what is going on in the world ... this is just a useless app where you get to see our JOKE of a president ... anyways horrible app would give it 0 stars if I could ... but that’s what you get for letting a pig be a president and run an app \nCall me a snowflake but who’s REALLY mad in the situation where you call people snowflakes ... toodles 😌","title":"Gross","isEdited":false,"userName":"tekashi696969420","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173972265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first of all he thinks he can trick this generation into losing their favorite app. oh we will find a way my chetoo lord. as soon i as downloaded this app trumps overwhelming homophobia suddenly turned my sibling straight. then they melted to the ground and rose back up now completely made of cheetos. they were screaming that they need everyone to vote trump 2020. after i told them that i would never do anything so disgraceful they started spamming me with nudes of trump. my grandma was go ingaged in the pics of trump i had then displayed on the tv she did not notice my grandpa fainting from the sight of tumors very ugly little friend. i am warning you now and now only don’t download this app","title":"i’m a one of those tiky tikis","isEdited":false,"userName":"hi its me fcsjbcg","date":"2020-07-08T22:37:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173963750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Eye opened 👩🏽\u200D💻this app like 👁👄👁 because oompy loompy🌚 cheeto☄️ man🦐 assaulted my eyes🧏🏽\u200D♀️ the second⏰ eye😤 opened the app!🤬 there was no warning🚫❗️and my underage👶🏽 eyes were exposed to the posionous🧪 photos!

If you think liberals are brainwashed and yet you get your news from Fox News, please rethink. He runs on a platform of racism. Yes racism. Kicking people out of our country because they are illegal is complete hypocrisy. You are so worried about stealing our jobs but don’t realize that their is enough for everyone and before the pandemic we were at full employment. How about a path to citizenship.
