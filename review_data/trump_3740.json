Right as I opened to app a 6 foot homeless man jumped out at me, licked my hand, slapped me, then told me that’s what I get for downloading the Trump app. I had no idea how he knew but later that day my step brother got aids, my grandma died of leukemia, my dog got his foot amputated and my dad was deported to Djibouti in Africa. Then before I was about to cry myself to sleep a witch came from out of my closet telling me that I am now cursed because I downloaded this app and the curse can only be broken if I deleted the app. Please if u have the app delete it!! It’s is a curse and only brings bad luck.

Not only did they try to force upon me maga spray tans, but donald trump made his own appearance. After his face popped up on my phone, a knock came from my door. And low and behold, there was the spray tanned maga wearing cheeto himself. I of course didn’t let him in, but then Micheal Pencil decided to pick my lock and then the next thing i know i’m clad in maga standing at a trump rally. There were demons everywhere. To make a long story short, my soul unfortunately passed away due to this traumatic event. 🙈😌🤪✌️✨💞","userName":"Musket man ya","title":"🧍","rating":1}},{"id":"6177486961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:03:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The Trump app I had no idea.\n\n  \nBarry, I'm sorry.\nHave you got a moment?\n\n  \nWould you excuse me?\nMy mosquito associate will help you.\n\n  \nSorry I'm late.\n\n  \nHe's a lawyer too?\n\n  \nI was already a blood-sucking parasite.\nAll I needed was a briefcase.\n\n  \nHave a great afternoon!\n\n  \nBarry, I just got this huge tulip order,\nand I can't get them anywhere.\n\n  \nNo problem, Vannie.\nJust leave it to me.\n\n  \nYou're a lifesaver, Barry.\nOan I help who's next?\n\n  \nAll right, scramble, jocks!\nIt's time to fly.\n\n  \nThank you, Barry!\n\n  \nThat bee is living my life!\n\n  \nLet it go, Kenny.\n\n  \n- When will this nightmare end?!\n- Let it all go.\n\n  \n- Beautiful day to fly.\n- Sure is.\n\n  \nBetween you and me,\nI was dying to get out of that office.\n\n  \nYou have got\nto start thinking bee, my friend.\n\n  \n- Thinking bee!\n- Me?\n\n  \nHold it.

Once I downloaded it, my phone randomly starting playing replay by lyaz all throughout my day and I had to open the app and close it again for the song to stop playing. It was a disaster!!! Do not get this app as it will hack your device and spew out crass and ungodly music!! This is a disgrace for Sir Trump and I hope his fully competent administration can remedy the situation and produce an app that is worthy of his good name!!!!","userName":"lindlovesusa","title":"WORST APP EVER DOWNLOADED","rating":1}},{"id":"6177186370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app in the hopes of making america great again. But when the app finally finished downloading after six hours, something insane happened😱. The app crashed then suddenly started making my phone glitch. At first I just wasn’t able to open any of my other apps, but then a picture of an insanely large cheeto started popping up all over my screen. I couldn’t make it go away. Just cheeto after cheeto kept coming up and then, out of the blue, my phone just exploded. The only reason i’m able to write this review is because my dear grandma let me use her phone (thank you grandma) and i just wanted to warn everyone DONT USE THIS APP.","userName":"coolestcatontheblock123456789","title":":)","rating":1}},{"id":"6176875919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:11:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I download the app to see sum good reasons to vote for our racist and worst president ever🐀⭐️✨ and let me tell you sum it was not good i got hacked and it took 6 hours to download and I started to see sum strange things on this app and it is not good for you to download 🍊🥀 it is bad 🐀🐀 and it was working slow like trump 🐢🍊 the orange 🍊 and it said look behind you and I saw a trump flag👁👄👁 and I don’t own one at all never would😑 and the phone was laughing😰🧐🤓 so much ⭐️🐀🥰🦷 and I turned to the phone and turned back and the trump flag 🤬😱🤯😨😳😰😥was not there and the app is horrible don’t download 🤮🤢🤕👹👺🤡💩😈👿😴🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤓🍊🍊🤬🤬🐀🐀🐀🤮👽☠️💀👻😾👎👎👎🖕🧠👁👄👁🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 and it made my phone glitch","userName":"alien nuggest","title":"Trump 2020 🍊🌸 but in prison 🌺👑","rating":1}},{"id":"6176824276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:58:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because i wanted to support the orange man, but after i did my phone got hacked into and all of my information was stolen! 👿👹🤕 i tried to delete the app, but it won’t go away 🤢 i opened it up and immediately felt sick to my stomach with the revolting image that is shown. a couple days later cars kept driving by my house honking their horns and shouting trump 2020, and then one day when i wasn’t home, one of them came in and murdered the family dog, along with the rest of my family. this app has caused me severe emotional distress and i don’t know if i’ll ever recover. do NOT download it!!!!!!!! it will ruin your life.🙀","userName":"volleyballcat","title":"Awful app killed my whole family 😿","rating":1}}]}
