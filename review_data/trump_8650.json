I mean the color scheme? The user experience? Being asked to join Dumbletrump’s Army? I’m so personally dishonored by this terrible app that I’m going to start an Order of the Phoenix startup to create an app that combats this one in the true American fashion. Waste of time, would not recommend to my MAGA parents.","date":"2020-07-09T02:22:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Version 2.2.2? More like Version 6.6.6"}},{"id":"6174632414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"maryestelle_","review":"I’ve never thrown up from just simply downloading and using an app before but as soon as I clicked download I began projectile vomiting which only worsened as I attempted to use the app, I say attempted not because I was so busy vomiting but because the app is almost impossible to use and works so poorly, honestly I’m shocked it even opened, awful awful awful app, I’m starving because I’ve thrown up everything in my body but this app alone has made me lose my appetite🤢","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Made me throw up :("}},{"id":"6174630192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MAGAbaby","review":"I wanted to find a new fun app to look at pictures of beautiful people like Instagram. I downloaded this one, thinking that’s what I would get. Instead, my phone instantly started glitching and it asked for my private information and then only showed me pictures of an old Oompa Loompa with a toupee that didn’t know how to speak English properly and didn’t believe in science. It wasn’t even one of the good Oompa Loompas that could sing 😔. Totally not worth the $100 for this app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:16:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever created"}},{"id":"6174625192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"1nickname10","review":"As soon as I opened the app it told me to put in my number so I did, but as soon as I did it started sending my texts. So basically every time Trumpet tweets something it sends you a text and even when he doesn’t tweet anything it still sends me a text. One of the texts told me to get tickets to his rally and I already did. It sends me texts every 5 seconds. I just deleted it and it’s still sending me texts. IT WONT STOP. This is unacceptable. If I could I would rate this 0/5.","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Unwanted texts"}},{"id":"6174589125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kenya Session","review":"I don’t know why I always gotta give a rating and put at least one star. It’s now worth anything! I’m so UPSET🤬. Ugh! I downloaded this app and my phone later on crashed for 2 hours straight🧨. Luckily I was able to get back in it😰. This app also sent some creepy messages to my phone telling me to get out of my house 🏠. So by this point, I’m confused. I go to delete the app and it sends more disgusting awful messages to me. Uh uh this is gonna be a no from me. I’m out✌🏻✌🏼✌🏽✌🏾✌🏿👋🏻👋🏼👋🏽👋🏾👋🏿","date":"2020-07-09T02:05:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Dookie trash app"}},{"id":"6174568461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"1014Vianney","review":"So I was on the app and then some weird thing came up on my screen😟 it was the color of a orange and had the hair of a corn😔🤚🏻 so then I went to the store and I saw my crush with another girl 😔🤚🏻 then I saw james Charles🤩 and he did my makeup 😋 then I went to target and I saw Charlie and she came up to me and said hi then took a picture with me😐 then I became TikTok famous 😎 then someone had the audacity to tell me that I look fat in a dress that I was wearing 😠 then I beat him up 😌 and ya that’s basically it so how are you guys?😆","date":"2020-07-09T01:59:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ugh it scares me😣👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6174548590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Imamermaidbixtch","review":"This app KILLED my pet hippo and hospitalized my grandpa. The images in this app have no trigger warning. The gross images in this app are so vital they gave my grandpa a STROKE. My pet hippo picked the phone up, and threw it after seeing what appeared to be a Cheeto-in-chief dancing on a unicorn. Since there as no warning, my hippo ran into traffic. My grandma said she likes the app, so my family has to lock her in a cage until Thanksgiving. This app is so scary I have had nightmares since November 2016. Please! Do not download.","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Would rate zero stars if I could"}},{"id":"6174508600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Behind the Pine Curtain","review":"Oh, if only negative stars were an option! I should have guessed that this blundering, incompetent administration would publish a worthless app. BabyDonnie is the poster child of failing forward. The imbecile in chief inherited millions and has 6 bankruptcies (not to mention the open racism, misogyny, and alleged sexual misconduct). The administration has multiple allegations of financial misconduct. It only stands to reason that this app is plausibly another attempt to funnel money into the family coffers. Do not download this app. Stand against corruption and tyranny!","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Negative stars"}},{"id":"6174507220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Upset & Disappointed :/","review":"There is a REASON why this app is rated 17+!!!! So much nudity that I had to force myself to throw up so I could feel a different kind of pain. Almost every single word is a cuss word. DO NOT LET CHILDREN DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS DANGEROUS!!! There are also a lot of cult leaders trying to gain followers through this app. Not to mention they stole my credit card information!!!! Also I heard that sex traffickers use this app to find children through their parents’ accounts. Crazy horrible! Super disappointed in my purchase!","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"NOT SAFE FOR CHILDREN"}},{"id":"6174488641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hhigfbh","review":"see now, this app is just atrocious. When I first opened the app I was met with a horrible photo. It was an orange man who’s hair looks like a piece of cotton candy. I won’t go into more detail because it may be triggering for some audiences. I immediately exited the app and deleted it. Ever since i’ve been having nightmares of the cheeto man. would rate 0/5 if i could. keep this app away from children or you’ll be paying for their therapy sessions for the rest of your life.","date":"2020-07-09T01:36:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i developed PTSD after downloading."}}]}
