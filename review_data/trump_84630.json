Mike Pence would lead me down these long dark hallways and at the end was Trump on a red and golden throne. I bowed to him as I didn’t want him to feel embarrassed about his hand size, but then when he would open his mouth, his eyes would fall out and his face holes would glow dark red, and this loud shrieking scream would wake me up in the middle of the night. This ended up happening every night but he would be closer and closer, until one night he ended up in the corner of my room. At this point I was starting to have fears about Mr. Trump, so seeing him in my room was a jarring experience. He grabbed me and then swallowed me. I looked around and I was walking through hell. People were crying and screaming and there was fire and there was no sky or trees. Donald would laugh and laugh and I would have to kill myself to wake up. At this point I had started to lose sleep and was afraid of going to bed. It was also at this time that when I would see Trump during the day I would get freaked out. Eventually my therapist strongly suggested I delete the app. Once I did the dreams and the fears about Trump went away. I am so blessed to be cured of these hellish nightmares. I would strongly recommend you don’t download this app as it might make you hate Donald Trump as much as I did. I can never see our president in the same way again and am now questioning whether or not I should vote for him. It is hard and stressful for me right now but I would just proceed with caution before you download this app!","title":"Proceed with caution!","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-11T17:15:00Z"}},{"id":"6059019923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"HeLooksConstipatedToo","review":"I will never support a leader who so blatantly disagrees with this truth.","title":"Black Lives Matter","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-10T13:48:15Z"}},{"id":"6060233066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"hulujklol","review":"Very informative. 🙌🏼","title":"Trump2020","rating":5,"date":"2020-06-10T20:03:07Z"}},{"id":"6053715451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":":) Lexi s","review":"I would give it a zero if I could :)","title":"No ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-09T07:10:19Z"}},{"id":"6048946961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"Underscorekim","review":"this app gave me stds.
