I had no idea than an app can even do that 😡. This app made everything very difficult especially cooking. I burned my lasagna because of it. The fact that a app has the power to do that is TERRIFYING. I only used the app ONCE and knew it was going to be bad when it asked for my phone number. Why does it need my phone number? I will only give my phone number to chipotle and bts period. After my recovery and building up my mental health by clearing out my head with negativity, which I got from Trump, I filled it with positive energy from bts and other kpop groups. I believe Trump needs to do this too. He does not seem stable and looks like something bad will happen to him. Although I don’t care if something does because of what the app did to me, he still should listen to bts and other kpop groups. All of the negative energy and hateful things be believes will definitely go away after doing so. Kpop has that power. \n\nAfter using this app, I have come to the realization that there are many kpop songs describing trump or that is for him: \n\nGet Cool (Straykids) because he needs to get cool \nSTOP(Straykids) because he needs to stop\nRun Away (TxT) because he needs to run away from election \nHighway to Heaven (NCT 127) he is definitely going somewhere but definitely not heaven\nMonster (EXO) he is truly a monster \nLoser (BigBang) he is a loser\nPsycho (Red Velvet) he is truly a psycho \nRude boy (Mamamoo) he is extremely rude to everyone it’s disgusting \nGotta Go (ChungHa) he definitely needs to go away \nAdios (Everglow) for what he does to the Hispanics and Latinos he should leave the White House and this country. \nHush (Everglow) he should keep his mouth shut \nBullet to the Heart (Jackson Wang) nothing  about him but he should listen to this song it’s very good 🙂\nUGH! (BTS) that’s what I say when I hear his name \nOutro: Ego (BTS) his ego needs to be checked \nRespect (BTS) he should give respect to all minorities \nKilling me (ikon) he is killing me and all minorities with his power and stupidity \nPunch (NCT 127) he needs one right now \nShoot Me (DAY6) this song is amazing and something that Trump should reflect on 😌","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6124468758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-26T14:57:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jewper","review":"Trump is a traitor to the United States.
