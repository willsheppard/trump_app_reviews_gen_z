Along with the convulsive fits of explosive diarrhea. I was rushed to the hospital and taken into immediate care. They performed surgery on my eyes, as seeing(no pun intended) this app had made me blind with all of the ignorance displayed. Once they had finished my surgery, thankfully I could still see. But I had a lost my dignity. I also had lost the ability to be a woman, but yet I could not be a trans man. This app doesn’t allow. So what would I do? I decided to identify as a attack helicopter. But aside from this I still decided that if I downloaded this app there would be no way anything else worse could happen. Well it did, because I have now lost all of my limbs and my Harry Styles tickets. Which the app stole. Not only was I appalled by this, I was utterly disgusted! And just when things were looking up, Hamilton had just been released on Disney+. But Disney crashed because of this app. So I cried while I blasted Burn. Limbless and alone. No Harry Styles, No Lin-Manuel Miranda, No hope."}},{"id":"6174469578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:11Z","title":"Just no!🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"224578543365347446","review":"I can not believe this app it is horrible and they did not take there time to make this app everything glitches and it doesn’t even make sense! And it is definitely not appropriate for children and adults! There is inappropriate and disgusting pictures when you log on there also is an appropriate words and could cause many problems for your future kids. They also steal your credit card information and they also stole my dinosaur chicken nuggets and my microwave so I put my chicken nugget dinosaurs in the microwave but then when I got the app it literally all my stuff disappeared they took the chicken nugget! And I want to file a police report against it this is not OK and I do not stand for this app. It is so bad and no one else should get this app. No the most if you were gone because you’re probably tired of reading this good job TickTock for doing all the great reviews I love it and shout out to Gen Z! I am very proud of you all keep up the good work! I really don’t have anything else to say so bye!!!"}},{"id":"6173599548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:09Z","title":"I can’t believe someone let this 🍊 in office","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡👁👅👁","review":"This app is TERRRRUUUIBBBBLEEEE it truly is not only did it take 10 BUSINESS DAYS but when it finally downloaded my phone jumped from 108% to -4 and then when I put it to wash it started saying a whole bunch of homophobic slurs 🤬🤬 and at that point I was put into coma and when I woke the app had been living in my pillow so I uninstalled my bed frame rendering the app useless of getting away and gave me a chance to delete it 🤗but it didn’t end there because just to remove the app it takes 25-67 business days😤😤😤😤😤😤 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤 all in all the app horrible I don’t recommend this app. Worst app ever, I can’t believe this app is still on the App Store it is just flat out horrendous, full of nonsense, The layout is catastrophic 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HOW VULGAR THE PHOTOS THEY HAD ON THEIR HOME PAGE.

So much spam, and he wants money and he promotes his gift shop when he clearly has billions and billions of dollars mind you this man is the president of the United States why does he need money from people. I downloaded the app to sign up for rallies, but the entire format was a disaster within its self. It also took a really long time to download and I have great Wi-Fi and great mobile data. Also when I download the app they asked for my phone number first why do you need that? I am out raged because I continue to get messages asking for money from the trump administration. Also when I first got the app it was very very. After I got the app my phone started crashing multiple times which is never happened but it only happened once I got the app. Do not get this app it will ruin your entire cell phone. I also didn’t know that the worst chip brand was allowed to have an app. The president is ✨racist, homophobic, misogynistic, sexist, and an overall nasty guy✨ I love gen Z"}},{"id":"6173472105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:36:27Z","title":"TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD⚠️⚠️⚠️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"no❤️😻","review":"Fellow far right authoritarian white conservative families, i speak as an ally and a friend when i say this app is TERRIBLE!!!!! when i first installed the app to support our one and only president trump who is definitely NOT racist and does NOT have peas for brains, the app immediately crashed and started downloading extremely inappropriate images!!! my theory is that the entire app is bugged and crawling with unsafe internet germs or whatever the youngling no good gen z kids call a virus. anyways, after it downloaded the explicit images, it sent out my address to EVERYONE in my contacts list. one other respectable lady left a review saying it played songs that attracted roaches🙄. i am here to confirm that it’s TRUE. the roaches came to my house and threw hands on my very precious ducks that i keep for friends when i get lonely because my husband left me. (george if you’re reading this please come back i miss you😭) ANYONE WHO SAYS THIS APP ISN’T TERRIBLE IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AND SHOULD BE PUT IN JAIL FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME!!! stay safe fellow conservatives❤️"}},{"id":"6177874116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:03:00Z","title":"My traumatizing experience...","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Hgfggaggn","review":"I originally got this app to better inform myself of what is happening in our country and become a better citizen. After getting this app I noticed my skin began to slowly turn orange. I didn’t think anything of it at the time. But as time passed the orange pigment began to began to become more prominent. I rushed to the hospital but was told there was nothing they could do. I went back home and woke up the next day with cornstalk hair and saggy skin, I also became very obese. I looked in the mirror realizing I turned into my worst nightmare, a monster. I became trump. If you fear for ur for life I don’t recommend this app. My mental health has been greatly affected. I’m now depressed, I look like an orange old potato and can’t pull any guys.\nI tried getting plastic surgery but they took out my organs instead. I’m now just a legless, armless, organ less potato. Trump is taking down TikTok now trying to kill me. Me and my fellow tiktokers won’t go down without a fight. This is so war Trump, if we go down you go down with us😤😡."}},{"id":"6177839428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:52:26Z","title":"Terrible (Witchcraft)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Say86153","review":"I was so excited to get this app after the orange dude and congress decided it was necessary to get rid of the best app ever due to the falsified conclusion that it is “a threat to national security.” So obviously I had to download this app so I could “support” their terrible judgment and political decisions, which right now seem a lot like facism.  I love it when a free country’s politicians think it’s constitutional to take away their citizens freedoms. So anyway, I was checking this app out when I started hearing these weird voices. Every time the app was open or running I would hear the orange mans voice saying “cHiNA.” I was so freaked out and I immediately shut my phone off. Later that night our very own POTUS appeared in my dreams. That seemed very suspicious to me, but then before I knew it, Donald Trump was right next to me, and he used his evil super powers to thrown my phone across the room and rate his app 5 stars. Obviously I couldn’t have that so I shoved him down the stair and rated this app a 1. Don’t get this app, it’s evil."}},{"id":"6177686235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:06:28Z","title":"pain 😪","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bataixe","review":"today i downloaded the app since many fellow trump supporters suggested to get it.  but once i opened the app nothing showed up!!  it kept playing load music and even when i closed the app it still kept going.  i asked my children what to do, but they didnt say anything and told me to just put in a bad review.  i deleted the app immediately and here i am putting in my review.  i thought the app would be a help to support trump, but there were so many malfunctions to the point where i believe this app is a joke!!  i plan on never downloaded this app again, it was painful to my ears to hear the loud music coming from the app. i dont even know HOW someone could be clueless and put in a 5 star review!!  i even feel like i should agree with this gen z group and not for for trump this year.  i apologize for this review, but i just couldnt stay silent from this terrible app! contact me when the problems were fixed, and just maybe i’ll think about changing my review.  thank you and goodbye! 👋"}},{"id":"6177618451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:44:43Z","title":"Why","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cesameshelf88","review":"This app is terrible glitches and more ok now that everyone is gone he can’t take TikTok away from us it has every single memory of my life is on this app it has gotten me through so many rough times and more just bc one person did something bad ur gonna take it away from the ppl who are choosing to express them selfs on this app it saved lives I feel horrible and hurt bc of his actions all bc he was mad and a foolish human I’m done with trying to put everything bad he’s done in his past I was one of the biggest trump supporters just bc it taking the app away doesn’t mean we won’t still express ourselves ppls hate will only grow stronger now I know it’s “because there stealing info” I have no more words to express how much that he is TAKING SO MANY PPLS JOBS AWAY TO ppl are providing for there family’s why would someone take that from ppl who actually need it ppl have learned to love themselves and express themselves there are so many things wrong with trump that im just know realizing #oboma back in office"}},{"id":"6177227037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:47:37Z","title":"false information!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"erica qin","review":"i downloaded this app because it said it would ship us a free sandwich every 1-2 business days. now, i am not one to pass up free food, so ofc, i downloaded it. and i waited. and waited. FINALLY, after a whole WEEK (4 days past the deadline!) a sandwich came. by then, i had given up on the whole free sandwich, thing, so u can imagine my surprise and delight!  however, the first thing i noticed when i opened the box, was the stench. it smelled like rotten orange peels and the stench of a college frat boys’ bathroom! i immediately threw up, before grabbing my gas mask and my sanitary gloves. i reached in... and was met with something sharp biting my hands! there was a family of humongous hornets living in the box! they attacked me, and i had to be sent to the hospital. later, my mom told me that the sandwich was actually a “sand witch,” which in my case had summoned a family of hornets to protect her. horrible advertising! i will be suing trump for my hospital bills! (i might not if there was free healthcare). go learn how to spell! zero stars!!"}}]}
