Also it took about 3 weeks just to get inside the app and it messed with the rest of my phone. For example my phone started showing me more and more pictures and news articles of this orange pig looking thing named trump? I think it was. Anyways it was a scary thing. This pig was a child predator, a racist, etc. he supported violence and wanted nothing more than power over the whole u.s. it reminded me of a horror movie. I 1000/10 DO NOT recommend you download🙂 Thankyou for your time","title":"THIS IS THE WORST APP IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE","rating":1,"userName":"jdjendhsjnddhjd","date":"2020-07-08T21:22:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173771295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Words can not describe how long it takes for the app to actually download.
