But why would being 17 do anything when 18 is what really matters. What im trying to say is that trump is trying to get us underaged children to look at him all the time. How ludicrous!!!! And listen to this—-> i wanted to warn you by making this review but in order to do so I HAD TO CLICK OK ON THE POPUP!!! So trump is forcing me to lie in order to not get 1 star reviews as much and SCARING me because now the fbi is going to invade my home and rig my internet with 5G to slowly cripple me until my dogs eat me alive because they are resistant to 5G. (I wish i was a dog) AND I WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO RUN! Because they put trackers in everything in order to successfully do trumps nasty deeds. ONE STAR FOOD WAS COLD NEVER ORDERING FROM JOHN EVER AGAIN.","rating":1,"title":"Directions unclear","date":"2020-07-10T08:58:25Z","userName":"wowdrew#2"}},{"id":"6180178351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Just stop my man just stop this is why Obama was better","rating":1,"title":"Just stop","date":"2020-07-10T08:58:16Z","userName":"spooky_savage21"}},{"id":"6180176388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this app and now i am bombarded with people assuming i’m straight, it’s the worst possible outcome.  not only that, but people expect you to hate anyone who isn’t white?? so boring and not worth it.","rating":1,"title":"this app is trying to turn me straight and racist :(","date":"2020-07-10T08:57:32Z","userName":"sirqueef"}},{"id":"6180175955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"As a weeb I downloaded this app to look at hot anime guys and listen to Hastune Miku’s songs...BUT INSTEAD IT TOLD ME TO VOTE THE ORANGE FOR PRESIDENT😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 A ORANGE CANT BE PRESIDENT ONLY HOT ANIME GUYS CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU UwU I want to say one more thing...🌸my👄name🤩is🧚\u200D♀️not🧢five⭐️ weenies🌈i🍕am🚘shoto🎆todoroki📱and💎i💌wanna📘be💖a⚜️hero🟦also one more thing..THIS APP GOT ME SICK BECAUSE I DIDNT SEE ANY TODODEKU STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"title":"As a weeb this is the worst app😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-10T08:57:22Z","userName":"Todoroki fan :p"}},{"id":"6180175760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded this app it erased all my contacts. It then started calling all the women that were in my old list and telling them it would give them money to fly to Mar A Lago to have sex with Trump. Which Trump? I don’t know, but it must have kept that general to be sure there was deniability. I think it also caused my vacuum to overheat and a plant to die outside. Bad app. Sad!","rating":1,"title":"App Erased All My Contacts","date":"2020-07-10T08:57:18Z","userName":"Obamawasbest"}},{"id":"6180175366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Completely tragic","rating":1,"title":"Tiny hands make for glitchy app","date":"2020-07-10T08:57:09Z","userName":"orangeclown"}},{"id":"6180174490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app and suddenly my family started supporting a white supremacy group. It was strange. Then they started saying that masks don’t work and we shouldn’t wear them. At first I didn’t realize the things were related but then I talked to my neighbors and they had similar experiences. They said when they deleted the app everything went back to normal. I went home and my daughter said she was ready to go back to school cause Trump said it’s ok. She then explained if we stop testing the numbers will drop. I had to explain that’s not how science works. If you just ignore something it doesn’t go away. Ugh can’t wait to delete the app and see my smart family again. I can’t deal with the confederate flag and swastikas they are sporting. As a side note it also took away my right to have my birth control covered under insurance even though I have endometriosis so I do need it but viagra is still covered. I guess we know what that means.","rating":1,"title":"Strange reaction to app","date":"2020-07-10T08:56:49Z","userName":"Trumpy Bear 13"}},{"id":"6180174321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Opened the app and it started spewing racism. Then the wealth gap grew, only benefiting the top 1%. Global CO2 was on the rise. Most people started dying from a deadly virus. Then it tried to delete other apps on my phone. It was crazy!!! So unsafe, so scary. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!","rating":1,"title":"The worst app know to man","date":"2020-07-10T08:56:45Z","userName":"kels2526"}}]}
