He actually is just his dad’s shadow and is manipulated by white supremacists. Couldn’t find anything decent on this app as it was just full of his ugly face and name. His supporters are the true dumb sheep of America that are anti-Americans and more along the line of racist, misogynistic, homophobic, just full of ppl that are stupid regardless of how whitely they were educated. This app reflects that and we hope that after Biden gets his term, we are able to find better candidates. Definitely not bunker baby though.
