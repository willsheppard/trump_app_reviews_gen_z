I had my bank info in my phone and my account was drained.

Furthermore if you remember in the original despicable me, you know there is a scene where Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat seeking missiles at Gru and and then proceeds to dodge all of them. According to speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, He can perceive and move at such a speed. After this he punches a shark and it’s paralyzed it’s spine is probably broken and it requires a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500 pound car crashing into a wall at 30 mph","rating":1}},{"id":"6179624751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I’ve never been more suicidal","userName":"12MHL12","date":"2020-07-10T05:33:23Z","review":"This app has led me to put a gun in my mouth. I was never confident in this country, but at least I was secure. After downloading this app, I found myself wanting to eat a bullet even more than I wanted to during my emo years. As a woman, I feel there is no point living anymore. Trump desires to take away my right to choose, my right to birth control, and my right to equal pay. For my LGBTQ+ friends, trump wants to make discriminatory health care legal based on sexuality and gender. For my POC friends, trump wants you arrested for BS so you can perform unpaid labor (aka slavery). This app undid six years of therapy and put me back on suicide watch (not that trump supporters believe in mental health).","rating":1}},{"id":"6179624756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"uwu","userName":"jaasiel pimentel","date":"2020-07-10T05:33:23Z","review":"I😿can💅hear👂Daniel👨walking🚶down⬇️the😾street🛣tap🦵tap🦵tap🦵tap🦵listen👂to✌️his👨feet🦶     shake😳the🛑blanket🛏shake⚠️the🦖blanket💤turn🔄the🥴blanket😴oooover👉👇👈👆       great😍grandma👵you🥺always😌know🥰just🙈what😳to👀say💅🏾OHGUHUHJUAGHUEHSUESEEHUGY🤭chreesmuss❤     One☝️percent➗is✨human👨🏻999️⃣9️⃣is🌸plastic🧩just🏍a😍sec✔️I👁gotta😈fix🔨my⛓lips👄       ：why❓don't⌛we🔪just👽R͜͡E͜͡L͜͡A͜͡X͜͡X͜͡X͜͡X͜͡😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅r̥ͦḁͦd̥ͦi̥ͦo̥ͦ📻 would👿you😼like💕卂爪爪爪爪👹or🤪 ቻጠጠጠጠ👺          \nmom🦋dad🌱lets👁get😼one🤠thing🪐straight🌈 ł💥₥ɄⱤĐɆⱤɆĐ🥶₮ⱧɆ😈₣₳₥łⱠɎ🙈ĐØ₲       Come🌽today🌽and🌽some🌽çœrń🌽or🌽we🌽will🌽sacrifice🌽your🌽ńëwbœrń🌽","rating":1}},{"id":"6179624689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"No","userName":"fdgh r ascbj","date":"2020-07-10T05:33:21Z","review":"This app took 78923 minutes to download so stupid","rating":1}},{"id":"6179624295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"A real review","userName":"iangay","date":"2020-07-10T05:33:13Z","review":"Has terrible glitches and lags all the time.
