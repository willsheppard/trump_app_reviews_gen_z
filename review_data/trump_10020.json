The app completely fried my phone and made it crash three separate times, I think my phone could tell the vibes were RANCID. Anyways would never recommend this app to anyone, wouldn’t even recommend it to a snail if I could.

This app made my phone glitch so bad I had to buy another one. The screen turn black and also the words “tRuMP 2o20”🍊 was flashing on my screen it’s literally the scariest experience. I recommend downloading this on your own risk. It’s such a terrible app and I wish that on no one.","userName":"karens 2.0","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:29:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172152566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The worst app I have ever downloaded, once I downloaded the app I heard dog barking coming from my phone and it wouldn’t let me turn down the sound and it was really high pitched and super loud and my ears are now bleeding, I had to delete the app for the barking to stop but I couldn’t write a review so I downloaded it again so I could write the review and then THERE WAS ELEPHANT SOUNDS coming from my phone, I have no idea what is going on with this app, but IT IS SO BAD.","userName":"love2090","title":"Barking and Almost as bad as the president himself","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:00:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172019869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The layout is so confusing I am a stereotypical republican, old.  Being old, I can’t understand all the tabs the buttons, or pts(I do not know what that means).  Also, ever since I got this app and wrote in my personal information, I have been getting many unneeded calls and emails.  \nOn a second note, I do not like how every time I want to sign up for a rally, this app takes me to safari.  Very annoying, needs to be fixed.","userName":"Sophia Aichele","title":"Confusing layout","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:22:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171999805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support our WONDERFUL, CHRISTIAN president that brings NO harm to others in any shape or form but then it’s brought to my attention that this big round orange’s app was very glitchy and poor made. not only is this large orange a BAD person he also has a poor made app too so, i don’t know why people think it’s okay the vote this large round orange for president while you should be searching up all of the incredibly bad things this “hero” of yours has done.

All I got from the app is FAKE NEWS!! I also remembered that YOUR president Donald, is a racist, sexist, and homophobic person. He counties to make racist remarks, he retweeted a video of a white man screaming “white power”. He continues to try and reverse protections for lgbtq+ people, he banned transgender individuals from joining the military! He continues to make sexist remarks, he’s sexually assaulted many women! He needs to be locked in jail for his actions.","userName":"fjrkwkxfntmkd","title":"THIS APP IS FAKE NEWS!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:49:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171778494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So i downloaded this app to keep up with the news about my beloved president 💖 and it took so long to download maybe 1 hour , i got into the app exited to see all the ✨𝑗𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑦 𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑠✨and to my surprise their was a really weird orange cheeto it surprised me soooo much then the orange cheeto face started glitching , going from black to white and red , I was so startled I dropped my phone off the stairs which then fell 3 flights spiraling to its doom...... i had to get a new phone sadly😔","userName":"✨whoreochimaru✨","title":"It made me crack my phone screen 😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:07:17Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6166128570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Downloaded this app thinking it would really solidify my admiration for Sir Trump, but as soon as I downloaded it and registered for my local trump rally (that I don’t think I’ll be able to attend, I actually have covid 😔) the app crashed all my other apps.
