I hope no one has to download this I was disappointed when I opened the app for the first time and was greeted with a Cheeto 🟠making a fist as if he was going to punch me 😭. And I almost fainted when I saw the Cheeto getting a spray tan Nude🤮🧚🏻\u200D♀️. And when my mother saw it on accident she passed out. So my sister kept giving cpr. I tried to call☎️ 911 but my phone immediately said in a low sad voice “bai bai” ✌️ and disappeared into thin air💨 out the window🖼. To the point where I screamed😭 which woke up my mom but when I looked outside my fish🐟smelled the fumes and died😖.

When I downloaded it, my phone immediately crashed. I had to go to the Apple Store to get it fixed, which cost me my precious money and time. When the phone finally began working again, I opened the app in order to find out when the next rally would be. Instead of any helpful information, I was instead greeted with some terribly inappropriate photos of the President, along with a slideshow titled “My Best Tweets That Show What a Great Leader and Articulate Speaker I Am I’m the Best President America Has Ever Seen Vote For Me Not Sleepy Joe.” Very unprofessional and rude. I cannot believe I downloaded this filth. If i could give less than one star I would.","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:50Z","userName":"JordanAlmonds","title":"Terrible experience!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174015327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello, finally introducing Loona\nAre you girls ready? \nOkay, let's go!\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\n오늘도 훔쳐보기 timeline 속 너의 얘기들\n넌 모를 거야 나의 짝사랑 (you know)\n사실 난 용기 없어 고백할 자신 없어 어떡해\n어쩜 지금이 더 좋아\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\nOh 비밀스런 우리 사이\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n날 흔드는 건 love love\n또 왜 이렇게 떨려 you uh uh uh\nOh 이런 내 마음 자꾸 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\n첨이야 my destiny 알잖아 이기적인 나\n나 말도 안돼 이런 첫사랑 (you know)\n친구로 생각했던 너에게 다가서는 이 순간\n겁이 나는 걸 어떡해\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\n더 깊어져 가는 우리\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n부드럽게 다가갈게\n난 니 눈빛에 설레 you uh uh uh\n내 팔과 내 다리 마저 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게 (가슴이 두근대 내가 왜 이럴까)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (이젠 내 마음을 숨길 수 없나 봐)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\nCome on, come on baby, tell me your story\n나 조금 더 꿈꿀게\nCome on, come on baby, close to me baby\n난 get it, get it, get it, get it love\n또 왜 이렇게 떨려 you uh uh uh\nOh 이런 내 마음 자꾸 녹아 내려\n니 향기 너무 좋은 걸 더욱 sweet 하게\n(더욱 sweet 하게)\nOh 이제부터 나는 너 밖엔 안 보여 love forever\n내 콩팥까지 두근대 아픈 것 같애 (아픈 것 같애)\nOh 달콤하게 점점 중독되어 버려 love forever\nLove forever (ah)\nLove forever\nLove forever","date":"2020-07-08T22:54:02Z","userName":"TheRockWarrior","title":"stan loona ✨🧚🏾🦋","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173783816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded it, it took almost a month to download 😦 then when I opened it the app took 100 dollars from me😑 then the app has horrible music playing and then ants started crawling on me!

The surveys are completely biased and therefore creates skewed data that should not be reputable to any degree. When it come to the app itself, it is extremely slow, taking 30 minutes just to download the app let alone the 10 hours it took to finally get signed in. Personally I believe something that spreads such false information should not be advertised and/or available for download in the United States because it is harmful to the citizens as well as our reputation around the rest of the world. 0/10 would never recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:45Z","userName":"12473628482","title":"Yeah, no","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173594140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have been down in this basement for 2 year and it all started when I downloaded this app. All I wanted to do is support our lovely deformed 🍊 and show my support but that’s not what happened . right after I downloaded the app I was kidnapped by orange rats wearing Trump merch then they took a dart with poison and shot it right at me I fainted and woke up in the most ugliest looking room covered in trump naked. My eyes started to bleed 🩸 in terror. Then trump showed up and gave me my phone to give him a five star ⭐️ review but I refused and tried escaping 🏃🏼\u200D♀️ . I completely failed and was handcuffed to my bed. Now here I am in a basement only allowed to drink Diet Coke with added sugar and an overcooked stake with sauce made out of horse 💩.

Standard issues.  But it got worse. I started getting hundreds of notifications about “tweets” and “trump”. Who even is that guy? Some of the worst days of my life came from this app, I think it may promote devil worship. All my photos were deleted along with my apps, with the exception of the standard apps and the Trump app. All of this happened away from my home. Apparently this app tells everyone where I live, because my house had been ransacked. Doors were torn off their hinges, all my money was gone, and they slit my dogs throat. My dog is dead. That were all I had. My life is ruined and it’s all this apps fault.","date":"2020-07-08T20:02:31Z","userName":"ijustwanttolistentoblackout","title":"Not very good","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173530377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The reason i gave this app one star was because this is one of the worst apps ever when I downloaded it it took me hours to download not to mention there was a orange thing popping out of my screen which almost MADE MY PHONE BREAK!!!
