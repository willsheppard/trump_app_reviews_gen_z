As soon as I got on my phone started to glitch and I tried to leave the app and it wouldn’t let me. My phone was frozen on the app until it died. When I went to plug it in and when it turned on it showed the white hello screen as if I got a new phone. And wiped all my data away.!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:00:54Z","userName":"Sienrkrodtjrpfpfjfj"}},{"id":"6175473033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was very very mad about this app. It showed pictures of rats on it and it is ran by a disgusting man, Donald Trump. So very disgusted by this. Nobody should have to go through what us people saw when we opened the app, we saw Donald Trump dressed as a Shopkin. So very mad that I wasted my time on this app. I do not recommend getting the app. So very bad. Never again will I. Good day.","date":"2020-07-09T06:58:09Z","userName":"aNnA-oOp"}}]}
