When I first entered the app I was greeted by a screen full of hairy armpits with extremely long hair. Each INDIVIDUAL hair had an odd looking smile on it like 🙂+🤥+😏 which ended up looking like a interesting emoji therefore a weird smile on every singular hair. Like whattttt. Anyways then the app proceeded to hack my phone and change my wall paper to pictures of un manicured toes. Each of my apps logos had been replaced by those plastic baby’s (you by from amazon) head. And most importantly my precious live wallpaper of very hot 90s actors was changed to a bunch of giant green peas with Trumps face morphed onto it. And they where dancing like they had a wegie and where trying to hold in a big dump. The peas has stick sized legs and don’t even get me started on how that is physically impossible for noodle legs to hold up a 201 pound fat dancing pea. How do I know the weight I don’t I’m just assuming. (Kids is is not okay to assume things like, gender, ethnicity, etc. but in this case it’s fine) So if you want your phone to look like a bunch of objects with creepy faces on them get the app. And if not don’t it’s as simple as that.\n\n                                        -Pea Pea Lady 🙂🩲","rating":1}},{"id":"6176318786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dog poop","isEdited":false,"userName":"abonminal snow man","date":"2020-07-09T11:41:16Z","review":"This app is an abomination to the apple community and took 47 and a half decades to download.
