It played so many ads that reminded me of when I was stuck in my closet for 78 hours in a row. Then a picture of Donald trumpy came up and scared me so bad that I haven’t been able to sleep at night 😭 Please remove this app from the apple store! An abomination!","userName":"miss thangbb"}},{"id":"6173550615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:22Z","title":"Worst App Ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is one of the worse made apps ever. As soon as I opened my phone, it was as if my phone exploded and got put back together by a toddler. I couldn't even use it for at least 2 hours after opening this app because it glitched my phone so bad. I will NEVER be getting this application again...","userName":"thvomas"}},{"id":"6173517842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:52:07Z","title":"Concerned","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Concerned about the 17+ rating. Why not 18 when last how old you should be before getting political.  As it most definitely clear, children are too young and dumb to understand anything in the world. Just like the women of the 1900s. Considering these are the ideals of Trump, keep the youth dumb and the women dumber, I hope my message gets reached. ✨","userName":"Charrrity"}},{"id":"6173496662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:54Z","title":"Freezes Up Iphone DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was so excited to be able to keep up with the President, but the moment I opened the app, my screen FROZE!

But unfortunately the only thing it brought to me was failure and sickness. I am currently writing this review sick and dying. So this app is receiving a one star review and if I could I would 100% leave zero stars. 🧚🏻\u200D♂️🦄🦋✨⚡️🧚🏻\u200D♂️","userName":"tacoschicken"}},{"id":"6173493527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:43:51Z","title":"NEGATIVE VIBES😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i mean honestly this app is just horrible and need to be taken down as soon as possible.

IT BROKE MY NEW PHONE!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I decided to get this app to support our president but then I noticed that like the president, the app sucked and could not process any information. This app not only drains your battery EXTREMELY quickly but this app made my battery NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. This free app just costed me a lot of money in repairs for my phone. This app is DYSFUNCTIONAL AND ATROCIOUS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!!! 🧚💕✨xoxo bunker boy✨💕🧚","userName":"Ma1352"}}]}
