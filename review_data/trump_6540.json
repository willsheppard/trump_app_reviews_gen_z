As i raced to get my charger, I projectile vomited onto my floor bc i am out of shape. I had no time to stop running, i need that charger so that i may keep up with our unsavory leader. Although i was committed to getting my charger as quickly as i could, i miscalculated the surface area of my vomit spillage. i slipped. i broke my neck, i have to wear an eyepatch, and one nostril permanently whistles now. My family couldn’t afford my medical bills, therefore I never got a proper neck brace. my neck is now permanently shaped like this “↪️”.  1 star. do not recommend","userName":"peter grizzly"}},{"id":"6173213271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app gave me chronic migraines","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:09:03Z","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded it so i could get up to date news on our lord and savior donald trump. however once i started watching all the news articles and social media posts, i realized, GOOD HEAVENS! this man is a complete idiot! he can’t form a single intelligent thought! not to mention he’s extremely racist and homophobic! then this app began to start haunting me... it came to me in visions in my dreams. it started causing massive migraines at all times of the day.. i started to lose my mind. i needed to delete immediately!!! horrible app!!!! horrible man!!!! horrible “president”!!!!!!","userName":"andiepandiecandie"}},{"id":"6173186362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cursed App","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:00:13Z","rating":1,"review":"First of all, this app took forever to load even with my fast internet speeds. If I can play a MMO without it lagging it messing up, then I should be able to download this app without a problem. However, it took nearly half an hour to download. It asked for lots of my personal information, phone number included, and now I’m getting constant spam texts and calls! My phone literally warns me that these calls are spam calls and put me at risk of being scammed!!! Why was my information sold to these scammers? That’s so corrupt.","userName":"Upset Over Lost Streak"}},{"id":"6173170161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Great grandma is mental now ):","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:54:59Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because My great grandma thought Donald was “attractive”, she was horrified to see his nudes, that thing was the size of the roach on her carpet. Horrified, she was absolutely traumatized that she had to be sent to the mental hospital, and she is yet to stay there. She has terrible nightmares about the event, having flashbacks every now and then. I blame this app and Donald for ever getting her involved in such nonsense to the point she worshipped him, well she doesn’t anymore um. She’s very frightened. So I blame you for this orange 😔 putting my great grandma in such frightening circumstances ✨ SHAME ON YOU","userName":"Riosju1212"}},{"id":"6173096436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"He literally is ruining my life and America","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:31:38Z","rating":1,"review":"First of all, I downloaded this disgusting app to see what all these young ones are on about on social networks including tik tik.

Then he found this app and saw what trump looked like. He started suffering from depression. Until lone day at pet school they were passing around trumps nude and my poor Cheeto said “ No. Not only in he bright orange but his pp looks like-like SHRIMP?!?! He was so disappointed in our president that...*insert dramatic pause and sobbing* he killed himself! So that’s why I gave this App 1 Star.","userName":"cheeto misser"}}]}
