And because I was trying to support the app I downloaded on my only other device my child’s tablet. It messed it up and  I couldn’t even get out of the app and now my kid won’t stop crying because she can’t watch her Elmo! I can’t explain how much I paid for that “Kid-Safe” tablet but apparently it wasn’t Trump-Safe!"}},{"id":"6172763814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:50:16Z","title":"Gave me Diabetes","userName":"TriflinDaby","review":"I downloaded the app and immediately was greater by a barking dog in my front lawn. I figured it was something that happened to everyone but as I looked further into the app more and more dogs appeared. It got to the point where they had begun to fill up my entire house! I tried to delete them but each time I tried they started to multiply. I was so confused and distraught that I passed out 😵 I woke up the next morning to being suffocated by wild elephants! At that point I was in such disbelief I had to get rid of the app. Would NOT recommend."}},{"id":"6172750889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:46:32Z","title":"I wouldn’t even give it one star","userName":"Hitherelove","review":"Constantly crashes. Updated my phone, still won’t work. But it will give me constant notifications that I can’t silence, and can’t tap because the app won’t stay open long enough to let me read the notification from there. Super buggy, and now my phone is acting up anytime I try to call someone. I wonder if maybe the trump administration is using the app to spy on me, because a lot of my other apps started crashing right after downloading the trump app. Very disappointed."}},{"id":"6172735071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:42:00Z","title":"Hello 👋🏾 finally😌 introducing ✨ loona 🌙 are⭐️ you😍 girls 👯\u200D♀️ ready🙈?

No gmail No phone number just password. So I tried to guess the password but I guess I put the wrong password in too many times. It turned into a black screen. After that my phone started to buzz and it wouldnt stop!!!!  It started to play clown music. It woke up my fish which was terrible because it takes 1 whole hour for her to fall alseep. I was so mad that I threw away my NEW IPHONE 11 OUT THE WINDOW. Anyways I want my money back and I dont want this orange as our president anymore 😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6172570736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:55:54Z","title":"Ignore my cat 🐈","userName":"Sabrina_143869","review":"Im a a HuGe FaN Of TrUMp. Sorry my cat walked over the key bored. Anyways,  I downloaded this app and it’s horrible... no offense tho. But it is, there are glitches and you can’t make videos and get likes. My phone froze and glitched and got a virus two mins after I opened it. That’s why I’m on my laptop. Please don’t download this app unless it’s to write a GoOd review. Oops my cat did that again. Ik the Karen’s and boomers (means that u old ppl rock) love trump and they just want to kiss him and make America GrEaT again. Silly cat of mine. But yea that’s all I needed to say. DUMP 2020!! my cat did that?

I’m starting to believe this app is just a virus??? DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELEPPR IS THE REAL DONALD TRUMP!!!! In looking at and going through the app, my phone is now covered in leftist fake news! I have been getting ads for Bad Biden and it constantly reminds me of the old candidate that extreme socialist Sanders. This app has done nothing but RUIN me and my family’s life. Cannot not suggest this app enough. This app has reminded me how much I don’t want to vote in november. God bless this country, do not bless this app 🙏🏻"}},{"id":"6172424526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:15:36Z","title":"Dump Trump","userName":"Everette_C","review":"This is the most racist, sexist, homophobic, and overall bigoted app I’ve ever been aware of. This app gets people killed by its users and in turn gets its users killed. It’s so unfortunate that anyone had cause to even think up this app much less to follow through with creating it and worse still that Apple allowed it to skip through into their App Store. If you’ve mistakenly or maliciously downloaded this app, please immediately give it a poor rating and delete it. If you purposely downloaded it without malintent then seek help immediately."}}]}
