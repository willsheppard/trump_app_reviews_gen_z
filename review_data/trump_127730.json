It makes you sign up for fake news. It asked for my credit card number and my address. Ofc I gave them that but then it crashed. My phone shut off by itself and when I opened my phone back up Everything on my phone was changed. My lock screen was changed into a Photo of an orange and my home screen was a photo of a pear tinted orange. All my apps are now “how to make America Great again” and “How to be an orange.” I looked up from my phone to notice I wasn’t at my house anymore. I was at Japan. Tokyo was so big. I saw an update pop up that said “to install orange phone please enter your password.” I fell off the sky scraper I was on and landed on the road. WHAT THE HECK DONALD ✨Orange✨ TRUMP. WHAT A SCAM.Do not waste your time on this non sense. 😎"}},{"id":"6177442109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏻🍓Just.. why?🧚🏻✨🐝","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kinleybm","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED.

However, I will say that this app does give me Android energy. I went on this app to further explore the possible location of our real president, Brittany Spears. I fear that our generation’s childhood icon and forever role model is going down to lindsay lohan and amanda bynes town and that place isn’t cute:’( please send ur luv and prayers to our mama the real Brittany bitch👩\u200D👧\u200D👧 xoxo gossip girl astronomically"}},{"id":"6177441926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Yucky","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"stink153826","review":"Stinky yucky yuck bye bye mr Cheeto"}},{"id":"6177441190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I hate our ✨orange✨","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"42069tiktoket69420","review":"I really wanted to learn abt trumps campaign, so I downloaded this app. But ever since I did in 2016, things started happening. Like one day I woke up and Muslims were banned out of the country. And then just a few month later trans people could no longer serve in the military. This app and its owners additionally tried to convince me that global warming isn’t real. They also love the 💕KKK✨ which is strange considering they hate ANTIFA. Also while having this app, the black lives matter movement started protests because if the ideologies this campaign possesses. So yea I’m going this app 1 stars because 0 isn’t an option for all the injustice it’s caused."}},{"id":"6177440933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS A DISCRETES","date":"2020-07-09T16:49:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jojofu123","review":"I hate this app so much and kept kicking me off once I signed in it kicked me off again and it was horrible I saw fried chicken on the page holding up a fist and I just hate it it wanted my ZIP Code and I was like hell no so yeah I recommend you not get this app"}}]}
