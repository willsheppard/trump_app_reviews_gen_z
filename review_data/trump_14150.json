Then some rats ran towards my house screaming “yuh get it to it” and attacked my whole family. We are now in the hospital with major injuries because of this. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. Lastly my dog came back because he missed us and got married to one of the rats. Now family gatherings are really awkward.","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:06Z"}},{"id":"6173520259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"so bad👎🏻👎🏻","userName":"olivia000000000","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Where do I honestly start? First of all there’s so many glitches, how am I supposed to stay updated on mr. obamas election campaign if the app doesn’t even work? I need updates now! Secondly, it takes so long to load. When I want to read mr. presidents updates or any other new about his campaign, I don’t have time to wait for it to load. I want it to work right then! If this app doesn’t get fixed, I WILL vote for Hillary! 😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:58Z"}},{"id":"6173497960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🧚🏻No💕🐀","userName":"YourDadNeverCameWithTheMilk","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"✨🙈Water. Earth. Fire. Air.\nLong ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.✨🙈","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:20Z"}},{"id":"6173493023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I was so scared","userName":"Orange devil🍊hater","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app to support the orange devil🍊,but when I finally got onto the app I heard my doorbell ring. I open my door and I saw the orange 👿 standing there looking mad,so I said what’s wrong with you. He said “GIVE MY APP A FIVE STAR REVIEW. When he said that I look at him like he was the dumbest man ever.(Btw he is) I ran away and the orange🍊 chased me while repeatedly saying “FIVE STAR RATE”. Then I took my phone out my pocket and delete the app. The orange🍊 just disappeared in thin air.

Next came completely tasteless slivers of Long Island Fluke. Next: a sliver of pork belly fat set on a bed of fava beans. After that, two slivers of capon breast that had the texture of raw human flesh. In the meantime, the bus girl was plying us with basket after basket of potato bread and refilling our water glasses non-stop.","date":"2020-07-08T19:43:01Z"}},{"id":"6173482479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"don’t ever download this","userName":"glass-face","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app took 2 hours to download when i have perfectly fine wifi, i had my router checked after downloading and nothing is wrong with it so it must be the app. also when i went on the app no matter what i did the app was a white screen and mind you i have the newest iphone and i restarted it a bunch of times and did other stuff to try to fix it.
