I was taught to always question, always seek more information, to embrace discussion from all sides in order to form my opinions. \nThis app does NOT do that. They have taken a page from authoritarian history and are only publishing false and unsubstantiated propaganda. \nIn this little bubble the world is a rosy white paradise that must be protected (with AK-47s). But in reality we’re being slowly killed by a virus that has purposefully gone unchecked by this administration because it reflects badly on our narcissistic “Leader”\nHow can good God fearing people support a candidate who has absolutely no regard for his fellow man?  This is NOT what Jesus would do. \nUse this app if you want  but PLEASE  use other sources as well. Stay informed by a diverse array of information. You owe it to yourself."}},{"id":"6172824616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BLM ABOLISH ICE LIVING ON STOLEN LAND","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Kornwalus","date":"2020-07-08T16:07:39Z","review":"This Cheeto unveiled America’s racism. These RACISTS have somebody to count on. But, racism is everywhere it is been alive even after the civil rights movement and it is found through our laws and policies. We, Gen Z have to target these laws and policies that have oppressed POC. We are at target of hate based on the color of our skin. Together we are powerful we tend to forget our constitutional rights that say we have the right to overthrow the government if it doesn’t serve The people this government is broken and only serves the whites. We, The People have nothing to lose, the only thing that we can lose is our chains. There is no more time for waiting, change is now or never. We can’t let this moment slip by,  we are the chosen ones, we have our fate in our hands, we need to choose now or stand down forever."}},{"id":"6172767871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"karen_rogers227","date":"2020-07-08T15:51:28Z","review":"this app was so incredibly difficult to use. it took FOREVER to download. at first i thought it was my connection, but i asked some of my my friends who downloaded the app and they said they had the same problem. when it FINALLY downloaded, it made me put in so much of my personal information, including my phone number and other very personal things and now this app won’t stop calling me! it’s so annoying to listen to. there is also so much FALSE news on here that i know isn’t true. this has made me see him in a completely new light, and this app is the reason i won’t be voting for him in the 2020 election. i now see him as a racist,\nhomophobic, sexist man. this app NEEDS to be taken down, because we can’t have this cheeto be running our country. worst app i’ve ever used. #tmwnbt"}},{"id":"6172752497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t ever download this","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"akfbmdkdl","date":"2020-07-08T15:46:59Z","review":"I downloaded this app in curiosity it took forever to download and it also gave my phone many bugs to the point I had to take it to Apple and even they said there was nothing they could do with it so then I had to pay for a whole new phone and I also risked getting corona from this app it caused me a near death experience and gave so many notifications took hours to download as I was waiting for it to download small rats started appearing on my screen and every time I would click on them my phone would get hot as if someone jailbroke my phone it was extremely odd mind u my phone is brand new I got it like a week ago and already had to buy another one this app was poorly put together and shouldn’t have been made at all also SAVEBARRON2020"}},{"id":"6172751284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download 🤮🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kkal463","date":"2020-07-08T15:46:39Z","review":"This app is just pitiful, who ever made this should be ashamed.

But guess what. When he opened the app, he immediately started spontaneously combusting and started deteriorating right then and there. The horrible image that he saw was too much for him. It was a bunch of orange potatoes dining around in a circle ⭕️ surrounding one huge, wrinkly, orange potato 🥔 🍊🥔🍊🥔🍊🤢, chanting things like Trump 2020! They kept promising things that they couldn’t keep. My dear old grandpa Joe couldn’t take it anymore. 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔all he could see were orange potatoes. The worst thing was, that the huge orange potato in the middle was spouting useless nonsense, his toupee flapping in the wind, his wrinkly face contorting into somewhat of an evil grin. It was too much for my Grandpa Joe. Too many lies and broken promises..."}},{"id":"6172232394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Such a bad app😵✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kaykayjkkay","date":"2020-07-08T13:22:55Z","review":"I got this app and as soon as I clicked on it it turned off my phone but I just turned my phone bad on and went back to the app but it would keep exiting me out the app but then I finally got into that app to find out it took all my information and I lost everything in my old account all my information was sent to them they took all my information and now this is my new account it was the worst app I’ve ever had and I don’t think this app that spreads your information should still be here it glitched my phone really bad to the point we’re all my apps were deleting by its self and my phone kept turning off and on.

A pumpkin. I just thought it might be some pranksters throwing stuff back there so I didn’t think anything of it. But the next day I came back and I decided to get rid of it so it wouldn’t rot or anything and I turned it around to pick it up and it was trumps head! I ran inside screaming (with the pumpkin head in my hand still) and I realized that I didn’t put his head down and I screamed even louder! I threw it as far as I could and (it hit my dog) but then it grew arms and legs and started chasing me saying “why didn’t you rate me 5 stars? Rate me 5 NOW!!” But then luckily my dog went to the rescue and grabbed his head off me and ate it all up. Thank you Parker (my dog) for saving me from the terrifying pumpkin head. And that why it gets a 1 Star for me."}}]}
