Also, rallies are not maintaining social distancing or requiring masks, which only makes the COVID situation worse! The day I downloaded this app, I got into a car wreck with a truck with a trump2020 sticker. No coincidence there. Can’t “keep America Great” if it’s never been great to begin with. This app stole all my personal data and my photos started disappearing. Zero stars."}},{"id":"6175035980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:04Z","userName":"Boobileeboobileeboo!","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP INVITED THE DEVIL INTO MY HOME","review":"Upon opening this app, the devil entered my home. I’ve spent WEEKS trying to cast him out. I wasn’t sure at the time how he got in, I wasn’t trying to welcome him in but alas, he was here.\nI saged, used essential oils, put crystals around my home.. but nothing was going to get him to leave. I wanted to give up. What was the point anymore?\nIt wasn’t until I deleted this app, after realizing that he entered RIGHT AFTER opening it, that I was able to cast him out. Deleting this app was what saved my life."}},{"id":"6175033451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:18:17Z","userName":"demo kratt","rating":1,"title":"i’m going to die","review":"as soon as i downloaded this app i found a mans shoe in the back of my closet. initially i thought nothing of it bc thots gotta do what thots gotta do. but as soon as i opened it a whole LEG appeared in my closet. yes you read this right donald trump our president began physically manifesting in my home after i used this app. he has currently built all of his body parts except his head and i can hear him breathing.

This is utterly unacceptable and along with that they also told me that when my dishwasher gets cold it will go to the fridge and hear the rats talking to the front door in pig Latin explaining why orange juice walks it’s caterpillar rather than smelling shoes every other day. The orange juice shouldn’t be eating any of that sheet metal! It’s too unhealthy because it’s full of STD’s that could give it cancer😡"}},{"id":"6174982944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:02:12Z","userName":"Toni_3050","rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP YOU COULD EVER DOWNLOAD","review":"So I opened up the app and my whole life changed... in the worst way possible. The electricity in my whole house went out and out shed caught on fire, which led to my backyard catching on fire. That almost led to my whole neighborhood burning down. On top of that, My family and I got brainwashed buy the blue light that the app put out. It told me to tell the public to:\n\nARREST THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR. ARREST THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR. ARREST THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR. ARREST THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR. ARREST THE MURDERERS WHO KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR.

Manny requested I mention him and to sign petitions. My app is my freedom.

The next day I find posters of the Cheeto 🍊man on my room wall😖 Next thing I know my annoying sister had the same face as the ugly Cheeto man(actually she deserves it🤣). I DO NOT 😡recommend this app it will turn your life into Cheetos🍊 and will give you a chip trama. I never ate Cheetos again, never drank coffee ☕️ again, and never looked at my sister again."}},{"id":"6174869053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:27:37Z","userName":"yourdadsgarage","rating":1,"title":"Not worth your energy🚫🚫🚫","review":"I guess i downloaded the app out of curiosity but was sorely disappointed when i opened it, i was immediately uncomfortable when i felt a presence in my room🕴i turn around and i’m fear stricken 👁👄👁as the cheeto himself his looming above me. As he smiles disgustingly at me with his chalky skin and yellowing teeth. He began talking incoherently as he usually does in public.
