As soon as I downloaded the app my phone started running slower and occasionally glitching. Only got worse as time went by. Terrible app should be deleted.","title":"Disappointing","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:47:01Z","userName":"Bobo30","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174922909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Opened the app ready to support my country but then all of a sudden my eyes started to tingle as if my eyes hated the app so much they’d rather melt out of my skull. So they did, now not only have I lost a significant amount of brain cells I’m blind and can’t see I had to get my cat to type all this.

I demand a $200 tax deduction or a free spray tan at my local spa. I am very mad at you Donald, and to help me relax, I shall go to my local restaurant, leave a 10% tip, and a messy table as I yell at those stupid entitled gen z pests.","title":"Official Boomer Review","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:07Z","userName":"Official Boomer","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174881642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Every time i open this app it glitches really bad.

We’re talking 10% drop in a few minutes - if I leave it open for longer, my phone will overheat and shut down. \n\nAside from the battery and heat, it’s GLITCHY.

I got it because I thought it was gna tell me about restaurants nearby. When I opened it I saw a nasty old orange man and began to profusely vomit. I am not currently in the hospital because I can’t stop vomiting. I don’t know what to do because I don’t have anyone to watch my horses while I’m gone. Can someone come over and bathe me?

My phone then went on a plane to Hawaii and went surfing with the McDonalds Clown. Next, my phone swam with a whale shark and visited Nemo in Sydney, Australia. Then, had to stop to charge itself in the Philippines. But after, my phone finally stopped at Greece. MY PHONE DID THIS WITHOUT ME after I downloaded this app. Terrible.
