It is currently still stuck on the screen and my brand new iPhone 11 now has a virus from the app. I am writing this review using Siri because my phone is still stuck on the horrifying picture! IT IS EXTREMELY REVOLTING.  My cat saw the Cheeto’s dong pic and is projectile vomiting on my carpet. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173886700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:06:02Z","title":"I’m revolted.","userName":"gayandslayingthe_day","review":"I downloaded the app expecting it to work out perfectly fine, but it did not. To begin with, it took weeks to download. Another problem was the man on the front page once loading in. Um- Who is he? Didn’t he die or something? I’m confused. Is this a memorial app? If so, I could care less. You won’t be seeing me anytime soon in the app again, so please, let apple delete it. Rot in hell!

Each time I try to enter the app it takes multiple minutes. It has no flow and is hard to use because it is hella confusing.

When I first go on the app I’m greeted with a talking fruit that has teeth (much like a developed tumor). Next, it asks me multiple times to show my birth Verdi are as if I’d give such personal info to an app. This app is so trash that the power in my house went out for TWO entire days! I want compensation for the mental distress this app has caused me and my family!","isEdited":false}}]}
