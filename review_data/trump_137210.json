Suddenly, I received an Audio message recorded by our orange orangutan (Trump ew) of a president. This message advised by 1) Vote for Biden, which I supported but was very confused at. 2) cut off all my limbs, which I found disturbing 3) it told me that everything he says is a lie and he’s trying to brainwash people. Like I didn’t already know that. 4) Eat rats so we can start another pandemic. All these “messages” were fabulous worded so I gave the app a 1 star rating. After the message was over, I heard the CDC, FBI, CIA, and an army of rats barging through my door. I ran, so, so far until I reached the Mexican border. Using my brain, I walked a couple a feet and entered through the massive gap in the wall were I flexed to safety. I was then able to use TikTok and vibe with the rats who had been controlled and I freed them, we did TikTok dances and I invited charli over and we talked about some tea. Overall, disgusting app.","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting ❤️🥰✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:49Z"}},{"id":"6179973840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"donny j. trumpet","review":"After coming across this app on my favorite app, TikTok, I decided that I’d download it as well to find out what all the hype was about. Needless to say, this was the worst decision of my life. After waiting almost 5 days for it to download, I was finally able to open the app. However, as soon as I laid my finger on the app, I heard a loud scream coming from the kitchen. I dropped my phone and ran downstairs as fast as I could, but it was too late. My beloved grandma had accidentally cut her wrist while cutting up an orange (which coincidentally looked identical to Mr. Trump himself)! She soon bled out and was presumed dead at the hospital. RIP Grammy. I went back home and cried all night long thinking that it was my fault that Grammy died. I became depressed and even tried to kill myself on multiple occasions.  I had failed 3 times but on the 4th try, I succeeded. As I was falling to my death from the Golden Gate bridge, I heard a *ding* from my phone. I checked my phone, and sure enough, it was a notification from this app. This was when I realized. The app killed my Grammy. It wasn’t my fault. But it was too late. I hit the water and died instantly. I am now a ghost writing this review. Don’t get this app. It WILL ruin your life.","rating":1,"title":"this app ruined my life (and ended my grandma’s)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:42Z"}},{"id":"6179973795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Eviet10","review":"HORRIBLE DO NOT GET IT TRUST ME I REGRET IT GETTING IT, WASTED MY TIME 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮😷😷😷🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮","rating":1,"title":"🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:41Z"}},{"id":"6179973525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"789798716","review":"This app is the worst ever the should just take down like its terrible😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕","rating":1,"title":"😕I mean who would want this.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:34Z"}},{"id":"6179973449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cuicnfgurx","review":"Literally the worst app ever and it needs to be deleted I never want to see this in the App Store ever again","rating":1,"title":"Bye app🤗","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:32Z"}},{"id":"6179973228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rinathegenzbaby","review":"This app is trash it it is very pointless","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:27Z"}}]}
