While people were being attacked severely by the police, he talks about KEEPING America Great when he forgot to make it great in the first place. It was never great for minorities. Also majorly displeased to find that the game was lagging and had some major glitching. I looked at the feed only to find that this man is vituperative and dictatorial with his extreme, outlandish and close-minded opinions. This is one of the worst apps ever. Even worse than the time my hippogryph went to get me a fugeldorpe and as he was flying all the way back from Uyelflurn, he was sucked off course by a black hole, which is of course inconvenient. Following that, he was yeeted into the Great Beyond by Buzz Lightyear himself. That made him late to my block party, and he had lost my milkshake in the Whisfleherm by then anyway. It was worse than that. And that is saying something.

I started downloading this app in August of 2019 and i didn’t even realize that it had downloaded. Secondly a month ago, all my relatives started to die. First it was my grandma, then my aunt, and now my great grandpa. Then when i tried to delete it, my whole phone froze up and i can’t even restart. I have to let my phone sit for 24 hours before i can touch it again, otherwise i can never use it. And when it does work, my whole phone is so laggy. When i go on the app, bad luck starts happening. I hear creepy music coming from upstairs, and my house becomes infested with ants, my cat has a seizure, and my house gets hit with lightning. coincidence? i think not. And anybody who rates this app a 5 star and says something about politics, is being bribed or blackmailed. When on the app it tries to bribe you into rating it 5 stars. this is a warning to all of those who actually want to use it for political and support purposes.","date":"2020-07-08T22:02:51Z","title":"So here’s what happened...","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173752655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"The ants 😡","review":"This app DOES NOT WORK it gave me lice🦟and it took 13 years to download 😒please don’t use this app. FBI agents crawled trough my phone 😇screen and they tried to steal my food 🍔.

This app took WEEKS to download. When it finally downloaded it was okay the first few weeks. Then I started getting calls about the app... Weird calls. Demonic calls! I had never been so scared in my life. I tried to delete the app only to revive an email with MY house address. Someone had found my house address and threatened to come if I had tried to delete the app. For the past few weeks I’ve been trying to find a way to delete it. But I’ve been receiving bugs and DEAD animals in the mail!! You need to remove this app from the App Store before its to late. I hope the people doing this to me don’t find out about this review. I’m never downloading this app again. But I have found a way to delete bringing me happiness and joy. Any 5 star reviews are LIES! They are trying to hide this and keep their secret from us. Please report 5 star reviews and get this app taken down!! We cannot let them pretend nothing is going on behind closed doors.","date":"2020-07-08T14:57:49Z","title":"Worst app.✨🐛","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177034892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"✨❤️😻🧚🍃yasmeen🌝","review":"I downloaded this app after hearing that it would immediately deter any women or poc that may be walking down the street, as an avid trump supporter i am very racist and sexist and proud. unfortunately, when i passed by AOC walking around the nations capital, the app failed to protect me from her brown skin and female body. She immediately pulled out an assault rifle and began shooting me to the rhythm of the Antifa national anthem, Black and Yellow. She claimed her first amendment right to a gun, which now that women and poc can own guns, i would like to abolish. Anyway, after shooting me do death, she individually plucked my eyeballs out and began to throw them in the air, probably some sort of ethnic voodoo. As a bearded, white, male, i felt very threatened. The police then came over and i was so thankful, I thought they would help me, but across their path to come get me a BLACK MAN walked by and they had to drop everything to go “feel threatened” and murder him. Nothing new. Anyway, i’m very disappointed with the apps lies and i will not redownload.","date":"2020-07-09T14:54:06Z","title":"Please read-will NEVER redownload","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176820910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"cass12388","review":"Well first off i downloaded this app to get the latest news from our president that has the same orange tanner as every southern highschool-college preppy/FFA girl (🍊🎃) and the app took ALL NIGHT to download!😠 Not to mention as soon as i clicked on the app to see whats going on with the trumpster ITS ASKED FOR MY PHONE NUMBER are you crazy??!!!! Thats totally a violation of privacy and i dont want the government accessing my data like that!!! Isnt that why we are deleting that tiktak app????? 😫😩✨🦋 AND if that wasnt bad enough my phone is now lagging when i have tons of icloud storage! My dad woke me up this morning to tell me that the tv was stuck on fox news until i typed my number into the app aswell its so bizarre. Why does mr trumpy even want our information 😔 is he lonely? How does he think Baron feels😳 plus it has taken me two hours to even type this review because my phone is going so slow and i keep getting TONS of pictures of trump being spammed into my messages😔🍊🍊","date":"2020-07-09T13:57:21Z","title":"😡very disappointed with the lack of privacy","isEdited":false}}]}
