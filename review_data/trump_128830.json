They do not privatise your data in the slightest, and this results in constant website ads, YouTube commercials, and emails from the Trump administration. They have stolen my data and completely overtaken the platforms that I use on a day to day basis, like Google and social media. Along with being forced to see President Trump's face plastered upon all of my devices like Big Brother in 1984, this app has led to my phone crashing numerous times since I've downloaded it. I would give this zero stars if I could.","userName":"SarahLM2020","date":"2020-07-09T11:23:58Z"}},{"id":"6176260416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!","review":"So I saw many disgusting and horrible photos and I saw his nude$ and my child saw it too and we were absolutely shocked and my child cannot get the picture out of her head she will be traumatized for the rest of her life, thanks a lot 😡😡 and now I have to send her to therapy and it costs a lot and I demand a paycheck for her sessions and she is still tormented by this as I write this review, you should be ashamed of urself mr.orange 😡.","userName":"kawaii kittes","date":"2020-07-09T11:23:53Z"}},{"id":"6176258990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No 💖😻","review":"Donald Trump is a stupid poop. الله يلعن  ابو ترامب.

Given this information, plus my undying love and worship for DonDon – hehehe my cute little nickname I gave our handsome president 🤣 – I downloaded it IMMEDIATELY. This was the start of my troubles. I had to delete ALL my other apps in order for this one to even completely download, even the app that stored the only pictures I have of my late grandma. All the rest burned in a house fire last year and I don’t remember my password to my account so those pictures are lost forever – RIP Grandma 💔. I was determined to help Trumps campaign though so after it finally downloaded (took about 38 days), I opened the app and signed up! Right when I signed in to my account, my email/text messages/social media apps were BOMBARDED with ads for Donald’s exclusive line of spray tan called “Cheeto Dust Delight”. I also received around 375 emails regarding toupee coupons and for some reason my YouTube would only allow me to watch videos regarding proper toupee application & maintenance. Weird right?😳 At this point I was feeling pretty frustrated because I was just trying to be a good citizen & support our non racist, non homophobic, and non sexist president! BUT THEN when I tried to log in to the app the next day, I received a blocked phone call. I answered and it was FREAKING President Trump himself😎🥺🇺🇸! To say I was honored would be an understatement, but I had no idea what was coming. Apparently, the FBI and CIA were able to use the app to hack into all of my accounts and steal my personal private data. After reviewing all my information, they discovered that I had posted a black square on my Instagram for #blackouttuesday and texted FLOYD to 55156. This did not please them at all. Trump went on to call me a “fat and unattractive woman” who served no purpose on earth because I wasn’t pretty and can’t have children – don’t really know how they got my medical records?🤯📑📊 He finished the phone call by saying that I was a disgrace to Christians everywhere & the great Republican state of Texas (where I live) because I support the BLM movement and don’t own a gun. Needless to say, this app ruined me.😭Save yourself the pain of being denounced by America’s idol president and don’t download it.💔💔💔 I guess you’ll be fine if you’re a rapist, homophobe, misogynist, and racist though.😎🤩👍🏻","userName":"diehardtrumpgroupie","date":"2020-07-09T11:22:22Z"}},{"id":"6176250280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BLEHHH🤮🤮🤮🤮ABSOLUTELY DISCUSTING","review":"I👿WAS🎃A😻GIRL📪IN🧚🏼THE👰🏻VILLAGE👩🏿\u200D🚒DOING🗄ALRIGHT🧲THEN🔧I🛢BEACAME🧸A🎊PRINCESS🎁OVERNIGHT👺NOW🤕I👹GOTTA🤠FIGURE❣️HOW🙅🏻 TO🧟\u200D♂️DO🙆🏻\u200D♀️IT🧞\u200D♀️RIGHT💧 SO🌈MUCH🌪TO🌜LEARN🐽AND🩱SEE👚 anywayyyy #settleforbiden2020","userName":"hell no to the no no no","date":"2020-07-09T11:20:51Z"}}]}
