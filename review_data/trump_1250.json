To my dismay, as soon as I opened the app, there was a terrible, disgusting picture of an orange man with this terrifying look on his face. His expression was that of a malicious frog. I swallowed my fear and continued to go through with the app by entering my mobile number. However, as soon as I did that, I was sent hundreds of useless texts that consisted of nonsense. One text said, and I quote, “Do you listen to Girl in Red?” while another merely sent another horrifying image of the same orange man that I had seen when I had first launched the app. The images are now engraved into my pure, developing brain. I am beginning to consider therapy to help myself forget the revolting photos. I am so fed up with this sickening and abusive app and hope that this scam is taken down from the App Store once and for all. Save the future from being scarred like I was."}},{"id":"6173904549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lol its ari","title":"#not my president","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:12:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I really thought that i would be getting white privilege with this app but it did nothing!!! 😤😤😡 Like how can you have my download an app and NOT GIVE ME THE B E N I F I T S of being a trump supporter in 2020 😖😭.

Then trump in a Azula outfit shot lightning at me but I caught it and threw it back  but I was another shadow clone so I had to defeat fire lord trumpzie and I went into the avatar state and defeated him and took away his bending. Then I got on appa (my flying bison) and got some chicken nuggies but it was 5 dollars and I was going to use my 5 dollars to get some Cheetos 😢 so now I’m sad. So I so I started to listen to rod wave and YoungBoy then it occurred to me that my fish was drowning so I took him out of his bowl and but him in the toaster so he could be warm and then I played 2k and watched some tv and fell asleep and my mom carried me to bed."}},{"id":"6173638292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👉🏽👌🏾✌🏽","title":"Gosh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:34:01Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is very terrible a waste of space in my phone really. When you first get it you are asked to give your phone number and it has a very disturbing picture on it and I feel like many people also feel the same way. Not only does it have  a  terrible image it’s asking for my phone number and I’m not comfortable giving my information just like that. There also so many glitches in the app that I can’t understand why the hell it was made in the first place if it wasn’t going to be made right. Despite all this I feel like I know a way to make this app of better use. If we put our president BARACK OBAMA and not have a white racist cheeto looking person on it. Basically just get rid of the whole app and make it about Barack Obama then I feel like it will have the best reviews ever. Oh and also the kpop industry should not be underestimated at all. Kpop fans UNITE!!!! Black lives matter✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻"}},{"id":"6173496146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"atruetrumpet","title":"Absolutely god awful 🙁","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:43Z","isEdited":false,"review":"To my fellow conservatives, trump-supports and knowers of the truth I beg of you if you want to know the truest  form of OUR president don’t get this app. It is libtard propaganda. \n\nIn the hopes to get the most beautiful and insightful news about our president I downloaded this app. I had heard wonderful things and wanted to keep up to date about the campaign only to be met with open hostility as soon as I downloaded the app. It was like Russia themselves invaded my phone. There flag was being flown and people were speaking that Russian language as if I could understand it. Now I KNOW our president would never be a traitor to this country you can tell by the way he look, with that American boy look to him. They way his skin gleams an orange hue wether it be day or night and how his Toupee is just the right shade of “hay in the barn” blond. But this app is just propaganda to prove these “facts over feeling” wrong. \n\nDo not get it. I repeat  DO NOT GET IT."}},{"id":"6173469473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Concerned Citizen36","title":"Dangerous App!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app and only within a couple sentences I got texts saying that someone was watching. They told me that they could see and hear me through my phone, so I deleted as quickly as a could, but that didn’t help. I then proceeded to get a new phone and download the app again because I thought it was just that phone and not the app. It was working fine for a few days before I started getting headaches and realized that the app was causing it. My uncle also downloaded the app and had a stroke caused by it. I was about to delete the app again, but right before I could my phone froze up and was only able to receive texts from someone who said that they could watch and hear everything I do through my phone. So now I am on my third phone this month and never getting this app again. I thought I would just let people know to also never get this app!!!!"}},{"id":"6172792237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jjaderivera","title":"horrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:58:21Z","isEdited":false,"review":"as soon as i opened this app the horrible odor it gave out was astonishing. i almost threw my phone away. i don’t usually write reviews on apps but this was absurd. i also almost went blind while looking at the pictures of trump. don’t get me wrong i’m so so happy to have a president who is a pedophilic, racist, narcissist, with multiple sexual assault allegations, who couldn’t even pass his own SATs, a white supremacist, and a waste of human being. we gotta love him huh? also i love the fact that he is blaming china for the insane rise of covid 19 in america, when it was his job to get it under control just like every other country did. but we obviously can’t expect much from donald duck right? oh i’m sorry, i shouldn’t compare that amazing king donald to the so called “leader” of the US. my badddd. i’m gonna go back to watching criminal minds now. peace out y’all. \n#blacklivesmatter #loveislove #tiktoklivesmatter #freebarron2020 #stanharrystyles"}},{"id":"6172715092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vghdtjjnjkkyg","title":"this app is a waste of time","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:36:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This took a week to download and I have excellent WiFi. And once I opened the app, all my other apps stopped working. And on top of that, it kept glitching and I saw an old man with an orange face on it?? And I’m not one to make fun of someone’s skin color but my guinea pig thought it was an orange and tried to eat it! So then we had to go to the vet but on the way there she say so many flags and she’s deathly afraid of flags! So then she passed out and we had to give her CPR. When we got to the vet, she said because of a piece of glass on her stomach, she’s gonna die next week. But we have Jesus Christ to bring her back:). I know she would’ve wanted me write this because she was my everything. And some people say I’m crazy because my guinea pig is stuffed, but who are they to judge! Anyways this app caused my dead guinea pig to die a second time and now we have to eat it because my family’s Cuban.

I got emails from the president saying that it was rude and disappointing to not give him money for his campaign but im a single mother with no job. I couldn’t afford it even if He has our best interest in mind. The freaky things started happening after I didn’t give money. I would get nonstop messages to my phone and email demanding money. My phone would glitch and images of nazi symbols, his orange face, racial slurs and him making sexual remarks about his daughter would appear. It terrified me to my core. Not only that but satanic symbols and videos were being sent to my phone via this app. Later after I got rid of the app my grandparents died, my fish died and my poor nephews fell down the stairs. They wereCHILDREN! Once the bank took my house and I got kicked out of college I realized that Donald Trump is hexing people for not supporting him. I will forever be on the run."}},{"id":"6177898985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NOT SONIC THE HEDGEHOG","title":"Here’s the issue. A complaint on portals.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:11:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Before downloading this app, I was excited to support our president! I was ready to support MAGA (Magicians Against Greasy Animals) with my full being. Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the app, I was greeted with a portal to an alternate dimension. What?? Soon the FBI was at my door, because as everyone knows, the FBI tries to cover up every appearance of a blurb in the space time continuum. I had to pack my bags and jump out of my apartment window. With Donald’s app open and a singular Nintendo switch compatible Mario Kart 8 card, I was ready to take on the world. As soon as I was prepping to jump through the portal, IT CLOSED!! IM SORRY, BUT IF YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE A PORTAL ON THE OPENING SCREEN OF AN APP, PLEASE MAKE IT FULLY FUNCTIONAL. I AM NOW BEING TAKEN AWAY BY THE FBI AS YOU READ THIS. I WILL BE POSTING UPDATES ON THIS COMMENT. \nUPDATE, I HAVE BEEM BROUGHT TO AREA 15. WE GOT IT WRONG, THIS IS WHERE THEY KEEP THE ALIENS. \nUPDATE UPDATE, I HAVE RALLIED THE ALIENS TOGETHER.\nUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE WE HAVE TAKEN OVER THE FBI"}}]}
