One night I was laying in bed on my phone and I couldn’t help to notice hearing a humming noises coming from my phone. It also made sounds similar to a static TV. It was a very faint sound, but at night when there’s no other noise but your phone, you can hear it. I looked it up on google, and the noise apparently means that your phone has been wiretapped or someone has hacked your phone’s camera and microphone to look at you and hear what you’re saying all of the time! A little scary of you ask me?","rating":1,"userName":"Kyla1801","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:34:53Z"}},{"id":"6172270580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad quality, bad content","review":"I downloaded the app to try and get more information about his platform, and the app is soooo bad. It’s glitchy, crashed my phone three different times, and takes forever to load every page. Not only that, but the content in this app is so obviously biased and not at all based on fact. Also, you have to enter so much personal information and I was getting so many texts and calls every hour about his campaign, and taking surveys, and donating, and buying tickets for rallies, and it was too ridiculous. I never thought the president of our country would give me flashbacks to my clingy, desperate ex but here we are","rating":1,"userName":"Joyce6162837","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:33:25Z"}},{"id":"6171788440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Your fellow Racist “Friend” 🤡","review":"I recently rsvp’d to the Trump rally a couple weeks ago that was held in Tulsa, OK but unfortunately couldn’t attend because I couldn’t find my crocs. Ever since then I’ve been constantly harassed by Don Jr. asking for money and calling me “friend”. I find it extremely disingenuous. Isn’t the POTUS a billionaire? Why is he asking us uneducated folk without a college degree to donate? Gimme some money! My wife Karen and I have nothing to give except our racism. Isn’t that enough for him? He done did it in ‘16 and all us closet-racists have come out might and proud! That should be enough! Stop pestering me for donations and I can’t wait to get my golden Nazi Trump card once I get a job and can donate $30!","rating":1,"userName":"MariSkutt","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:10:33Z"}},{"id":"6177811023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app is GHETTO","review":"So, when I downloaded this app, I downloaded it for promising, truthful information! It is the #1 News app after all! That’s when I realized.... I did not trust it. I couldn’t. IT WAS A CULT APP! Campaign? More like CULT. I was so upset. I had joined a cult. 😭I did not want to worship their leader any longer. When I uninstalled it, I started going crazy. Weird people with Trump attire/apparel started coming to my house... They were all so creepy. It’s like they were coming to get me. 😔 I didn’t know what to do. Less and less have started to come each day, but NEVER AGAIN will I install an app like this. I CANT JOIN A CULT. Sigh. Well I’m done.\n\nALSO I DARE YOU TO TRY TO BAN TIK TOK B* GEN Z WILL NOT PUT UP WITH YOUR BS WITHOUT A D* FIGHT.","rating":1,"userName":"Idontwanttoworshipanorange","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:44:03Z"}},{"id":"6177793038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🦋✨🍁This app is terrible🧚🏽✨❤️","review":"✨🧚🏽🌸🍒🍄It took forever to download and when it finally did, it made my phone so slow. The quality is horrible and just the over all look of the app made me want to vomit. I mean all you see when you download the app is a old, wrinkly, egotistical piece of garbage with fake hair.✨🧚🏽🦋✨I was just trying to educate myself on why I should follow “my” president, but all I found was reasons I should not support this orange, idiotic, disgusting, racist, sexist, homophobic rapist. I am honestly super disappointed in all the people that can support this cruel and ignorant creature. Gen z will take over even the bunker boy, oops I meant president knows it, thank you. 🧚🏽🍄✨💗😈","rating":1,"userName":"qeryioppkjhgfddsccvbnmnvc","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:38:42Z"}},{"id":"6177643054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my phone","review":"I was so excited to have this app so that I could get a daily dose of cheeto to add to to my calorie intake. However, when I downloaded it my phone started glitching and got a virus. Now I keep getting messages from a Nigerian Prince who wants a plane ticket to America. Then, my phone glitched and I saw my FBI agent for the first time. I was horrified to find out that he’s bald and definitely not Chris Evans. I’m horrified and will have nightmares for years because of this. This app did not only ruin my phone but I am now severely traumatized. I believe that Trump should pay for compensation because all of the trauma that I just experienced. You don’t have my vote.","rating":1,"userName":"dre.dre in the temple of god","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:52:38Z"}},{"id":"6177541665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Unacceptable","review":"I love trump or at least that is what I thought I got this app to hear all of the good things about him because all that ever comes up in the news is the bad stuff but when I got this app I saw it was cheap and had fake news I really thought our president would be able to step up and use some of his billions of dollars to make a good app for his supporters and the thing I found worse is that sometimes he wasn’t even involved in the news on this app sometimes it was this fat Cheeto which  confused me obviously he I am so upset right now I was his biggest fan now I just think he is a fraud and he definitely lost my vote. 😡😡😡","rating":1,"userName":"jgdbfxbcxbcxnvx","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:12Z"}},{"id":"6177433856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It doesn’t work","review":"This app is asking too much of personal information.  Also, it glitches and throws me out as if I’m the immigrants he wants to lock in cages. Really disapproving and I believe the app better be deleted for the sake of some users and the United State itself.  Was really looking forward to see a lot of hate comments in the posts.  Oh well, we’ll wait next time to throw this whole system away or something even better for the sake of our “beloved and free” country.  Thank you and have a good day🖤.  \n\nP.S: You make US great again, America is a continent you hypocrites.

Just so I could see all of the ❄️ libtards cry. But the second I downloaded the app I knew something was wrong. I am a woman so I ran to the mirror to see what happened. All the sudden my eyes changed from black to a terrifying vibrant blue color and my eyelashes looked like spiders. By hair turned bleached blonde but I wasn’t that convincing bc my roots were showing. And last but definitely not least, my skin turned into an disgusting orange color. Definitely a fake tan gone wrong. But enough about me, after I saw my disgusting appearance, I ran into my baby’s room to see if she was ok. She exploded😓.","rating":1,"userName":"Vballer1234567891011","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:33:10Z"}}]}
