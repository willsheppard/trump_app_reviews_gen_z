It has half the communication that it promises and caused my phones battery to die within 3 hours of use just running in the background!\n\nMr. Trump, you have a lot to work on before this app is nearly as good as it should be!\n\nNot to mention the app kept glitching out and the words, “You have little time left” kept showing up over and over on the screen in different places. I think this app has given me a curse, because when this happens my tv will begin to play static at the same time as the app glitches out. Since i have downloaded this app, i have been seeing shadow figures walking around at night, heard steps from inside my attic, and hear whispers when i’m home alone in the quiet. I don’t know how to explain this, but I think this app has unleashed something that is trying to kill me.\n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP\nIT WILL HAUNT YOU","rating":1,"title":"Worst App EVER","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:23Z","userName":"IzzyGAwesome","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173452951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. It released a bug to my phone and made me get software. Not only does this app have false information about our president (saying how he’s so great and all) but it was also found that this app tracks you and records your ongoing conversations. Me and my team of highly trained professionals in the LSIS community have proof to take this app to court and sue for false allegations. I would recommend taking this app off the App Store unless your ready to get sued along with Apple for allowing this monstrosity to be on the App Store. you will be receiving emails from my team.","rating":1,"title":"if I could I would rate 0 stars","date":"2020-07-08T19:29:57Z","userName":"yo momma da ugly butt","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173314603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was so excited to get this app because i’m a big fan of trump. it took so long to download and i had to delete many of my apps that i USE just to get this app. once it downloaded i opened it up i realized i had to use my phone number. why can’t there just be a trump app to where we don’t have to use our phone numbers? it’s ridiculous! i’m starting to dislike trump and his decisions. i deleted the app and i will be spreading the word and telling people not to get it because of the foolery. i will NEVER be getting this app again or doing anything to support trump anymore.","rating":1,"title":"worst app ever !!","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:04Z","userName":"ash379248","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173245411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Every time I use this app I get kicked out of it even with the latest iPhone and new updates. This doesn’t happen in any other app but this one. Also you don’t get key info about the trump administration like their decision to ban thriving social media app TikTok. Their reasoning for this is because TikTok is a Chinese company. Tons and tons of Chinese products made from Chinese companies are brought and sold to the USA but this one social media company has to be banned? I found out this information from multiple reliable sources and it adds to the many reasons why this app is ABSOLUTELY USELESS AND UNRELIABLE.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE SOFTWARE AND BAD INFO","date":"2020-07-08T18:19:41Z","userName":"Angel key","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173136614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all this app took me 5 hours to download. An app shouldn't take that long. Second of all this app has caused my mother extreme vomiting that she ended up in the hospital. She saw a picture of the president and almost DIED. This app is so not safe for people of America. The app also makes you feel horrible for not voting for trump. It was saying \"if you don't vote for trump you and your family and everyone you know will not be going to heaven and you will have to live the rest of your life's in pity\". I was shocked on how they chose to do this. This app needs to be taken off the App Store immediately.","rating":1,"title":"This app is HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-08T17:44:24Z","userName":"Kalynanana","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173072263","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to find reasons to support our president for 2020 election but when it asked for my information I put it in and then the next day I went to go back onto the app and I was hacked I just kept seeing this orange face Donald Trump‘s face all over the screen and it kept popping up and when I tried to click out of it, it didn’t work. So I do not recommend buying this app because I had to go inside the store to be able to delete the app and then I had to reset my phone completely and I lost all of my pictures and all of my contacts.","rating":1,"title":"terrible app🙄","date":"2020-07-08T17:23:49Z","userName":"#blm #blm #blm","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172962082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is a murder weapon, i was scrolling through the app to see which rally i wanted to go to near me, and my mother walked past to go grab the gravy from the dining room and she saw what i was on and fainted and cracked her head open on the tile floor, spilling gravy everywhere!!! we rushed her to the emergency room because she was bleeding so badly, we got her in and they tried stitching it up but she fell into a coma!! and i know what you’re thinking, there’s no way that could happen from cracking your head open but it did!! my poor mother was in a coma for 3 WEEKS! last night she sadly passed away holding my hand.
