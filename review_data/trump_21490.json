I had to spend ¬£75 just to get my phone back but I lost precious pictures that held sentimental value.

Like a cup of hot covfefe, it is steamy and sweet. Yet... it leaves me wanting more. Specifically: a competent and moral leader.  Someone who loves his fellow citizens -all of them- more than his economy or his shot at re-election.  Someone who is not a division-sowing, anti-science fascist hoping we ignore our climbing death toll and his increasing tendencies towards authoritarianism.  Someone who doesn‚Äôt rule via executive tweet.","date":"2020-07-09T23:23:17Z"}},{"id":"6178411779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Waste of storage","userName":"Dullcee","review":"This app wastes a ton of storage.

The president being THE PRESIDENT obviously has access to the best professional tech people, but somehow made the most trash app.  The president doesn‚Äôt show any consideration concerning his citizens and its truly childish and annoying.  Let me know when we get a good worthy, leading, unselfish, educated president.","date":"2020-07-09T21:19:08Z"}}]}
