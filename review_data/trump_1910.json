The only reason it finally worked was cause I got a spray tan. My phone kept crashing 🍂while I used it and when it finally would work it told me to wear a mask. 🪐I mean what is this 2020??? ✨🌈. So I put on the mask and it cause me to fall down the Eiffel Tower and I woke up on the road. ThEre was a giraffe with 50 year old men playing football and it actually hit me in the head causing me to wake up dehydrated at the zoo in the dolphin cage. I showed the dolphins this app and they went crazy soon breaking the glass and sending me into my basement in my dogs cage! All I can say is SUPER DANGEROUS☄️. Do not download without my warning🏋️","isEdited":false,"title":"Oops Gen Z here comin at ya live","date":"2020-07-09T16:33:25Z"}},{"id":"6177310104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"melania trumpets","review":"i downloaded this app so i can see what cheeto man was up to, but the app took 69 weeks to download and i lost all my patience. then finally, when it downloaded, i opened the app and when i did, i saw this tall, six-foot, orange cheeto lookin’ man who gave me a heart attack. luckily, my dad is a heart surgeon and he gave me a new heart. when i fully recovered, i opened the app again in hopes that soemthing better would pop up, but no. it was the same tall, cheeto, oompa loompa lookin’ creature. i would give this zero stars, but i can’t do that. so i’ll just be nice and give it a one ⭐️ rating. the cover for the app doesn’t even look good. i had no clue what the app was when it downloaded, cause again, it took 420 days to download, so i forgot about it 🙄 ugh talk about a millionaire who can’t even make his apps download quick.","isEdited":false,"title":"OPENED THE APP TO AN UGLY LOOKIN’ OOMPA LOOMPA","date":"2020-07-09T16:11:43Z"}},{"id":"6177257076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"its gossip girl✨","review":"So one day I was scrolling through my AppStore and I see an app that lets u learn more about 🍊 so ofc I got it to see what’s up and not only did it take 2 months to download, when I got the app it was ~horrible~ the app was cluttered and it brought me to this weird ugly Cheeto thing and made me learn abt it instead of 🍊! And then after a week of having this ~horrible~ app weird stuff was popping up in my room like trump 2020 posters 🤮 so I quickly tried to delete the app but when I tried to delete it an orange Cheeto kicked me and brought me to Australia where I showed a kangaroo the app and the kangaroo hated ugly Cheetos so he kicked me into space where I saw Barron and Milania trying to escape and so I joined them and together we were finally able to be free. also me and the kangaroo r best friends now we made up. ok bye","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is not good😤","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:21Z"}},{"id":"6177220913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Lolabobola101","review":"after weeks of the app trying to download i was finally able to open the app but when i opened to app i was greeted by this cheeto looking man, who gave me a heart attack from how ✨ugly✨he was. I was practically dying the whole time i was on the app and no one even noticed the service was t e r r i b l e. i tried to shrug it off and see what i could learn from our racist💕🌸 and homophobic💫🧚🏻\u200D♀️ president but was unable to figure out how to use the app, everything was very confusing, but i was especially heartbroken by the low vocabulary used in the app, i thought we had a president with a very high IQ😿💫🌸 but guess not. I was so in shock from the app practically called me fat i had to close it, after that i cried for weeks and i’ve finally found the courage to stand back to the app and write my experience, thank you💕.","isEdited":false,"title":"✨i n s h o c k✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:45:51Z"}},{"id":"6177029264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"someoneveeheijdjwuqkjccx","review":"I got this app to show my FULL support😂to my racist a- I mean president 🤫. Ten minutes after DORA knocked on my door. We decided to go get Starbucks to celebrate downloading the app. Two min after arrival we both got a notification from the app saying if we don’t vote for TRUMP then we’d get locked in cage with angry dogs. Thinking it was a joke and our little carrot 🥕 would never do that to us we continued celebrating 🥳. suddenly we heard the door crash open🚪🤛. It was Trump’s little paranoid minions. They raided the store, tear gassed every one, pushed and shoved innocent people during a worldwide 🌍pandemic and blamed it on the people sipping their coffee not brainwashed by a peace of 💩. Over all the app glitched a lot and I would not recommend downloading it. Anyway I wouldn’t expect anything more from our little carrot 🥕 .","isEdited":false,"title":"Sending my love to my little phat 🥕","date":"2020-07-09T14:52:32Z"}},{"id":"6176679053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🌸🌸uwu🌸🌸","review":"The download speed is horrible. I thought that I’d never get to see my loving, totally not homophobic, totally not racist president’s face, as I waited for this accursed app to download. I looked at my definitely real poster of Trump. The poster was silent but his energy said it all. He was weeping. I began to weep as well, placing a soft tender finger over his Cheeto dust lips. “Shhh Donald...” I comforted him. “We’ll see each other soon.” Once the app finally downloaded. I was excited to see my badly self tanned president. Oh how I yearned to see his awkward stance. But... He was not who I thought he was. Donald personally came to my house once I opened the app. I was delighted, that is, until he opened a bottle of drain cleaner and dumped it on our floors. Taking our cleaners from under our sink and spewing them everywhere. I still can’t believe I witnessed such an atrocious act.","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:58Z"}},{"id":"6176641488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"joshieskookie","review":"I’ve been trying to download this app since the 2016 election so I could support this rich dude and it didn’t finish downloading until yesterday. He agreed to get me a job and pay off the national debt by refunding me my 100 billion dollars. HOWEVER he has done none of those things!! I now work a job paying the absolute minimum wage and I still haven’t gotten my money back 😤 How am I supposed to pay for my BBL and Nose job now. I have a family to provide for, but since I don’t have any money, I live just outside my nearest Walmart along with my 3 kids, 5 siblings, my mother and her mother. I was just trying to buy some MAGA hats for my family and a banner and he sent me 11 staples and a piece of paper with “WHITE POWER” scribbled on it. This app also caused my cancer and gave me herpes. Worst mistake of my LIFE, NEVER download this app!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T13:10:03Z"}},{"id":"6176105302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"edp for pres 2020","review":"I was buying his shirt and it made me pay$500 dollars and they said if I don’t pay I will we put in jail😤😤😤 and they took all my pets and they cut my light and my water for a month but you still have to pay for it and then they took my car and burned it and put me in jail for 3 weeks I don’t recommend downloading it or it will make you pay for NOTHING🤬🤬 and they took half of my money out of my bank and they said they were gonna use it to pay people for them to vote on him and your not aloud to leave your house at all after jail and.

So ofc I had to download this app! To support my gosh dang president. To be honest with you I ain’t heard about this until my sister or as I like to call her my lover, my honey bunchkin of oats told me about it and her love for Mr. President made me want to show some patriotism and I downloaded it after downloading it I didn’t seem to have any problems that’s until me and my sisters 3 eyed child BuRtis junior ( we had to keep him when my sister leighleigh got pregnant at 15 because we pro life ofc) decided to play games on my phone and opened up this app to see a picture of mr presidents small Willy and he was blind on the spot all three of poor burtis juniors eyes went blind. So lemme say this download the app if you want your children to see a🍤 Willy. but BEWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES!!!!! \n\nYours Truly \nBilly Bob Bobby Billy","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute Garbage","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:46Z"}},{"id":"6175558079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"textylexi","review":"This app is terrible, if I could give it a 0/10 I WOULD!! Do not, I repeat, do NOT download this app! All I wanted to do was reserve my tickets for our nation’s most fantastic, totally not racist, and definitely not orange president’s rally coming up. Well, they caught on to those darn kids who ruined his last rally on Tik Tok so they made me download this app. Not only did it take up all 256gb of storage on my phone, it cost $2,000 dollars, asked for my first born child AND refused to let me register for tickets without asking me to sell my soul to the devil first. Determined to support our nation’s smartest and totally not racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic leader, I complied and was FINALLY able to reserve my tickets. Then weird things started happening, including my phone BURSTING INTO FLAMES!! So yeah, I repeat, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP AND VOTE DONALD J. TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE 2020!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"So bad, 0/10 DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:31:01Z"}}]}
