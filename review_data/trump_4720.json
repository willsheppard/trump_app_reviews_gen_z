My name is ✨Karen Smith✨ and I HATE this app. You see kids from taktik, the app commenting stuff about ninja turtles attacking them and loosing their poor dog. And I would proudly like to say that I 100% agree with them. As soon as I downloaded the app my dog, also known as baby biscuits, went missing. I have looked everywhere for baby biscuits. Yet no hope 😵😡😪 Also the claim over Ninjas was unrealistic. For me it was the hulk and ironman. So DO NOTTTT download this app ever!!! Its a waste of time and braincells","date":"2020-07-08T18:04:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karens not happy 🤩🤩"}},{"id":"6173165081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No Thanks","rating":1,"review":"First of all, the app took a long time to download while I had wifi which I didn’t expect. I first of all downloaded it in attempt to find reasons to vote for Pres. Trump, but that idea quickly clouded away. After I put in my mobile phone number, I kept getting spam messages from a random number for Trump, one of them being one to get a Trump 2020 doormat and I had specifically pressed ‘no notifications’ right when I downloaded it because I didn’t want that. Not only is it also incredibly slow in general, but it was really confusing also. Please don’t spam me for doormats, no thanks.","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"===========*****€_>|£\\"}},{"id":"6173024986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"review":"Donald Trump is the textbook case of a narcissistic personality. He has an exaggerated sense of self-importance, a sense of entitlement that requires constant admiration, expects to be recognized as superior in every way, exaggerating his own talents, successes, power, brilliance, beauty and having the perfect mate. He monopolizes conversations and belittles those who he considers to be his inferior, expects favors and unquestioning compliance to his expectations, takes advantage of others to get what he wants but is clearly unable to acknowledge the needs and feelings of others. Finally, he is envious of others but firmly believes others envy him. He has trouble handling anything perceived as criticism 🍊🍊🍊〰️🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💗","date":"2020-07-08T17:08:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"haru oran"}},{"id":"6172891305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Extremely disappointed","rating":1,"review":"This app was beyond a let down, it took not hours but days to download on my brand new iPhone 11 so frankly the phone could not be the problem. It froze on multiple occasions and even forcibly shut down my phone. I have had to restart and turn off my phone to continue using the app which I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. Absolutely nothing has been done to fix these bugs and I’m sick of it. I made sure to enable notifications but I never seem to get any and the few times that I do they literally blow up my phone. The administration and developers should be ashamed and I want it removed!","date":"2020-07-08T16:27:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Meg Aballs"}},{"id":"6172575490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"...","rating":1,"review":"I can’t even begin to explain the amount of despair and trauma this app has caused me. I think ive become deathly allergic, Becuase a few months prior seeing this app on the App Store would constantly make me sneeze... and sure with a giant Cheeto as president I figured it was the dust flying up into my face from his old orange self. But not even seeing the app on my home screen I start crying, sweating, sneezing uncontrollably and my throat almost locks up. I had to delete it it was causing me emotional, mental, and physical pain. I think Honestly for the safety of society this app should be completely removed some nobody else catches the Cheeto diseases that fumes off of this application.","date":"2020-07-08T14:57:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"beagle40"}},{"id":"6172574363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Come find me daddy trump✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️","rating":1,"review":"I tried to find out how to like my daddy 🍊more.

I looked through the app for hours and after those very long hours I have come to a conclusion, just don’t vote for him. Whenever somebody stands up against him he shuts them down immediately, taking away our freedom of speech. He wants to get rid of the one thing Gen Z has finally been able to use use to come together and work our way through issues. He thinks that that will stop us, nothing will stop our generation. So if you’re going to take tik-tok from us were taken everything you’ve got.","date":"2020-07-08T14:55:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ashy91504"}},{"id":"6172212346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🧚\u200D♂️My innocent Eyes ✨🧚\u200D♂️😢 Obama is my President 👑✨","rating":1,"review":"What is this app it’s literally scary. I hate seeing Cheetos on my screen and he is trying to take away tic tok like boy of you don’t get your 48 hours in a tanning bed out of here. If you voted for him you must seek medical help instantly. He just scared me like I wanted to cry and he literally acts like a 5 year old that’s why Obama is my kind 🧚\u200D♂️✨👑 I hope you get impeached and stop eating a lot of Burger King you already fat and orange you hippo. That’s why your girl don’t want you when you broke she gon btw let your son wife me up prdt. BLACK LIFES MATTER. And y’all need to stop voting for Cheetos. Tell me why when I opened the app I threw my phone","date":"2020-07-08T13:17:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Obama is 👑"}},{"id":"6145628023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrifying 😱😱","rating":1,"review":"As soon as i opened the app, some strange orange man burst through my door! He started yelling at me, and i couldn't understand most of what he was saying because he talked like a 3 year old but I could understand a few words like 'N****' and 'F****t'. I find both of those words very offensive but when I tried to get him to shut up, he pulled down his pants and showed me something that looked kinda like a shrimp 🍤. Then 500 cops showed up and arrested me. 😭 I would not recommend this app if you don't like racist, homophobic, oompa loompa, sexual predators, or a bunch of squealing crying pigs that somehow got a hold of weapons. I am truly traumatized.","date":"2020-07-01T20:27:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"skinnyween"}},{"id":"6177789447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst","rating":1,"review":"Donald Trump has been the worst president we have ever had. He doesn’t care about our country or our happiness. He only cares about the money and his family. He’s made horrible jokes about women and he thinks it’s okay to grab females by their lady parts. He makes jokes about his daughter saying he would sleep\nWith her if she wasn’t his daughter and he is always saying racist stuff. Now he wants to ban tik tok and act like he doesn’t already use our information from our phone or from our electronic devices. I just want his app to get token away because tik tok is the only app that brings me laughter and happiness.","date":"2020-07-09T18:37:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Islacutegirl"}}]}
