On top of that while it was downloading one of trumps stupid speeches started playing and then my phone got connected to my living room Bluetooth speaker. After the app downloaded it never opened and sent a VIRUS TO MY PHONE. I had to take my phone to the apple store and when they turned on my phone my wallpaper had changed to a picture of Donald trump. What a terrible app and what a terrible president.","userName":"myra003","title":"Do not download","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:59:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172639809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support my president like a normal human being but as soon as I downloaded it my phone was glitching a lot so I restarted my phone but still nothing. It came to the point where my decided to completely shut off and not turn back on. I had to get a new phone. This happened all because I downloaded the app, I have never had any problem with my phone in the past. I don’t think I will be downloading the app on my new phone. (PS I’m on my daughters iPad).","userName":"Elizabethc.68","title":"Terrible🙄🙁:(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:15:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172591934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"SO many glitches on this Trump app! I wanted some quality, orange 🍊 ,old🐽,crusty🤡,rude🤮, Trump content but the whole app just doesn’t work so unfortunately I wasn’t able to (I couldn’t be more upset)🥱🥱🙃🙄🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️.It was so frustrating to do anything on this app I will never use it again. Definitely should be taken down if it takes more than 5 hours to download (even though I had the best WiFi). I will NEVER use this app again and I hope everyone else does the same🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕🌟❤️","userName":"Olivia Risner","title":"WORST APP I’VE EVER USED👎👎👎👎👎","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:01:45Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172296199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the absolute worst. I was looking forward to using it, and sadly, that did not happen. This app crashed my phone numerous times. I was constantly having to restart my phone, and whenever I would open the app, it would glitch, and then my phone would freeze. I feel as if this app gave my phone numerous bugs. So, thanks a lot. I wish I could give less than one star, but I can’t. The one star is very generous. Don’t get this app, it’s not worth it. \n\n🧚\u200D♀️✨ dump the trump 🧚\u200D♀️✨","userName":"SescaKrueger","title":"Worst App.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:40:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172107175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So i was sitting in the car and i was watching a thing with ur voice in it and my mom grabbed my phone and threw it making me cry saying trumps taking tiktok down then she starts crying cause people make sucessful money and her children with get so bored and bother there parents then next thing ik my car is flipping.

I wish I could give it zero stars that’s how bad it is. Don’t get it! And please help me out by giving it one star. That would help heal the pain and the trauma this app has brought upon me!","userName":"yodelaheehoooo","title":"Bad app","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T03:35:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6133814556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am a hugeeeeee trump supporter 🇬🇧 go America!!! But I would just like to let people know that this app is unsatisfactory. First off, when I show it to my friends and family, they throw up. Like what’s that about?!? It opens to Trumps face, why are they throwing up? Second, the amount of fake news I get, is AsTrOnOmIcAl, it is waaay to many tweets. Mrs. Bennet and I were trying to have a conversation and the tweets kept coming. So as a result of this despicable behavior, fake news will not be permitted, and I will be deleting this app. Thank you.","userName":"abcdefg🧚🏻🧚🏻","title":"DiSgUsTiNg","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T00:21:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6132875487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I think this app is a disgrace the the human rights I also this trump is a disgrace of humans right.  this app is so stupid and retarded I don’t know why it even exists.
