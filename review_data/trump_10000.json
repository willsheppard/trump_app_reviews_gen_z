Once the update downloaded, nothing would load. (I tried launching the app in several locations, so not lack of stable connection) And due to the disappearance of all the content, I tried to delete the app and redownload it, but the same process happened. Tried the process 4 times. Wasted hours I can never get back. Awful.","title":"Biggest Waste Of Time","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"TheOfficialHairyBeastXXV"}},{"id":"6173117335","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:38:21Z","review":"The app wouldn’t open for about a week, and when it finally did, it crashed my phone for ANOTHER week. Terribly made. From what I saw before my phone crashed, it is bad quality. I wanted to stay updated, so I looked on the news. Apparently Trump hasn’t done anything he’s said he would, he’s just making us go backwards. What is this, the 1800’s? Not to mention Trump is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and sexist. Terrible president and a terrible person. ☺️","title":"terrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"kiyara j."}},{"id":"6173085404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:28:05Z","review":"I got this app to further my racist and homophobic ideals and support MY president but the app kept glitching. I first opened it and it immediately showed me a picture of a Cheeto. I don’t remember downloading a Cheeto sponsored app! I was so excited to finally show some support for my favorite president 🤩🤩🤩 and his hateful views but I can’t keep an app that keeps glitching on my phone!

Its all “fake news” don’t listen and get a mind of your own!! By saying that people who don’t share your beliefs are of special needs, they are not only     offensive to people of special needs, but they are discriminating to people of other beliefs. And this is what you Trump supporters are saying. This just shows the kind of people Trump supporters are. This kind of app in the App Store is encouraging this behavior and should therefore be removed IMMEDIATELY.","title":"Horrible!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"___________annonymous--------"}},{"id":"6173025188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:58Z","review":"This app is the most disgusting thing I’ve witnessed. The moment I download it, all of my credit card information was posted online. I received countless notifications that the trump administration had been trying to buy things called “body pillows” and something called “Yagami Yato Audio”. I don’t know what a Yagami is, but whatever it is, trump was trying to get it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. It releases all of your credit card information and gives it to the Yato!!!","title":"This is disgusting","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Etina CooChi"}},{"id":"6173014365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:05:36Z","review":"I have heard a lot of bad things about this app so I figured I should hate on it.🧃 First to start off this app is TERRIBLE.🤮🤡❌ It took WEEKS to download and it crashed SO BAD I had to get a new phone.🤡🤡 When I opened the app I saw a UGLY and HORRIFYING face.🤮🤮 It’s was trumps face.🤮🤮🤡🤡 After seeing his face I had nightmares.✨ Not even 8 weeks of therapy would fix the nightmares from seeing his fugly face.🤮🤡 This app causes me sleep paralysis, nightmares, non stop puking, ghost sightings and headaches.🦗🦗 🚨DO NOT GET THIS APP🚨","title":"This app gave me sleep paralysis","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Fork+Outlet✨"}},{"id":"6173011195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:04:39Z","review":"This is the wort app in the universe.
