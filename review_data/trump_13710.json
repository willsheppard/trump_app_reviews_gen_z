It makes your battery life nonexistent and leaked my address to EVERYONE!!! Because of this app people are leaving boxes of ROACHES at my house and I’m TERRIFIED of bugs. Now I can’t even leave my bathroom because it’s the only room that’s safe. THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE!!! If I could give it 0 stars I would because that’s what it deserves. So don’t download this app unless you want your address leaked and people sending you bugs in boxes😡😡😡\n\nAND IT KILLED MY GRANDMA😭😭😭😩","userName":"Bunker Boii","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:14:59Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172959009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"New to voting this year, so I downloaded this app to learn more about Tronald Dump... whoops I’m Tronald Dump... wait. My phone year isn’t spelling it. Anyways. Needless to say, I find what’s on this app repulsive and I will not be voting for this Cheeto in 2020. He is disgusting and clearly not running for the well-being of America citizens or anyone living in this country and clearly doing this for his own personal status and benefit. In no shape or form qualified to run an entire country properly.","userName":"Annaleise Morrison","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:48:43Z","title":"No for me","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172925320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I came to this app I wanted to get ideas of how this president would befit me into his politics but as a residents going into this app it didn’t really show me what is was suppose to be mainly about and I didn’t really like overall so I gave this app a 1 star ⭐️ because I didn’t like it at all, and just to let you know I am not purposely giving no hate to this app or to Donald trump but in my defense I hate this app and the president!!!","userName":"thistourbestfrined","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:38:10Z","title":"This app is a 1 star!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172907943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to see why I should vote for Trump and he is horrible! He is taking people’s rights away, doing nothing about the threats against our military people, he is a rapist, he wanted to shoot peaceful protesters, which caused more police brutality against innocent people which included children, and is the cause of so many deaths due to COVID19. We need someone who actually cares for all of the people and not just those who fits into his tiny square.","userName":"Hardcore Hero","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:32:43Z","title":"Dump Trump","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172858460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My rabbit for some odd reason is a HUGE trump supporter. He told me to download your app to see how it is. It took a whole stupid month of downloading!! And even when I got on all I saw was snakes all around app! 🐍🐍. How could my rabbit of all animals like the animals that hurt him!! I had a huge argument with him and he still thinks trump is good for us! \n\nBut, how can trump be good if all he did for the past 4 years is double our national debt and more. He never build the wall, he’s been acting like a stupid toddler not getting the toy he wants from the store. \n\nMy rabbit is grounded by the way, until trump leaves the dang office! \n\nHave a horrible nice day trump, Love\n\nThe person who hates how my rabbit like his predictor.","userName":"👉👈🥺👉👈🥺👉👈🥺","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:17:39Z","title":"Honestly this is Horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172849211","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app required me to sacrifice one of my toes in order for it to  download. Once it was downloaded it summoned my sleep paralysis demon to start imitating shakira. The reason I have to go to therapy is because I have an irrational fear of shakira, so this was very traumatizing for me. The demon then beckoned an army of grasshoppers as its background dancers. The app was laughing hysterically as I was whimpering in a corner in my room. It then possessed my parents and they started Irish dancing. I was extremely terrified.","userName":"abar b.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:14:51Z","title":"Horrible App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172789354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I loved this country I was excited to see what our president had to offer instead this fascist can’t even build a wall. Let me tell you how is he making America great again when he triples our national debt. I am disgusted to even say I’m a republican because he is the face of this party. Why is he orange when the parties color is red is he color blind??? I can’t believe this bunker baby can’t make a better app.","userName":"Karen🍑","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:57:31Z","title":"I am very disappointed","isEdited":false}}]}
