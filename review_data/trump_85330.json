When I downloaded the app, I was sent to Mars for three seconds and Jeff Bezos was there, but before I could ask him for the 3 million dollars I’ve been emailing him about for the past two years, I was sent back to Central Jersey🙄 that’s not even remotely close to Mars! I got this app so I could join the Space Force! Legit NEXT DAY, i wake up and open the app, thinking maybe I’ll be sent to a new planet for a mission that won’t glitch. Well, throw me on a set of wet concrete stairs, put me in a dank red-ass suit and call me the Joker bc this was one SAD JOKE. Not only am I NOT sent to Mars, I am asked to donate some of my OWN hard-earned money to support a political candidate. When President Trump asked me to contribute, he clearly was not looking for my money— this nation would benefit far more from my ripped body in the Space Force than from any cash shmoney. Just when I think I’ve sucked all the sweet honeysuckle propaganda and fresh squeezed Kool Aid of this app, I fall into another trap. I try to delete it, and my acid trip completely stops. COMPLETELY. Like, no flying caterpillars, no fiery tire fires, nothing. Everything is suddenly so quiet and bright. Where did the sirens go? Where did the howling toucans fly off to? PuhlEESE do not download this app i swear to Jesus Christ in Heaven (blessed by His name) you will regret it and 🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨you will NOT be able to join the Space Force."}},{"id":"6179173597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:59:20Z","userName":"🧚🏽\u200D♂️iykyk✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨🧚🏾\u200D♂️✨🧚🏿\u200D♂️✨","review":"Some people really be leaving a bad review for this app🤭 AND I’LL DO IT AGAIN POW 💥 POW💥POW💥\nEveryone is loved 💖✨😍except to trump and his supporters🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨🥰"}},{"id":"6179169883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:57:56Z","userName":"jeldnejwhjqq","isEdited":false,"title":"Not worth it","review":"I don’t like the app"}},{"id":"6179158669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:53:40Z","userName":"ffuggyffyuugdr","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download","review":"So laggy please don’t download"}},{"id":"6179154548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:52:08Z","userName":"trash 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"title":"10/10 would not recommend","review":"the quality is trash , trump is trash, he’s trying to ban tiktok which is trash ,"}},{"id":"6179144979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:48:36Z","userName":"Kitty funny","isEdited":false,"title":"Ewwwww","review":"The app doesn’t work just like the president."}},{"id":"6179141251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T02:47:16Z","userName":"i hate it here x72310","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️","review":"trash app if i could rate 0/5 i would because it’s absolute garbage. it’s unhelpful and it just took up valuable space, just like him ❤️"}}]}
