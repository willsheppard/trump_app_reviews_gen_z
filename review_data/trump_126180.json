I wanted to support our lovely ,pedophilia, orange, racist president 🙂. This was the worst app I have ever downloaded. The reason being is because it had asked me my PERSONAL INFORMATION such as my social security, when/where I was born, and most importantly my BANK INFORMATION!! This app is trying to take away my personal information and HACK MY ACCOUNTS!!! This will not go UNNOTICED! If I could I would rate this app ZERO STARS. Don’t download this app I WARN YOU. It is for your own good. Sooner this or later this app will be taken down!!","date":"2020-07-09T23:09:29Z","userName":"Hamilton.4568"}},{"id":"6178562108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","review":"It’s just bad it lags to much it also reports the news very later that I’ve seen them on the news.And also after I downloaded the app my phone started to glitch","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:56Z","userName":"osiduduejdjhhxcucu"}},{"id":"6178562033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:54Z","userName":"frick trump 202"}},{"id":"6178561965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤢🤢","review":"If I could give this app —2938923 stars I would. It’s disgusting to look at and it keeps giving my iPhone viruses. After taking 7 days to finally download, it crashed, crashing my entire phone, leaving it worthless except it kept playing a bunch of hateful words and I couldn’t stop it. Not only is it giving my phone viruses, it made its way to my other devices, my family’s devices, my home appliances, and even my personal health. I wish it would be taken down as I feel it is a danger to society and innocent people’s livelihoods.","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:52Z","userName":"sofiadokeee"}},{"id":"6178561850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"You didn’t download this. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽","review":"BREAKING NEWS!: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS THE AUDACITY TO TRY BANNING TIKTOK OHELLNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also don’t download this. Ya just no. Don’t. I said don’t. Nothing good here. I downloaded this in hopes of making our PRESIDENT less stupid, but this is a virus and a scam it will scar u for life like it did to me pleeeeaaaaaassseeeeeee don’t download it’s horrible! lemme tell u my story: This app ruined my childhood I’m 37 and I coded cupcakes to taste cool but when I got this app it ruined my cake coding software. A big squishy orange 🍊that I recognized to be the presidents face appeared on the screen and ticked for a few seconds and then exploded with the blast of a mini bomb fortunately I chucked my phone across the room but I was deeply wounded physically and mentally and am now typing this from my nonexistent father’s phone in the hospital with my poor mother in our tiny van I’m now homeless and scarred forever thanks to this app and my coding cakes bakery closed bc my software blew up but it reopened because trump realized COVID1 existed and then the trump administration blew my house up again so DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👁👄👁👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽I have a school friend who told me her story with this app. She had to wait for 5 MONTHS to get this app in hopes of, like me, making trump less stupid but when she entered her email and phone number her phone immediately shut off and wouldn’t open again. All her family started getting threats that if she and her family didn’t vote trump in 2020 elections trump would kidnap her kids and take away all their jobs and health care and even lit the shed on fire! Fortunately we got there just in time to put it out  but the damage had been done. TikTok is one of the most important things in she and my lives we watch aspiring artists and support them in chasing their dreams. But soon TikTok was deleted from her entire family’s phones and iPads and computers replaced instead with pictures of squishy oranges 🍊 labeled “Donald Trump, Aka Donald Duck 🦆 “ and quotes of trump himself saying how “ black lives don’t matter as long as I’m safe” and so finally she tried to delete it but instead all her devices blew up in puffs of orange 🍊 smoke 💨. She told me not to download this app but I didn’t listen to her because I thought it was a lie. I read the comments before downloading this but most where as crazy as my friends story so I figured it must be a TikTok trend and downloaded it anyways. Not a lie so much crazy stuff happened I should have listened to the 5000000000 warnings I got. lesson learned: only a true trump supporter will download this  sh•t if u are a person you will not bother wasting your time and risking your life and possessions on this sh•t so screw this f¥cking virus 🦠 ( also screw corona) this thing should be deleted. \n\nSAFETY MESSAGES: \nStay safe from COVID19 wear a mask and stay indoors when possible avoid even Seeing others outside of ur house\nBLACK LIVES MATTER only a bish would say otherwise but remember even in protesting keep your masks on unless you really can’t and stay safe. REMEMBER Don’t use violence because words speak louder than actions.\nTIK TOK WILL STAY NO MATTER WAT!!!!!! Not my prob we all sharing kindness online, trump!\n1 more thing: I decided to be a Democrat in second grade 2016 when I heard that trump was a republican. 2016, when the entire ELEMENTARY SCHOOL was running around shouting SAY “NO TO DONALD TRUMP” during rescess. To be honest, it been a pathetic 4 years anyway I miss Obama.","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:49Z","userName":"dat_boi_who_want_tiktok_u_bish"}},{"id":"6178561261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Watch out","review":"Very very very bad 😭😭😭😔😔😭😭😭😔😭😭😔😭😔😭😭😭😭😔😭😔😭","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:34Z","userName":"coolestcat02"}},{"id":"6178561080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting","review":"my🤚name👄is👀not❌five👏weenies🌭i🔥am😎shoto❄️from😳UA🏫and👈i👁wanna✨be💫a😜hero💂\nmy🤚father👨endeavor🔥is💖✨currently💫the☝️number 💖one🦸\u200D♂️hero 🥴but✨ to be🐝frank👨I’ve 🤚always 😡hated🤚him and I 😌wanna 🌝forge 💖my 👄own path🏞","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:29Z","userName":"anne boleyn 💚😌"}},{"id":"6178560366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"F u d Trump","review":"This is the worst app in this App Store period","date":"2020-07-09T23:08:12Z","userName":"jshsnshsn"}}]}
