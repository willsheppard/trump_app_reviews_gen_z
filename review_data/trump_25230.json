Month by month my hopes were squashed. Wake up America, this man does not have our dreams in mind he has an agenda and not a good one. I was hoping to find something redeeming when using the app and all I was left with was a more sour taste in my mouth.","userName":"Kelkel2000","rating":1,"title":"Ugh...","date":"2020-07-08T14:43:35Z"}},{"id":"6172490874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"The time that it took to download was frustrating and everything was lagging. This is the worst app that I’ve ever downloaded and I will not do it again, 1/10 don’t recommend.

The more I look into Trump, the more I begin to fear for the well being of this country. I wish I could rate this app zero stars.","userName":"quack_quack_","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed but not surprised","date":"2020-07-08T14:26:50Z"}},{"id":"6172429161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app was unbelievably glitchy, old school dial up internet slow, and littered with offensive dialogue. Who approved this to go out to the public? All I want to do is reserve my tickets for the next rally 😏 This should be taken off the App Store, it’s so technology inadequate. Also the slogan is so 2016.","userName":"JasmineAmbry","rating":1,"title":"There’s something terribly wrong with this app","date":"2020-07-08T14:16:52Z"}},{"id":"6172416141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I Downloaded this app because I wanted to know more about our president for my project in school. But when I opened it all a saw was a huge image of Pickle Rick saying vote for trump on a loop. I then put that as my report and I failed my class. I had a nightmare that night of a huge pickle tick crushing me. That will haunt me forever.","userName":"Jimmy DuPree","rating":1,"title":"How dare you Donald","date":"2020-07-08T14:13:19Z"}},{"id":"6172410264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"THIS IS JUST BAD I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN IT THIS APP NEED TO BE GONE LIKE DEADAZZ👎👎👎😒😒😒😒🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 OH NOW I CAN EXPLAIN WHEN I OPENED THE APP MY PHONE WENT ALL BLACK THAN PPL CAME WITH SPRAY TAN AND SAID YOU NEED TO LOOK LIKE TRUMP I SAID THAT ORANGE 🍊 OH NO I DONT WANT TO LOOK LIKE HIM THAN THEY SPRAYED IT ON ME THAN IT GOT IN MY EYE LIKR OMG THAN IT WAS BURNING UGH THIS IS A BAD APP ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS OH WAIT AND THEY TOOK ALL MY ORDERS OUT OF MY HOUSE TO GIVE TO TRUMP THEY SAID IT WILL MAKE HIM MORE ORANGE SO BASICALLY THEY ARE STERLING MY FOOD SO MESSED UP MY PARENTS SPEND MONEY ON THAT ALSO TRUMP NEED TO GIVE ME MONEY FOR WHAT THEY SO I NEED ABOUT 100,000 DOLLARS BC OF THIS OH AND I FORGOT TO SAY THEY BROKE MY ARM AND MY LEFT LEG 😭😭😭😭😭🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😭😭😭😭😭😭 GIVE ME MY MONEY AND LIKE I SAID THIS APP NEED TO BE GONE FROM THE APP STORE","userName":"Old McDonald56","rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP EVER 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮","date":"2020-07-08T14:11:42Z"}},{"id":"6172404891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible horrible app. I actually downloaded it awhile ago and the first thing I saw which was president trump made my vision disappear.

As his voter population is mainly made up of older white male. As grandparents and parents I beg of you to listen to the next generation and support us because we firmly believe that Donald is severly lacking in compassion for many minorites of the US and will bring them harm.","userName":"bobagurl._","rating":1,"title":"Terrible app....","date":"2020-07-08T14:08:16Z"}},{"id":"6172393672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I really don’t know what happens I was just downloading the app and my fingers just slipped and is typing this.
