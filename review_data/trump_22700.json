I had to buy a brand new phone and still there were problems due to this app. I am so TREMENDOUSLY disappointed and hurt by the lack of respect to all supporters who just wanted to stay updated and informed.","isEdited":false,"userName":"postcastlistener","date":"2020-07-09T23:19:08Z"}},{"id":"6178559423","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","rating":1,"review":"This app has the worst service I have ever experienced, it is so complicated and it took 5 hours to download, the sign in is so inefficient and and overall layout is so awful. \nIt takes up so much storage. If I could give it negative ratings, it would be a negative 10 no cap","isEdited":false,"userName":"Narwals Swiming in the ocean","date":"2020-07-09T23:07:48Z"}},{"id":"6178538863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I don‚Äôt have words.","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I pressed the download button this app put me through a traumatic experience. The design and word choice are absolutely revolting, just the name of the app symbolizes themes of racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, the list goes on and on. It is incredibly offensive, and NOT the message that I know Apple is trying to send.","isEdited":false,"userName":"the.c0och","date":"2020-07-09T22:59:37Z"}},{"id":"6178494510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Whats with the wait!?","rating":1,"review":"The time it takes to download this app is insane, not to mention the time it takes to get the app running!

The logo flashes when it loads and caused two of my friends with epilepsy to go into shock. I recommend either closing the app when it starts, or covering the phone with a soft cloth which deters the damaging effects of the flashing lights. Please be safe.","isEdited":false,"userName":"raynalollasmith","date":"2020-07-09T22:15:19Z"}},{"id":"6178365871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don‚Äôt get its has lots of problems","rating":1,"review":"Being a Trump supporter I thought to get this help to help out with election but no it‚Äôs awful it‚Äôs swarmed with tons of bugs it‚Äôs so laggyNot only that it‚Äôs spams you constantly About dumb stuff do not get this that awful instead go support Biden because after this app I sure do you","isEdited":false,"userName":"üñ§Lily‚ù§Ô∏è","date":"2020-07-09T21:51:54Z"}},{"id":"6178348496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I have no food","rating":1,"review":"I was expecting this app to be of our lord and savior Donald Jenius Trump but all I found we‚Äôre some carrots and Cheetos which reminded me that I wanted food so I went to check and hade no food but I went to get food like a month ago so I was sure I hade no food but as this app was installed previous to this I have to blame the app.üòòüòòü•∞","isEdited":false,"userName":"So not wattermelon","date":"2020-07-09T21:45:12Z"}},{"id":"6178297945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"review":"This app is not useful. There are no facts. I was hoping it would be coherent and helpful for the upcoming election but it is anything but helpful. It is time to stand together and let our message be of love. In a place where everyone is truly equal. Anything associated with this person is horrible and will treat you very unfairly.","isEdited":false,"userName":"vgj!","date":"2020-07-09T21:26:18Z"}}]}
