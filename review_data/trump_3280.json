Then I just so happened to come across one specific Cheeto named 🌞DoNaLd JoHn TrUmP🐽While talking to him he gave me plenty of reasons why 🌻I should pick him to be eaten🐵Two of the main reasons was because he was a RaCiSt and a RaPiST🐚I still wasn’t really convinced so he offered to grab me by my pussy🙉I then went on to ask him how does he know about anything like that and he responded that he had done to a lot of girls younger than me🙊I notified him that I wasn’t okay with his actions as an orange 🍊 Cheeto so he would not be the one I would want to eat. Before I left the app he asked me did I have anyone else in mind to eat and I said “yes, BARACK OBAMA” 😍😍😍🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄","date":"2020-07-08T23:13:52Z"}},{"id":"6174039334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Biden for the win","userName":"african village man","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app hoping to learn about politics but this was definitely the wrong app. I opened the app and my air conditioner disappeared my girlfriend changed genders and my dog became a hairless cat. So i clicked the view terms and policies button and boy that was a even worse idea i passed out and woke up in outer space with Neil Armstrong holding me. He said “one more small step and your going back to earth” i passed out after that and woke up and Bill Gates made it rain on me (which was amazing) then teleported to Africa where everything ended. After that I signed up for the app cause i wanted to see what else would happen. But the events that happened after that still give me nightmares \n\nSincerely, toto \n1999","date":"2020-07-08T23:02:59Z"}},{"id":"6173977611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No","userName":"jojo siwas daddy","isEdited":false,"review":"THIS APP SENT ME TO THE HOSPITAL, so I open the app to be greeted with Donald trump acting like he supports BLM which made me SICK so after I get done throwing up due to the horrid picture I saw when I opened the app, I slip and fall on my shower which causes my head to crack open, my mom went up to check on me she was horrified to see me on the floor but what made her even more scared was when she saw my phone still open on the trump app, luckily she has a stomach of steel so she didn’t end up throwing up but she did take me to the hospital, where I get diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, apparently because I looked at the trump app trump gave me Alzheimer’s through the app, he must’ve known I was a liberal or something but I plan on suing him ✨✌🏼🤪😊😳🤡💀😭😂🤩🙌🏽👿🍄🤷🏽\u200D♀️🙃😡😡😠😤😤😤","date":"2020-07-08T22:39:46Z"}},{"id":"6173958190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DELETE THIS APP","userName":"dumbbrunettebitch","isEdited":false,"review":"this app will kidnap your wife, husband, or significant other. my aunt recently got kidnapped by a cheeto that pulled up in a limousine with armed body guards. there was one witness who said that they could smell the stench from 50 yards away 🤮 although the witness only saw the cheeto for a couple seconds, they said they heard him make many racist, sexist, and homophobic remarks. then when i went on the app, i realized that the cheeto was on the very front 🤯 also the app asked for my mobile number.

Next thing I knew they shoved my parents and I in trash bags and proceeded to kick our cats😪. Once we were in the van 😫trump was sitting in the front seat singing the “I’m a little tea pot” song,💩 it was so horrible we all started to bleed from our ears🤢. The guards eventually passed out from trumps stench that my family thankfully couldn’t smell very much, cause we were in trash bags😡, and we were able to roll ourselves out of the back of the van while trump wasn’t looking,😏 like the fish from Nemo🐠. Overall terrible experience and now I’m deaf🥵😧🤔🤯🤬👺💀☠️💩","date":"2020-07-08T22:23:42Z"}},{"id":"6173896429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NASTAY","userName":"The Duckhead","isEdited":false,"review":"I ordered the Ravioli with cheese because I had nothing to eat in my house except my dishwasher, but it still needed to be fully cooked before I consumed it so I ordered the Ravioli. The package came late, and there were only 1 singular Ravioli even though I SPECIFICALLY ordered TWO AND THREE QUARTERS. EXTREMELY AGGRAVATED, OBVIOUSLY. The one ravioli tasted scrumptious, with a hint of dish soap to go along with the melted cheese, adding to my craving for dishwashers. I fed some to my giraffe and I think he really liked it. \n\nUpdate: he did not like it. Currently throwing up the remains of my ravioli. But I don’t want the food to go to waste, I’ll eat it later.\n\nAnyway, for anyone who sees this, DON’T BUY THE RAVIOLI. Instead, go to 5613 Pasta Avenue and bring food (preferably orange peels and golden oreos). I am very hungry.","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:40Z"}},{"id":"6173872255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app made me drop my spaghetti out of my pockets 😭😤","userName":"cereyes503","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened the app and when I saw what was inside I gasped, creating a strong wind that caused a category 5 hurricane that blew through the entire east coast. Now even tho I happen to live on the west coast, the best coast, the wind was so strong that we had 1 mph winds in my lovely city of Watts which then caused my spaghetti to fall out of my pocket. You ask why I had spaghetti in my pocket well I’ll tell you. I was lacking carbs one day you see which made me think I need to start eating more carbohydrates. The genius idea then came to my head that maybe just maybe I could eat a pizza, but alas a pizza can not fit in my pocket😔😢 so I had to settle for the next best thing... spaghetti 🍝 amén 🙏🏽","date":"2020-07-08T22:00:49Z"}},{"id":"6173802197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst App ever","userName":"mAgA20269","isEdited":false,"review":"Absolutely the worst app ever. I blame the minorities for making this app not work. Man I wanted to get some points redeem stuff, find out were this Demi god is holding his rallies. Ugh it won’t tell me nothing. I guess I have to stay at home, pleasure myself to kids in cages and police brutality while wearing JUST my maga hat and using my tears as lubrication. Oh well, at least I can still pleasure my cousin wife, we get off on watching cops beat the crap out of minorities while doing the nasty, she has her limits though. I guess the kids in cages on tv gives her a weird vibe while doing the nasty, I slapped her and called her a snow flake while my cross eyed inbred son was watching, idk if he was, those eyes are all over the place. tRuMp 2020","date":"2020-07-08T21:33:55Z"}}]}
