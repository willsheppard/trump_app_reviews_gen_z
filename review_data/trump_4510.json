I tried restarting my phone multiple times and troubleshooting with no success. I eventually was forced to contact my phone service provider who then informed me that my phone received a virus. After further analysis they informed me that THIS APP gave me a virus. Subsequently all my personal information was stolen including my phone number and bank information. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. They will sell your information to the Chinese!!!! 0/10 Would NEVER recommend. Thanks a lot Trump"}},{"id":"6175988165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:58:32Z","title":"MALWARE!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"EmileeYO","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app to stay updated on presidential news and whatnot but within a couple days i started noticing that my phone was SLOW!! i restarted my phone to see if that would fix it but when it turned back on all my photos and contacts were WIPED!! this stupid app deleted everything! i had to get all my files back from the cloud and it was fine. but over the next 24 hours or so my screen was glitching and none of my apps would stay open for more than a minute! after that i deleted the app!! no problems since. don’t download this crap or you’ll regret it!"}},{"id":"6175948976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:45:38Z","title":"Gave my phone VIRUS🦠🦠🦠","isEdited":false,"userName":"deadphone🦠","rating":1,"review":"I’m so fed up! The second I downloaded this app it gave my phone a virus. When I went in to Apple to get it fixed they diagnosed my phone with Coronavirus. My phone was at 1% battery which put it in the most susceptible category. I couldn’t afford the bills because of a lack of a universal care plan. Also, it had a black case and I noticed all the white-case phones being treated more frequently and receiving better care. In the end, my phone died from the consequences and lack of initiative of Trump. All around disgusted, appalled and will make sure everyone votes this app off of the App Store for good."}},{"id":"6175828137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:05:30Z","title":"ATROCIOUS😤","isEdited":false,"userName":"MouJayX","rating":1,"review":"If I could give this app ZERO stars I would. Just to download this app it took 86 weeks just for it to finish. It all went downhill from there, it caused a sharp pain to shoot up my arm... I thought I was having a heart attack, when I opened the app my mother called me and told me my grandmother rose from the dead and came to to tell my mom she never loved her just to die in front of her. After that I took my pet fish on a walk and not only did he bite me he died right after it, and now my life long fish friend is now dead because of this app. This app has caused nothing but disasters for me I wish I had never come in contact with it."}},{"id":"6175753578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:39:59Z","title":"MY LOVELY PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO RUIN MY LIFE 😱","isEdited":false,"userName":"daddy 😡","rating":1,"review":"i wanted to see what my non rapist, homophobic, racist lovely president had to offer on this app. i wish i could give it a 5 stars but it took tooooo long to download 89 weeks to be exact. finally after 89 weeks of downloading i opened the app like normal, it wasn’t until i closed the app things started to get weird. i got hacked and made my phone acted up and to this day i have been getting death threats. i got a new phone and i don’t know why or how they got my new phone number and everything but i am still getting death threats. i am very much disappointed in my non rapist, homophobic, racist lovely president."}},{"id":"6175683669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:16:16Z","title":"Made me want to commit the not alive","isEdited":false,"userName":"hawyeeteeheehee","rating":1,"review":"I just want to warn everyone about this horrible app that triggered my depression and made me spiral into a panic attack that lasted several days. It took so long to download and when it did, I think it gave my phone a virus which I didn’t think was possible because I trust the Apple store and wouldn’t assume they would let anything like this on the App Store. This virus caused all my photos to delete that had pictures of my friends and family and my pet hamster that got chlamydia and died. Now the melody of Stuart little is gone and I don’t know what I will do with myself. Please don’t download this app"}},{"id":"6175680715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:15:18Z","title":"NOT WORTH THE KIDNEYS!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"iwouldrate0/10","rating":1,"review":"where do i start. While downloading this app i kept getting notifications from my fbi agent telling me that I ate some bad spaghetti, the thing is I didn’t have spaghetti. Anyways, everything went on normal until it finishes downloading where i get texts saying my grandma is in the hospital and needs my kidney to save her, she should’ve baked me more cookies if she wanted it 😌. Then the app started saying that i must vote and shall vote for trump or they take all my families kidneys!!!!!! Turns out my grandma downloaded the app and didn’t vote for him that’s why she needed my kidney. Please don’t download though it’s a disgusting waste of time and kidneys!!!!"}},{"id":"6175605856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:48:35Z","title":"Disappointing","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤮🤢🤮🥴🤮🥴🤮🥴","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with our lord and savior Donald Trump. But the app to sooooo long to download. And when It finally was done, I opened and it worked just fine for about 5 minutes. Then it started to glitch, and would close on its own. After about 3 hours after I downloaded it, the app completely broke and started trying to update, but it wouldn’t work. When I tried to use other apps they would also crash. When I deleted it, my phone worked just fine. Do not download this, they are trying to mess with your phone and all your personal data."}},{"id":"6175267662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:38:25Z","title":"yeah❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"b€uyess","rating":1,"review":"so i downloaded the app to see papa trumpling😻🙈 but when i opened it i got a notification saying i was an ugly bi beotch who deserved to die😓 HOW DID THEY KNOW😫 i just wanted to see my favorite daddy orange 🍊 but the biphobia really jumped out🌝 anyways then all of the sudden i got a knock on my door and i opened it and saw BARRON😻 he grabbed me by my hair and threw me into his limo. i thought we were getting married but we pulled up to daddy trumps house and then they murdered my pet grass😔🔪 idk what to think anymore. i’m currently writing this from daddy trumps secret spray tanning booth that they locked me in because they don’t like me. it’s very orange in here. help ❤️ ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡᶦᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸᶦⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃᵗᶦᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉˡᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢᶦⁿᵍᶦⁿᵍⁿˡᶦᵏᵉ"}},{"id":"6175240018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:27:45Z","title":"COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!! 😡🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"dldkicrvh","rating":1,"review":"I’m a proud Trump supporter, and wanted to show my undying support to daddy Donny by downloading his app. As soon as I verified my number I was bombarded by several notifications, causing my phone to glitch. I was frustrated and confused so I just decided to turn my phone off since it was unusable. While I was making dinner for my handicapped grandmother i hear a knock on the front door, i stopped everything i was  doing and answered. IT WAS DADDY DONNY. Excited and baffled I try and welcome him. He pushes me out of his way and heads straight to the living room where my grandmother was resting. He punched her repeatedly before disappearing. Anyways RIP grandma😔😐. 🇺🇸settle for Biden 2020🇺🇸"}}]}
