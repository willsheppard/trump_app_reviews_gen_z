Not only am I greeted by the face of an orange Cheeto as soon as I downloaded the app, all the sudden flying toupees flew into my house and tried to suffocate me! Thankfully I was able to escape into the bathroom. But then an awful theme song came from my phone. It sounded like middle age white women screeching the lyrics “real women vote for trump we don’t need no liberal chump” beware of the hags because if I listened to it any long I’m sure I would have gone deff. The app wouldn’t stop and wouldn’t let me delete it so I flushed my phone down the toilet.","userName":"em12034593939,&('","date":"2020-07-08T14:56:39Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!"}},{"id":"6172459462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app completely slowed down my phone. I was trying to find reasons to vote for him, but during the downloading process, for some reason my phone kept turning orange! Also, I was see the yellowish hair like mass fly across my phone screen. Don’t know what that is about. Whatever. I looked past that and realized I had to put my personal information in. I was not happy about that 😡 But, I was determined to find reasons  to vote for this man who seemingly is incapable of running a country. AND GUESS WHAT. I found none! Hm.

It was full of this racist, pedophilic giant chips, but not the good chips like those nasty flavors, FRITOS, Ik scary. They were saying that if i didn’t give this 5 stars and write an amazing review they were going to cook me and feed me to their chip babies, I refused to write a review and 5 star it so they all started to come at me.

It seems like more attention goes towards creating an image for Trump than actually explaining what he’s done and will do in his political career, which is close to nothing. Trump does not have my vote. He cannot be forgiven for his previous actions with the help of some flashy app. Half of the “news articles” on this app discuss how Joe Biden is not the right candidate, but never discuss how Trump is. The only way this app is convincing people to support him is by giving supporters reward points in exchange for support. I am disgusted.","userName":"thisisalli","date":"2020-07-08T12:52:44Z","title":"Horrific"}},{"id":"6165256885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was really excited to support my very beautiful thick scrumptious booty president 😫 but then when I downloaded the app he came to my house and he was like u wanna have segs and I was like 😼 yeah❤️ but then I remembered that im a minor and that he was married and had 2 daughters that he has segs with and I was like no way Jose so then I kicked him out of my house then he said he was gonna deport me and then he bit me and I was like 😼 and I invited him back in but he has a shrimp so I was like no❤️ how’d u even make ur beautiful son barron with that and then he kicked my boobs and left in his Honda 😔","userName":"im on the elite side of tiktok","date":"2020-07-06T19:19:14Z","title":"Barron 😼❤️😻"}},{"id":"6165146784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i got this app to support bunker boy🥵✨😍 but it was the most terrible app ever😭💀😞 right after i got it my phone exploded🧨🤯💣 i have now gotten a new phone and have tried to download it again because i am in love with trump😏but when I downloaded it i got HACKED😤🛸💻the hacker then flooded my phone with notifications about how I was a snowflake ❄️ 😭 then i started getting random notifications saying the mothership was here😳🛸🚀 i went outside to see a flying saucer over my house and aliens in my yard taking down my trump 2020 flags😞😣😫 i was heartbroken😰😭😢","userName":"zoeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy","date":"2020-07-06T18:38:00Z","title":"the orange is mad 🍊🟠🟠"}},{"id":"6164847926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I am passionately in love with Donald Trump and just wanted this app so I could be closer to him. I figured since I’m still underage I could get a chance 🥰. Anyway upon opening the app it started crashing and glitching like them crackhead h0es on ma streets. Then it asked for my phone number out of nowhere which triggered my flight-or-flight. I was extremely offended and assumed the app had been hacked by the fake media in an attempt to get my info. Since this app was a failure, all I can do is inject disinfectant into myself to make me feel better 😔.","userName":"BOBOBO273718292","date":"2020-07-06T16:52:09Z","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED 🤦🏻\u200D♀️🔫🔫🧚🏼🧚🏼😭"}},{"id":"6161760640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Oo yuh my baby daddy has an app love that 😍😍😍 o wait he can meet other GORLS on here!

I was looking forward to bonding with people over orange things but unfortunately all I got was this sad excuse for a president. And his followers? I swear Trump  2020 is just like a cult. I felt pressured to join in the cult like practices and gather and do cult like things. Other followers wanted to buy merch and ... retweet his tweets. I just can’t stand for this type of discrimination. All campaigns matter. All presidents matter. All twitter accounts matter. It’s not that hard.","userName":"sbbxusiaksmsnbsbzbnz","date":"2020-07-02T04:39:43Z","title":"I wouldn’t get this app"}}]}
