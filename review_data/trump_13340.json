I was rushed to the hospital and was confirmed that I have stage 4 heart cancer. DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you want to end up like me with little time to live. This app is truly a curse in itself, it even started to brainwash me into thinking the homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, toxic masculinity\nway was the right way. Please save yourself the agony and listen to my warning!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:08:17Z","title":"GAVE ME CANCER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177070776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rich mans fall","review":"I tried to be the wonderful ✨Conservative Republican✨child my parents always wanted and downloaded this app. However, the app kept crashing! How ever could I be the good child😢?? Each time I opened the app it was a 😫struggle🤧 it kept 🔥crashing🔥, 💀resetting💀and disappointing me😫. Worst of all, I was kept from seeing an 🍊orange🍊on every page.

And then when I could finally open it my phone started crashing. It was horrible!! When I tried to contact the designer he called me a “fat, ugly pig” and told me he wouldn’t change the app. Now I may be a fat, ugly pig but at least I’m not a sexist, racist, homophobic Cheeto with a bad haircut. Would not recommend this app to anyone. Would not recommend trump2020 to anyone.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:33:12Z","title":"Horrible app!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176939502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ray ray alex","review":"I downloaded this app to follow our great and powerful overloard. However, moments after opening this app, locusts began to swarm. Animals began to jump out of the bushes, while birds dropped from the skies. I have reason to believe this app had somehow triggered the biblical plagues of extreme proportion. In the distance, there were sirens.\n\nPlease be careful while handling this app, I want to make sure this does not happen to anyone else.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:26Z","title":"I think this opened Pandora’s box","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176866619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"harryphost","review":"I purchased this app because it was trending as #1 in news and I said “hey, maybe we don’t love the guy but I can give it a chance!” BOY SHOULD I HAVE LISTENED TO MY FIRST INSTINCTS. \nThis is singlehandedly the WORST form of technology I have ever experienced, and it is an absolute disgrace that Apple is associating with the Trump Admin. I wouldn’t wish this experience on my worst enemy. TALK ABOUT FAKE NEWS!!!!!!! \n\nI wish there was a way to leave a 0/5 because truly, that is all it deserves.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:09:22Z","title":"this is absolutely unacceptable","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176738021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ld032405","review":"The app took like 5 days to finally download and then when I opened the app all my photos deleted and then it gave me a whole list of things that I needed to do like surrender my family to the presidency and I was told to either vote for Donald trump or I was a complete and utter waste of space. It then told me that all of my favorite childhood show characters were voting for Donald trump and would crawl out of the tv if I didn’t vote for Donald trump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:30Z","title":"The app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176718822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"elizcoulter","review":"this app is the most poorly designed app i have ever seen in my life! it is extremely slow and then makes my phone glitch out for thirty minutes for restarting altogether. how is America supposed to be great again if i can’t even use the Donald J Trump app to its fullest potential? i guess the only option is to delete it and act like it never existed and i would recommend that you do the same thing","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:30:26Z","title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176707190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Peanut butter egg","review":"Absolutely horrible \nThis app takes forever to load, not to mention it has all this political stuff on it, I thought it was a funny turnip app but I was wrong, very disappointed I can only give it one star for the fact it’s very misleading and all I wanted was turnip memes, my youngest daughter was so excited but I waited over 12 hours for it to download and once it did it was disappointing, asked me for my credit card info and everything, I was just looking for memes about a vegetable, I’m now heartbroken and upset about this \n\nIf you read this far\nArrest the police that killed Breonna Taylor and the countless others, and abolish I.C.E because right now it’s our time to fight \nBlack lives matter","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:22Z","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176541590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"President Autism","review":"I downloaded this app and now all of a sudden I’m getting spam texts from random phone numbers telling me to vote for trump or asking if I want to take a survey for trump. I deleted the app and it kept happening but before there was no problem. Somehow the app gets your personnel phone number when you download and sends it to a bunch of bots to then spam text you whenever they feel. 0/10 imo","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:42:59Z","title":"Absolutely Garbage","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176469151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"11346hgjfkdls","review":"I had the worst ever experience with this app, I actually think it might be one of the worst apps I’ve ever used. I can’t even comprehend the amount of times this app crashed and the amount of stupid ads there where. This app deserves to be removed from the App Store, it’s possibly one of the worst apps on here. It would be better off in the void. I’m so happy I’m able uninstall this app, and I regret ever installing it.  😤","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:23:10Z","title":"Terrible app.","isEdited":false}}]}
