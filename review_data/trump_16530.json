The first thing I saw was such a horrific monster I had nightmares for months. My phone starting getting too hot to function because of all the bugs i got from just downloading it. I think we all agree that this cheeto should be taken away the right from giving anyone else the trauma of just seeing its existence.","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:43Z"}},{"id":"6174466465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gen.zer","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s a no from me ✨💅☺️","rating":1,"review":"I’m not sure what I expected to see, but I was met with the fever dream of a reality that 🍊 exists? Easily the worst app I’ve ever downloaded, low quality, the photos make me wanna barf, rip my skin off, and leave the country. If I could give this 0 stars I WOULD, don’t try me.

I never want to open or download this app again and I absolutely recommend never to use it again. I don’t want anyone else to think this is a good way to get your news or updates. Stick with how you’ve been doing your news searching online or through news channels. This app is not it.","date":"2020-07-09T01:24:41Z"}},{"id":"6174442186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dazjons#1fan","isEdited":false,"title":"No sir 🤢🤮","rating":1,"review":"i’m sorry but opening this app😳 gave me a litera aneurism. i can’t believe that something this repulsive could even be released to the public 😱! it is so disrespectful to put this type of inappropriate content out the those who could potentially be 17😖it is disgusting and i can’t am appalled by the orange hippopotamus within this app can’t believe u thought that it was a good idea to give it a platform🙊🙊shameeeeeee !!!","date":"2020-07-09T01:22:52Z"}},{"id":"6174438889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"QwertyQuoties","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded","rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded because it spreads false news and as the number one app for the news category it shouldn’t be spreading false news and corrupt ideology this app should be removed because a news app run by our president is going to be a biased news source and people getting news here will be believing and spreading false news.","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:51Z"}},{"id":"6174421867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kurtis Buscemi","isEdited":false,"title":"THE worst app","rating":1,"review":"So I was reading these reviews and thought to myself...this can’t all be possibly true but oh boy was I wrong. As soon as I opened the app my phone grew arms and legs, slapped me in the face and pulled out my eyeball. Then it ate all of my uncrustables in the fridge. THEN it ran outside and shaved my dog til she was bald and screamed “I hate women!!” And proceeded to pimp out my dog at my local Walmart. It was very hard to see her standing on the sidewalk so 0/10 DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","date":"2020-07-09T01:16:44Z"}},{"id":"6174406511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"my reveiw over tik tok","isEdited":false,"title":"switching lanes!","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app as a republican. and I am leaving this app as a democrat. this man is ridiculous! a ridiculous excuse for a president. I open the app to a horrifying picture of donald j trumps teenie weenie peenie. horrifying I tell you.
