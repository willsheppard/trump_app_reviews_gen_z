DO NOT GET THIS APP or get it and leave ur honest review here. all i can say is ... no❤️","userName":"AbcdefgHIJklmnopQrsTUVWxyZyyy","title":"ruh roh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:55:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176991163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to support our darling oompa loompa🐒🍊 for his campaign! But I was sadly disappointed 😭 This app was so poorly formatted. It was extremely cluttered and glitchy when using it. The text was too big or too small. And after a while i couldn’t even open it, because it started crashing. It also sent me wayyyyyyy too many notifications! This app should be taken down immediately! \n- a dissatisfied customer 😔","userName":"DubbyBoy21","title":"so disappointed","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:42:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176904128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Worst app ever! I was so excited to see more on our Trumpie poo 🍊💩but when I opened the app a bunch of orange THINGS jumped out at me, I dropped my bagel out the window on my neighbors head! Then I went to apologize but the window broke and I fell out, landed on a compost bin (save the earth 🌍) and realized that unicorns exist and I’d love to ride one someday. But I’d also like to swim with dolphins one day as well so long story short save the earth. But I still can’t get those orange things out of my house and that was the last bagel. VERY MAD!","userName":"skfndnskaa","title":"👎🏽👎🏽","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:19:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176893052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"‼️‼️‼️I was very disappointed in this app. For starters the reason I wanted to download it in the first place is to support this ✨oompah loompah Cheeto ✨that’s in office right now. Since he thinks he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to this country, we should just blindly support him and his ideas without actually educating ourselves and understanding what he wants to do to this country, right? 😊 yeah makes sense! AND, also there’s one more thing that I’m forgetting about...what is it... ummm I can’t seem to remember... oh yeah........VOTE BLUE IN NOVEMBER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"Lucy_harper","title":"✨🧚","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176780155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Downloaded the app out of curiosity but it takes up so much space on my 128gb phone that I had to delete a bunch of other apps just to get it to install. How can a campaign app take up so much space on an iPhone? Not to mention it would crash every time I tried to open it. I can feel my phone running slower than ever because of the app hogging all of my phones CPU or whatever it is. Don’t download, it’s not worth it the space!!","userName":"bernie bros 1234","title":"Terribly designed","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:46:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176701852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the app downloaded after a day of finally waiting and then it asked me if i was a democrat or a republican and i clicked democrat and it hacked all of my accounts on my phone. it even took money off of my pay pal. i also got a text from donald trump HIMSELF and it said: “i will keep taking away money from ur paypal account and i will continue to hack ur account if u don’t vote trump 2020” i blocked the number and deleted the app. all of this stuff continues to happen to this day. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP IT IS HORRIBLE AND GROSS. thanks :)","userName":"🥍🥍🥍🥍🥍","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:25:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176591561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was just laying in bed minding my black business and I thought, “Hey I wanna see how Trump is doing”. So I looked for the app and found it pretty easy, until I was BOMBARDED with Trump supporters telling me to go back to Africa😰 Theh managed to get my instagram and even my Mom’s number!😓 I just wanted to see how Trump was doing, I thought this app was one of those apps you can watch someone through, like watching you’re dog at home to see if he’s misbehaving, and you Trump is a naughty boy. Anyway, DON’T GET THE APP!","userName":"fatousdrug","title":"This app hacked my phone 😵😵😵😵","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:56:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176561566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to see if my homophobic, racist, snowflake of a president had used his platform to stand up for anything right in the world and just as i had thought, he hasn’t. not surprised whatsoever. whatever you do, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS MAN if you care about children not being molested, women not being raped, children dying because of his policies, and every single minority in this country OPRESSed beyond belief because he claims to be a “christian” but doesn’t care about anyone but himself","userName":"bickleymb","title":"worst app i’ve ever used 🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:48:30Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176477897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took almost an HOUR! (Yes and hour to download) and once it did it was super laggy! I got lost and I couldn’t find my way through the files and things. Later that day I came back onto my device and I saw that a few of my apps were deleted and hacked! I do not recommend using this app. Also! Do not ban tik tok. If you do many people will get very mad and upset, and it will most likely start and outrage on the internet or maybe even in real life. Thank you.","userName":"i am kkkkkkkkk","title":"Not good.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:25:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176475215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took all day to download. After it did I opened it to be instantly hacked. My phone number was sent to some who I could only assume was Trump. He messaged me telling me discriminating names due to my gender identity and sexuality. Then he proceeded to send trump supporters to my town to hunt me down. They captured me. I’m currently reviewing this app from a dumpster that I’m definitely not hiding in. 0/10 would not recommend. The food that the trump supporters fed my was yuk, and the car ride to the facility was dirty. The dumpster smells as well...","userName":"GoldenGrouch","title":"Horrid!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:24:49Z","isEdited":false}}]}
