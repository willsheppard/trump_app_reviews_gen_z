That was when the wind picked it up and sent it huddling down the beach. It destroyed everything in its path. Including lil hoodie’s and Charli’s relationship. Children screamed in terror at the giant inflatable monster that crushed their sand castles. The faster we chased it, the faster it rolled. Eventually, we had to stop running after it because it’s path of injury was going to cost us a fortune in legal fees. \nSo, don’t get the app."}},{"id":"6174909922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL APP!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:39:34Z","userName":"Jacknzack","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app can and will set your eyeballs on fire. I was simply taking a nap in my freezer when I decided to download this application. Filled with glee I pressed the button to download the app then out of the blue my retina spontaneously combusted, AND I WAS IN THE FREEZER!!! What kind of app forces a semi-sentient, multi-dimensional, intergalactic beings eyes to catch fire in an instant. I mean come on man I just want to be able to see my inhuman, indefatigable, man-beast thrive and make it in the world, but I can’t because now all I can see is fire. In conclusion do not download this app."}},{"id":"6174786941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:23Z","userName":"melaniatrup","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is truly terrible before I downloaded this everything was fine but soon after my phone disappeared. So I get up n turn the light on only to c that my bed had gone missing. So I called the odd squad to come help me figure out what it was. They were very helpful but sill didn’t help me get my Bed back. They said it was the terrible app I had downloaded. It wasn’t the app so much as the the person that owns it the The orange man so long story short this app is the worst app ever. Pjmaz and odd squad agrees jus sayin 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6174774547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dino","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:35Z","userName":"dinorah the dino","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is so bad so l downloaded it to see more of daddy’s trump 🤩nudes✨😝 but then it just kept showing en orange idk why 💜 then asked me for my number and I’m like nooo im going to become another of his vitcm 😭 and then my pet dinosaur 🦕 got my phone and went to the app and diedddd 😭😭😭 he KILLED MY PET DINOSAUR and then l kept getting texts would you allow this app to use your location and then l said yes and then DADDY TRUMP came to my house forcing me to kill my sister sophia the first but the the princess and he was forcing and so I killed sophia the first I’m so sorry guys I GATE THIS app"}},{"id":"6174733610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRUMP SUPPORTS BEWARE:","date":"2020-07-09T02:47:07Z","userName":"I mean, I guess","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app will make your phone so unbearably slow. I would rate 0 stars if I could. It sends you constant notifications, regardless if you turn them off or not. Ever since I downloaded it all of my apps crash whenever I open them, the only way I got it to slow down was by deleting this app. If you do have it downloaded it’s only a matter of time before this happens to you to, the safest bet would be to just delete this app before you have an unusable phone.."}},{"id":"6174638058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just ew","date":"2020-07-09T02:18:55Z","userName":"chadistyping🇺🇸🎣⚾️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was interested in this app cus I heard a lot about it so I decided to waste my time and download it. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. I open the app and see a picture of this really ugly man like HIDEOUS man and I just go blind. I touch my screen and then my hand becomes paralyzed. This app is cursed I asked my sister to delete it for me and now she’s in the hospital. I decided to burn my phone and now my house is on fire too. UNBELIEVABLE.

Now you all know how I l0vE our gre🅰️t leader the Trumpkin however this app told me that I had to pay it $1000 dollars so that trump could go golfing tomorrow!  I obviously said that that was okay because why shouldn’t he go. But the thing that really took me by surprise was when I saw a LIVE FEED of my HOUSE on the app. I saw trump HIMSELF walk in AND TAKE MY FRIDGE and it had my chicken nuggies in it.
