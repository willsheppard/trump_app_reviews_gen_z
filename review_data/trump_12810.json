It has so many bugs and it keeps reloading. Since I have this app my wi-fi is so slow. My phone heats up what destroyed battery capacity, I bought a new phone last week and my battery health is now at 75%. How can this app still be available at the App Store. And it looks like I’m not the only one with this problems, please fix that!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Kvgunzydzk","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-08T19:09:34Z"}},{"id":"6173387699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and it never opens, it’s just a picture of Trump showing a white power fist. It doesn’t let me log in, doesn’t let me add the 1000 t-shirt I want to buy for my family and all my cousins. How can you cap hats at 3?? You think my parents stopped at one kid?? No! I wanted to spend my entire stimulus check on this merch and it rejected me because I’m WHITE and that sir is reverse racism. I’m deeply attacked by this app. This is not how we keep America great.","rating":1,"userName":"spiketacular1234","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s so glitchy!","date":"2020-07-08T19:07:25Z"}},{"id":"6173356525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Over the weekend I downloaded this app to see if I could learn about the president of the hnited states. Whilst on said app, my grandma was right next to me, minding her own business. She happened to glance over at my screen, and when she did a bright light came from the screen and blinded her. She rose off of the couch and fell down and hit her head on the table killing her instantly. I will never forgive the president for what he's done to my family.","rating":1,"userName":"r.c.haha","isEdited":false,"title":"This app caused death","date":"2020-07-08T18:56:31Z"}},{"id":"6173330287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It sucked. I had to wait forever for it to download and when it did it started to play some weird music that sounded like a bunch of cats screaming. I hate this app. It also never actually worked correctly. I could never leave the beginning screen. It also ruined my phone, because now I can’t download other apps. Such a bad app. Should be removed from the App Store.","rating":1,"userName":"beepbeepjd","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible 10/10 would not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T18:47:18Z"}},{"id":"6173316051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i was downloading this app it’s took for ever for the download to complete i set a timer and it took 3 hours and 47 minutes to complete the download and afterwards when the download was completed my phone started to glitch horribly i have talked to consultants about my phone and they said i will need a new phone as i am writing this on my ipad for your sake and everyone reading this don’t not download this app","rating":1,"userName":"bsidysnlshsbaoshns","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download this app","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:33Z"}},{"id":"6173297638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is very glitchy and took forever to download I was trying to download this fou a week and when I finally got it this app deleted itself and I tried to get it again and I did but for sum reason this stupid app freezes and when it glitches it shows this orange face and it cause my phone to shut off and when it comes back on it goes straight back to the app and I have to hurry and get off this app I am DONEEEEE!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"nyqueraAbcd","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app EVERRR!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:36:41Z"}},{"id":"6173247862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I recently acquired this app in support for my president Donald J Trump, but this app has done nothing but wreak havoc on my life, the download time was three weeks two days and thirteen hours, after the thirteen weeeks i thought this app would help me support our beloved leader, bUT to my surprise it did nothing of the sort, this app is used to spread hate.

It has slowed down my phone entirely. I am so disappointed as i try to stay informed on whatever this malicious president is doing. Unfortunately due to this app constantly disappointing me, i cannot. I wholeheartedly think we should just take this app down because of the damages the app in itself has but also because of what this app does to the device it is downloaded on. :)","rating":1,"userName":"kiarar111556","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-08T17:55:07Z"}},{"id":"6173135059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried to download the app but it took hours😿and when i finally opend the app it gave me anxiety seeing a 🍊😔‼️And we want a good president not a orange Pelo de elote😺Idk if hes trying to take down tik tok what u want us to do “go outside”?🥶 No sir❤️we not in 2017 anymore‼️🌚kinda wish we went back to 2017 tho we want Barack Obama BACK NOW‼️😭and i hope donald trump gets ran over by a car with a pig in it✨💅🏾😽🥺💜 Sir trump u belong in the 🗑❤️‼️ add my snapchat u guys heyitzmebackup1 and my ig is leslie_is_stupid   \nXoxo❤️‼️","rating":1,"userName":"a no~one","isEdited":false,"title":"Mexican lifes matter😌‼️","date":"2020-07-08T17:43:55Z"}}]}
