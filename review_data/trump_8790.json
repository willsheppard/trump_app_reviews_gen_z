However, this was the worst decision because this app made both of my girls cry and hide under their bed’s!!!! They were afraid of this strange man and how he was so mean to others. My youngest daughter who just turned 6 was afraid that this “meanie” would take her stuffed elephant in the middle of the night because wanted everything for himself!!

This about their future!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174749070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App","rating":1,"userName":"aVERYHONESTPERSON101","date":"2020-07-09T02:51:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded the app and my screen cracked!! The glass fell onto my dogs 🐕 food and now he has severe depression🤧🤧 and anxiety🥴🥴. I often find him panicking at the sight of an orange Cheeto.😱😱 This app not only led to the horrible demise of my dog of 30 years but it also spammed my entire phone. With all the notifications I couldn’t see the text from my grandmother👵🏼👵🏼 that she had fallen.👩🏻\u200D🦽👩🏻\u200D🦽This app is against dogs and elders and anything good and loving in life.

As soon as it downloaded I got a virus on my phone, didn’t think that was even possible. It then sent out racist emails to all of my contacts in my phone, sending it to my boss and my grandparents. So now I have been fired and disowned because of this ridiculous app. My phone got really hot as soon as I tried to delete the app and my phone exploded and burned my house down. If I could leave zero stars I would."}},{"id":"6174720586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely awful app","rating":1,"userName":"sady43226789054","date":"2020-07-09T02:43:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Worst experience with an app I’ve ever had! It wouldn’t load so I had to re-download it about 17 times. I ended up calling the “help services center” and they told me to “shut up” before using much profanity. Once I did finally get into the app, after hours of trying, it scammed me and took $300 from my personal account that I am now in the process of trying to get back. DO NOT download this app; it will ruin your week and take your savings!"}},{"id":"6174713549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"userName":"Kuldeep R","date":"2020-07-09T02:41:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i am a fellow supporter of the orange and i was so thrilled to support my mans but as soon as i downloaded it it started asking it started asking for my personal info and if you don’t put it they will deport you, LIKE chile i wasn’t tryn get deported so obviously i put all my social security info in and right after the app disappeared and started hacking all my my apps, drained my bank account, and changed my background to a picture of trump AND i can’t change it back.

I am currently typing off of my new iPhone X pro max. This unbelievable. I am gonna vote for Biden now because if this app. I now believe that the lgbtq+ community should be able to adopt kids, have healthcare benefits and have the other privileges white straight men have. Trump is gross now and I am disgusted that I ever voted for him.🧚✨🥰💓"}},{"id":"6174680585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"VERY disappointed w/ this app","rating":1,"userName":"10294737bb","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this thinking it would be a good app to follow the president and keep myself updated. but right after i downloaded the app and opened it, it shut down. i’m pretty sure it used my database and figured out that i’m filipino because now it just won’t open at all. yet it works for my friend. soo it’s super upsetting that it won’t even open. it is TERRIBLE and i can’t even use the app. it’s upsetting so please don’t download. not worth the space."}},{"id":"6174680031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is TOQUIXXCC","rating":1,"userName":"CHRISTAN DIORRR DIORR","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was casually flying in the sky wit my pet turtle then outta no where Patrick from spongebob squarepants pulled up n told me to download this app n I should have known better because Patrick stupid🤦🏾\u200D♀️.
