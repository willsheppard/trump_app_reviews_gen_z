I do not recommend that anyone gets this app bc they will feel disgusted. this app reminded me that the orange fool is office is the worst president ever and that’s truly hard to beat considering many previous presidents were none other than slave owners.

After setting aside my distaste for the concept and simply downloading the app, I was displeased to see that there was a bright orange Cheeto man on the screen, I won’t explain any further details otherwise it’ll trigger my ptsd, but I deleted the app immediately.","rating":1,"title":"Horrible quality and content","date":"2020-07-08T22:38:55Z","userName":"youhad1jobb"}},{"id":"6173963576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"honestly just shocked at this and i’m not sure how to put my anger into words. the color scheme? horrific. the flags backgrounds? not correct. last i checked the flag was black and yellow not this disgusting arrangement of red and blue with white. not only is it visually unpleasing the person running it is worse. I didn’t know oompa loompas where a real thing? would not reccomend to anyone with a brain or without for that matter.","rating":1,"title":"disgrace","date":"2020-07-08T22:34:27Z","userName":"Rate Mick Take"}},{"id":"6173952560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is full of glitches, Obamacare website has nothing on this horrible excuse for an app. Barely stayed open long enough for me to sign up, max 90 seconds before it freezes and quits. It freezes up other apps on my phone too probably cuz the phone is working so hard to figure out what the coders who wrote this were on.","rating":1,"title":"Hire a computer scientist maybe?","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:16Z","userName":"Joseph Boctor"}},{"id":"6173948756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"First off, everything is so hard to read, and the app is just so unorganized- a whole mess. Second, it takes so unbelievably long to load. I simply tried to tap on a registration and it took an hour to load, mind you every other app I have was fine. On top of that this app gave me a virus 🤮. I CANNOT believe what people these days are just letting onto the appstore. Disgusting.","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-08T22:28:50Z","userName":"doopppppo"}},{"id":"6173906375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"If you're incredibly interested in our very own bunker boy's incoherent quotes about the economy and photos of his family who appear to be held hostage then I highly recommend this app to you. However, if you happen to be a normal human with any remaining brain power (unlike our dear dear president), then I would recommend you stay as far away from this app as humanly possible.","rating":1,"title":"terrible vulgar app","date":"2020-07-08T22:13:15Z","userName":"ratking.com"}},{"id":"6173872166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is crap! That’s all I gotta say. \nIt took a whole month to download and when it downloaded all my apps randomly deleted and it sent my address to random ppl, and then I started getting messages of ppl saying “rate the Donald trump app 5 stars or you die” and I got really scared and I hope you guys get this app down so ppl don’t go through the same thing I did😔\nAnd I hope the Cheeto expires😌","rating":1,"title":"I hate it","date":"2020-07-08T22:00:46Z","userName":"valeiaroan"}},{"id":"6173867307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"First off I opened the app to see a horrible looking man he reminded me of an orange but as I went down I continued to see him get a spray tan naked!! My eyes burn and water can’t fix it not to mention the more I scrolled the more a profound smell started coming out of my phone I believe it came from the app since I keep myself relatively clean and I have never smelled something so bad!!
