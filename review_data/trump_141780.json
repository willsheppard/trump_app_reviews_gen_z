I heard you want to delete TikTok cause we’re making fun of you. Sorry. No can do. Listen you oversized carrot.  TikTok is a family. Something you don’t know very much about clearly since your own wife laughs at your own downfall. Delete TikTok you will start another world war and it won’t be pretty.
