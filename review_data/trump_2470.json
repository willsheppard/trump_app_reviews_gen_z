How did I know it was Russian spam? Well it was telling me to vote for trump, and the only people who gain anything from that are the Russians. All this being said it’s also important to know both sides, so look up Pied Piper Strategy and see who else wanted Trump to win the election!!! I’ll be deleting this app, such a wast of space. I was sent here by BTS (big time socialists) to help AOC invade the Untied Statues with socialismo. How spooky. Look up the Patriot Act, the US has been spying on us and are trying to blindside us with the fact that Tik Tok syncs contacts and copies clipboards. Guess what! So does reddit, Facebook, and Instagram. Don’t let the wool block your eyes.","userName":"Alexthethompo1","date":"2020-07-09T06:51:00Z","rating":1,"title":"Russian Interference?¿","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175248618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’d first like to start off by saying that I hope you get hit by a car. Sadly they don’t kill presidents like JFK times. If any FBI agent is reading this, i dare you to try and track me down. I will be running after i write this time consuming review ❤️Anyways so my point of this is saying that when i downloaded this app I automatically got STD’s. If the brainless idiot reading this doesn’t know what STD’s are, its a infection that is transmitted through sexual contact. Yeah that’s what i have at the moment. It’s hurts. So like anyways while we’re here, why don’t we talk about the thousands of children that are “lost” due to ICE being incredibly irresponsible? Or should we talk about how Trump has yet to talk about Vanessa Guillen? No? hm ok. Anyways don’t download this app luvs x ❤️😹","userName":"lawquina","date":"2020-07-09T05:31:04Z","rating":1,"title":"This app gave me STD’s, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174837714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app for the first time, and it immediately crashed. Then I tried again, and it crashed. Finally, on my 3rd try I was able to get in but then the second I got it on it froze and I had to close the app. On my fourth time opening the app, it did not crash or freeze and I was finally able to see the graphics. However they were absolutely terrible and they looked like they were designed by a child. The app also detected my location and it told me that it was sending me a representative to finish setting it up. However, the person they sent was my annoying teacher from school and I slammed the door on her. Over all a terrible experience and I would not recommend to anyone.","userName":"WorldTraveler21","date":"2020-07-09T03:18:23Z","rating":1,"title":"Complete Disappointment","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174777263","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to blindly support and follow our 💕 fascist racist rap*st sexist  misogynistic islamaphobic xenophobic and ignorant president ✨ when j was in my room ooening the app 😻and all of a sudden this strange bright orange man is creeping around my window which mind you, is weird because my room is in the second floor! and he disappears then my phone crashes?? then i heard this rustling outside my door and he BARGES IN! rude. 😾😡 he whips out this shrimp like little thïng and starts laughing and then screaming at me saying the n word and the f slur!!! he also is telling me i look like a wet noodle? he walks towards my kitchen starts eating EVERYTHING then immediately stops like he forgot what he was doing! probably the dementia. but seriously??! i deleted the app and like poof he disappeared. anyway 1 star do NOT download.","userName":"timothee chalamets wife","date":"2020-07-09T03:00:24Z","rating":1,"title":"do NOT DOWNLOAD !!! 😡😡😡😡😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174732815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? No. I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. He could actually save save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.","userName":"krakman2018","date":"2020-07-09T02:46:52Z","rating":1,"title":"Nope","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174688852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP MADE MY BLOOD BOIL‼️‼️ I made my account and all and then a few hours later the FBI shows up at my house to steal my last chicken nugget from mcdonald’s.

As a patriotic Southern woman, I downloaded this to get the latest news from the Trump administration insupport of our president. Instead, all I got was this terrible manifesto about a race war! I thought it might have been a virus/that cute mysterious hacker man with the mask trying to make the president look bad. I re-downloaded the app and it came back to normal with ‘Trump 2020’ signs. Then while I gave my little boy Timmy my phone to play Angry Birds, he comes up and asks me about  the picture on this app. That’s when I realized my poor little baby was exposed to a picture of President Trump’s little cheeto!!😱😱 I then got a notification to send my own son to Epstein’s old trafficking island!😰 My family was forced to move to another country😞","userName":"tEaSpilLeR 🍵","date":"2020-07-09T01:45:50Z","rating":1,"title":"No yee yee from me😠pedo!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174515908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"From the moment i downloaded this app things started to occur. First my pet fish ran away, then my stuffed animals all died, THEN my phone started to glitch out so much and any time i would try to open it to see something about my most favorite prez of all time, eventually causing my phone to burst into flames and completely evaporate. But the troubles did not stop there. I soon ran out into the street in frustration due to this app and got hit by a fly causing me to fall over and break all of my limbs. After spending some time in the street i proceeded to flatline and have yet to recover. This app is a danger to society and if anyone out there actually cares about the citizens in this country this app should be taken off of the app store and banned from all devices.","userName":"j.rachelle","date":"2020-07-09T01:44:13Z","rating":1,"title":"EXTREME DANGER 💔💔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174464551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is probably the worst thing to have ever existed none of the information is used for the fact that I have to even download this app to write a review that’s going to be credited towards this app is disgusting I wish I would never have even attempted to download this app because it is going against my moral values and beliefs so the fact that I have to download this app just to let Donald Trump know that it is not OK what he’s doing and the fact that he is trying to silence the prayers I bet he is trying to get an app deleted for interfering in his campaign even though it wasn’t the apps fault it was the users of the app is not OK our freedom to practice our religion is being oppressed our freedom to live our lives is being oppressed thank you!","userName":"markcroc","date":"2020-07-09T01:29:41Z","rating":1,"title":"This app is terrible!","isEdited":false}}]}
