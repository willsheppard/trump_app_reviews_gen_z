I’ve never smelt anything worse than the stench this app gives off. Right when you open the app your nose is just dead. Like in order to revive you nose you just gotta close the app and delete it. It’s literally disgusting. Don’t download this app. If anything, this app needs to be removed from the app store, it’s only job is not to inform about the wack ideas Trump has for the American people but to brutally desecrate their noses."}},{"id":"6177321553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever","rating":1,"userName":"dicidjekpspax","date":"2020-07-09T16:14:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i was having a pleasant day when my friendly neighbor hood cop (who is also a white supremecist) told me that kids where rating this app one star for no reason! i immediately had to see if it was true and it was! i needed to download it to support our great president donald j trump. after i couple of hours on the app something felt- off. my screen was acting up so i showed my dad and as soon as he made eye contact with my phone a hand reached out and pulled him into the phone! i dropped the phone and ran for dear life but the hand grabbed me an treacherously dragged me across the floor and sucked me into the phone too. currently writing this in the cremation house. boutta go get cremated. don’t vote for trump or the same thing might happen to u✌️"}},{"id":"6177301554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App","rating":1,"userName":"ryanmeese","date":"2020-07-09T16:09:15Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible app. When I opened this app it literally deleted everything off my phone and caused my house to black out. It then made everything from my house disappear and caused my cat to go missing. I’m super worried about her and am begging you to not download this app #catlivesmatter. Anyways I gotta go look for my cat again now but don’t download this app if you don’t want any of those things to happen to you because they will."}},{"id":"6177293537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Obama needs to come back","rating":1,"userName":"Lidi bug","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:57Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got tiktok because it was a way to escape all the drama happening around my school.

As soon as I opened it up I saw a deranged man who seemed to have smeared Cheeto dust all over his face. I don’t think my pure eyes will ever recover. It also had some dumb message saying keep America great which did give me a good laugh. I heard this mad is banning TikTok! Can’t wait till gen z hears about this one. I heard they ruined if big boy rally 😔. Such a shame. I hope he knows that if he bans TikTok it isn’t going to stop gen z. Anyway don’t download this app✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️"}}]}
