SAD!","userName":"fishskxoksndjdmenos","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:03Z","review":"I don’t know who this Ronald Trump guy is, but he must be one dumb loser to make such a bad app! Everyone agrees with me, and I know apps; you know people are surprised by how well I know apps, they say, “we’ve never had a reviewer who knows apps so well.” They really say that. I know apps, so I know that this app is a HUGE disgrace. It’s so ugly. It’s pointless. All those five star ratings are FAKE NEWS! MAKE APPS GREAT AGAIN!!!!"}},{"id":"6174551867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT GET","userName":"🤡🤮🙄","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:54:26Z","review":"this app is horrible, when i first opened it i saw a disgusting looking cheeto. never get this app. i am scared for life please delete this app asap.🤮😌and when i first got the app it said if you are a person of color i am banned from the app.🙄 it’ll steal your information and it’s not worth the space.

There is way too many ads! This app hacked my credit card account and made me pay 1,000 dollars from my credit card. This app took all of my money that I need to pay for my grandmothers cancer. I am so mad, my grandmother had passed away because I didn’t have the money to pay for her cancer."}},{"id":"6174538899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I have never seen an app so glitchy and broken","userName":"anonymous 98780","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:50:42Z","review":"From the first time I opened the app, my phone was bombarded with glitches and my phone instantly froze.

Fourth, I just don't like trump. Fifth, the app is complete useless and it logged me out after I opened the app."}},{"id":"6174514536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This... just is not it","userName":"a_vall","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:50Z","review":"I would like to start this off with the classic “If I could give it 0 stars, I would.” This app is absolute garbage and so is the human being it supports. We didn’t vote for this child molester so imagine how tired we are when we have dealt with IT for four years. GARBAGE. We hate racist, bigoted, fat, ugly, dust, musty, nasty smelling rapists. So the dissatisfaction is real. Thanks for playing, fat."}},{"id":"6174510128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"What did I witness 👀","userName":"roseblows","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:42:38Z","review":"This app insulted my dead grandmother, not cool by the way. It stole my fridge which I would like back because I need that food, in the process called me fat as if the Cheeto is one to talk. I was minding my own business walking my Caterpillar and then this app mugged me in broad daylight, flashed me with the tiny tiny tiny Cheeto and then killed my caterpillar. I am very traumatized from this, catch me in therapy."}},{"id":"6174494401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HOME WRECKER","userName":"justice4barbie","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:38:12Z","review":"This app is disgusting it caused my friend Barbie’s divorce. Her Ex husband Ken had an affair with the app. He tried to deny it but the app kept messaging him asking for his information, confirming their visit, sending racy photos of an orange pig🍊🐖, even going as far as saying Trump 2020, when Barbie saw that it was the last straw she was tired of Kens betrayal to herself and Bernie so she lawyered up. This app needs to be taken down it’s a HOME WRECKER🏠💔🤮"}},{"id":"6174482527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Uhhh, Just Why","userName":"NOMOREBULLSH*T","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:34:54Z","review":"This is the reason I didn’t vote Trump in the first place. It was horrifying. Not only the pictures, but everything. I have seen a poster that said, Vote Trump 2020, NO MORE BULL-SH*T, and this app shows all that BS. Oh, and the thing about Trump, why is he running for the president. In the past elections years ending with 0, that president was ASSASSINATED. COVID-19 was gods way of saying Trump dare be president in 2020, I saw your app, and HELL NO. Don’t get this app, and VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!"}}]}
