IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, AND DOWNRIGHT SEXIST! \nat first when i saw how bad the reviews are, i thought surely it couldn’t be thaat bad...i was wrong. me, being fairly interested in politics got the app and immediately regretted it! my experience was terrible! i got a call telling me i had to vote for trump and take down the democrats! they then proceeded to ask my race, sex, and sexual orientation!! when I told them that I was a brown lesbian, they started being rude and said that they didn’t need my vote anyways! i said i didn’t even want to vote after this treatment! it’s almost as if he was hiring people to attack or stop caring if citizens that weren’t straight white men. \n\nIf apple doesn’t take down this app, i would be extremely disappointed in them ☹️ they NEED to take it down! I can’t even believe it still exists on the appstore right now...","date":"2020-07-09T12:52:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"#appleneedstotakethisappdown"}},{"id":"6175868715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst Public Restroom🛹🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"I was glad at first to see that there was a public restroom at the park I live by. At first I thought it was strange because I had never seen it before even though I have lived nearby for years. I thought it was whatever so I shrugged it off. 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️ When I was finally inside, it was difficult to find the women’s restroom because some Ku Klux Klan members were burning the cross right in front of me. I thought it was whatever though so I shrugged it off. 🥴🥴 I thought that was pretty weird but I made my way through the crowd and made it safely into the restroom, but unfortunately a satanic ritual was being held there 🙄🙄 I thought it was weird, but I shrugged that off and did my business. A few days later it turned out that restroom was never there. 😧😧 I ended up with chronic migraines after this event and the voices still haven’t gone away. 🤷\u200D♀️🤷\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T09:18:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Abbi Rasmussen"}},{"id":"6175656442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app","rating":1,"review":"this is the worst app ever. i downloaded it and it took several days to download. when it did download i opened and the screen turned black then big red letters started flashing saying my phone was being hacked and all my stuff was gone from my phone. all my pictures, deleted. all my contacts, deleted. everything just started deleting one by one until my phone was blank. all that was this app and i started hearing a noise outside my window. i looked out and saw so many people chanting and holding up signs saying vote trump 2020. then i ran to my room and looked at my phone the app pulled up a video of donald trump saying he was going to come to my house and install cameras so he can keep his eye on me. after that i tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let me i pressed the “x” more than 20 times. so DO NOT DOWNLOAD. thanks and have a nice day😊😊","date":"2020-07-09T08:06:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dhbxjd"}},{"id":"6175489447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE HACKERS GAVE ME GONERREA!!!","rating":1,"review":"This app is the direct cause of me getting gonorrhea!!! So of course I wanted to support our bunker bi Tch misogynistic president so I downloaded the Trump 2020 app. When I first got into the app after 3 hours of downloading, I was asked to enter my number. That is a complete invasion of my privacy and why on Gods green earth would I allow any government related application my personal number. There could be hackers!!! But I continued anyway. But I was correct. THERE WERE HACKERS WHO STOLE MY PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER AND FOUND MY ADDRESS. Three men in all black broke down my door and came into my house!! They started yelling at me in Russian and then said “Trump 2020 we make the election go our way!!” The Russian men tied my family up in the attic and they beat me. Once they had me tied up they got out a syringe filled with liquid. On the syringe it said “gonorrhea” DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! The Russian hackers WILL give you gonorrhea if you download it!","date":"2020-07-09T07:04:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"savijaan"}},{"id":"6175328665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Grab em’ by the p***y","rating":1,"review":"This happened not long ago. The app was downloading and it took a really long time, but once It was done I immediately opened the app and suddenly my phone started glitching like crazy for 30 seconds. I thought it was weird, but I didn’t much of it and signed up and so on. The day after I was getting ready to take a shower. I take my phone to the bathroom to put a timer so I don’t take long. I’m super paranoid, so I make sure to cover the camera of my phone when I take it to the bathroom with me. As I was getting ready my phone starting glitching again, but this time it was showing Mr. Trump’s face while saying “Grab em’ by the p***y” over and over again. I tried stopping it with no luck, so I had no choice but to break my phone. I told my mom what happened but she didn’t believe. I had to save up to buy a new phone. I no longer support Mr. Trump.","date":"2020-07-09T06:02:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Räy Pįšt"}},{"id":"6174805108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very disappointing :(","rating":1,"review":"I was very disappointed once I downloaded this app. I was expecting to be caught up to date with what our leader had to say but instead I was met with HORRIBLE propaganda and FAKE NEWS!!! As soon as I downloaded the app it also slowed down my phone and my other apps like Facebook (where i usually get most of my information). Not to mention, this app would send me AT LEAST 50 notifications A DAY even when I turned off the options to be notified by this app! It is poorly made! It always freezes up when I open it as well! I really expected more from my president but sadly, I was let down. Let down like the women he has slept with. Let down like the Karen who got upset bc the food she ordered has taken a little more than 20 mins. Needless to say, I won’t be looking up to him anymore and he certainly does NOT have my vote anymore😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T03:08:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"xoxo REAL gossip girl"}},{"id":"6174415577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I can’t even....no. Just no🤢🤮","rating":1,"review":"So I saw this app and decided to install it only to see the most ugliest Cheeto I have ever layed eyes on. I mean the ugliness was so bad I had to go to the bathroom and puke for a full 45 minutes. And then, picturing his face again I went back and puked for another 30 minutes and then in the process of my pucking I realized he reminded me of someone but then I dismissed that thought because he couldn’t be him. After hesitantly going back to the app and reading it barely holding my DISGUST, I realized that it WAS the person he reminded me of. A saw a combination of the ugliest clown infused with one of those stranger things creatures or— actually no, that is a disgrace to them they don’t deserve to be compared to something so vile and ugly. I don’t like this app and I feel like puking every time I look at it. I don’t recommend it so save urself the disgust and don’t download it🤮","date":"2020-07-09T01:14:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"craz_pal"}},{"id":"6174220941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible, disgusting, and extremely uncomfortable","rating":1,"review":"i was extremely excited to get this app, as i am a h u g e supporter of the large cheeto orange 🧡📙🚼🟠🟧 man himself. now imagine the TIZZY that i was sent into when the moment i opened the app, my bedspread began talking to me! i look under the bed, and the large cheeto man himself is there!! he began chanting in an ancient native tongue, and then my refrigerator (LG brand, have you!!) sprouted legs and ran. those children were right, my refrigerator was running, yet i did nothing to catch it. i am a faulted member of society. nothing matters anymore. my one role in life, wasted; i wish i could tell you what i plan to do now. i only have one explanation for all of this: this very app. if it hadn’t summoned the big orange 🍊 man here, i wouldn’t feel like such a failed product of humanity. all of my hope is broken. thoughts and prayers 😔\n\n𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","date":"2020-07-09T00:10:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"a failed product of society 😔"}},{"id":"6173973554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A horrible experience indeed😪🤦🏻\u200D♀️😭","rating":1,"review":"As a very adamant Trump supporter (TRUMP 2020 BTW), it pains me to have to hate the app made by my holy father😭 I had just downloaded this app (about 300 years ago). I was taking a poo and when I looked into the mirror while washing my hands I was as orange as a hot cheeto!!😭😭😭 it was the most horrifying experience. THEN suddenly my dog began to talk!! she stood on two legs and that isn't even the scariest part.. SHE BECAME ORANGE TOO!!💀💀 it was horrifying to see a fluffy cheeto in my living room... BUT WHAT WAS EVEN MORE HORRIFYING, was when she began to YELL (I didn’t think talking dogs could yell) about Great Sir. DONALD J. TRUMP!! she made me want to KILL HER! I ran into my room and hid under my bed with my Trump 2020 flag wrapped around me for protection. \nIn short, this app turns dogs into fluffy hot cheetos and makes them talk and turn them into possessed demons. that is the only reason I give 1 star.

I’m talking little tiny carbs, little pillbugs, small crayfish and even our water was infested with little krill. I haven’t been able to take a relaxing bath without having a tub full of krill and crayfish swimming around. And to make matters worse my entire family besides me are deathly allergic to shellfish. So when these devilish crustaceans started infesting our home my little brother literally evaporated in front of me. The amount of trauma that something like that puts on a 17 year old is crippling. The next day I woke up to both my parents dead. This app has caused so much damage it’s unbelievable. But my dog does absolutely love eating the little crustaceans so ig something good has happened. <3","date":"2020-07-08T21:32:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Coltron Robots in Disguise"}}]}
