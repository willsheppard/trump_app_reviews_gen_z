Momo held a .22 at me and Appa had his standard ol’ faithful .360. I was confused with Appa’s weaponry but he explained to me that the ✨b u l l e t✨ performed a special 360 twirl, leaving multiple entry and exit wounds. They both stated their second amendment rights to kill me if I were to even think about letting the app finish downloading. Appa begun on this monologue about how he once encountered a hot Cheeto bag and the dust stained his fur for ages despite his best attempts to wash it off. However, when the water touched his fur, Appa explained how the Cheeto dust locked Katara in a cage, shot Sokka, kicked and mocked Toph, called Aang a “liberal snowflake”, and then proceeded to slander and silence Zuko. That experience left him and Momo traumatized and yearning for equal rights for all and fair government treatment of all. They then began to curb stomp me because the Trump App finally downloaded itself on my phone. If it were possible, I would give this a 0/5. Worst experience of my life.","userName":"ddrfghh","rating":1}},{"id":"6177519525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"For my beloved pterodactyl, Frog♥️","review":"I got this app to keep up to date with that orange blob of steaming trash so I could know if he was gonna come to my state for a rally so I could have proper time to escape and flee for my life. But upon downloading, my phone crashed 42 times! Not only that but when I opened the app I immediately vomited at the disgusting picture that filled my screen. It was a child rapst, white supremacist, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic, revolting, sorry excuse for a human being with demensia!!! I had to go to the hospital because I couldn’t stop throwing up in disgust and that fake-tanned sweaty blob of flesh won’t stop plaguing me with nightmares. As soon as I opened this app it tracked my location; they came to my home and stole my beloved pet pterodactyl, Frog. I will forever miss him. His favorite food was lying, idiotic, corrupt, piece of trash politicians. Their population will grow out of control without Frog keeping their numbers in check. We love you Frog♥️ I hope whenever they took you, you’ll find tasty, scheming, power-hungry abusers to fill your belly✨🥰","userName":"for Frog my pterodactyl♥️","rating":1}},{"id":"6176747860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:38:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"disappointed","review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to keep up with the greatest president this country has ever seen. Not only is he homophobic and racist, he is also a r*pist. Who wouldn’t want him in office? The fact that he is a bad person doesn’t matter because the economy is doing good! But I’m getting ahead of myself, when I downloaded the app it took six weeks to finally finish loading. I signed up to get notifications from the app, but all of the notifications seems to be some sort of message from Barron Trump asking to be saved. Anyways, the app posts about having over 1 million RSVPs to the Tulsa rally. When in reality, only a little over 6000 people showed up. Mr. President, do you like spreading lies? I mean, I knew you were an idiot and a liar when you told us to inject bleach to get rid of Covid, but now you lie on your app about how many people are attending your rally? And expecting over 1 million people to be in the same room in the middle of a pandemic? I knew you were an idiot, but I didn’t know you were that stupid.","userName":"dannimarie2904","rating":1}},{"id":"6176608216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:01:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TRASH!!!😾😾🙀😤😤","review":"this app took 69 HOURS!!! to download!!! that is absolutely ridiculous!!!!!😤😤😤😤😤I CANNOT believe it took THAT LONG for a stupid APP!!!! then it asked me for my phone number??? like what?? trump is a married man!!! why would he want MY number?!?!?!?😳😳😳buttttttttt regardlessssss,,,,, i have him my number........😳when i did tho i got a bunch of spam!!! so much spamm!!!!🙀🙀😾😤i had no other choice the to block trumps number. i never thought our president would be such a cheater and a desperate person..😳🤧🤧😤after i blocked his number he texted me from a new one and i got a bunch of spam???? like whatttt????? our bunker boy is so desperate!!!!!!!!! i didn’t know i was that desirable!!☺️☺️☺️😳😳💅so because he was spamming me so much, i decided i was done with him!! i was OVER such a cheater!!! i told him NEVER to contact me AGAIN!!! and blocked his number!!!

OH WAIT. ALL APPS NEED HELP right? this trump app has false information and rumors. it also has a nice feature of ignorance and stupidity. the person featured in this app, yes trump, is known to grab women by their private parts. you don’t need to be 18+ to use this app because trumps like underaged people, such as little girls, using this app. i mean do you see how he looks at his daughter. this app cares more about putting people who vandalize STATUES, that represent colonizers and past racist people behind bars than police officers and racist people who kill black people. this app will make you AHHH GO CRAZYY AHHH GO STUPIDD. this trump app is NOT KID FRIENDLY. I mean trump doesn’t care that over thousands of \nimmigrants that are minors have been reported ‘missing’. lastly, you gain more calories looking at trump’s cheeto puff face than eating actual cheetos. \n\nall of the current information above is accurate and precise. period.","userName":"cheetopufftrump","rating":1}},{"id":"6174750037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:52:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!","review":"So I was very curious about what this app was all about. BOYYYY WAS I WRONG!!!! My phone shut down as soon as I opened the app. I didn’t put much mind thought it was just my phone acting up but actually it was the app. When it turned on a T-Rex came out and started eating all my food. He didn’t even have the audacity to pay me back. The T-Rex was even GrEen with the face of trump on it lowkey got scared a lil but then a found it funny until the food part. Trump I’m still waiting to get a refund for all the food that ur t-Rex took from me. That was one hell of a good pizza. Well after that the phone sucked me in and I was stuck in this place with the face of trump everywhere. That lowkey scared me more than the T-Rex. I couldn’t bare to see so much orange umpa lumpas. Then when the phone finally let me out I threw it across the room then grabbed it and threw it out the window then grabbed it and hit it with a bat then grabbed it and bought a ticket to Antarctica and sent it through a plane. That’s what u should do in this situation. Good luck. And DO NOT GET IT!!!","userName":"hiiiiiiiiii123","rating":1}},{"id":"6174499149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:39:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Avoid this app at ALL COSTS 🤢🤮❌","review":"Okay so I downloaded the app and was very excited to expand my mind into foreign political territories. Unfortunately, to my utter shock and embarrassment, this app was not what it seemed to be. I opened up the app to see a picture of a raccoon, but instead of black and white, it was a saturated orange with bright, blinding white eye bags. Utterly terrifying, I was speechless. I continued to explore the app in hopes that it wasn’t too bad and discovered the same raccoon but wearing a wig! I’ll admit, it was quite amusing to see this orange raccoon with a blonde wig, but still I didn’t see how this related to politics! Then the raccoon started speaking to me! Telling tales of grabbing 🐱 (I suppose for dinner?) and building walls and not wearing masks even though there’s a pandemic! But I guess I haven’t seen any other wild animals wearing masks, so... But anyway, when I asked my mom if she knew what animal it was, she said she didn’t know either! We were both stumped, and we still don’t know, so if anyone can figure out what inbred, foul-looking, rude animal it is, please let me know!","userName":"👁❤️🐱GRABBERS","rating":1}},{"id":"6174363110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:58:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible...dont get","review":"i was so ready to get this app so i opened it up and there was a a huuuuge penis and a cheeto puff i was looking for I found lilhuddy saying a no no word then my phone starts glitching like crazy and throws itself into the river and turns into the big cheeto man he was dancing the renegade and sang ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆 then Charli did a 𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚎𝚐𝚊𝚍𝚎 on me and then nessa Barrett tried to throw it back on me BHEUSJYES sometimes I don’t wanna be happy the next day i woke up and someone was knocking on my my door i went to open when i saw the Tony Lopez who wanted to give you a helicopter ride obviously i said yes but then he turned into the cheeto man so i jumped out of the helicopter And Nikita got mad so she dissolved my lip filler so im as natural as Madison Beer🖤 bEhuesss my Gemini moon was rising💧 👁💧👄👁 So i decided to go to the hype house where Thomas told me to renegade so i can eat i got so scared and ran home and the big cheeto man was at my door 😥he drowned my fish 🐠 and it died i do not recommend this app if you dont want your fish to drown 👁👄👁","userName":"gehenkwmr ufne","rating":1}}]}
