I nearly fell of my houses roof. So I exited out of the app and tried to open it up again. When I opened it I saw a OOPMA LOOMPA. This times I nearly fell of a bridge. And the only good thing about this app is because I opened up one last time and Obama was on the screen 😌 Back to the app. The app asked me for camera permission but there is NO camera thing for it. GUYS TRUMP 🗑 IS STALKING US. Plus his wife is like 30 years younger than him. Anyone else see a problem? But the app spams you with notifications and it’s just not a good app overall. I just don’t understand how people like trump and his app.","userName":"hi_me_awesome","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175942091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:43:33Z","rating":1,"title":"Foreign Malware","review":"This app gave me so much malware on my phone and terrible advice. Even if I closed the app, inappropriate pictures of models with our great presidents popped up on my phone. It even had photos of underage kids in revealing clothing with our wondrous President. This is unacceptable. \n\nAlso, I wanted advice on what to do to feel that didn’t support trump. And it told me to shout TRUMP 2020 in their face. I tried that and got punched. Terrible advise. Also, when I asked it about wearing masks, it called me a socialist. I would NEVER be one of the radical left. So it told me to not wear a mask and make sure I insult any who does. I did this, and once again got punched. Now I have 2 black eyes. Terrible advice. Terrible app.","userName":"HARDRIGHTSUPPORTER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175893941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:27:20Z","rating":1,"title":"PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP","review":"So I got this app so that I could check out the current president’s ways of communication but I soon found out that it was giving my phone a terrible virus. The actual software damaged my phone but the content of the app damaged my soul. I’ve never seen such vile things in my life. I’m currently writing this from my new phone, as one day after downloading the app, my phone overheated due to the app running in the background. My phone exploded, sending shrapnel flying into my face and body, which I am still recovering from. On top of being injured, my house was also set ablaze by this explosion, and I lost all of my belongings to the fire. Please do not get this app.","userName":"littyig","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175732152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:32:48Z","rating":1,"title":"very ugly no download from me ever again- tati","review":"donald trump is a white supremacist FULL STOP if you vote for him again you’re a white supremacist. \n\nsorry just wanted to type out MY national anthem before i proceed with this review. this app gave my family coronavirus. do not download!! it’s awful! it took a year to download and took up all my storage. i also started looking kind of orange after downloading this app and i began to become a racist!! i would never! i actually believe in human rights and the BLM movement so it’s weird that i would demonstrate these traits. must be that donald trump is racist and a fraud so it was rubbing off on me.... maybe that’s why all the trumpets are so dumb and clueless. anyways, biden 2020. ✨💕🧚\u200D♂️🥵","userName":"Annie184&19492","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175731451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:32:34Z","rating":1,"title":"worst app; made my phone crash, gave me covid","review":"horrible app, so disappointing. i was with my friend nayely as i was supporting this app which has to do with the person that is controlling this country and then it shut down. i had to go to the apple store to get it fixed and then when i came back home i had covid-19. this gave us the VIRUS. how inhumane, it shouldn’t be legal. back in my days, the president of the US would have been able to have at least one thing in order: this app not the country of course. truly a disgrace but not a surprise. donald can not run a twitter account, let alone an app. #savebarronwilliam #justice #newpresidentneeded #thisappdoesnotwork #takethisoff #scam #phonenotworking","userName":"jasmin.silva","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175412864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:34:27Z","rating":1,"title":"eXcUsE mE","review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to support our definitely not the reincarnation of hitler president🙈. I was so excited to see all the features and help the campaign🥰. It asked for my phone number which was pretty flattering😏 so I gave them it. At first all the texts were nice and pleasant and we were having a nice convo😊. Then HE SENT ME A 🍆 PIC. Normally I would be so excited to get one from the president but it was a disgrace. The president should really have a big you know what, but it was itty bitty 🤏 Maybe he should get a 🍆 enlargement surgery because as we all know, the constitution says the president should have a big one. This convinced me to vote for Biden cause we all know he’s packing","userName":"mjm69420","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175180120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:06:08Z","rating":1,"title":"BUNKER BOY","review":"this app is absolutely HORRIFYING. after i opened it, my phone shut off completely. it restarted after like 20 minutes and had the words “i know you’re a f*g” written on my screen. i frantically tried to delete the app bc it started using my location, but to no avail. secret service ended up coming to my house and threatened me and my family at gunpoint. side note: do secret service agents get vacations??? they looked fried like some mf cheetos like the bunker boy hiMSELF. anyway. after they threatened me and my family, they literally picked up my dog and put her in this contraption that was said to go into outer space where they’d be testing life forms. they freaking deported my dog to space.

However, after I downloaded it my phone started glitching and not working properly. I went to settings and it turns out that this app took of SO MUCH STORAGE! Also, this app sends so many notifications each day that I don’t even see the notifications that are important. In fact, there are so many notifications that it made my phone die, when my phone normally stays charged for the whole day. I do not recommend this app because after I deleted it, everything went back to normal and all the problems I had after downloading it went away.","userName":"Ruggs0119","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175110162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:42:31Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible.","review":"Hi, I was trying to download this app but it was taking forever! I thought that maybe it was because I had too many apps so I got rid of a few but it was still taking a long time to download. An hour later it finally downloads and it messed my whole phone up! My phone started to get a whole bunch of lag spikes and it was very slow, I had to restart my phone but it still had the same problem. This app is awful! My phone wasn’t old and it’s an iPhone. I asked my friend if she could download this app on her phone and see if it was having problems, same happened to her! Her phone was completely messed up as well!","userName":"DumbAssSouli","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174820739","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:13:26Z","rating":1,"title":"동물원을 빠져나온 퓨마 - TXT","review":"West side, east side\nDidn't know where to, where to go, no\nTonight we ride 적막한 이 밤의 소음\n어둠 속 저 문이 열려 누가 막아? 아무도, oh\nWest side, east side, it don't matter anymore\n뜨거 뜨거 뜨거 뜨거\n뜨거 발이 데인 나\n눈떠 느껴 숨 쉬어 꿈꿔\n꿈꿔왔던 세상\n생애 제일 거대한 night sky (Night sky)\n내 발의 speed는 벌써 마하\n눈앞의 저 green light\n뭐가 뭐가 두려워\nThey came, catch my back\n절대 잡히면 안 돼\nThey came, catch my friends\n짙게 깔린 저 안개\n여긴 사방은 까맣고 (It's coming)\n심각한 분위기로\n귓가에 들리는 건\nBang, bang, bang (달려야 해)\nBut 왠지 나는 기뻐 (I'm PUMA)\n처음 느껴본 이 기분\n처음 자유를 만난 지금\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\n왠지 나는 기뻐\n내 선택이 내 leader\n내가 나의 believer\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\n두근대네 심장이\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa) 처음 보는 나의 피 Yeah\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa) 번져가네 조금씩\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa) 나를 뛰게 하는 뛰게 하는 피\n동물원을 벗어나고 나서\n마주친 세상은 너무 낯선\n누구 하나도 나를 안 반겨\n매일 같은 \"걸음아 날 살려 race\"\n밤이 되면 저 달엔\n얼굴, 그리웠던 엄마의\n서글퍼진 맘\n내 두 번째 걸음마\nI told ya (Told ya)\n홀로 서기엔 아직 너무 어려\n이 세상은 jungle full of warriors\n조준경이 너의 목을 노려\n수천 개의 눈이 인터넷에 접속\n조심해, 네 적이 삽시간에 퍼져\n\"꿈에 닿을 때까지 얼마나 더 걸려?\"\n그 질문엔 매번 총성만이 번져\n난 계속 숨을 쉬기 위해 다시 run up\nBut 왠지 나는 기뻐 (I'm PUMA)\n처음 느껴본 이 기분\n처음 자유를 만난 지금\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh\n왠지 나는 기뻐\n내 선택이 내 leader\n내가 나의 believer\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)\n처음 보는 나의 피, yeah\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa) 번져가네 조금씩\n(Whoa, whoa, whoa) 나를 뛰게 하는 뛰게 하는 피\nWest side, east side\nDidn't know where to, where to go, no\nTonight we ride 적막한 이 밤의 소음\n어둠 속 저 문이 열려 누가 막아? 아무도, oh\nWest side, east side, it don't matter anymore (Mm, no)","userName":"&//&:&:!:!??","isEdited":false}}]}
