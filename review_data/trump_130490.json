But no the app threatened to hack me and said that it’ll break in and steal my parakeet. 🙄I then turned my phone off and on to see if there was a difference but NO. The app started to curse at me and said that Donald is not orange but he IS WHAT A LIER! The app then turned bright orange while it yelled “orange alert” “orange alert” and it locked me in as a slide show of trump walking out of his rally upset because us gen zs tricked him. OH NO POOR KID🙄🙀🙀. It then started flickering to all of my apps and said that it will still hack me and delete my info. I was so SHOCKED BEYOND COMPARE. Then it started to flicker really smelly poop through the screen at me like it glitched  or something ! This app is absolutely ridiculous and a disgrace to The App Store. Please take it down kids will be absolutely scared! This app was HORRIBLE anyways... delete this off of the AppStore it’s absolutely a piece of trash !💋👁👄👁👿💋👿😼💅🏼😩😩🙄🙄🙄","title":"the worst thing I’ve ever seen💋💕🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"userName":"lmao😹","rating":1}},{"id":"6174658578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:48Z","review":"IT WAS SO GLITCHY GAVE HER A seizure.
