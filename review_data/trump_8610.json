I did as I was instructed and carefully text trump to the number listed, and something unimaginable happened. It responded with my name address an social security number, and then it was leaked to twitter. I thought nothing of it and went to sleep. I woke up at around 3 in the morning and saw someone standing by my bed. I then proceeded to get swatted. I hope no one ever has to go through this same misfortune again."}},{"id":"6176232806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I gave it a chance","rating":1,"userName":"kaxkade24","date":"2020-07-09T11:15:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Let‚Äôs start with the FACT that the SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION chose this app. This app immediately wanted to force close and DISCRIMINATE all the apps that weren‚Äôt similar or had similar content even though  they WORKED Perfectly fine.

I was going through the App Store when I can across the app of the most ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù president ever. So I installed the app but it took 2 weeks to install. By this time I got deported so I was already in mexico. So I saw that it was available so I had to get back to MERICA to get on that high speed internet. So I easily jumped the border and smuggled some drugs. Because you know ‚Äú2 birds with one stone‚Äù and then when I opened it. It all went green and my phone exploded :("}}]}
