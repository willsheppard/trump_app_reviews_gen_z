It immediately stole all of my personal info including my credit card info, social security number, and my phone number. Now I’m stuck on the streets because they stole everything from me and on top of that they won’t stop texting me asking for $100 as if they didn’t take everything I had. 👎🏼👎🏼","isEdited":false,"userName":"1k3madeir","title":"Two thumbs down","date":"2020-06-24T12:57:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6065490914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Firstly, this app wouldn’t let me turn off location settings. \n\nSecondly, it kept asking for pictures of my cat at every. Stage. Of signup. I complied every time it asked, thinking it was pretty innocuous. \n\nI realized too late my mistake.\n\nI have (had) an orange cat, and a day after downloading the app, a strange Van with the trump logo showed up at my house, and now my cat is gone. I am positive that these events are related. I can only assume that the Cheeto in Chief gets his brilliant glow in the dark can see you for miles beacon of Mordor orange skin tone from the essence of orange cats, and mine was just the latest victim in his quest to become the Eye of Sauron. \n\nI want my cat back Donald. I know you have my sweet boi. Give me back my cat, Donald.","isEdited":false,"userName":"IRA Lad","title":"WHERES MY CAT, DT!?","date":"2020-06-12T04:25:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6064623482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Genuine review: The app has many bugs. I've tried it on many devices and it's always the same problem. I've tried reporting them but nothing gets done about it. I'm not a biased person, I like getting news sources from both parties then making my own opinion; however, this app gave me too many problems. There are many other apps to get information on tho.","isEdited":false,"userName":"I need gens","title":"Genuine Review","date":"2020-06-11T22:27:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6056213016","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got on here thinking that it would be at least somewhat reliable, guess not everything is fake news. It just gives you all the brainwashing things people wanna hear, when in fact most things this bigoted President does and says are not for the betterment of anyone but his own ego.

I can’t even use my phone as a phone anymore. Every time I try to make a call it opens the app instead. It sent out texts to every single one of my contacts WITHOUT PERMISSION. I’d be surprised if this even gets posted because my phone is SO HOT FROM TRYING TO RUN THIS APP AND GOING SO SLOW.
