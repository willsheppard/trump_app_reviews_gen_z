I had to kill the app 3 times before it started working. Then when i tried to sign up, it said my email was wrong and wouldn’t accept the “@gmail.com” at the end! So i put in my phone number and it took 10 MINUTES to load to the main page. When selecting the drop down to look at more options, it wouldn’t drop anything down like nothing was there.

So when I saw this app I thought there was no way I could get a trumpet app that was incredibly up to date. I mean 2020 is in the name people! Turns out it’s a xenophobic, misogynist Cheeto trying to sell some weak ass merch.

This app. Don’t even get me started. The quality when you first open this is HORRIBLE. Kicked me out multiple times. Not to mention they added a moldy orange when you first open the app. I thought this was supposed to be a president?? Who is the person? I honestly think it’s is UNBELIEVABLE that the developers of this app thought it was funny to put a moldy orange on the screen. 🙄. And this is only the beginning! It asks me to put my phone number in to receive messages, but once i added my number it continuously sends me PORNOGRAPHIC photos and videos! I have children using my phone! What if they accidentally press on it?! And it does not let me block the number. I believe that this app should be REMOVED. It is completely INAPPROPRIATE and UNSTABLE.  I honestly hate this app. And i do not use the word hate EVER. I wish Obama was back. #Obama2020 #KickOutTrump #TikTok #HatersGonnaHate #AddMeOnIG #ItIsLil_moyyaaa #Lmao #GenZ #TakingOver"}},{"id":"6173947469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"i hate this and this app is not worth it","userName":"no one cares about trump","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:21Z","review":"i first wanted to download this app to vote for the election. when i pressed the download button it took forever to download like when i say forever it took forever, and yes i do have a lot of space on my phone, actually i just got my phone a week ago so it’s not like it was my phone no it was the app. then when the app finally downloaded after a long long long time, i signed in and everything and i was just exploring the app you know and then the app froze. i was like maybe it’s my phone but no it was not i went out of the app and tried a different app and it worked perfectly so it was the trump app that kept on freezing and freezing. now after all that happened the app started to glitch it was bringing me to different things on the app uhhh i would just not recommend it like who needs to vote for this skum bag of a piece of poop who no one cares about expect for karen of course. anyways i give this app 1 star it was just so not worth it and a complete waste of time."}},{"id":"6173947261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"cheeto gone wild","userName":"1Dlover999","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:16Z","review":"this app is offensive and proves the different fascist motives that the candidate pushes. do not get the app, there is nothing worse than this app. it is uninformative and frankly rude. the fact that this app helps any candidate that is charged with multiple counts of child molestation and sexual assault is appalling. along with a president that has done little to support pandemic aid efforts, is inherently racist and sexist, and is beyond idiotic. final say: DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6173947231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😡😡😡","userName":"good igjcjzigdigdkhxgsutslhx","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:15Z","review":"I’m to traumatized to tell you this story in words, so I’ll use emojis 😁😳😧🤕😾🤯😭😥😡🤡🤬💩💩💩👎👁🦠🔮🔪🪓🔫💣🧨⚰️😤😤😤😢😢😢🤬🤬🤬😱😱😨😨😰🙄😵🤧🤮🤢💀👻🦶🗣🤳👨\u200D🦯👨\u200D🦽📸📞📡🧲⛓🩸🦠🧧📥📫📪📃📑📇🗳📌✂️🖍💔"}},{"id":"6173947181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is poo","userName":"Mattutherater","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:14Z","review":"THIS APP IS SO POOPY PEE PEE IT SMELL LIKE DOG FART"}}]}
