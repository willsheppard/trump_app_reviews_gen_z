Worst read I’ve ever had actually. It’s impossible to work and even more impossible to actually understand the claims being made seeing as they’re so idiotic.

But it wouldn’t let me get in the app. I am not from Gen Z trying to take down the app👀. It crashes so much. It makes my whole phone glitch. Drains my battery in 15 minutes.
