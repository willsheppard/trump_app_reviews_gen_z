There are so many bugs in the software and the app constantly glitching and freezing. I have changed my phone 3 times due to this app and the amount of money that I spent is astronomical. I’m hoping that Mr. Trump😻can reimburse the amount of money that was taken out of my pockets due to this app."}},{"id":"6177475679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"trump lover ✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:55Z","review":"this app is absolutely horrible. i downloaded it to support my totally amazing president who we all should love and re elect. however upon opening the app i was faced with death threats specifically towards my elderly mother telling her to khs. this is horrible and it was signed off on by the president himself!! not to mention it totally screwed up my phone. after a day or two the app kept glitching and my phone was randomly shutting off. i have an 11 btw. so in conclusion this app is horrible don’t get it"}},{"id":"6177346526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️Fairy comments 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","userName":"kimmy149","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:21:47Z","review":"Excited to help our president and then when I downloaded the app decided to hack me and I started to get all my data and sweep out my whole phone and then I started talking about sexist and racist things end it decided that it was going to take all my data and start sending me Donald Trump‘s nudes and credit card numbers and then it started to take my dog and swing it across the room and started writing trump 2020 all over the walls and in my phone and everything"}},{"id":"6177335050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET WAISTED MY TIME AND CRASHED MY PHONE","userName":"jim strutler","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:18:33Z","review":"I was so excited for this app and I needed to get some important information about our president, but that was proven to be more difficult than I thought. \nFirst off this app took OVER A WEEK to download, I’ve never waited for a app to download for so long, but hey this was really important to me so I continued to try and use this app, but as soon as I opened it, it literally crashed my phone, and it took me forever to fix it!\nI’m honestly vary disappointed with my whole experience!"}},{"id":"6177322804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏽✨⚡️tik tok🧚🏽✨⚡️","userName":"🧚🏽✨⚡️tik tok🧚🏽✨⚡️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:15:08Z","review":"Soon as I saw a orange Oompa Lupa ICracked up.

I was so excited to see what had in store on this app. but was extremely disappointed at what i found. Right after I got the app my phone crashed and i had to get a new one. I thought maybe it was just an old but when i downloaded it on my new one the same thing happened. And spent a boat load of money on this silly little app. If you want your phone to crash be sure to get this app because it’s trash"}},{"id":"6177007811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"veeeeery disappointing 😡😡😡😡","userName":"wh0r3 for $ale","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:46:46Z","review":"if i wanted to watch a chunky old man constantly treat things like jokes then i’d just watch Gabriel Iglesias (fluffy). like i’m sorry an ✨enlarged cheeto puff✨ does not do it for me😌💅. also when i opened this app it straight up gave me directions to hell (literally his whole plan of action). like i know i’ll be going there someday but at least let me find it myself and in a more fun way that doesn’t suppress other races, genders, and ages. keep this chain going my fellow manny followers❤️🥰\n\nxoxo \ngossip girl"}},{"id":"6176994419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!","userName":"SaveIvanka","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:11Z","review":"If I could give this 0 stars I would be more realistic. This app is so bad! First of all it, doesn’t work. Second of all, it’s literally useless. Third, this app spreads hatred and racism to everyone who gets it and it goes on from there. Fourth, it gave my phone a virus. Fifth, it is an attack against many people. I have so many reasons why this app shouldn’t even be in the apple store. The list goes on and on. Please take this off the apple store and off any other store out there."}}]}
