I was hoping it would educate her about how black lives don’t matter (aka all/blue lives matter) and how the 1% don’t deserve to be taxed because if they aren’t taxed then they’ll pay for stuff for us (the 99%) because they’re so generous. Well she used the app every day for the past two months and it started working. She started screaming at people holding BLM signs whenever we saw them on the side of the road and got a blue stripe bumper sticker. She even stopped wearing those masks because she realized that they’re just lies made up by the corrupt Russian democrats. Well somehow she ended up getting coronavirus (the Chinese virus) and all the hospitals near us (in Florida) were full so we had to keep her at home. There was a private one that had space but we couldn’t afford it and apparently a bunch of millionaires were in there after getting trashed at a nightclub the day before. Her lungs were too weak from all the mango pods I’ve been lending her and she ended up dying.

However, when I opened the app, I immediately got booted out and my screen turned a hideous orange, and a smell of old, crusty blonde wig filled my home. My family passed out while I had a mask on. I can not believe this! 😡 I FaceTimed my friend to tell her, and she looked like the almighty cheeto puff! I frantically hung up. But when I turned around, the cheeto was there AGAIN! 😥 He started chanting “GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN” loudly.  “but also vote trump 2020” he added as a self promotion. I said “ok” 😄 but I then deleted the app. My screen remained orange. 🍊🍊 I had to buy a new phone and waste so much money!!! 😡😡 The almighty cheeto puff disappeared into my phone, only increasing the color of the screen to a dark orange. Adding to the old blonde wig smell, something that smelt almost like rusty spray tan mixed in with it, creating the smell of Trump. Do not recommend this app. My story deserves to be heard by the world.

This app took forever to download. I remember starting the downloading process on a Monday night, it finally had downloaded completely that Friday that week. Not to mention how horribly it slowed down my phone. Now whenever I try to use my phone it’s so glitchy. But once I opened the app I immediately got a message telling me that if I didn’t vote for Trump 2020, Trump him self was going to personally come to my house and spit in my child’s face and then mine.I ignored that message and had only downloaded the app with an open mind to see if I could be convinced to be a hard right but after digging around for a bit they said that if didn’t even vote entirely, trump would slaughter your pets and use their fur for his toupees. This all happened in one day of using the app, not to mention the multiply pop up adds I started to get for every other app on my phone. I immediately deleted the app but every search engine I go to mutinous adds for Trump 2020 over takes the app. Getting a new phone this weekend. Horrible🤢🤮🤢","userName":"SendHelpForThisCountry"}},{"id":"6172807905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:02:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Trash","review":"A bunch of racists using this app. First it asks for you personal information so that they can sell it and you get pointless messages day and night that “keep you updated” on a campaign that is based on nothing but fear mongering and taking advantage of vulnerable old people and impressionable youths. He claims to have created more jobs, however, jobs have been increasing in America since before he was in office and less have been created in his time in office than Obama’s. He has no regard for human lives and has been tied to several crimes including human trafficking. And the wall he promised to build is still not up. It is common for politicians to not keep all of their promises, but to keep no promises is basically him lying to every one of his citizens so he can be in power. Anything he sends about his campaign on this app is essentially him trying to claw his way back into the Oval Office. He is a scared little bunker boy who created this app to take advantage of whatever “supporters” he has left in his little cult of racists and ignorant, incapable government officials and citizens.","userName":"biden_2020_bitch"}},{"id":"6172460190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:25:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"How about turning this app into N O N E X I S T A N C E ? ✨","review":"As an avid pedo supporter- erm I mean supporter of the president! I would like to say that if I want to support him why do I need to sign in? And why do I need to sign in to use this app? Furthermore! It took me 6 hours! 6 hours! 😫 To download! I know my WiFi may not be the best! But it certainly took a very long while! I was able to run to the store and get myself some tortillas, chopped up carnitas, lemons, cilantro, onions, and some Mexican Coca Cola from the local Cinco de Mayo!🥵😌 Then I was able to prepare me said things... come to think of it these things were heavenly to eat and prepare and I just think... hm... what’ll happen when these things are gone? And not just the foods, but the people too? And the culture from the country? And then not just Mexicans, but Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Peruvians, Chileans... etc.? What’ll become of the great US of A? What’ll happen without of Hispanic influence?😡 Anyways my turtle Tito died at the sight of the orange man and sadly my turtle died this year... so RIP Tito🥺... anyways so... vote blue🔵, BLM✊🏾, HLM✊🏼, and Gen z strikes again 🖕🏼✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️🇲🇽","userName":"GEn z gOrL"}},{"id":"6177356417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:24:35Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP GAVE ME RABIES","review":"So this app just randomly appeared on my phone and so I click on it and strait away there is  a GINORMOUS orange rat staring at me and I got so scared that I threw my phone across the room and obviously I get up to pick it up but when I get it I get sucked into this giant black hole and it took me to joes barbecue and foot massage which was ok I guess but then next thing you know I see ELMO handing out leaflets saying that there was a giant orange rat on the loose giving people rabies and I realized it was the rat on the app so I go over to talk to him and he THROWS me up to the moon and I didn’t have any way to get back to earth so I just decide to wait. So I’m there for 10 hours when finally an alien comes over and asks if I need a ride home so I go and then I get dropped off at the WHITE HOUSE I was so excited but then the GIANT FAT UGLY ORANGE RAT came out running at me and he grabbed me and he kept chanting build a wall and so I try to get away and because he was so oily I slipped out. By the time I got home I felt sick so I went to the doctors and find out I have rabies so I’m conclusion DO NOT GET THIS APP 😁","userName":"😻yeah yeah ✨😁😁"}},{"id":"6177240280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:51:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Awfull","review":"This app took days to download and when it finally Did it wiped out all my pictures and some of my other apps. And when I finally opened it this big Cheeto with hair popped up and I was at the beach so a flock of pelicans started coming after me so I ran away, but then I stepped on a jellyfish that kind of looked like a chilly chess dog and got stung! So I fell on the floor and my phone slipped out of my hand! And guess what the pelicans came and took my phone! Anyhow someone had to pee on me because the pain was unbearable , but the only person there was my dad so I really didn't want him to PEE  on me! So we waited for medical help to come. But while waiting Justin Beaver was walking along the beach so I ran to say hi but it turns out it was just some nasty old pervert so I ran away but wile I was running away the pelicans where back and they where trueing to jump me! So after playing leap frog with them they left me alone but they took my wallet and sunglasses with them. So medical help came along and they had to amputate my foot so now I have one foot, no wallet, and an creepy Cheeto on my phone.","userName":"mason k burgess"}},{"id":"6176931228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i had such high expectations..","review":"ugh. i downloaded this app so i could see what our LGBTQ+ 🏳️\u200D🌈 supporting, anti-racism loving, totally not a r*p*st president was up to. i wanted to see ALL of his cute pictures of him and mrs. melanin🥰✨. unfortunately, after a WEEK of the app waiting to download, when i opened the app a KNIFE 🔪 –yes a knife– literally flew out of the screen and stabbed me forty-five times 🙄😒 how symbolic of mr. trump. another issue i had with the app was that it   did not have ANY of the movies promised to be featured in the app’s description, such as “finding donny” (my favorite film about the lost fish 🐠 who was trying to find its way home) or the new feature film “the silent majority.” (the trailer reminded me of when my 10 yr old cousin when her mom makes her get off of roblox before bedtime). i was SO devastated because i was looking forward to keeping up with the trumps, reserving tickets 🎫 for his concerts and rallies, and OWNING the stupid liberals 🧚\u200D♀️😌.  i really hope that mr. trump can fix all of these issues with his app! until then, i unfortunately have to give it a one star ⭐️ rating.","userName":"🧚\u200D♀️ gen z warrior"}},{"id":"6176141432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:47:28Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app STINKS","review":"It literally stinks. You would NOT BELIEVE the smell that immediately began to emit from my phone as soon as I downloaded this godforsaken  app. I downloaded it just before I went to bed and I was excited to wake up in the morning just to use it! But in the middle of the night (at 1:39 to be exact) that SMELL came. It was awful. I leapt out of bed and flew down the hall because the urge to vomit was so powerful. After sitting by the toilet, throwing up for what felt like hours, I eventually fell asleep by the toilet and I ended up being late for work! I got in my car- but I was so deprived of sleep and delirious from the smell (which was still coming from my phone) that I ended up in a terrible car incident. I never even made it to work :/   It’s a shame that I broke my dominant arm so I can’t even use the app if I wanted to. Even after all of this occurred, the smell was still there!!! I decided to delete the app, but the smell never left. My husband and kids have lost their sense of smell and I’m afraid it’s all because of this app. I would NOT recommend 🧚\u200D♂️💕✨🌸🌷🌺🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"CarenKarol"}}]}
