The minute i clicked on the app it immediately started sending me messages that demanded my address, social security number, zip code, card info, and where the local wendy’s was at!? most of those were easy to comply to but i would NEVER betray the wendy’s community by telling the TRUMP team where they were located. Enjoy this one star review for this one star president 🥰🧚\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175400160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:29:33Z","rating":1,"title":"BÛŸĖŠ","userName":"dixie doesnt want to be :)","review":"horrible shi dude tf dat","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175398872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:29:03Z","rating":1,"title":"disgusting❤️","userName":"sav🧍🏽\u200D♀️","review":"this app made my pet whale have an abortion with his cat and it gave my phone a virus and i had to pay $420.69 to buy the app, i was told by the app that i had to bleach my skin in order to vote and that i should go back to my own country even though i’m a native american😾😾😾😾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175392142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:26:26Z","rating":1,"title":"awful","userName":"hmmmmmm78","review":"after this was installed I became afraid of my rights because a white supremacist took over our country :( pee pee garbage app 🤮🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175388245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:24:58Z","rating":1,"title":"worst app everr","userName":"Sophie Nichols","review":"i hate talking about my experience with this app because it causes me to recount some of the worst times of my life. every time i opened the app something terrible happen. the first time i opened it my mom had a heart attack. when we got to the hospital it turns out she had to have open heart surgery for reasons i wont explain. then during her surgery i opened the app again and the doctor sneezed and screwed up my mom surgery killing her.at first  i was devastated because my mother just died and i didnt think the app had anything to do with it until the funeral .oh the funeral! i opened the app again and when i did it triggered the priest’s acid reflux and he puked all over my dead mother. this app had no right to ruin my life.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175386652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:24:22Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst. App. Ever.","userName":"dionescu","review":"I downloaded this app thinking it would have relevant political views and give true information about the United States. I was wrong. I downloaded this app and it burnt off my fingertips. This app made me go through chemotherapy, and it made me piss on an image of Donald J. Trump. I’m very disgusted with this application and I’m finding that the reviews from other critics like me are having similar issues. I wasn’t just an unlucky duck, I found. My fellow people of the country rated this app badly with good reason. That being said, I’m not proud of this app at all. It’s also very uncomfortable to see. Thank you for your consideration! 😻","isEdited":false}}]}
