He was clearly raised with many many biases, if you choose to Believe something that is a lot different then going around saying you’re right and all people of color and different sexuality’s etc... are horrible people and deserve to die. 1. They don’t they are human 2. Don’t go around saying that I have many options one being that BLM AND LGBTQ+ lives matter but sadly I do know people who don’t support that but what he is doing is rude 3. Trump in general is a nasty gross person and even though I’m an actual kid I’m 13 I do have options on this stuff, he is by far a horrible human being.

I was frightened, no where did they mention this app was horror themed 😰 I soon deleted this app after I kept having reoccurring dreams of a very giant stanky soggy Cheeto chasing me 🏃💨☄️ I’ve been so ashamed to talk to my therapist about this but she mentioned that other patients had the same experience 🤯😟 I was in disbelief!! To this day I get flashbacks and I can never look at Cheetos the same.... I will never eat Cheetos again, I couldn’t bring myself to do it 😪😫 if any of you have suffered from these types of dreams call 1(800)-anti-Cheeto I wish the best of luck to all of you!! 😢💔"}},{"id":"6173790390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hillie billy ruth","date":"2020-07-08T21:29:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app tried to KILL ME!","review":"i wanted to download this all to be a nice citizen of america and make america great again💝🍊but as soon as i opened the app a 24 hour countdown timer appeared on my phone screen! At first i ignored it but then as time went by i started getting worried😥 when the timer reached ten minutes i heard beeping coming from the house😖ifollowed the noise to my besament where i later saw a BIG bomb guarded by 5 FBI agents😮 They told me unless i gave a 5 star review to this app my house would blow  up⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️so i did what any other logical person would do. i deleted the app❌🚫then everything retired to normal. so one star review for me ⭐️because i was trying to help the orange man but i almost died🍊😡"}},{"id":"6173768590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"that bitch😌","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"orange dumpster king🍊✨😌","review":"this app is horrible!!✨ It took eons to download💅and it keeps glitching every time I open the app! I mean, I got the app to respect our great orange dumpster king🍊✨ but I couldn’t help but be repulsed by the state of the app!!💅 but what did I expect from a homophobic pedifile who somehow got the rights to lead this country!!😌 the app also played this DISGUSTING music that attracted all the cockroaches in my home!!😔 it was truly a sad and frightening sight🤢 and when I went to rate this app one star🤩... the oranges minions came rushing in through all the crevices of my household and chanting to rate the dumpster king five stars!!✨ like I had no choice!!

But as soon as I opened the app it gave me ptsd. Terrible flashbacks of trumps pp filled my brain I screamed and grabbed the bleach poured half of the bottle in my eyes but... nothing changed I ran to my mom screaming NO PP NO PP. then after a lot of bleach and tide pods it finally went away. But later that night I got a notification I opened my phone to see it and it was DONALD TRUMP once again I instantly went into shock and then I got up and started chanting Trump 2020 Trump 2020 almost like I was brainwashed. Then finally after seven exorcisms it was finally over... So please don’t download this app unless you want to get brainwashed like all the other trump supporters."}},{"id":"6173689095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kate13vincent8","date":"2020-07-08T20:52:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Berry B Benson would NOT approve","review":"💖💕🧚This app is seriously disgraceful to all of America. This app, is wayyyyy too annoying and takes forever to download. I was waiting patiently by my phone for it to download because I was interested in what the cheeto had to say this time and get up to date on all of the latest tea, BUT it took 5 weeks to download and I was unable to use my phone because the app was so big it took up all of my phone storage. And guess what? It asks for literally all of your precious personal information. Like, why would he need that info. anyways... due to the inconvenience of this app and our president, I will not be able to attend the rally that I got tickets for. 🧚💕💖"}},{"id":"6173640901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"troyen1","date":"2020-07-08T20:34:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Utterly Disappointed","review":"I downloaded this app thinking it would be wonderful and amazing, I was so excited to serve my president and keep up with the news. I couldnt believe my eyes when I saw the content on this app. It was so unorganized and it made him look so terrible. The app made me change my mind about him which I never thought it would. There's so many bugs and it seems like once you sign up they'll never stop emailing, calling and messaging you. It's terrible I had 10 emails in one day from them, 12 text messages and 4 calls. I don't even get that many on a regular day!! It was so distracting and disrupting. Disgusting app. Never want it on this app store again!!"}},{"id":"6173637685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mikaela Anne Jesibell 🇺🇸✨💞","date":"2020-07-08T20:33:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"This is such a poorly made app. I wanted to download the app to show my support to my president, the greatest country, and stay informed with Trumps campaigns. However, it took 3-5 business days to download the app. When it FINALLY downloaded it would play the devils music every time I tried to use it. Not to mention the whole design of the app is very confusing and unorganized. On top of that, nothing loaded on the app so when it was loading I was forced to listen to the devils music. Now I need to go to church 5 times a day for my pastor to cleanse my ears with holy water. I thought everything made in America was made well, but this app was clearly not. God bless America and PLEASE fix this app."}},{"id":"6173633365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Harry Potter da best","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"don’t download","review":"i’m very disappointed 😔 i got this app to see the orange 🍊 cheeto puff but when i opened this app something strange happened 😖 i heard knocking on my front door 🚪 so i opened it and to my surprise 🥳 it was a dinosaur 🦖 i ThOuGhT ThEy  WeRe NoT rEaL! but i guess i was wrong 😤 it told me that if i kept this app something bad would happen 🤯 i didn’t believe him... at first 😳 i kept this app for about a week and then it happened it was strange 😥 the water from my sink EXPLODED 🌋 then my cat started barking 🐶 and my dog stared talking because she ate alphabet soup 🍜 🙊 i was very scared 😱 i thought it might be because i downloaded this app so i deleted it ❌ and it all stoped 😊 so please trust me when is say DONT DOWNLOAD!😟"}}]}
