ITS SO ANNOYING!! Didnâ€™t realize my info was going to be sold for lousy telemarketing!!!!! They also keep sending me text messages, might have to block them somehow or get a new phone #.

Itâ€™s truly not worth anyoneâ€™s time, itâ€™s takes forever to download, but itâ€™s very quick to remove âœ¨. When I opened the app it physically hurt my soul, and no one should have to go through that ðŸ˜”. Looking at what the hot Cheeto has to offer is truly damaging to the eyes, and brainwashes civilizations. So please spare yourself while you have a chance. âœ¨ðŸ¤ª","date":"2020-07-10T05:27:23Z","userName":"chicken_strips77","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179607446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried to download this app exactly 69 days ago at 4:20 and it just downloaded. I want to be informed on what our president is doing for us, but it asked to be able to track my location and I thought nothing of it, our president wouldnâ€™t put the straight white peoples of America into harms! But I noticed that someone was following me the very next day! I am frightened that MY president would hurt me! \n\nYeah, thatâ€™s all true. But actually he is a maniacal jerk! He took away trans peopleâ€™s health care, wants to make it so LGBTQ+ people canâ€™t adopt, when they can get children a home! Iâ€™m afraid for what the USA is going to see if he wins again.","date":"2020-07-10T05:27:23Z","userName":"Misiletoe","title":"Critical information","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179607261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"honestly i just donâ€™t like him, 25 rape allegations and human trafficking ? please sir, STEP DOWNNN","date":"2020-07-10T05:27:19Z","userName":"hughehughe","title":"ASS","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179607049","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Andrew Yang 2020","date":"2020-07-10T05:27:15Z","userName":"SKIBunyard","title":"Trash","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179606955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Before downloading this app I was a nice, open-minded person.
