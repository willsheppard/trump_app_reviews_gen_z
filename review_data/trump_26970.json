I Karen would like to speak to its mother to ask her to be very pro abortion specifically around the time the cheeto has been born 😡😡.

Why?? Because me having to look at TruMp first thing when opening the app is LAVA to my eyes. Absolutely destroyed my eyes. I 10/10 DONT recommend!!!

Every time I opened it, it would close down again. It did the same for my brother who said that it was Trumps way of telling us that we weren’t good enough for the nation. So I guess my vote will go to someone who’s app actually works.

I was with my kids. He was just smiling and it kept repeating, “snowflake, Trump 2020” it was terrifying and loud. I quickly deleted it, and my poor kids were in tears.

This is insane. Absolutely insane. I cannot stand the audacity. I entered into the app and my phone started smelling so bad... like a pig. And soon, i saw some CHEETO on my screen? A cheeto?

I let my child go on this app to see our president and the first thing that popped up was a nude photo of the entire Trump family. I realize that this app 17+, but that’s no reason for there to be nude photos.

Just like his presidency!!! THE APP IS JUST GOD AWFUL, I open it just too see an obese Cheeto pumping his fist like he’s rocky or something. the aesthetic appeal is NOT there, I honestly thought the designers of this app would know that fake tan is SOOOOO last year, but oh well I guess boomers are late to the trend 🥱🥱 anyways worst app ever, enough said. 😘"}}]}
