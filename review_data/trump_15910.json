This app slowed down the internet connection in my entire house! It took too long to download, and it kept glitching. As soon as I downloaded the app, my phone has been pressing random buttons on the screen without me pressing it. THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!! Do not download it. It also gave me a virus AND CRACKED MY SCREEN. I didn’t think that was possible.","title":"🧚💕🧚💞","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175919888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:36:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"follow lawnuhlol on tiktok","review":"THE WORST APP I'VE EVER DOWNLOADED. not only did it make my phone crash several times, it literally shut the whole phone down after trying to open it again and again and again. like oh my god, seriously!? how bad can your app be that it cant even open and stops the entire phone from functioning!! in conclusion, dont waste your time downloading this ❤️","title":"oh my god","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175889705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:25:55Z","rating":1,"userName":"emily 😿🧚🏽\u200D♀️","review":"I was just downloading the app and minding my business it took a long time (1 minute) good thing I had my music. 🎵anyways when I clicked on it my phone exploded.

I just wanted an app where I could support my amazing and truthful president. And the app isn’t even that good. I was barely able to exit the app because of all the pop ups. Honestly just the worst app out there 😡 honestly I’ve always wanted my 🌮 to get pounded by carrot man, but this app has changed my mind. -5/10 🤬🤬🤬 mr cheetoh u messed up owU","title":"Eww trash app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175707225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:14Z","rating":1,"userName":"Buppy23","review":"During its campaign trail, this app held rallies where it spewed racism and hatred, and for some reason that resonated with people. Even though this app lost the popular vote, it somehow became President. This app has brought great shame upon the nation, hurting anyone who isn’t a rich white man. This app has made America into a laughing stock and sent our nation backwards in terms of progress. If I could give negative stars to this app, I would.","title":"Embarrassing","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175676320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:13:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kat_soccer101","review":"I wasn’t able to use the app for some reason and I tried to figure out why, and they i realized that it’s only got racist and homophobic people so that makes sense! At first I was kind of bummed out but then I realized “why would I want to support a sexist dictator who also happens to be a rapist?!” Ya not for me🙂 Anyway if u r reading this have a great day, unless u support trump then I hope u have a terrible day! VOTE BIDEN THANKS","title":"For racist ppl only","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175661350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:08:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"Janete Lilpul","review":"I am truly disgusted by this app oh my god. It was so horrible and took a month to download. It was super laggy and hard to read. I wish I could give it 0 starts because that is what it deserves. ALSO, I wanted everyone to be aware that this app lures children into a sex trafficking ring. It is filled by sexual predators as well as Trump! I think we all know he is part of the sex ring already though. So disgusted! 😔","title":"APPLE NEEDS TO DELET THIS APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175654042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:06:04Z","rating":1,"userName":"calyster oyster","review":"The delete button has never looked so sexy and fiine😩 I just wanted to tap it so hard😍 I new trump would kill me but I couldn’t resist temptation 💋 as I got my finger ready for the most satisfying experience I’ll ever have🤩 I started smiling as big as I ever have🥺 as I pressed my finger against the screen to press the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen the hardest I ever have❤️ I was the happiest person in America🍆😘","title":"My fantasy🤫","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175609726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:50:01Z","rating":1,"userName":"bob5363738","review":"I was so excited to finally get this app but it was so slow it was like it was built in the 1950s or something! It also never asked for my consent on a lot of the notification options. I am very disappointed and wish I could give zero stars! Maybe they should try to be a little more progressive and hire educated individuals to build their app.","title":"Do not download!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175538561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:23:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"x nsns","review":"Hi, my name is Karen and I fully support my AMAZING president. However, I do not find this app tasteful on behalf of the fact it took us most of my space and made my phone crash. Not only that, this app has crash multiple times and never gave me a receipt when I donated $100 to Trump... I hope you fix this app or rather take it down... I still support Trump for 2020! #womenfortrump2020.","title":"Unbelievable... Worst app ever!","isEdited":false}}]}
