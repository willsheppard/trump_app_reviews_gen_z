And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it. I am old now Frodo. I’m not the same hobbit I once was. I think it is time for you to know what really happened. \n[old Bilbo begins writing about his adventures] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] It began long ago in a land far away to the East. The like of which you will not find in the world today. \n[cut to map showing the city of Dale] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] There was the city of Dale. Its markets known far and wide, full of the bounties of vine and vale, peaceful and prosperous. For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom in Middle-Earth, Erebor. Stronghold of Thror, king under the mountain. The mightiest of the dwarf lords. Thror ruled with utter surety, never doubting his house would endure, for his line lay secure in the lives of his son and grandson. Ah, Frodo. Erebor. Built deep within the mountain itself, the beauty of this fortress city was legend. Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems hewn from rock, and in great seams of gold running like rivers through stone. The skill of the dwarves was unequaled. Fashioning objects of great beauty, out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Ever they delved deeper down into the dark, and that is where they found it. The heart of the mountain, the Arkenstone. Thror named it the king’s jewel. He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine. All would pay homage to him. Even the great Elven king, Thranduil. But the years of peace and plenty were not to last. Slowly the days turned sour, and the watchful nights closed in. \n[Thorin watches his father, Thror growing obsessed with the gold he’s gathered in his castle] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Thror’s love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to grow within him. It was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives bad things will follow. The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane, coming down from the North. The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in the hot dry wind. \nThorin: Balin, sound the alarm. Call out the guards, do it now! \nBalin: What is it? \nThorin: Dragon. \n[Thorin turns, runs inside and shouts out the warning] \nThorin: Dragon! \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] He was a Firedrake from the North. \n[Smaug starts attacking Erebor by breathing fire everywhere] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Smaug had come! \n[Smaug starts destroying the city of Dale] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Such wanton death was dealt that day, for this city of men was nothing to Smaug. His eye was set on another prize. For dragons covet gold with a dark and fierce desire. \n[as Smaug starts attacking Erebor, Thror takes the Arkenstone and makes a run for it, then he sees Smaug finding all the hidden gold] \nThror: No! \n[Thorin finds Thror and grabs a hold of him, dragging him away from the scene] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Erebor was lost. For a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives. \n[as everyone left in Erebor is making a run for it] \nThorin: Run for your lives! \n[to the Elves who are watching from a distance] \nThorin: Help us! \n[Thranduil does nothing] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon. No help came from the Elves that day. Nor any day since. \n[Thorin watches in anger as the Elves leave] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness. The once mighty people brought low. The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it, laboring in the villages of men. But always, he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon, the trees like torches blazing bright, where he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and a city turn to ash. And he never forgave, and he never forgot. \n[back to old Bilbo in Bag End continuing to write his story] \nOld Bilbo: [voice over] That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. For quite by chance, and the will of a wizard, fate decided I would become part of this tale. It began…well, it began as you might expect. In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty wet hole full of worms and oozy smells. This was a hobbit hole. And that means good food, a warm hearth, and all the comforts of home.","userName":"Crossy road14","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:55:40Z","title":"trashy app, enjoy the hobbit script :D","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178831120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He 👨\u200D🦰 has no 🙅🏾\u200D♀️ lips 👄 how 💁🏾\u200D♀️ will he 👨\u200D🦰 get a kiss kiss 💋 very ugly 🤢👎🏾 no 🙅🏾\u200D♀️ kiss 💋 for him 👨\u200D🦰 HAHAHAHAHAH😹😹🤣🤣😹😼","userName":"conservativecaca❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:53:15Z","title":"This app is kaka ❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178743649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"he said this ain’t it.","userName":"moomooluvr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:19:32Z","title":"chief called.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178818865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"5 STARS NO DOIBT ABOUT IT ALSO ALL BAD REVIEWS ARE CHILDREN FOR GOD SAKE","userName":"Pestin","rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T00:48:32Z","title":"YOU MUST GET THIS APP!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178698741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"worst app i’ve ever had","userName":"yessriruur","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:02:10Z","title":"ew","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178657838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was majorly disappointing, sad.","userName":"Reesie-the-awesome","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:46:15Z","title":"really bad app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178651031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"heck no!!","userName":"Game_tester786","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:43:37Z","title":"this app is awful","isEdited":false}}]}
