Unfortunately my sister was next to me when this happened and saw my screen before I could turn off my phone. She is only 12. Her screams were unlike anything I had ever heard. While running out of the room with her eyes closed, tears streaming down her face, she ran right into my grandmothers china cabinet and broke every single one of the dishes. My poor grandmother who worked so hard to preserve these precious pieces of family history, fainted immediately. When she collapsed she landed on my dog, spraining his hind leg. My parents are making me pay for the China, my dogs vet bills, and both my grandma’s and sisters therapy. To afford all of this I’m working three jobs and am beyond stressed. I have been taking it out on my family whom I resent for blaming me for one small mistake. I’m distraught from the image of the apricot too! But they don’t think of that. My life’s gone to hell, my family can’t be in the same room anymore and my dog can’t walk. I hate this app."}},{"id":"6174307529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE !","date":"2020-07-09T00:40:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bfbfudhfd","review":"This app is DISGUSTING! Donald dump is a racist UGLY orange head ! He judges and hates others because of the colour of their skin. First off , they can’t even help that . Second, your supporters have nothing good to say about you their only comeback is “tRuMp 2020” no. I hope you lose because me as a white person I HATE seeing people of colour getting treated differently than I am. We are all equal even if we aren’t the same skin colour! And also your spray tan is HORRIFYING 🤢🤢.. I cant STAND you . I have friends that aren’t white and I don’t have a problem with that . I treat them all the same . On the other hand you DONT ! And why don’t you like the LGTBQ+ community?! NO REASON. We love who we love and that’s that . If you were married to a man and got hated on just because your happy with the same gender how would you feel ? Exactly, you wouldn’t like it . So stop . You say “mAkE aMeRiCa gReAt aGaIn” but have you seen our country right now ? Apparently not. The first thing you do is hide in a bunker 😭! That’s hilarious🤣, you are a horrible president and need to stop judging and hating people because they like the same sex or their skin colour . HORRIBLE APP AND HORRIBLE PRESIDENT."}},{"id":"6174152757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"😀ya","date":"2020-07-08T23:44:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"goose honk honk","review":"me 👁👅👁 and my dog 🐶 were so excited 😆 to upload this juicy 🤤FAT 🙈orange 🍊 app!!!!!!!!!!!! but sadly when it opened, it spoke english and not american😕 luckily 🍀😀 i am cultured 🦕 and speak american🇵🇷, english🥫, and even canadian 🇯🇵! it started playing something like “four in her💕 four in her💕 four in her💕” 😰 and then it started to get worse 😪 my dog 🐕 started singing 🎤 \n\n“ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃ” AND THEN the cheeto 🦧 puff 🐁 himself rose up from the 😺 of my dog! i started my car 🚙 and drove away and fast 💨 as i could😵 cheeto puff started a strange ritual 👹 he said: “⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽” I started to sob 😭 i was so scared 😟 that i sh💩t myself! i went to the nearest walmart to clean 🧼 my fat booty 🍑 while i was sitting on the 🚽, cheeto puff 😤 broke in and stole my wallet! i teleported back to my house 🏡 to see 👀 what’s going on. there was an orange 🍊 as my dogs 🐶 head 😫😖 he started saying “vote for 🍊 ! vote for 🍊!” i deleted the app after this, but it has caused me explosive 💋diarrhea🦶from all the trauma. do not recommend. i am now living under the white ⚪️ house 🏠 shhhh 🤫 🧚🏼\u200D♀️ ✨🌹"}},{"id":"6173375391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The god of fluffy Chito’s","date":"2020-07-08T19:03:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤡👺👹💩💀😈👽👾👺🤮","review":"I downloaded this app and it took me over five days😖😴.

Every time it turned back on it showed a picture of our✨ chito lord✨. When I open the app it played this music called 🌹bust down Tatiana🌹 and made all the oranges 🍊 in my house dance around me.

It’s a “terrible, horrible, no good, very bad” app. It supports everything that’s wrong with the country and it should be banned. I mean, what other president has had an app for himself?? Also, Trumps a racist, sexist, fascist, misogynistic terrorist. If you vote for him you’re voting against your rights, and against the future of America. Right now the U.S. has the highest amount of coronavirus cases. I’m sure you’re happy we’re first place in something, but that actually is bad. He’s a terrorist in the way he treats the people of this country. America is NOT made up of white people, but people from all cultures, skin colors, and countries. Also when you say, “go back to your country” It applies to you whites too. If we said that to you, 50% of you would go to Ireland, 10% to France, 20% to Italy, and God knows where else. I mean this country is BUILT off the backs of all the people white people took advantage of. Black people MADE THIS COUNTRY. WHITE PEOPLE ENSLAVED THEM. WITHOUT MEXICANS THIS COUNTRY WOULDN'T HAVE ITS HISTORY. WITHOUT ASIANS THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE BEHIND JN EVERYTHING. WITHOUT MUSLIMS, THIS COUNTRY WOULD. BE. NOTHING.\n\n-A teen who knows more than you"}},{"id":"6176797690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WARNING!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","date":"2020-07-09T13:51:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🖤💜🌬🌊","review":"So I downloaded this app because why wouldn’t I download something that’s supports this fabulous president? Throughout using the app I started to get really really cold. I thought it was the vibes coming from the phone so I closed the app. I felt this way for days and I would break out into cold sweats. I was practically bedridden. Turns out I had a very high fever, to the point my mother was worried. On my way to the emergency room every thing outside started to look RED. The sky, the trees, the road, the car, even my tears were red. And it started to feel like there was something creeping into my thoughts. Just awful racist, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobic thoughts started to crawl into my mind. Which is weird because I’m black, bi, and a woman who loves learning about other cultures and traveling. Even being in the same space as my own loving mother started to gross me out. I was in the hospital for FIVR DAYS as they tried to find out what was wrong with me. Every time I opened the app the red vision would get worse and the thoughts would intensify, which is weird because the president definitely isn’t any of those awful things\nHmm🧐🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨💕"}},{"id":"6176737764","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Such HIGH HOPES 😤😖😭","date":"2020-07-09T13:35:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"biden4evur","review":"I had such HIGH HOPES for this app. It downloaded so quickly so I could immediately get into it and sign up for TEXT MESSAGES from him. But doesn’t trump know I’m in a monogamous relationship? 😫 I signed up anyway because we MUST support the greatest cheeto of a president we have ever had EVER. Then my name, birthday, SSN, home address, my first born child’s credentials, the color of my underwear, ANYthjng you could think of appeared on the home screen of the app? How does he KNOW 😞?? When I agreed to sign my life away to the devil I didn’t realize I was also giving access to everything I owned 😱. This app ruined my life. It hacked my bank account and stole all my money. Because it has my SSN it opened 669 credit cards in my name and now I’m 4billion$ in debt. I don’t even make $1 a month! My husband has left me, my boyfriend has taken the kids, my dog took my car, and there’s been a hit put on me by the Russian mafia. My life is falling apart all because of this APP. I thought the PRESIDENT was supposed to be GREAT. How could HE LET THIS HAPPENED TO MEE?!?!?!? Anyway I don’t recommend this app unless you want everything as you know it to be destroyed. ✨ ✨ 🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️ ✨ ✨"}},{"id":"6174140924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Never again","date":"2020-07-08T23:40:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ikori BendyStraw","review":"When I first opened the app I saw this- orange looking thing. Like some Cheeto dipped in nacho cheese. But anyway, the app asked for my location yesterday and I unknowingly said yes. I woke up this morning and my Eastern Automated Attack  Pigeon was missing. As well as my Dinosaur. After a while of crying about that I go to my fridge and see a note from the same guy who had the opening picture on the app. It said “look out your window”. So I did. My dinosaur was strapped to my mailbox. Scary. I took a nap later that evening. When I woke up I got a notification that said “Allow —- App to access your contacts?” I said yes. The next day all of my contacts were missing. And instead we’re replaced with new phone numbers. I called them. They each had the same voice mail “Sorry I’m getting a spray tan right now, it’s going to be huge. Call me after my vacation to cHyheeNAugh”. Then the worst of the worst happened. I got a notification saying “You won a ticket to the next rally”. I screamed, cried, and finally deleted the app. Never again. Wouldn’t recommend unless you want your prize bird stolen. I miss Josè. RIP my robotic feathered friend. Don’t download.😡"}},{"id":"6173644915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do not recommend!👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T20:36:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ayeviar","review":"So I got this app because I saw all of the 𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑠-✨😾😿 I mean trump supporters, downloading it and leaving great reviews! ☺️🌸✨🌙 now I have raised my whole family 😈👀😰including my hamster, fish and dog to be a trump supporter!😿☺️😑👌 so I opened the app and my hamster was on my shoulder at the time, i opened the app and it started spraying orange spray tan🙀🙀 at me and my hamster! 😿😰🙀 he ended up going blind because of it! 🙀😒💝 we had to put him down 😿😿😰😰🙀because he ate rat poison thinking it was his food! 😿😿😿so then after I reopened the app it started playing a noise that only my dog could hear,😄😶😾 it bursted her eardrums and she went rabid and attacked my kids causing one of them to pass away.🙀🙀😿😰😰 my husband had to shoot the dog to get her to stop.👁👄👁😒😭 then lastly I opened it one more time!
