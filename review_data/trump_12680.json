I couldn’t stop throwing up for weeks and I felt really bad. It was like a virus or something 🙄. Anyways this is the worst app I have ever downloaded and HAD to delete it IMMEDIATELY. Not to mention but he’s like a racist and a rapist but like yea people don’t care about that🧚🏻\u200D♀️.

I tried seeing if it was my iPhone connection but I had full bars and I live right next to a cell tower. I tried using other apps and they seemed to work just fine but this app kept loading and crashing back up again. Very low budget app, could have made it work better.","userName":"lsteps","isEdited":false,"title":"nothing would load"}},{"id":"6177991054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:41:01Z","rating":1,"review":"I hate this app so much because the app doesn’t even work. I tried opening it and I just smelled racism and disrespectfulness I was like EWWW. Idk I also saw that the app glitched a couple of times. I don’t like this app at all it needs to be deleted and I can’t wait til that happens. I think it was be very helpful if the app was deleted cause this app takes SOOO much room on my phone it’s annoying. I’m gonna go delete this app now.","userName":"nun of ya business 😘","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible"}},{"id":"6177783244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:35:45Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because it promised me that if I paid them I would become the queen herself raini Rodriguez overnight.I filled out all my info and then went to sleep ready to become a skinny queen, but when I woke up nothing changed and I looked like a rat. I thought the side effects would wear off but I still look the same. Anyways do not download this app because they will scam you and your money will be gone forever","userName":"Cami CS","isEdited":false,"title":"😡🐜😡🐜😡"}},{"id":"6177619162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:44:56Z","rating":1,"review":"THIS APP IS THE WORST ON THE APP STORE!! i downloaded this app it completely crashed my phone had to get another. it puts a tracker on your phone completely always knows where you are even if you deny it. they don’t care about what your opinion is. they choose for you. before i went out to get my new phone because this app crashed it somebody was outside of my house trying to kill me because of this app. do not download it.","userName":"S.A09","isEdited":false,"title":"IT KILLED ME!!!!"}},{"id":"6177577160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:31:29Z","rating":1,"review":"When I first tried to download this app, it took ten minutes to even start downloading. I figured it must be my WiFi, and moved on. However, ever since it has just been running incredibly slow. I guess I can’t blame it, look who’s name is on it. I’ve been staring at a spinning T for fifteen minutes waiting for this thing to load. \n\nIn short, his app runs about as well as the country.  🤷\u200D♀️","userName":"oompa loompa body a$s b¡tch","isEdited":false,"title":"Incredible.....y slow"}},{"id":"6177541234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:20:05Z","rating":1,"review":"It took over 40 hours to download! and not only that when it did finally download it wouldnt even open. it took 2 hours to get it to open and the first thing i saw was a ugly cheeto😩 i somehow managed to get it off my screen but it kept apearing. then a text popped up saying \"hey sexy\" which is very inappropriate! i told him to leave me alone but he said he will come find me! someone tell his wife to come get her cheeto please😩😭","userName":"Peachy_Jiminie","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!"}},{"id":"6177481011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:01:29Z","rating":1,"review":"Genuinely the worst app i’ve ever downloaded. Besides the fact that you are forced to look at trumps disgustingly ugly orange face, this app takes forever to load, took days to download, kept logging me out, kept shutting down periodically. overall i’d give it 0/5 if i could. All this to say, i’d be embarrassed by the president solely because of this app, if it weren’t for how racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, (the list goes on for miles) he is.","userName":"hahdheha77","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is awful"}},{"id":"6177365398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:27:15Z","rating":1,"review":"I had extremely high hopes for this app. I mean, it’s made to support our amazing, fair, and loving president. He’s done absolutely nothing wrong and he constantly helps others. He is not racist or misogynistic. When I opened this app, it started flashing and made me have an epileptic seizure. That is not okay. I was hospitalized. I tried opening it again and a ton of ads started coming up for inappropriate adult sites. That is unacceptable. In conclusion, do not download. EVER.","userName":"mynameiskarensmithandihategenz","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE"}}]}
