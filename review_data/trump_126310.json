So we r here with the one and only Cardi B. I just wanna say this app is just as or lower than the quality of Cardi music. Anyways this app is so bad. I let my kid have it and she instantly lost her virginity. BE CAREFUL. If ur kid is younger than 18 and even hears the VERY NAME OF THIS APP. Then he or she might be booked to a ticket to see Donald trump and get sexually harassed. Thank you and that is it. Que the outdo music. 🎶I SAID I LIKE IT LIKE THAT.

This app is absolutely horrible, I downloaded it in hopes I could support my beloved president. But instead I was greeted with a horrendous, mockery of modern day media. I opened it an the first thing I saw was joe Biden propaganda asking me to vote for him. Why would I do this in a thousand years, I would NEVER want that!!!!! Don’t even get me started on how long it took to download, by the time it was done I completely forgot I wanted to downloaded it in the first place.it It keeps crashing and wouldn’t work for more than two minutes in a row. I wouldn’t be surprised if it downloaded viruses. Over all I am extremely disappointed I expected more from my dear leader. All I have to say is NO❤️.","title":"No❤️","userName":"barry rump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:15:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178425912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"look👀at☝️me😻its🤑timmy t🥵 boutta🤪hit👊em👄with🐗the👿ZTEST😟lets👫do✍️a🦶problem📝let🤖us🤝see🌊the💥probability📈you 😑seeing😲me😍on👋tv🖥\n1.0.0.0💵trillion🤑percent👽imma👻statistical🤔wonder😈a👊🏻statistical💫gem💎 \n1🥇in👉🏼a📎zillion💵bouta 🦴net🥅 a💃million💵 fruity🍇colors🎨 on🔛 these🎢numbers#️⃣call☎️me 🤷🏻\u200D♀️a 🍨 chameleon🦎\n✋👁👄👁✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱✋👁👄👁✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱😁𝘺𝘶𝘱✋👁👄👁\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱🤟👁👄👁\nms.lawton🖐🏼ms.lawton✋🏼ms.lawton🤚🏼ms.lawton👐🏼\n✋👁👄👁✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱✋👁👄👁✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱😁𝘺𝘶𝘱✋👁👄👁\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC✋statistics📖𝘺𝘶𝘱🤟👁👄👁\nms.lawton🖐🏼ms.lawton✋🏼ms.lawton🤚🏼ms.lawton👐🏼","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!","userName":"jdnsakamkajaka","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:15:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178425214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2.
