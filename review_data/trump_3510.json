I went to open the app and the first it did was try to get my personal information! Why is that necessary? Why is the president trying to get my information when he should be focusing on governing the country? Not the mention the extremely bad tension that I got in my room as soon as I opened the app. When the app finally downloaded my phone froze for I don’t know how many days! I expected better from someone who is supposed to “Make America Great Again” as he calls it. This is outrageous! I don’t recommend this app to anyone. It’s is a complete waste of time and does nothing more then spread propaganda to make himself look good. Obama 2020!"}},{"id":"6175163509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"vanakejke","date":"2020-07-09T05:00:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Before I downloaded this app my phone was fine. After downloading app I realized Santa stopped coming to chimney. It was so Horrible. There was NO PRESENTS under the Christmas tree either. This app ruined Christmas. Not only that but my phone 🤮kept getting weird glitches and it kept saying such inappropriate things. 🤢This old weird Cheeto appeared on my screen out of no where!!!! I have a Samsung fridge and it started appearing on there to even when I was not using the app. 🧚🏼\u200D♂️❤️He’s a baddie ahaha but the “bad” is silent.🧚🏽💅🏽💩Unless you want to be scarred for life and scared of every move you make then I do not recommend downloading this app. It is a waste of time.

So then my plant grew 50 arms and tried to pull me but girl I was drowning in there. So then a T-REX pops out of the microwave and literally GRABBED me with their little witty arms. I survived but I didn’t come out the same. So if you didn’t know I’m half turtle half lasagna, so I’m walking down the street and everybody’s following me for some reason so then I try to run and I was going 2 miles per hour FEW I was like the flash I lost them so quick. But yeah I went to the supermarket and I forgot why do I need to go to the supermarket when I’m never hungry I’m made out of lasagna. Seriously sometimes I think I don’t have a brain.

After a week of this, I had to delete the app🧚\u200D♀️. I thought it would be over after that, but soon my cell phone and house phone were blowing up with messages from telemarketers, as well as the trump administration🍤. I refused to answer the phone calls and eventually, I had to move and live off the grid. I thought that I would be safe after that, but the app found a way to advertise the trump campaign through my nightmares👁👄👁. Downloading this app was a mistake that cost me my SANITY and FREE WILL. Don’t download. 🐝🐝"}},{"id":"6174762921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful Horrible App!!","rating":1,"userName":"Secret 😙","date":"2020-07-09T02:56:01Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is one of the worst apps I have ever used in my life! When I was on my way to sonic this app made an alien come and take my car!! I just wanted to use my free coupon to get a medium vanilla root beer. Instead of getting my drink I was taken into space and experimented on!! I now suffer from ptsd thanks to this app! My poor dog was left at home for a month without me and she suffers from separation anxiety! Thank goodness my brother noticed I was gone and fed my poor dog Bella! She could have died! It’s all because this app made aliens kidnap me!!! If I could give this app less then 1 star I would! This app is awful, so for anyone thinking about downloading it...DON’T!!!! and i rest my case 😙✌🏼"}},{"id":"6174744576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy","rating":1,"userName":"anya.laughter","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:28Z","isEdited":false,"review":"when i first opened this app, i was greeted by a BRIGHT ORANGE CHEETO LOOKING FIGURE. my eyes could not take it, i’m pretty sure i was looking at a monster. then my app glitched out and took me back to the homescreen. i tried to go back in and then my phone started talking. donald trump started talking and he called me a sl*t!!! i was so offended. i tried restarting the app but each time i came back in he would call me a racial slur 😪😪. i put my phone down for an hour and when i came back there was a dragon sitting by my phone eating my little brother. i blame the app. i would really expect better from our president. definitely giving a one star.
