When I downloaded this app all my other apps started glitching. Then I tried to delete it but the app wouldn’t go away, weird right? Then when my mom checked my phone I got in severe trouble for having this app and my parents are now fighting and I just broke my foot. So it’s safe to say that good things do NOT come from this app 🤮TRASH!!!!","userName":"the name game Judy","rating":1,"title":"Worst app in app history"}},{"id":"6173602911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:21:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"For all the trump supporters saying that trump is a good president we’ll think again because first he actually raped a 13 or 12 year old girl I don’t know how because he has a Cheeto small di$k second, he is transphobic and homophobic he promised to help the LGBTQ+ community but never did, third he is RACIST he has said some hurtful and racist words on his Twitter account, Fourth he is STUPID he literally made a “vaccine” for COVID-19 that made other people DIE, I rest my case 🌸🌝🧚✨","userName":"ThicBar","rating":1,"title":"Trump is a racist and homophobic man 🧚✨🌸"}},{"id":"6173589365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Writing this review because I saw someone say that it’s just kids who are writing bad reviews well hello, it’s me, an adult. And guess what? The “kids” are right. This app is absolute hate filled garbage. That is all. Thank you. Also want to say that yes Trump is trying to ban Tik Tok (which is a far superior app) not because of the Chinese government but because of those same “kids” y’all look down on. Say what you want but they are changing the world.","userName":"Purple Tom and Ben","rating":1,"title":"The worst app"}},{"id":"6173585814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:15:23Z","isEdited":false,"review":"the app took almost a month to download and it kept asking me personal questions that i didn’t want to answer and when i didn’t answer them the secret society showed up in my house and started grabbing me, they took me into a van and brought  me to the white house. when they took my blindfold off donald trump was staring right at me, then he started to abuse me but lucky barron trump was there to save me and took me back home 🥰 THANK YOU barron💖","userName":"trump2020 but on a grave","rating":1,"title":"TRUMP never"}},{"id":"6173581497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ugh where do I start?

I hate to see an unprofessional, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, and overall terrible president try to continue to run again for a second election. Voting for him in the first place was a huge mistake for the american society. Trump has not had enough political experience in order to become president, keep him in the acting industry and out of the office.","userName":"kathy.romero","rating":1,"title":"Worst App I’ve Ever Downloaded"}},{"id":"6173527575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:55:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app took 2 days to download and when it finally did every time i pressed the app my phone would completely turn off. i was so confused that i clicked on it about 3 times and it fried the whole phone! i just got the iphone 11 and that’s 1000 dollars down drain.  this is the worst app ever and i bet they do this kinda stuff to get people out of there money. you have enough trump quit being greedy.","userName":"F@!$ Trump","rating":1,"title":"OH MY GOD!!!!"}},{"id":"6173527394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:55:29Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was just trying to get this app to support our great racist President🧚🧚 but when I got it, it took three days to download and then I went on the app and it started to ask me weird questions like what my family’s names where, and my phone number, and asking where I live 🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️and I did not like that then it started to glitch me out and broke my phone so now I had to get a new one😡😡😡😡😡😡🖕🖕🖕 DO NOT GET THIS APP IT WILL BRAK YOUR PHONE AND MAKE YOU HAVE TO GET A NEW ONE","userName":"trump 2020🖕🖕🖕🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️😤","rating":1,"title":"😤😤😤"}},{"id":"6173497967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I hate the app as much as the president.
