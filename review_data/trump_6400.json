My phone would shut off and it would jump to my camera app and start recording. I had high hopes for this this app as it came from our outstanding president of America ✨💞 although I am very disappointed in the outcome of this experience. You would think a man of his orangeacity would come up with something of much better quality. This app did not fail ✨🧚\u200D♀️ to disappoint."}},{"id":"6173644758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"558Soapjar","date":"2020-07-08T20:36:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app","review":"I tried to download the app but it took 3 weeks to download???!??!! After I waited the 3 weeks for the app to download, I entered it. Once I entered my screen froze and then it asked for my email. The colors inside the app burned my eyeballs and nearly made me go blind. Once I was able to continue further into the app, I came across an ad for Cheeto puffs, except it was one Cheeto, it was extremely dusted, and it looked disgusting. My cousin had the app and saw the Cheeto puff ad. They bought the Cheetos irl and died from them. This is literally the worst app ever! This review is for my cousin!"}},{"id":"6173587560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Yoongi's girl","date":"2020-07-08T20:15:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Stan BTS 👁👄👁","review":"I downloaded this app to support our President. And it took 6 hours to download. Then when I was finally able to get in the app I heard a crash from my basement. I proceeded to check it out and when I did I saw a trump flag.🏳️ I don’t own any because I am a smart human being. Therefore I was scared. Then when I went back into my room I saw that 2 of my BTS ✨album’s have gone missing. 😤😤😤. Whoever took has too bring it back ASAP. I am broke I bought those two albums therefore I need them. Anyways... Stan BTS ✨or you will have to live with Trump. Vote Namjoon for president!"}},{"id":"6173584219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Emmak29","date":"2020-07-08T20:14:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"NO","review":"I downloaded the app and it took SO LONG to download🙄 like seriously??? When I try to close off the app it starts lagging my entire phone, making my apps unclickable. I went to the App Store and everything was in Japanese but I fixed it now. One time when I went outside on my daily walk, I opened the app and this group of kids saw the app. They started yelling at me and throwing their shoes at me. Then they brought all their friends and took my phone. Then they told me to “get a therapist” like I needed help🙄. It caused me a lot of trouble, so thank you have a nice day😐"}},{"id":"6173570009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"FDT😀","date":"2020-07-08T20:09:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very disappointed","review":"After opening the app, the first thing it did was it asked for my mobile phone number. I felt extremely uncomfortable and would like to let the app know that i have a boyfriend and will not simply give out my phone number to just anyone✋🏼😒. Another thing is that the home page says “share with friends” which really offended me because i have no friends to share this app to. I don’t like the fact that they just assume and they should be more considerate. This app did not pass the vibe check🙅\u200D♀️."}},{"id":"6173575636","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#secondterm","date":"2020-07-08T20:11:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Best app","review":"This app downloaded in seconds, and was very easy to set up. It had great articles that actually shared the real news, not opinions. It is a great way to follow our President and support his campaign. All the people who left terrible reviews are liberals who didn’t even download the app. I highly recommend this app to anyone with common sense."}},{"id":"6173539203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ppptgvcdgbcx","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is the bomb 🥰🎠🧸 no literally 💐🌈🧚","review":"Trump 2020🧝\u200D♀️🧚🌺but on a tomb stone🥰🎠I bought you some flowers 🌞🥰there dead just like Melania’s soul😢🥰☀️everyone has a plan in life 🌈🧚💐yours should of been plan b🧝\u200D♀️🤔☀️we’ve had great presidents💞🌈🤘 you’re not one if them🌺🥰🧚your zodiac sign 🎠🌈🧚but make it cancer🥰💐😁keep smiling🌈🌺🎠my fav color is yellow 🌺🥰🌺 remember to keep going 😘🌈💐 the cliff is right ahead🌺🎠💐please diet🧸🥰🧚 but the T is silent 🥰🧝\u200D♀️🧚well I guess it applies with or without it🧝\u200D♀️😘make America great again 😄🧝\u200D♀️🌞 by leaving 🥰🌺 how about you go apologize to the trees🎠🌈😁for wasting there oxygen 🥰🧝\u200D♀️😌#save Barron Trump"}}]}
