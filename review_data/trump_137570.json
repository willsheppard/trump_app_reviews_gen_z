The first effect was mild. I turned on Fox News for the first time and gradually started watching it daily. Then it stated to get weird. At night I would have nightmares and wake up screaming “build that wall” and “lock her up”. As the days went on, my brain was getting foggier and cloudier until I could barely form a sentence. I was oddly attracted to my daughter and became aggressive with the women in my office. The final straw was that I saw a BLM protest and this projection appeared on the inside of my eyelids that read “terrorists”. I screamed in horror and immediately deleted the app. Instantly my brain cleared and I could form a rational thought again. That goodness I didn’t get corona virus after I burned all my masks. Does anyone know of another app where I can make public apologies?","title":"Almost made me a racist","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179892751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Amir White","date":"2020-07-10T07:13:11Z","review":"This app is terrible.

THIS APP WOULD NOT OPEN, it kept crashing on me, and then it deleted all of my photos. Like what? I want my stuff back. This app is absolute garbage, location? Why does it need my location?

There’s no point of this app AT ALL. It’s pretty much useless and has no purpose to be on the App Store. Extremely disappointed","title":"WHY IS THIS ON THE APPSTORE","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
