And I mean HORRIBLE!! The graphics on the video game is TRASH! At first I saw an orange waving, but it was drawing so badly, they tried to fix it by giving it hair, but it just looked so fake!!! The suit wasn’t any help either! As I got into the game, I noticed it was trying to brainwash me into voting this orange for president????? Super unrealistic!

I will absolutely be having nightmares tonight too.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:39:21Z"}},{"id":"6174422537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nads johnson","title":"What is this","rating":1,"review":"I am appalled by the disgusting graphics and images of this Cheeto. Who votes for this dusty man to be president? The navigation is awful and i do not like it. Uninstalled immediately cause “all apps matter”.
