This app almost killed me and my family. When I first opened the app I saw this very scary looking fat Cheeto on it. The. The orange Cheeto came out of my phone and took a lighter and set my house on fire. We escaped except my youngest sister. She was still a baby. So then my mom went into the fire to save her. But then she fainted and we called the fire department. They got her out safely but she had many third degree burns, along with my baby sister. So then we had to go to the hospital in our pijamas. Then we went to the police station to tell them what happened but they didn’t believe us. They believed that we set our house on fire for attention. We went to jail for one week until we hired a lawyer. The lawyer helped us and we got out of jail. And now since we are homeless we have to live with our family until we can get a house, money, and all basic needs. This app ruined my life and I hope that no one else has to go through the same thing that we had to go through. I will hate this orange Cheeto for the rest of my life, I hope that people will read this review so that the same thing doesn’t happen to them. I know that this is very long, but just please take the time to read it. Thank you. And now this orange Cheeto is the president of the untied states of America! This is not good for our country and our country will burn if we keep him in office. Please kick him out of office so that we don’t ever have another problem like this. Please vote for Joe Biden in this year election because we don’t need another four years of this orange Cheeto running this country. And also this orange Cheeto has two people that he is keeping hostage. Their names are Melania and Barron Trump. I can tell that they hate him. So please whatever you can do to save them, do it. Please put this orange Cheeto back where he came from: HELL. I believe that he came from hell and people also think so too.","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177561302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Flip","userName":"dang bro that crazy","review":"I died when I opened the app he came through my screen and killed me hel...........p bleh😵","date":"2020-07-09T17:26:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177540866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"awful app","userName":"bsjskdkfkekfm","review":"this app took a full week to download and it gave me multiple unnecessary notifications and it was so slow compared to my other apps. it was awful.😭😢😢😭😤😤😤😤😭😢😢🤬🤯🤯😭😠😡🥵😥😰😰😨😱😱😭😤🤯🤗😱😱🤯🥵🥶🥶😓😥😰🤗🤯🤯😤😨😨😨🤬🤯😳😳🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😢😢😢","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177540359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Near Death Experience!!","userName":"Nya Clare","review":"i opened the app and saw a hideous orange staring back at me. i had a panic attack and was sent to the hospital! 👁👄👁 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💕😍","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177519313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Fake news","userName":"kid diggety","review":"fake news","date":"2020-07-09T17:13:14Z","isEdited":false}}]}
