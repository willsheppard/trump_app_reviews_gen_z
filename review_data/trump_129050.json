Not only that but i was greeted with the face of an orange looking bacne ingested man, who’s face looks like my grandma’s sagging butt cheek. Not only that, but apparently this so-called “man” is RACIST??? Wow and he apparently hates WOMEN?? This man did not pass the vibe check, so i do not recommend this app. I would rate this a 0 if possible. He gets an 00F- ❤️."}},{"id":"6175822865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"Half1254","date":"2020-07-09T09:03:44Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was so excited to download and test this app but it was an awful experience. Especially since I had voted for him in 2016 I had hoped to Make America Great Again with this app and vote for him this year. But low and behold this made me retract my vote 🧚I am scared to death because they asked for all of my information including my SS number. As well as my phone number even sending me this weird code to my phone. Also I waited 72 hours to download this app and yet I shouldn’t have to wait this long. DO NOT USE THIS APP.

I had troubling experiences! After I gave my phone number to get the verification code, I got no code at all! Instead I got vulgar furry pictures sent to me. 😠 I decided to ignore it. I continued to sign up and instead I got the whole bee movie script sent to me 30 TIMES. Not to mention, peaches face would pop up on my screen every time I opened the app! Can’t believe Trump would allow this, this app is TRASH."}},{"id":"6175820092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It’s a disgrace to this country absolutely shi*💩","rating":1,"userName":"fuck@trump101","date":"2020-07-09T09:02:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t like it so yeah 🥱🥱ok byeeee😁"}},{"id":"6175819071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"complete ass.","rating":1,"userName":"🦖🦕🍁","date":"2020-07-09T09:02:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"yep. complete ass."}},{"id":"6175818745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made me eat my own poop >:(","rating":1,"userName":"Joseph Nguyen","date":"2020-07-09T09:02:25Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hi. My name is Ronald and I love, absolutely LOVE eating my own poop. If there’s one thing you should know about me is that I love Hulk and Shrek smut (especially the Hulk Smash). You could say my life is pretty great\n\nHowever, after seeing this app, the retina of my eye detached on it’s own, grew legs, and starting beating me up! Not to mention this app took years (possibly even months) to download! Not very cash-money if you ask me. \n\nAfter taking decades to download, the app then proceeded to hold my McDonald’s Bag hostage, even after I gave up the ransom money of 55 euro-euro. Then, it took my wife AND my girlfriend! \n\nThe app made me eat my OWN poop! I have never done such a nasty disgusting thing, and I’m into piss. I just can’t believe that this app (if you could even call it that anymore) even exists on the same device as Fruit Ninja.\n\n0/10 do NOT recommend unless you REALLY like poop in your mouth >:("}},{"id":"6175817777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wanted hot Cheetos not the orange one","rating":1,"userName":"@gloweileen","date":"2020-07-09T09:02:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I heard that Trump was a Cheeto.
