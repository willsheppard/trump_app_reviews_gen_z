For starters, the loading screen is frightening, I mean, who openly WANTS to stare at Trumps nasty face? Secondly, the app is extremely biased. None of the news sources are credible. If I wanted news from a garbage source, I would’ve watched Fox News instead. The whole point of the app is to get you to rate it 5 stars, which is annoying.\n  Anyways, I don’t recommend downloading this app and waste your storage space. If you want some VALID news sources watch The Young Turks (TYT) or Kyle Kollinski on YouTube!","rating":1,"title":"Troompa Loompas 🤢"}},{"id":"6157768522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-04T20:45:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"💖 S M I L E Y 💖","review":"This app NASTY YA’LL. 🤢 14529/10 don’t recommend!!! 🙅🏾\u200D♀️ Caused me to have long term foot fungus and STDs. 🥵😷 As sooon as you open the app you have to see that ugly cheetoh of a president!!! 🤬 Because of that, I’ve gone blind and have fallen severely ill. ☹️ Please don’t use this app!

No functionality without entering a phone number and ACCEPTING a subscription to his messaging service. YOU ALSO HAVE TO ENTER your email and zip code. Once I regretfully did all of this, the app was full of DANGEROUS and MISLEADING headlines. I immediately saw one about hydroxychloroquine’s positive effects on coronavirus, which has already led to more unnecessary death. It also displays misleading headlines about Trump’s accomplishments that were actually the direct result of the Obama administration. Never again! Don’t underestimate the power of the younger generation.","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely horrific. Fake News!"}}]}
