It makes me make sure I’m of 18 years or older. I think that’s not a good look for an app. What is it an adult entertainment app? Why is it censored for minors??? I’ve never seen such a worse app. It really ruined my day. This is something that should be looked into. The graphics and banners don’t even load and the app crashes frequently even if I do manage to get it to open. It’s just so sad to see something like this in the AppStore it is not a good look for apple. I think that it has a virus embedded within as well. Trump is trying to steal out information. 🤢 I’m disappointed and how horrendous this app is 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 it’s just sooo sad ✨","rating":1,"userName":"jillybobjow","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:31Z"}},{"id":"6174241408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!🤮","isEdited":false,"review":"i'm sorry to inform you but this app, please do not download it. once i opened up this app i was met with a heartbreaking photo of a mini cheeto💔💔 i was scarred for life so i quickly deleted the app, but once i deleted it my phone began crashing and later turning to a black screen. i thought it was just a glitch but seconds later a photo of trumps son appeared onto my screen, and it looked as if he was kidnapped. i don't know what happened but hopefully he is okay, but i don't think he is.. after that was shown my phone turned back on and all of my apps were deleted and contacts. this app has ruined my life so i beg you not to make the same mistake i made, lots of love stay safe❤️😿","rating":1,"userName":"btsisthebestthingonearth","date":"2020-07-09T00:17:33Z"}},{"id":"6174194617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BAD!!! Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!","isEdited":false,"review":"I expected more from a “Proud American”. But this app is just a NIGHTMARE😣😣!!! The first thing I did was open the app to a picture of weird looking guy. He looks orange with sad lonely eyes that are just so UNAPPEALING. I havent tried the app but just by looking at it NOT WORTH IT. The app doesnt even work(Im assuming). Seems like a country should be run instead of making useless things. If I could give 0 stars I would. GET THIS OUT OF THE APP STORE. How is this #1 for News????!!!🤦🏽\u200D♀️ Yall old racist people need to get OFF THEIR PHONES😒 This app aint even secure!!! <- im guessing...  Also Ive never seen a person more happy about 2020???🤔 He must not be looking at the COVID cases amon hmmm other things. Also SCARYY idk this app looks creepy as well as the man portrayed.","rating":1,"userName":"whatever19384884","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:12Z"}},{"id":"6174127190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible disgusting app","isEdited":false,"review":"My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible.

I recently got some news 📰 saying that you’re going to ban❌ me from the US 🇺🇸! This news shocked me a bit because most of my successful creators🤳 are from the US 🇺🇸. I am very sorry that I am more successful 💰than your app but there is nothing❌ I can do about it😚. Most of my creators come in to TikTok 📱 to laugh 🤣and have fun. Some even come so they can forget about their personal issues😔. Please do not ban me from the US 🇺🇸.  Banning me is a bad idea because Gen Z will figure out something to do about the issue. They always do. They will also become very ✨sad✨ if you take it away from them! Anyways I hope you have a great rest of your day cheeto.🟠🍊🟠🍊\n\nSincerely,\naltTikTok😝😁😘🧚\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"userName":"From: TikTok To: Cheeto","date":"2020-07-08T23:34:08Z"}},{"id":"6174093201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER! DONT VOTE FOR TRUMP!","isEdited":false,"review":"First off when i opened up the app i saw a DISGUSTING picture of trump NAKED! 🤢This is really y’alls president? i really can’t believe my eyes. Second i went to the “terms of use” section and i saw “NO N*GG*RS ALLOWED”! i was very shocked at those words. i know he’s a racist and a p*d*phile but i wouldn’t expect him to actually say that on the app. doesn’t he want people to vote for him?!?! 😧NEXT! I was scrolling and saw videos of his fans saying “GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY N*GG*R” HOW CAN YOU BE SO EVIL! HES REALLY PROUD OF THAT? 😟 and last but not least he’s putting pictures up of a flag saying “ALL LIVES MATTER”!!!! WHAT??? IF YOU READ THE REVIEW AND STILL PLAN ON VOTING FOR TRUMP YOUR INSANE! They are also deleteing reviews when it’s not what he wants to here!

So I threw it at the wall, put on gloves, and brought it to the dump. I dropped it off at the dump and drove home. When I got home, spiders were crawling everywhere and walking oranges that kept chanting “you shouldn’t have done that” over and over again. in the center of the living room was my phone and spiders were still crawling out of it. Just then, the oranges dragged me by my ankles outside and they yeet me in the air. Luckily I land on the roof. But then I see king🍊daddy🍊 orange 🍊 in 🍊his 🍊throne 🍊 “rate my app 5 stars” he keeps chanting. so i did what any decent human being would do, and i jump off of the roof. SPLAT i’m dead. so that it why i rate this app 1 star.","rating":1,"userName":"im✨not✨a✨racist","date":"2020-07-08T23:01:52Z"}},{"id":"6174012441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"keep tik tok up!","isEdited":false,"review":"ok now i love trump and i think he’s done great for our Country but you can’t ban tik tok. that’s what all teens do all day and everyday. and have you ever thought when there just sitting in there room all depressed we go on tik tok it really helps me when i’m sad and a lot more kids and teens will get sad and depressed. but also people lift other people up we support each other. and it’s a great way to make friends from around the world. yes there can be some negatives but doesn't every app? like really you can’t ban this app. on a side note there’s so many people around the world that love this app. it’s a amazing app. and that’s why i think we should keep it. i mean i know it’s helped put me a ton","rating":1,"userName":"valianwarrior","date":"2020-07-08T22:52:59Z"}},{"id":"6173884946","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Had a heart attack","isEdited":false,"review":"I know most user aren’t happy with this app and I have to agree. This app is absolutely vile. As soon as I saw Trumps app it became clear to me that some people are rly part of this cult. The use of brain cells seems to be absent from every and anyone who rated this five stars. I hope they get better but truth is they probably won’t. It’s a sad story to know that no one is getting information from this app but rather hateful thoughts and misinformation. One day when this app is off the App Store they will wake up and realize that nothing comes good from the propaganda they spew for trump and his racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, biphobic, xenophobic, rapist, and pedophilic ideas/thoughts. Just downloading the app makes my heart hurt!","rating":1,"userName":"arealarie","date":"2020-07-08T22:05:26Z"}},{"id":"6173806266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app killed my family","isEdited":false,"review":"Upon opening this app it released a horrific high pitch screech. Blood began to drip out of the ears of everyone in my vicinity. Unfortunately my family was affected. The steady drops of blood soon turned into a crimson blood stream that gushed out of their ears. Unable to remain conscious, they collapsed. I attempted to treat their wounds with the limited medical knowledge I had. I would have done anything, everything to save them but I was unable to fulfill my desperate wish. The hearts that had once beat with the might of a lion lay still. They were dead. I now lay on the floor next to the corpses of my loved ones waiting for the next screech to be released by this app. I will soon join them in the afterlife, goodbye.","rating":1,"userName":"lin6da9","date":"2020-07-08T21:35:30Z"}}]}
