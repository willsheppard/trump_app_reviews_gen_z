THE ENTIRE APPS OPENING SCREEN BLINDED ME. It was so terribly designed that my vision was impaired and soon enough I couldn’t see, in which I then fainted from the shock. My girlfriend took me to the hospital and told the doctors “Please help her! The terrible Cheeto president’s terrifyingly ugly and dysfunctional app blinded my girlfriend and she fainted!” So, they fixed me up, but I’m now blinded for life from this terrible app😡😡. I then fell into despair and tried to delete the app, but Junko kept popping out of my screen and smashing my fingers with a tiny hammer, which is bad since my sense of touch is what I rely on severely!!! I then had to get my phone smashed and had an exorcism done on it, and spent SO much money to buy a new phone!! The curse this app brought me is impairing my ability to live my day to day life, EVEN AFTER the exorcism 😡😡 I will never forgive this orange!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178946559","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App tried to buy a butt plug in my name?","date":"2020-07-10T01:35:53Z","userName":"anti butt plug activist","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app thinking “why on earth does it have so many bad reviews?” And at first I couldn’t tell what the problem was. When I first opened it, this app is exactly what I expected, another way to support our president. Then upon using it I started to notice alarming things like “sex workers for trump” and “butt plugs for trump” and I was so confused so when I clicked on the event my card was charged $69 for a new butt plug and I’ve never used a butt plug in my life! When I tried to cancel the order a pop up appeared saying “your butt plug is on its way to the president” has anyone else had this problem? Anyways I’m on the phone with my credit card company trying to get my money back. Bad app, worse products!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178946287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very small pp 👹","date":"2020-07-10T01:35:46Z","userName":"Poodie Toot","rating":1,"review":"Anything by nasty Trump is Sh!t ✨ Anyone who thinks otherwise has no brain cells.\n\n👁👄👁","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178945171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I would have given this 0 stars","date":"2020-07-10T01:35:21Z","userName":"Shiba inus","rating":1,"review":"I am a homosexual with no rights, and my favorite man is this orange right here.
