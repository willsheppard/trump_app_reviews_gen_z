TRUMP’s millimeter peter (you know, the one in the spray tan booth) and my grandmother was sitting NEXT TO ME as this unsolicited picture came on my screen. it caused my poor old meemaw to go into shock and she died! for these reasons i have to give the app one star. i will be contacting my lawyer and suing the trump administration for this terrible situation and i expect trump to pay for the finances of maymay’s funeral. may meema rest in peace. i used to be a raging trumpster but i guess i might just have to vote for joe biden now in the 2020 election, since his peepee didn’t kill meemee. anyways, thank you for your time and please for the love of GOD take down this app😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 stay safe everyone and please don’t look into it’s eye!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173319395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:43:38Z","userName":"sjbejwjsnhueiwj","title":"worst app ever😭😭😭👎👁👄👁","review":"i tried downloading this app and it took over 22 HOURS to finish downloading and when i opened it it kept on kicking me out and i felt very offended by this as a POC like i was rooting for you we were all rooting for you 😭😭 after my family saw i had this app and kicked me out of the house because i had the orange 🍊 cheeto puffs face on my phone while i was trying to make my account and while i was being dragged out my siblings kept on chanting “HE HAS NO LIPS 👄 HOW IS HE GONNA GET A KISS KISS 💋 VERY UGLY 🤢 NO KISS FOR HIM 👎 ” and laughed in my face while i was crying 😭 and after walking in the streets a lady with a dog tried telling me to go back to my country and then the dog peed on me 👁👄👁 and now i’m on the side of the road crying my eyes out i blame this app for all the bad things that have happened to me😭😭😭","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172516627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:40:44Z","userName":"rumpyydumppyy","title":"Never again","review":"So many things wrong first thing it took 10 million years to download and I have great WiFi then when I went on the app it glitched it was taking me out of the app and when I went into my other apps it took me out of those but when I deleted this app everything worked perfectly fine and another thing is when I went on the app and it kicked me out it said messages like your not good enough for trump he doesn’t want you and other one was trump doesn’t like you so stay out then all of a sudden I went In the app and it kicked me out again and said you are getting banned from this app we talked to trump and he doesn’t want you to go back to China I was so mad that this happened and I am no longer a part of this so never get the app","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172418028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:13:50Z","userName":"nifty_tissue","title":"i almost died from this app (tragic)","review":"there i was just innocently trying to scroll through the app when it glitched out and sent me to an undercover browser in the dark web. i was then being tracked to be kidnapped and trafficked all because our president wants to get rid of teenagers 🤢 i screamed and ran to my closet to put on some clothes because i am VERY self conscious and when i returned i was no longer on the dark web and was instead on a locked web browser screen that had a 24 hour long video of trump rallies playing 😭 after sitting there for 24 hours waiting for the video to end i was finally brought back to the app only to see that it was frozen and not working anymore. deleting the app, our president is a disgrace ✨🧚🏻\n\nanyway stan BTS for clear skin 🧸🥥🏹","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172416489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:13:24Z","userName":"Syrac608","title":"Worst app ever","review":"This app is the most atrocious app i could’ve ever downloaded. It kept glitching out while i was trying to understand why people like and support Trump. The overall appearance of the app was disgusting, as there was this big orange man everywhere. The slogan ‘Keep America great’ implies that America was great in the first place. Implying that he “fixed” America. He didn’t. He and all of his supporters wanted America to go back to its routes - a country built on the backs of slaves and POC. His slogan might as well be ‘Keep white Americans in power’. He has Authoritarian personality syndrome and so do his supporters. This syndrome is associated with the lack of concern for the needs of others. They need an authority figure in their lives because we all know their parents left as soon as the words “Trump 2020” came out of their mouths.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172323207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:48:12Z","userName":"Trumer05","title":"Terrible app","review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about the president, (me being a gen z). At first I thought it may just be my phone glitching out, be cause the app would kick me out every 10 or so seconds. So I restarted my phone to see if that would do the trick, but for some reason now the screen was tinted, like peach orange. So I exited the app but my entire phone had the aggressive orange tint. But none the less I kept the app because I wanna support our president. About a week after installing it, I kept getting these sudden urges to yell at innocent minorities, and to build a wall out of my little brothers LEGOs. Then another week and I kept wanting to call women dishwashers and tell them to stay in the kitchen. Then i finally deleted after trying to take my baby cousin and rap him in aluminum foil.\n\n:)","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177827029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:48:44Z","userName":"Trumpy Bear 13","title":"Strange reaction to app","review":"I downloaded the app and suddenly my family started supporting a white supremacy group. It was strange. Then they started saying that masks don’t work and we shouldn’t wear them. At first I didn’t realize the things were related but then I talked to my neighbors and they had similar experiences. They said when they deleted the app everything went back to normal. I went home and my daughter said she was ready to go back to school cause Trump said it’s ok. She then explained if we stop testing the numbers will drop. I had to explain that’s not how things work. If you just ignore something it doesn’t go away. Ugh can’t wait to delete the app and see my smart family again. I can’t deal with the confederate flag and swastikas they are sporting.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177680909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:04:48Z","userName":"jskckwbhdicjahwjdijcnwwjwk","title":"AWFUL","review":"UGH this app is so annoying! Basically, it is programmed to steal your information and find your address so it can send a hologram of Trump to your house. First, the hologram aggressively shouts campaign phrases in your face, like “build a wall” and “chInA”. Sometimes, it builds a holographic wall and if you cross through it, Trump gets really mad and screams “ILLEGAL!!!”. Also, it criticizes you when you do literally anything. It told me to stop “being idiotic” by going outside because the UV from the sun was sent from aliens and was going to kill me. Then, whenever you try to watch the news, it screams a bloodcurdling “FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS” over and over until you stop watching. UGH! It’s almost as if it’s trying to brainwash me. This app is HORRIBLE! DON’T get it!!!!!! it will ruin your life, I swear!!!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177553578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:56Z","userName":"RuvAkx","title":"💓 suicide in an app 💓","review":"lol where do i begin.. should i begin with all of his scandals or should i begin with the caucasian men who still beast for this man to stay as president of this country? it’s AWFULLY embarrassing to label this man as a leader when all i see is orange peels 😍👍🏻 before i get disrespectful, this app is HORRIBLE OMG. the storage it takes up is insane. it took bout 5 hours to download, not to mention i’m pretty sure i got a virus. if you support this man, i truly don’t trust you. but if you say you like this app???? i wouldn’t even stand 6 feet in your distance 💖 also lets not forget how he said he was attracted to his own daughter, so for those orange toned girls that break their back just for an instagram photo and are for Trump2020, i hope you’re uncomfortable. respectfully, a random teenager 💖💓💖","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
