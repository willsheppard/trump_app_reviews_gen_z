It took close to a year to download before it decided to. But it even had a few glitches that I wasn’t looking forward to. And it decided to offer me to buy some spaghetti. But I was like I don’t want no spaghett!!! So tell me why this stuff was sent in the mail the next day. But it took close to a year for the app to download😑! I was not amused. So I sent it right back to this secret location only for it to be sent back through airdrop. There sat the moldy spaghetti with a note saying VOTE TRUMP 2020. I would have to😩😩 only if the spaghetti didn’t come in the mail! I want warm spaghetti next time. NOT COLD AND MOLDY!!!","date":"2020-07-09T08:17:38Z","userName":"KANYE4PREZZZZZ"}},{"id":"6175475724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"R.I.P my cactus plant, henry.","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded the app to get notification about the  🍊 but then as i opened it , it’s glitched and kept going down. once i finally got it to work i then realized all the lies. nothing on here states that he is a racist, white supremacist who sexualized women and in many statements sexualized his own daughter. I then deleted the app and started having recurring nightmares. My last straw that made me restart my phone completely make a new apple ID was when i woke up to my poor cactus plant that had turned orange and began saying his disgusting quotes with a sign that said “grab her by the p*ssy”. i had to throw my favorite plant out of my window. So, now i don’t have my plant and a broken window.

As soon as I opened the app, I could just sense an overwhelming feeling of homophobia😬😬pedophilia😷, racism 🥴and bigotry😯. As a positive and uplifting person, I was not having it. Please do not use this app🤮☹️🤢🤒😷unless you are trying to come down with the aforementioned diseases and especially if you are prone to such diseases🤒🤒🤒🤒🤒. I recommend downloading some healthy living apps🥬🍅🥒🥑🍑, maybe a daily motivation quote app📒📕, a brain game app 🧠🧠or anything else that will be of use and can contribute to your wellness in order to propel our society forward rather than backwards. 🥰🥰🥰","date":"2020-07-09T06:57:17Z","userName":"obonekinobee"}},{"id":"6175338234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"pls don’t put me on the fbi watch list😘","rating":1,"review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah🏖🏝\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아🌞🔥\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby🥺🥺🥺\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)🙈\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아🌹\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아🤪🤪\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand🥰🥰💅\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby🥺\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼🍦🍫\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely🧁🧁\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는💫💫💫💫\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아🙈🤘\nHey I love you (love ya)😍🥰❤️❤️\n그래 너 ❤️I fancy you🤘 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼⭐️\n'Cause I need you🥺🥺\nWhat? fancy you🤘누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때☺️\nFancy you🤘 지금 너에게로 갈래😡\nFancy, ooh🤘🤘🙈🙈\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my🙄😒\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데🧐\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼😗😚\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S🤪😚\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼🏊\u200D♀️🏊\u200D♀️ \n매일이 birthday 🥳달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy🧚\nDream dream 😴마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐🤗\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby😫\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼🍦🍫\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely🧁🧁\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는💫💫💫\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별⭐️⭐️⭐️\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아🙈🤘\nHey I love you (love ya)😍🥰❤️❤️\n그래 너 I fancy you🤘 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼⭐️\n'Cause I need you🥺🥺\nWhat? 🧐fancy you 🤘🤘누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때🙄😒\nFancy you 🤘지금 너에게로 갈래🧐\nFancy, ooh🤘🤘🤘\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까😍😍🌬🌬\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아👁👄👁\n생각만으로 포근해져🔥😊\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래😫🙅\u200D♀️\n거기 너 🙈I fancy you 🤘아무나 원하지 않아🥺\nHey I love you❤️ (love ya)❤️🙈\n그래 너 😉I fancy you 🤘꿈처럼 행복해도 돼😴\n'Cause I need you🥺🥺\nWhat? 🧐fancy you 🤘🤘누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때😉\nFancy you 🤘🤘지금 너에게로 갈래😫\nFancy, ooh🤘🙈","date":"2020-07-09T06:05:30Z","userName":"poplosos"}},{"id":"6174923483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Can’t Believe This!!","rating":1,"review":"This app was so incredibly stressful for me. I downloaded it hoping to get and show support for the president. Instead, I couldn’t figure it out, it kept glitching, and had me so stressed out that it gave me a UTI!! You know what a UTI is? It’s a URINARY TRACT INFECTION!!!! I had to go out in a MASK and get antibiotics and explain SHAMEFULLY to a pharmacist that the Trump 2020 app gave me an infection in my private parts. Then I only got given so much because healthcare made it too expensive for my young entrepreneurial free souled self. Turns out, if I don’t take enough antibiotics, I could DIE!!! It’s true, I learned it on Google, my doctor...Worst experience ever. Would NEVER recommend this app.... Everyone go give it ONE STAR. My name is Generation Z and I’m here to take this app down.😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😪","date":"2020-07-09T03:43:38Z","userName":"ana y nguyen"}},{"id":"6174894322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"omg","rating":1,"review":"a literal douchbag. \nthis app is horrible! my brother and i had nothing to do today so we sat under a tree. then i saw that donald trump had an app and i thought “Ferb! I know what we’re going to do today” we were going to build a machine that gets trump out of office. mean while, my secret agent platypus(perry) was trying to stop the evil dr. doofenschmirtz from making a make-me-president-inator. as we were making out machine, our friends came over to help, along with the girl scouts because girl power. periodt. overall, our machine worked and Dr. Doofenschmirtz inator did NOT work. the end. \n\nif only that could happen. the moral of the story is that trump cannot ban tik tok and should not be in office, and the electoral college should be abolished.

When the app finally downloaded (it took about 2 hours because my WiFi is awful), the app wasn’t opening. I went to check my other apps to make sure that my iPhone wasn’t the problem, it wasn’t. I shut off my phone completely and turned it back on to then realize that it, fortunately, opened. Although, I was soon greeted with ads and glitches in the app and it was honestly difficult to maneuver. The application slowed my phone immensely and I was really disappointed to see that my favorite president had such an awful app. I’ll make sure to never download this again.
