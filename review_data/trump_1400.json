I then tried to delete the app and tell everyone what I had witnessed but he came to my house and drop kicked my puppy and told me he had an ak-47 in his trunk that he would use on him. Of course I didn’t believe him seeing as he looked like a handyman, but I didn’t want to risk anything because he also said he was a cop. (ACAB btw.) So I picked up my puppy off the floor and ran to the nearest Costco to write this review and here I am writing it on their ipad mini display. Absolutely terrible. Because of this atrocious experience, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and crippling anxiety. I’m scared and horrified. I want this app taken down as soon as possible. I will not stand for such an app. disgusting","rating":1,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T00:14:59Z","userName":"bëEreyezz","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173943044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just cannot believe that OUR president would do this to us. He was the man us nothing to do with our lives, oppressor child stealing people had. This app should not even be on the app store, it’s amazing how Trump replaces all the pictures of him with a che- With a.. with. ugh i cant bring myself to say it. A cheeto... There i said it. He deliberately decided to have a darn cheeto run this country. Where is the man who claimed to bring white supremacy back? Where’s the man who wanted to inject bleach into us? WHERE IS HE. I am writing this from a hospital bed because i listened to Trump and injected bleach into me to kill the virus. I followed him and he vanished. WHERE IS HEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! my family is disgraced to say the very least. How am I supposed to make casserole this Thursday, and feed my 14 cats? I’m upset, delete this app off the apple store it’s making a mockery of trump supporters! and wait until I tell your father...","rating":1,"title":"I cant even...

That was the first mistake. First of all it’s sooooo slow. It took me nine years to download😤 but patience is a virtue so I waited. And waited.  And waited. \nIt finally downloaded yesterday and I was more excited than I have ever been in my life. But when I opened the app it asked me really weird questions🤔 after I answered the questions a man came to my house ( through the window) and  told me that I have been cursed. Of course I didn’t take it seriously but then weird things started happening. My husband got possessed and started shouting Trump2020. Then he bought $12,000 of Trump merch. I am now in debt. Then he went to go get a fake tan and a toupee and he hasn’t come back. Then my hamster committed suicide. My tv turned on and was playing Fox News and I couldn’t change it no matter how hard I tried. Then I tried to delete the app but my phone burst into flames which almost burnt my house down. I now have the glee the country\n\nAlso if anyone sees a man with orange skin and a blonde toupee walking around in maga clothing in please find him a priest or an exorcist. \n\nTl;dr\nThis app cursed my whole family and now I’m homeless","rating":1,"title":"Download at your own risk😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T21:15:48Z","userName":"oh lovely😽 oh 😸 my love","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173554199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"While i was reading the news on this app, copies of Trump came in my house, i was very scared. The copies then started attacking my family but somehow my dog was a trained ninja, he took out the copies of Trump and I called the police, the police said they where busy killing black people 😔, but just as i uncalled the police rats and cockroaches started crawling out of my walls, me and my family where scared but my dog somehow said “GET OUT OF THE HOUSE” me my family where horrified and went out of the house. Our house started burning and we could hear from the rats and cockroaches chanting trump news that soon played on my phone, i ran inside of my burning house. The attention was on me now... but just as the cockroaches where gunna attack I deleted the app and everything was back to normal. I know have to undergo therapy, I am still traumatized from what happened. As a warning i tell you to NOT get this app.","rating":1,"title":"I ALMOST DIED FROM THIS APP","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:34Z","userName":"dhytac","isEdited":false}}]}
