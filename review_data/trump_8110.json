I don’t think it’s what it’s advertising itself to be. It seems too sketchy and unprofessional to be a presidents official app. I asked my engineer husband and he said it might be an app that a scammer/s created to get your information, download credit card numbers, emails, passwords, etc. I am going to have to take my phone to an Apple store to get this uninstalled and I am not happy about this at all.","rating":1,"userName":"Adriannatol","title":"BEWARE OF THIS APP"}},{"id":"6173736023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:09:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app has to be the most horrible app that I have ever used. When I first downloaded the app it took a week to download and once it did..two days later it just disappeared off my phone. But when I had the chance to use the app it took forever to open and it was glitching. It didn’t even let me but my Information in. This app is useless and I highly recommend NObODY use this app😡 it’s just going to be a waste of your time.","rating":1,"userName":"kyla.ky","title":"The Most horrible app I have ever used 🧚🏽💫✨✨🪐"}},{"id":"6173723934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:04:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could stay up-to-date on what our racist, homophobic, sexist, bully of a president was doing leading up to the election. Anyway, my phone started to glitch really bad after downloading this app. Once the glitching stopped, a video of Trump saying he was sexually attracted to his daughter was on replay for hours. I tried to power off my phone but it wouldn’t stop. It was so unbearable I had to throw my phone in the dumpster. I’m writing this on a new phone that I can gladly say has no Trump propaganda on it 😌✨","rating":1,"userName":"abbyrath","title":"FAKE NEWS"}},{"id":"6173687465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app it straight up sent trumpers outside my house and they chanted “TRUMP 2020” so many times 🤬 THEN AFTER CLOSING THE APP THE CHANTERS LEFT SKSKSKSK.

My phone started glitching so bad after I got it it’s got a whole virus on my phone and I’m pretty sure my phone is about to die and I have to get a new one.

I got this app to worship my sexist, racist, homophobic 🍊dictator. I love the way he supports my right to kill black people and get away with it. Unfortunately when I downloaded this app I saw my traffic cone president touching naked 👶. I went blind after seeing this monstrosity all the while I was driving. Im in the hospital right now in Kansas. This hospital is so bad they had snakes sneak into my room. I think I’m going to die. The president made me die. And they denied my claim so now I’m broke and dead. The president is evil.","rating":1,"userName":"bobduncy","title":"SCAMMED ME OUT OF MY LIFE SAVINGS"}},{"id":"6173610111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:23:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"the app simply would NOT load it took FOREVER, and when it FINALLY loaded it kept glitching. the app asked to access my photos and of course i allowed it because i thought that i could trust my president, and then it upload a bunch or random and very inappropriate photos of  Kayleigh McEnany (kinda disappointed could have been better pictures.) i also got a a notification from the app saying the N- word i was in shock i didn't know trump was black, ya know cause he’s kinda racist but i mean melanin king ig.","rating":1,"userName":"chad brad williams","title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6173599674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:12Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app has become a danger to me and my family because upon downloading it a high pitch automated sound was released into the air. It brought cicadas drawn to the sound which then caused my mom to become paranoid that they were in the house so she is now locked up in the attack because she’s mentally disturbed. One of the cicadas carried a disease with COVID symptoms but creates welts in the shape of Donald trumps face on different body parts. This app has ruined me and my family’s life and it should not be on the AppStore. \nAlso try to delete TikTok trump I dare u","rating":1,"userName":"BellassssRatesssss","title":"Dangerous app"}},{"id":"6173579269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:06Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I expected this app made to honor our great lord cheeto puff would be heckin gr8, when in reality it sucked. It ran so slow for me, and everytime I tried to look his 🧚\u200D♀️✨beautiful face😍🌸 the app crashed. I’m so extremely disappointed in how it is running. I am deleting this app immediately after I write this review. Not only that, I am very disappointed in the color scheme. I was very excited to see many different neon colors... but I guess not. Would not recommend this app. Nor would I recommend re-electing cheeto puff...","rating":1,"userName":"bruhidklmaoooo","title":"Oofda Cheeto Puff"}},{"id":"6173567958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:09:12Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to know where our racist cheeto lookin ass🍊president gets his spray tans😻and his wigs from👩🏼but there was not information on that which made me very upset. Also, this app was supper glitchy and hard to use because of the format so it was not easy to access certain things on there. Well u know how trump is when it comes to freedom😹he only lets certain people have the privilege and access to certain things💔anyways I’m save Barron Trump, I feel so bad for him😿","rating":1,"userName":"Googlegirl469292.","title":"Awful app😾👺"}}]}
