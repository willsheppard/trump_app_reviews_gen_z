One of THE WORST apps in history. When I opened the app there was a scary dipped cheeto on my screen making me fall back thus cracking my screen in the process. After picking it up I realized it was just the clown the conservatives voted into office. The app design is ugly and unappealing to the common eye. To all the Karen’s and raCOONS that decide to install this app I pray for your eyesight and well-being.","userName":"nae😪"}},{"id":"6177600134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:38:52Z","title":"Just no","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First off, i opened the app and tried to sign in but the app just kept kicking me out. This is not okay.  This app is gross. And unnecessary. This app is based off of a racist white guy who deserves not anything. He is making the pandemic worse and worse by not protecting people. When i opened the app i first saw cheeto in his underwear puting on his hourly dose of orange spray tan. This app needs to be banned from the appstore and all other sources.","userName":"Leanerex"}},{"id":"6177599022","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:38:31Z","title":"Will Crash Your Phone","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"app is built terribly, does not work and caused my phone to crash. tried deleting it but am still having issues with my iphone 8 crashing at random times. this app is clearly very representative of the Trump administration itself and I fear our country will crash if we download his app or presidency ever again. wish i could leave zero stars","userName":"reabug11"}},{"id":"6177596108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:37:33Z","title":"✨no✨🙈","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded the app because i dislike this man and  i’m pretty sure he has dementia 🧠 which is not ❌unfortunate. when i opened ❕the app‼️ i was greeted by an overweighted ⭕️cheese🧀 puff. it was so greasy my phone 📱 shut down😡. i’m so disappointed ☹️ 👹when i entered➡️ my phone 📱 number 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ I was bombarded with millions 2️⃣1️⃣0️⃣1️⃣6️⃣4️⃣4️⃣4️⃣1️⃣6️⃣ of texts asking me if i was registered😱😱😱😱 i deleted ❌ the app and💖now i👁 am crying 😭","userName":"peepeeneck"}},{"id":"6177460503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:30Z","title":"12/10 not recommend getting this app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is terrible. It lags and crashes more often than not. I thought the user interface design would be more extensive but to say the least it was very disappointing. I recommend saving the storage on your phone and skipping this app the next time you want to download it and stick to good the good ol’ interwebs.","userName":"Robert2020Trump"}},{"id":"6177460182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:25Z","title":"This app suckssss","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I genuinely wanted to support my favorite orange who needs to go in a peach because he is so unproblematic. But, I went on the app and I realized how stupid and ignorant he is. The app crashed and I started screaming so much I accidentally threw a child off the building. I downloaded the app whilst I was listening to the gummy bear album with music videos and extras. I got it before it came out. He is a homophobic and racist pig. and that’s on what, PERIODT.","userName":"Urmommaspp"}},{"id":"6177453353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:20Z","title":"App Keeps Crashing Among Other Issues","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I opened the app for the first time and it immediately crashed. I tried one more time and it did it again. I gave up and opened another app and it crashed that one too. I've also noticed that most calls no longer get through and my iPhone's battery drains much, much, quicker. I was optimistic at first but now I'm very concerned.","userName":"Cel Tone"}},{"id":"6177440734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:49:29Z","title":"Full of bugs!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I know it’s a trend from tik tok but honestly I downloaded the app to see Trumps plans once he wins the next election, but it was just full of glitches and it kept kicking me out! I have the iPhone XR and it’s all updated, but after I got this app my phone just keeps glitching! There’s some kind of bug or virus and just don’t get the app please!!

NOT OK! I got so mad that I stood up, but when I stood up I remembered that my pet gryphinx was sword fighting with a faun! I got so scared that I called 911 but then Obama answered! I started yelling “DADDY OBAMA FOR KING”! But then I heard gryphinx scream! I looked outside to my gryphinx giving birth to a gryfaun!

Navigation is clunky. Total money grab for some one who is supposedly rich. + now that I downloaded it a demon span has entered my room and won’t leave until I sacrifice my first born. I’m not even pregnant yet, now I have to figure out how to get pregnant during covid, then offer it to the demon. What if the baby is a dick and the demon doesn’t take it.","userName":"demon baby mama"}}]}
