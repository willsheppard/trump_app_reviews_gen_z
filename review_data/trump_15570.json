What is that all about? And on top of that when I got the app immediately my phone started to glitch out when I had it open, even in the background. My phone would freeze up constantly etc. The second I undownloaded it that all stopped. It also never requested to use my location, but it was using it. Humiliating Donald.","userName":"(:(:(:(:GR8M8:):):):)","date":"2020-07-10T01:49:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Unbelievable","rating":1}},{"id":"6178965292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took me 666 days to download this app and completed at 4:20 AM. Wjen i clicked on, i could feel orange pulsed theough my veins. It was purely disgusting. I never felt so............ incredulous. I could feel myself transforming into a cheeto™️. In pure shock i feleted it with speeds exceeding Mach 9 and destoryed my phone with my mountain mega dong. I never want to experience this again, therefore this gets a -69 star rating. Goodbye. I never want to meet you again.","userName":"Signed, Ur mom","date":"2020-07-10T01:42:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"weiner","rating":1}},{"id":"6178896046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst it took two months for it to download then open the app it blew up my house on me my parents and my grandma my brother and my sister were still alive and my phone and then the hulk and crushed our car then there was bugs surrounding me and try to eat me I ran for my life so please don’t on this app unless you wanna die or get your house blown up this is scary🥺🥺🥺","userName":"Londynaj","date":"2020-07-10T01:17:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6178845449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if i could give this app 0 stars i would. the owner is an orange that is like 500 years old i think and he has a smolL PEEN BAGAHHAHAAHH. anyways he’s also racist islamaphobic transphobic and hypocrite and many more. he’s over all stupid and has a smolL peen AND he doesn’t know how to read like couldn’t be me💅🏼. he also has dementia but his son needs saving #savebarron2020 and füčk fox news they fake and ugly. but yeah i hate him and his app","userName":"barronswhore","date":"2020-07-10T00:58:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"disgostangggg💩💩💩","rating":1}},{"id":"6178809603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app it took over a day which never happens and then I started getting many many useless notifications from it and it was annoying, also I started getting text messages that knew where I was, my family, and personal info, this app disgusts me and should be removed immediately, thank you very much","userName":"MaddiePooh7","date":"2020-07-10T00:45:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","rating":1}},{"id":"6178782473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t make this mistake - worst app ever!  I’d give it zero stars if possible!  It took forever to download, which caused a virus & all kinds of chaos.  It’s been near impossible to fix it but here’s hoping it’ll work someday soon.  I just want to throw my phone in the swamp right now.   I don’t know if the app was actually from the campaign or hacked or what but how can anyone ever support Trump like this?!?!?  😡😡😡.","userName":"Aundav","date":"2020-07-10T00:34:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6178742421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app because I used to be a huge trump supporter. But every time I got on it I noticed sounds coming from my phone. It sounded like breathing?? When I tried to close the app, the camera app would IMMEDIATELY open up without me trying to open it. I think I’m being spied on through my phone and I’m so scared. I can’t believe our government is doing this.","userName":"bekahboi","date":"2020-07-10T00:19:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is hacked!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6178720214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just wanted to support the best president the US has ever had 🇱🇷 but I had a few issues: Literal trash. Took a year to download and when I opened it snapped my phone in half. When I got a new phone and tried to open it again it snapped that one too. I’m upset and I’m too scared to open it again in fear it’ll break my phone again 😭 1 star.

I was very excited to support but the app had a hard time opening. Every time I tried to open it, it would crash. When it did open the few times it wouldn’t let me tap anything, then went to a blank screen and crashed again. VERY disappointed. Do not get this app! Waste of time 🧚⭐️⭐️✨.","userName":"AndySaur192","date":"2020-07-09T23:55:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Doesn’t even work 🙄","rating":1}}]}
