Why would this app need time to download? Don't ask me. I'm not as PAtiEnT as the current president of the US is.\n\nOnce I opened this AMaZinG app, I was greeted with this horrible image of this man trying his best- if you can even call it that- to look emotional. I'm not sure why they hired such a horrible actor to represent this app, but I would suggest having him do something more like:\n＼(;´□｀)/ \nbecause that suits his personality more.\n\nNot only that, but he also had his fist up in the air, and I'm not sure who he was trying to fight, but I would suggest that he position his arm a little lower so he can actually hit his target considering he is- allegedly- 6 feet tall (this is only criticism, so please don't try this at home, kids).\n\nAlthough, maybe he already hit his target, and that's why he had his fist up in the air because he is so pOWeRfUL that he yeeted his opponent with just one fist. If that is the case, this app is advocating for violence which is not a positive message for a politician to be spreading to his followers.\n\nAs for the text on that photo, it said to \"Join today to help us Keep America Great\". Not to be opinionated or anything, but... I'm not sure America has EVER been great, so saying that we need to KEEP it great sends the wrong message. Therefore, this app is falsely advertising.\n\nMoving on to the sign up/log in section of this app, it is clearly bribing us into continuing by stating that we can \". . . earn points and redeem rewards\". What kind of rewards are we to earn? It did not state what they are exactly, which will only draw in the potential user (bribing = no confidence). \n\nWere you completely blown AWAY- in the worst way possible- by everything mentioned above? Well, hold on to your rear because this will clearly set you off into a higher level of anger: they... They asked for my number... I know... I know... It's so upsetting... HOW COULD THEY? I mean... The fact that this app is for 17 years+ is completely disgusting. THEY ARE ASKING MINORS FOR THEIR NUMBERS! How uncomfortable can you possibly get?\n\nThis is the last thing I'd like to report on before I completely stopped looking at this app... As if all of that wasn't enough... They... They mention at the bottom of the campaign app that this app is \"Paid for by Donald J Trump for President, Inc.\"... 😭 I was so SHOCKED. This app is helping this man become president... I know... I know! You're absolutely horrified. I'm sorry, but someone had to let you know the truth.\n\nFor the hour (?) I've had this app, I have felt nothing but nausea, horror, and anxiety. Therefore, I shall be getting rid of it, and I hope you didn't take any of my words lightly. This app is SICKENING. Do not- and I truly mean it- use this app! \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nA traumatized individual"}},{"id":"6175233795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T05:25:22Z","userName":"jay.013","review":"this app gave me glitched to my idphone and nows i cnat typ wel it mess up me pone wht th hek"}}]}
