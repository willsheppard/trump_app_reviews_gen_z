Let me tell you why:\n1: hire a better graphic designer. the T in the logo is off centered compared to the 2020. i know you have enough money, with all of your shady hotels and restaurants, to hire even a monkey that could do a better job with no experience in ms paint than who ever designed that logo.\n2: i don’t feel comfortable giving you my phone number, but i gave you one that is supposed to go straight to santa clause. maybe you can ask for a better tan and hairline this december!!\n3: if it was not evident by now, i am not trying to help you win the election. in fact, i really don’t think that a measly little app will help improve your track record over the past... let’s just stick to what’s happened in the last year: impeachment hearings, nearly sending the american people into another world war, assault allegations, assault of a minor, and ordering the police to shoot protestors.  now that’s only a few that i could remember. do you really think that this app is going to lead to voters to forget about those things? \n4: these rallies you are encouraging people to attend? will people be able to stand 6 feet apart, or are you at the point in the year where you don’t care about your people’s well-being anymore? did you ever care? or was it just about the power and money?\n5: do the points that i can earn equal money? because if so, who’s money? if it’s yours i would gladly take it off your hands. you have too much anyway.\n6: the first article that appears when i log in to the app is that “Biden Opposition to Opening Economy Hurts Black-Owned Businesses”. now, i would think that sending the police to kill black people that run those businesses would hurt them more than a brief recession could. \n\nin conclusion, you cannot stop the will of the american people. the coming generations are prepared and ready to vote, protest, and revolutionize this country. you and your gang of boomers with osteoporosis and broken hips cannot stop us. good luck in the election 🧚🏼💖🤩you’ll need it","date":"2020-06-10T14:12:39Z","title":"good try, better luck next time, buddy","userName":"my dog is smarter than you","rating":1}},{"id":"6055231977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"as soon as i downloaded i got tetanus :( wouldn’t recommend","date":"2020-06-09T15:20:50Z","title":"idk abt this","userName":"hated it pretty bad","rating":1}},{"id":"6041364030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"was extremely disheartened to see the lack of k pop stan content on this app :(","date":"2020-06-06T05:51:48Z","title":"k pop for life <3","userName":"fairykpopstan","rating":1}},{"id":"6179207758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Yesterday as I was walking my pet iguana I thought to myself “ HOLD UP , I should download the trump app “ SINCE IM A GOOD AMERICAN CITIZEN.

WHEN I GOT HOME SUPER EXCITED TO OPEN THE APP I i suddenly stopped aggressively and gave a dirty look at my cell phone >:( the APP was still HALFWAY DONE 😱.

IT WAS MR TRUMP . I was so startled but happy on seeing my “ president “ but then what he said gave me ANXIETY “ KID YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE GOING DOWN MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AND NO ONE WILL STOP ME 😈” as I saw trump evil laughing I got an idea 💡!!!!! For a distraction I told trump that his hair was messed up so he said “ OMG WHERES YOUR MIRROR ???!?!? “ “ behind you sir fix it so you look good once again 😊” as he looked away I GRABBED MY PHONE AND OPENED IT AS FAST AS I COULD AND DELETED THE APP !!!!! but ..... trumps last words were “ this is not the end child ...” * vanishes * SO YOUNG CITIZENS OF AMERICA AND MANY MORE * also boomers * please don’t download this horrific app it’s not worthy of your time and please STAY SAFE YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE HE MIGHT APPEAR 👀👀👀👀","date":"2020-07-10T03:11:48Z","title":"Oh to see without my eyes 🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"american cotizen 😍","rating":1}},{"id":"6179171985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"this orange man’s app took forever to download and once it did it gave me and my 1299 cousins cancer😕","date":"2020-07-10T02:58:43Z","title":"🤍✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️sad💫🥰🤩💎","userName":"gsbehiㅗㄱ무젓ㄴ로뭋ㅋ😢😁😴","rating":1}},{"id":"6179096037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Trump 2020","date":"2020-07-10T02:30:29Z","title":"Great app","userName":"tj_42096","rating":5}}]}
