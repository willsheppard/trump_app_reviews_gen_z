It took almost a week to download! And also when I launched the app it had disturbing pictures of trump which caused me to have seizures. I was hospitalized for a month. Then I forgot my password so I had to log in to the account and go to setting on how to change my password. Take this app down!!"}},{"id":"6173623509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"teddy bear broom sandwich","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨✨crusty✨✨.","review":"I was a gurl in the village doing alright🥳then I downloaded this app it took 3 nights😭I opened the app then crust appeared on my floor🤷\u200D♀️ that’s not was I was waiting for😡✨TRUMP 2020✨(on a gravestone🧚🏻 ) I’m finding out where this Cheeto put his small brain 🧠.                         but then I realized he has ✨ dementia ✨ oh well😌 it’s so sad to hear that Tonald Dump isn’t doing the best🚒 it would be awful if he got the virus 🤗"}},{"id":"6173622533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dont vote for kayne","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible app","review":"This app is AWFUL. Took forever to download and it glitches!!! I thought I had to restart my phone because mr. Trumps face was stuck on my screen. Then I got a knock on the door and it was the rat colony!! They claimed that this app had summoned them to my house, and they proceeded to break in and eat all my cereal and steal my dog. Now me and wife dont have a dog and are celrealess 😭💔 Horrible app."}},{"id":"6173611477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sawyer3030","date":"2020-07-08T20:24:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app on the internet, no offence","review":"When i download this app it was fine but with the constant spams it was enough and with such a low rating the App Store needs to do their part and take it down, with a rating at 1.4 it’s already close enough to be removed permitted. Give other people a chance to shine and have their apps on the App Store."}},{"id":"6173611466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im just here as a guest","date":"2020-07-08T20:24:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app steals your information","review":"Hi. I as well as many other reviewers am a trump supporter, so it pains me to say that I absolutely am disappointed in this app. It stole my information because I guess it has low security. It then crashed and I had to delete the app and restart my phone. I’m sorry mr president but this app just is very heartbreaking. I do not recommend.\n\nSincerely,\nLeslie smith"}},{"id":"6173595238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lmCristian","date":"2020-07-08T20:18:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s disgusting 🐸🔪","review":"This app it’s horrible because I hate this man I had to download it and when I open the app my phone started to glitch and there was tho orange Cheeto popping on my screen and he was yelling make America great again and I was in public I got assaulted because people thought I supported the Cheeto and if he deletes tiktok I will fight till he’s app is deleted too!!"}},{"id":"6173580983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Savage006","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"app downloaded many VIRUSES on my phone","review":"i downloaded this GARBAGE app to my PHONE and SUDDENLY my phone turned off. when i turned it BACK ON i got a screen saying ‘thank you for downloading trump app but unfortunately we decided that we don’t like you haha’. this review is the last thing i will be able to write befor my phone completely shuts off so ple"}},{"id":"6173579496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"__157__","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"A gross waste of space","review":"I downloaded this app with low expectations and was not surprised. This is literally a HUGE waste of space. The app itself serves no purpose to any intelligent humans. Make the app store great again. The orange was left on the vine for too long. It's starting to rot. We better stick it in the trash where it belongs before it stinks up the neighborhood again. :("}},{"id":"6173575739","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Banana Fanana Fo Fudy","date":"2020-07-08T20:11:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not good","review":"I opened the app and the first thing it told me I had to do was kick my dog!!😡 This angered me very much because even though my dog does speak rudely to me from time to time, I would never resort to kicking it. As I continued to scroll through the app tryna see all this Trump 2020 madness, it then told me to get rid of my baby!! I DONT HAVE A BABY. Anyways, not a good app and it should get removed ❤️🙈✨"}}]}
