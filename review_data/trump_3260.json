Couldn’t even get past the home screen without wanting to throw up!! I can’t believe Apple is allowing an app like this to be in its store. Repulsive!! I wish I could give it 0 stars!! No doubt in my mind this app needs to be deleted immediately!! I hope children can’t see this! Their poor innocent souls could just be scarred for the rest of their lives!! Now once I got past that terrible home screen my phone started glitching out and closing the app. I have a brand new phone and this has never happened with any other app. It just shuts me out! Oh well I guess I’m deleting it. I warn you, DO NOT download this app!! 🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏽\u200D♂️🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏿\u200D♂️","rating":1,"userName":"Kvhvxd gvuvuvtc","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:38:59Z"}},{"id":"6176814845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of Storage","review":"There are no words for my experience using this app. It’s so slow and not to mention the content is absolutely abhorrent. This app is a piece of crap. The screen is just orange all the time. Was this an attempt at doing something? If so who ever made this app failed horribly. I can’t believe I wasted my storage and time downloading this app. This app causes several side affects, included but not limited to bigotry, racism, and misogyny. I would never recommend this app, not even to my worst enemy. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This app will just cause you to loose brain cells and cause you to be extremely frustrated in humanity and the climate of the world in all aspects. Safe yourself the headache and self loathing and don’t download.","rating":1,"userName":"Lauris1798","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:55:46Z"}},{"id":"6176773419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The app is a joke","review":"The app is killing my battery!!

When I answered the phone call I was informed that they were calling only white voters on the phone I received a call from and everyone who isn’t white got a phone call from their “other line”. On this call they asked me many questions about my political and religious beliefs and after the questions they deemed that I passed the test. Within three days I received a package at my door step with a not that only revealed the message written on it when submerged in urine. The message had a location on it and the package contained a white cloak.","rating":1,"userName":"GroovyCat.rd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:01:52Z"}},{"id":"6176599426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful","review":"Downloading this app was the worst decision in my life. After downloading the app and enabling location detection I now have a group of Russian mobsters living with me in my home. They forced themselves in and claimed if I liked Trump I would help them! They have eaten all the food in my house and my baby hasn’t stopped crying in days. He’s only eight months old and they are already training him to be a part of their mob. Not being able to eat because of the mobsters led me to being sick at work so then my boss thought I had COVID, even tho it’s clearly a commie scam, and now I’m fired. The app also somehow managed to leak all my “racist” comments to my linked in. I’m not racist tho I just don’t like anyone who isn’t white.","rating":1,"userName":"Eric Trumpp","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:58:47Z"}},{"id":"6176488464","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app will RUIN your life !!!!!!","review":"i downloaded this to stay informed about MY president, but i ran into problems right away. first, it took FOREVER to download as if they purposely wanted to make me wait for it, and i was dying of anticipation the whole time! second, when it finally DID download, it made my whole phone glitch out, almost like the app had INFILTRATED my phone data! i have this strange feeling that the app literally took all of my data like STOLE MY DATA AND INFORMATION!

First it took 6 days to download and then I open the app to see this CHEETO looking at me like um what is that?? Then I proceeded to continue looking through the app to see his shlong. I didn’t think I would see such a small Cheeto, but I sadly saw it😫. So I was already off to a horrifying start. Then the app proceeded to try and steal my cat and my microwave😤. It literally made my phone grow hands and reach for my cat and the microwave. Luckily my cat is fat so the app couldn’t handle the weight of both a microwave AND a fat cat😔. I DO NOT recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t want their cat or microwave stolen. I saw a few comments above saying their fridge was stolen as well. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!😩😩😩","rating":1,"userName":"Ava🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:12Z"}}]}
