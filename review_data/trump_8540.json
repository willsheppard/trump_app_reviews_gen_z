Once I finally got the app to work it would make a very loud screeching noise to where all the oranges on my counter in the kitchen fell on the floor and my dog ate all of the oranges. We had to take my dog to the emergency room because the oranges were toxic to my dog. My dog died. All thanks to this app my dog is now dead","rating":1}},{"id":"6173543788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wouldn’t recommend","isEdited":false,"userName":"moondidi","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:03Z","review":"So as soon as I clicked “download” it look about 4 hours to and even on top of that it was super slow and kept glitching out causing my phone to start to glitch as well and make a weird sort of ring that really seemed to bother my dog. When I say my mom started to glitch I mean I couldn’t open and any apps only the “trump 2020” one and it forced me to just look at the dumb over priced merch and stare at a rapist/ racists face for TO long. \nSo over all I do not recommend this app✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6173494969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible horrible APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"Juli_89","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:21Z","review":"when i first got the app to educate myself about MY president 🍊my favorite orange oompa loopmpa (which by the way is a disgrace to 🍊the actual willy wonkas oompa loompas) i kept kicking me out and ringing like a 🍊smoke detector alarm. when it finally downloaded after months it gave my 🍊phone a glitch and now the orange emoji pops up randomly 🍊see^^.

But that only lasted for a couple hours when it started glitching and taking almost 3 HOURS TO LOAD! I was not impressed with this app at all. The other thing is that I went into privacy settings and realized it had taken ALL of my contacts, pictures, and log ins. Spread the word!!!

Also, I tried to close out of the app and my phone froze and shut off. I should not be having these problems since I have an IPhone 11 with an updated system and all my other regular app work perfectly. The content on this app is completely useless and I pity anyone who sincerely, regularly uses this app. \n\nHave a good day, love yourself💜","rating":1}},{"id":"6173290040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧑🏼\u200D🌾Noooo🧤","isEdited":false,"userName":"singeli ophelia morning","date":"2020-07-08T18:34:19Z","review":"𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣\nThis 🐵is🥚the🥁worst🚨app🧎ever🍿\nDo❌not📠download🛶\nThis is the worst because when i was hitting my brother with a wooden fish i got a notification saying that our cheeto was watching me so i tried to deleat it but it spoke to me and said“you can never delete this app. I will now possess your whole family” and I said “ok bet” and it didn’t do anything.
