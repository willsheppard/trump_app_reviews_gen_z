THIS APP WILL RUIN YOU ☠️☠️☠️","rating":1}},{"id":"6144648842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible! Do not recommend!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hope_girl2411","date":"2020-07-01T15:18:00Z","review":"I downloaded this app out of curiosity of what our president is up to. As soon as I opened it, it began to tell me idiotic sayings like “Donald J. Trump\nFor president!” I took a pause from the app for a few minutes to catch my breath because the huge picture of him was just absolutely ugly. I mean does he know that he has wrinkles? I went back on the app to see some statistics and boy oh boy was I impressed with the amount of bs this guy was spreading. Does the J. Stand for joke Mr. Trump? All of a sudden I had the urge to pee, so I made my way to my bathroom and what happened next shocked me! My skin was beginning to look... orange. I was shocked because I haven’t been outside in years, so how could I have gotten this tan. A few hours later, I came downstairs to enjoy dinner with my very American family. My mom asked me if I was mashed potatoes and I responded with, “make mashed potatoes great again!” I couldn’t believe such horrible things coming from my mouth. A few days later, I had gained some weight and my hair was a silvery blond. It was horrendous! I opened up the app and I said, “this is very nice. Very great app,” but it wasn’t my voice. I sounded exactly like Donald Trump. I was turning into Donald Trump. I quickly deleted the app so I could revert back to normal. I’m doing just fine now. Do not download this app or you’ll turn into Trump! I bet he secretly has an army of Trumps in the White House. Be careful what you do! DO NOT RECOMMEND I WOUKD GIVE 0 STARS IF I COULD!","rating":1}},{"id":"6144409227","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","isEdited":false,"userName":"i miss 1D :(","date":"2020-07-01T14:16:12Z","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! \n\n-Love, Grandma 😘😫🥴✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6144384123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This App Is Terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Don'tBeASnowFlakeTrump2020❤️","date":"2020-07-01T14:09:57Z","review":"Donald Trump fooled us all!

I immediately went to the App Store and of course, downloaded it. Who knew that it would be the biggest regret of my life.\nUpon opening I was greeted with the horrid image of a desiccated orange with puckered limbs, rotting on the inside out. No need to say, I was horrified out of my mind. Whilst processing the photo presented to my eyes, I heard a knock on my door; this is where the true terror begins.\nI look up from my screen and see my cat drenched in blood. I get up in a hurry, when the window behind me smashes to the ground. It’s a deformed creature; almost like a middle age woman with a blonde angled bob cut, screeching at the top of her lungs. “ALL LIVES MATTER”. I scatter to the ground in shocked and bewildered to the reasoning behind her statement. That’s when it hit me. I had recently attended a BLM protests and still had the signs I took laying in my room. I was petrified. The app detected every single item and object in my room and chose its weapons accordingly. This time, it chose a Karen. I look back at my door to see my cat, but it’s no where to be seen. I’m crying. Tears flowing down my cheeks, I hear “it’s a free country” in a deep, threatening voice. I look back. It’s my cat. On two paws. Pointing a gun and staring into my soul. That’s when I remember why we need gun laws. I finally manage to get up off my feet and run downstairs. I don’t even look back. I come downstairs, trying to catch my breath, when I notice my family on their knees crying. Our pet moth had suffered a cardiac arrest. And you can say whatever you want. But I refuse to believe that this didn’t happen because of the app. Then it hit me. The solution. I had to delete the app. Simple. I ran up stairs again. My family look at me with utter confusion, but I didn’t have enough time to explain. I run up, open my room door; completely forgetting about my possessed cat and Karen. Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Instead, there was an old man in the corner of my room, rocking back and forth. Repeatedly muttering “trump2020, trump2020, Trump2020”. I ignore him and did what I CAME for. Deleting the app. And I did. And boom. It was all gone. Everything. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","rating":1}},{"id":"6137867101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App is terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Haley Brown10","date":"2020-06-30T00:53:50Z","review":"Glitches a lot and only says trump 2020 with no information on the 2020 election.
