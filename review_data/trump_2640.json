What it doesn‚Äôt tell you in the app store description of this app is that it will ruin your LIFE. After downloading this app and inputting all of my information, i could feel eyes on me at all times. I didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore. Is president Trump stealing my information? Is he watching me? I feel violated and scared. My children and cats are terrified. Every second becomes harder and harder as I wonder how much time i have left. Worrying for my life at the ripe age of only 37 should not be a concern after only trying to support my president üòî. I am scared and disgusted. Delete this app before anyone else has to experience this kind of fear in their life.","date":"2020-07-08T20:30:25Z","title":"Disgusting, Disappointing, and plain out HORRIBLE.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Hot M&M"}},{"id":"6173569035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this up to support our beloved Cheeto president, it took about a day or so to download which was okay because I had things to do like take my fish on a walk and teach my dog how to fly. anyway back to the point once I opened the app it kicked me out and my phone started to glitch and it never turned back on, I had to use my iguanas phone for the next couple of days until I got another phone. I started to read all trustworthy reviews that were left and my God I was baffled. bad luck, ovens turning on without anyone‚Äôs permission, about a week for this app to download (I thought mine took a long time), dogs levitating.

I don‚Äôt know where to begin. When it finally downloaded after 3 days, the first thing I see is a cheeto as the cover. Now, I don‚Äôt expect to see some glorious cover, but a cheeto? I am allergic to cheetos so naturally my face began to swell up. I immediately try to blow up the app, but in the process my phone blew up too. It cost me good money!! In this whole process, when my phone blew up, cheeto dust sprayed everywhere and my dog sniffed it and turned into a cheeto. I expected better. My dog is now in the cheeto puff factory being turned back but now she is permanently orange. Patriotic I suppose... Very disappointed though. Do not buy unless you want a cheeto dog and have a cheeto allergy. I have not stopped sneezing ever since.","date":"2020-07-08T19:02:11Z","title":"Instructions not clear.

To start out well I was downloading the app it took six hours and at first I played it off as my Internet slow or my phone just doesn‚Äôt have very much storage left but now it gets worse. I filled out all the information right before I went to bed. When I woke up I found thirty missed calls. I had just gotten this phone number and now I have all these spam calls. Of course I went into the app and everything was flashing. I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I powered off my phone and left it for a couple hours and when I got back on it sent me to safari and guess what I got... a virus. Thanks trump really appreciate it!","date":"2020-07-08T17:27:27Z","title":"Words cannot describe this app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sarah.836m"}}]}
