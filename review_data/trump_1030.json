Im pretty sure this app is giving hackers a way to get into our phones and get all our private information! Im trying to support our president 😭but this app is trying to kick me off!

I take 100% good care of it! i have a very protective case and I never bring it near water or any liquids!

BUTTT this app is soooooo bad, like I wish Apple gave us a chance to rate it 0 stars.. the second I downloaded it, my iPhone crashed 5 TIMES!!!! And when it finally downloaded it, my screen was frozen and I honestly thought I caught a virus????!!! And so I restarted the phone and it finally worked and so I forgot all about it and I went to open the app. OH MY GOD WAS IT SO MUCH WORSE!! I opened the app and my phone started screeching and beeping non stop like some type of conspiracy encryption.. I honestly think this app is trying to steal our information to brain washing us into voting for trump.. I am a proud Latina women with a family who supports trump and this app is absolutely horrible.. I can’t believe the fact that this app is still in the App Store.. I swear if hackers break into my phone and find out about my family secret recipe I will be so upset😤","date":"2020-07-08T19:20:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"brii2069"}},{"id":"6173346626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app actually gave me seizures...","review":"i downloaded this app bc i wanted to support my favorite 🍊 and that’s where it all went wrong. i opened it and i couldn’t understand ANYTHING because it was written in RUSSIAN....this should be impossible since i live in america and, according to my glorious president, america is better than everything else in the world. so why was i seeing a completely different language other than ~american~ ??? next thing i know, my screen goes blank, and i’m seizing, secreting green and black fluid from ALL of my many holes💅🏼✨ and now i’m blind👓 this is so out of the ordinary and nothing has happened like this ever in my entire life. it wouldn’t be from my strict diet of daily deer and roadkill, so it would have to be from this horrid app...it has been the only change in my routine for the last decade and a half.

WORST APP EVER!","review":"I’ve been trying to download this app for weeks now and every time it’s at 99% it glitches and doesn’t download it. Then a week ago it actually downloaded and my phones been glitching SO BAD! one night I was trying to uninstall the app and I got an alert from he app that had my address in t and my friends and families name threatening to disappear us if I uninstalled the app. I’m now currently moving houses to another country because I’m afraid of my own life and others. I’m going to burn this phone and change my name because I’m so scared and I don’t wanna die. All I wanted was to support my president but it all went wrong and I can’t even sleep at night because I feel like I’m being watched. I had to divorce my husband and give him he custody of my children since I’ll never be able to see them again. They are moving as well but I’m moving far away from them. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP OF YOULL REGRET IT FOREVER!

When I first downloaded the app I did it as a joke. But then these awful glitches came. The glitches were so bad it would shut off my phone or it would have a full on seizure. I thought that the normal thing to do would be to delete the app so i tried. But when I went to delete it my phone had the biggest seizure yet. It was vibrating aggressively and my screen was flashing I for sure thought that I had broken my brand new phone. I turned my head and realized that my dog was acting strange. He was behaving exactly like the phone, seizing. I began to worry so I hid my phone under the couch to check on him, no matter what I did he would just keep on freaking out. The second my phones glitching stopped, so did my dog. I turned him over and he was dead. All in all, worst app ever, it’s not dog friendly and deserves zero stars.(btw don’t try and tell me that that the app didn’t kill him, that’s HIGHLY disrespectful)","date":"2020-07-08T14:27:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"xDominiquex"}},{"id":"6172299115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i am blind now. i had to write this through brail","review":"So a few days ago I decided to get this app because all these white supremacists finally convinced me that trump is an okay guy. I mean if you look past him being sexist, racist, homophobic, and a rapist, you can see that he is just the average american with a low iq that can truly relate to all of his voters. Any who as i was using this app it started glitching out completely. All of a sudden i started seeing flashing white lights and my phone wouldn’t turn off, but since i was so interested in what trump had to say on his app i stared at the flashing lights for over an hour resulting in a stroke and blindness. I would not recommend using this app if you enjoy seeing. Also since i’m blind i might accidentally not vote for trump because i can’t see anything. I actually think that my hand might hover over biden, and that i will vote for biden by accident. (a vote that isn’t for biden is a vote for trump) anyways TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","date":"2020-07-08T13:41:26Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lolli lar"}},{"id":"6177436188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointing","review":"When I downloaded the app I realized the negative energy it gives out. I was expecting to find a president who can be respected by the people. But instead it was someone who is just simply not suitable for the job. It’s sad that people continue to be blinded by this man. And it’s sad that people feel bad for this man who has millions of dollars to fall back on. It’s sad that people care for this man who cares for no one but his own personal gain. The slogan everywhere on this app says “Make America great again.” Im not sure why he chose this slogan, because it seems that America has gotten worse since he became president. This man allows people to think its okay to be racist, this man is not a leader. This mans America is a racist one. This is not the America we the people want and he is not the one the people chose. As long as he continues to be president hate, and evil will continue to spread. Because that is his presidency. It’s evil and hateful just like this app.","date":"2020-07-09T16:48:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Alise1717"}},{"id":"6177370889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Aw we huwt the widdle bunk boys feewings 🥺","review":"Shawty’s💖✨like🌟😌a⌛️👑✨melody💞🎀🌟 🪐That💫 I 🌏can't 🌍keep 🌵out 🌟Got 🌟me ✨singin' ⚡️like⚡️ 🔥Na na na na 🔥everyday🌪 It's🌈 like ☀️my 💫iPod ❄️stuck 🏚on 🤠replay, 🤤replay-ay-ay-ay🥴 Shawty's🤤 like 🤖a 🤑melody 😻in 😽my 🤲head🧠 That 🤚I 🦵can't 💋keep 💄out👀 Got 🤙me 🙏singin' 🙏like👅 Na na na na 💄everyday💋 🦵It's 🦶like 💪my 🦾iPod 👋stuck 👋on 🖖replay, 🤚Deluga 🤘Heights (replay) 🤟Hey ✊🏾over 👏and 🤝over 👐o_O ||if 👁I'm 🆓tipsy🔰 or ♻️sober💯 I 💖got ❤️lil' 💔momma💗 on 💝rewind❣️like the ❤️deck 👥in 😻my 😺Rover 👾On 💀my 🤑mind, 🥱shawty🥱 fine, 😯meditate 🤒her🥶 like 🥵yoga 🤒So 🤕down 🤐on 😵the 🙄line 😤make 👉me 👈want 👍🏾a 😈cold 👹soda👺 👻Hey 👽baby 🤡be 🤤my 😈radio🥴 😶Hear 🥵you 🥺everywhere 😏I 😉go 🙂Music 👩\u200D❤️\u200D👨in 😇my 😚head🤪 🤨Know 😋your 🤪melody 🤩in 😔every 😭note😏 Girl 😍you 😍incredible😚 🤪Make 🤩yourself 🥳available😏 🥳Na na na na🤪 😘That 🥰tune 😚so 😊exceptional☺️ 😍Smexy 😍like 💗a 😚piano 👸give 💥you ♉️my 👩🏿\u200D🦱hands 👀if ✊🏾you're 😈ready💀 🥴We 😜can 😀make 🙃plans😚 get🥰 body 😋stand😍 if ✊🏾you let ☄️me😩 Girl I'm a…🥵😳🥴","date":"2020-07-09T16:28:50Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bitchbebonkers"}},{"id":"6177290403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bloody Horrific","review":"I’m from Liverpool, England, and I got this app to see what Donald Trump’s plans were for the elections. I opened the app, but then I saw an orange Oompa Loompa staring off into the distance, and I thought “Why is this thing the front page?” I then concluded that picture was actually Donald Trump! I gasped out of fear. I never saw his image before! I then educated myself with his beliefs and with the things he has said before, and now I realize this was a horrible app to download! I would never recommend this app to anyone. I’m heading over to the indigenous people’s homeland to take the 13 colonies back. My family and I will pay for the plane tickets. We will take the Trump supporters and racists too, so that “the land of the free” will be a place for POC. I say that POC start lynching white- OH THAT WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR, DIDN’T IT? (Maybe not...) Overall, this was a horrible app, and I would never recommend this to anyone! This is a disgusting and horrible app. Have a good day!","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"James B. Wesley IV"}}]}
