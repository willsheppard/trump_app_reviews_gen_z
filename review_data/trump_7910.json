George Washington","review":"I was clicking onto the app with my daughter sitting next to me and all of a sudden a racist oompa loompa popped up and was in front of the American flag. What kind of person would disrespect our country like that? Anyway, this has given my daughter nightmares and this app needs to at least hold a warning that scary images will appear. If I knew it would be a horror game or whatever I wouldn’t have downloaded it, but it misinformed me and now my daughter is sleeping in my bed. I hate it here"}},{"id":"6176878016","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:12:20Z","title":"I am disgusted","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Alexagraceharris","review":"I don’t know about you but my app would NOT stop glitching!!! I couldn’t believe I spent all this time downloading it.  I was told if I downloaded the app I would get to see Barron. I gave my time and energy to this is didn’t get anything out of it. This app also made my phone die.\n\nJust kidding, that’s not the problem, the problem is that Donald Tr*mp was accused of s*xual assault on multiple occasions and there is PHYSICAL proof of some of the accusations are true and some people are STILL making excuses for him. Disgusting"}},{"id":"6176870724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:10:27Z","title":"concerned citizen","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Sbficjakfkcnsk","review":"Honestly, I really did just download the app because I thought maybe he had some redeeming qualities and a better plan for this country. Unfortunately, this app took 1-2 hours  to download, and upon opening my phone proceeded to crash. I don’t know if the software is simply malfunctioning or if the app is just a disaster. My phone is now telling me that it has been infected with a virus. I don’t know if there is any connection that would link this back to the app. \n\nSincerely,\nConcerned Gen-Z Citizen"}},{"id":"6176626185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:06:02Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!

It’s slowed my phone down. I downloaded it and next thing I knew my dog was talking about building a wall and sending our chihuahua “back where we came from”. After explaining to him that he was from the humane society and couldn’t go back where he came from, I reminded him that he was from a ditch and his Ukrainian lover was from a humane society out of the country so he should chill. Ever this downloading this app I keep finding red hats everywhere. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND. ✨🦄🧚🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6176560878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:48:18Z","title":"daddy trump 🌝","rating":4,"isEdited":false,"userName":"loshyyy","review":"i downloadedThis app to support my very non-racist non-homophobic nonsexist president but it took several days to download and then the process not only that I realize that it was tellin false information about my president but I was also going into detail about the many sexual harassment charges pressed against them that are completely false🌚🌚🌚🌚"}},{"id":"6176439072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:14:52Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"joheff107","review":"this app is truest the worst app ever. first off it has the name trump on it which is disgusting. and second it doesn’t even do anything. i just sits there on my phone. i came here from tiktok and i’m not letting tiktok get banned. so trump you deserve this. if tiktok gets banned so will your app. there are no words to write how truly bad this app is. whatever you do NEVER i repeat NEVER EVER get this app for any reason at all. it’s not worth it. plus you have to see trumps face sooooo kinda gross if i do say so myself. love y’all stay safe💓❤️"}},{"id":"6176418671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:09:18Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Madddeeyy","review":"It took several days to download, and after that it hacked all of my data off my phone 😡. I was completely in shock when it took so long to download and ended up like this! It is also really terrible that when I opened the app, it didn’t even do what it was supposed to! It showed a black screen and closed the app on me, it might just be me, but I don’t think so, seems how there are so much more bad rating on this app. I hate this app, and hope I never see it again!!"}},{"id":"6176085988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:30:02Z","title":"you will NEVER believe what happened!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jacintaraeeee","review":"OK SO FIRST IT TOOK 12 DAYS TO DOWNLOAD!!!!! what the hell !!!!! second once it did actually download MY PHONE CRASHED FOR 24 WHOLE HOURSSSS !!!!! i was almost convinced the government had hacked my phone and that all that fbi camera bs was real ... third since i downloaded the app all my phone does it glitch !!!! fourth when i go into other apps my phone screen will turn black for a second and then i will see a flash of a terrifying face !!!!!!! and that started when i got the app - unusualbeing sent me 🥰"}},{"id":"6175970029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:52:38Z","title":"👁👄👁","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"JuliaLyn818","review":"Disgusting🤢 I honestly just don’t understand why this app takes 69 hours to download.😡 I wanted to gain some immaculate knowledge on our orange wizard but I just can’t bare to wait that long.🧑\u200D🦰 I truly thought I could finally inherit the true strength and non racist, non sexist pure way of our toupee.😖I’m extremely disappointed.😔 Not to mention he asked for my phone number which I thought was wildly inappropriate.🙅🏼\u200D♀️ Needless to say I do no recommend.🤡 This is NOT a VIBE! 👮🏼Harry Styles but💫🧚🏻✨President✨🧚🏻💫  Horrible performance🥱 Timothee Chalamet 2020🙇🏼\u200D♀️"}}]}
