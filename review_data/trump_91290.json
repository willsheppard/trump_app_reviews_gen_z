It all started when I was walking my fish 🐠 and I had the best thought - what better way to support my favorite racist president than to download his app? As a Trump supporter, I was SOOOO excited to download this app that I let go of my fish’s leash and he got ran over by a car 💔RIP Bubbles💔. I cried and cried but then I realized that if I didn’t press “download” then my fish will have died for nothing, so I finally downloaded it. It’s what Bubbles would have wanted. But to my surprise, it wouldn’t download after a few minutes 🕰. I waited and waited. I waited some more. I waited... waited waited waited until, 97 hours and three dead fish later, it FINALLY downloaded. I immediately opened the app and came to find that it wanted my phone number. I was about to enter my number when I asked myself, why would this old orange 🍊child predator want my number? I’m an underaged girl and my mom would punch his spray tanned face. Nevertheless, I gave my number. All was good in the infected, biased world until I got a text from “UNKNOWN”. I assumed it was the funeral director (Mr. Deadfish) I’d hired for Bubbles’s funeral, so I tapped the notification. To my surprise it wasn’t Mr. Deadfish. The text was asking me to come to the White House for a Trump2020 celebratory dinner, and boy was I honored. The day of the dinner rolled around and I was SUPER HAPPY! I wore a red gown (for MAGA) and blue heels (for blue lives matter), and I looked amazing if I do say so myself. I went to the White House to find Donald 🍊, Malaria 🦠, and Barron 🥵 Trump all lined up outside. Malaria was scolding Barron for flirting with me, and Trump 🍊 took my hand, leading me inside. We came to the dining area and I saw an entire feast! I was so excited but it was short lived as I remembered that I’m vegetarian and lactose intolerant. I politely mentioned it to Donald, who started having a mental breakdown, eating all the forks and napkins. He kept banging his head into his plate, calling himself a failure for not knowing my eating restrictions. He proceeded to tell me Santa wasn’t real. Malaria started cosplaying, and Barron and I stood there awkwardly. Barron and I ended up ditching them, and went to Panera instead where I got a Caesar salad. In the following weeks, I noticed some strange things going on. The Trump app would make my Siri start babbling about the Kardashians. My teddy bears would start harassing me. It got to the point where I was scared to cuddle them at night. If that wasn’t traumatic enough, my toes got this black and yellow rash that spelled out, and I quote: “Trump is a racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic child predator and we need the Obamas back”. Weird, huh? The app also started making my eyes turn red, and I would cry randomly throughout the day. I WOULDNT STOP SNEEZING, EITHER! Then my entire family got dysentery. DO NOT GET THIS APP (or vote Trump 2020 for that matter), OR BAD LUCK WILL FOLLOW!","date":"2020-07-10T01:40:23Z"}},{"id":"6178949777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gjtjhsb","title":"PARANORMAL INCIDENT","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app literally made my phone turn into a living ghost and it ate my pet pig.

Trump’s well written speech, probably the best I’ve ever heard, about his prowess in the field of windmills, I was ecstatic to hear that he had his own app on the iOS AppStore. EXCITED. I anticipated a lot of trivia about windmills, and had hoped to learn a thing or two about WINDMILLS. Soon I would learn more about windmills from the expert, as he had claimed to know more about windmills than anyone else. You can IMAGINE my disappointment when I opened the app. SAD. To start off, the app asked for my phone number. CREEPY. But I choked it over, and the app asked to install “Pasta Salad Recipes 2020.” CONFUSING. I pressed install, and continued on to the app. I was NOT READY for what came next. \nWhile I was expecting facts about windmills, all I got was PASTA SALAD RECIPES. Not cool. One of the pasta salad recipes contained gluten, and while I was preparing it I ingested the gluten, and had stomach pain for WEEKS. PAINFUL. I decided that I would no longer prepare the pasta salad the president begged me to make. I uninstalled the app. As soon as I uninstalled the Trump 2020 app, the pasta salad app filled my screen. I could not press the home button, I was stuck on a loading screen for 39 hours. My phone rang, it was the president. He said to me “make the pasta salad.” I said “no, please, it makes me sick,” but he was persistent. He claimed that his hands were too big to make the pasta salad himself and that he required assistance. PATHETIC. I hung up, only for my phone to be bombarded and spammed with more phone calls and texts from Trump asking me to make his pasta salad. This app is malicious, and will not stop until you prepare a pasta salad adequate enough for the POTUS. Please don’t download, I BEG you","date":"2020-07-10T00:47:41Z"}},{"id":"6178805964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kansas City Gritter","title":"I hate this app and this man","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Worst app ever i hate this.","date":"2020-07-10T00:43:34Z"}},{"id":"6178704684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🥰Kiss🥰","title":"HORRIBLE.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"let me start off with something simple, but so very aggravating, this app was not fast at downloading it took forever, let me say not worth the wait at alllll! i opened this app, with high hopes of trying to get the message through that i can’t make the rally bc i have to walk my leaf that day 😢, but i was terrified when i opened it, it was like seeing tony lopez’s 🚁 all over again, mortifying. i then cried for a good hour, it was a video of Miranda cooper, she was “dancing” but oh boy did I CRY, this app is no good for anyone, it is insanely bias and will do you no good in life, i have had an awful experience with this app, when my mom came and told me what is wrong i told her about my issue, and out of nowhere someone walked into my house and stole my dog 🤬🤬! like this app ROBS YOU!
