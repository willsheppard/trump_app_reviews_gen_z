When we found her she was holding her phone, not long after we found her we learned that before she died she had been using this app. Therefore this app killed my grandma. Overall I would like to say that this app is disgusting and disgraceful. I hope to see it taken down as it is so absolutely awful that it kills innocent old ladies.","title":"Killed my grandma","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤪🎉🥳","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173137526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horribly ran and set up. Everyone supporting it must be crazy because this man is racist. Official trump 2020 app is probably the worst app on here, and there’s no way it should stay. It brought cockroaches and many other bugs. It’s smells horrible and now I’m living in fear 🤧. He’s doubled national debt, created less jobs for Americans, and taken away health care for LGBTQ+\n Not only that, but when you launch the app HORRIBLE music is played and my ears are still recovering.

Little did I realize what everyone was telling me was true. Even Sleepy Joe would do better than this! Shortly after downloading it, I got texts in Chinese from random numbers, and I even got scam callers! I didn’t know what was happening at first, but my granddaughter told me Trump sold my information! I am furious and heartbroken that he would do such a thing to his loyal supporters just for a few bank.

I just wanted to support our lord and savior, Trump, but I had to uninstall it. However, when I attempted to do this, my phone began to SCREAM at me, saying words like “Snowflake” and “Trump 2020”. It scared me half to death! Very bad app, had to get a new phone because it would not stop screaming at me.","title":"Very stink app","isEdited":false,"userName":"juicybutterlips","date":"2020-07-08T17:06:39Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172979896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was curious about what the president and his second term. I went on here to see how he is presenting himself. The app functions horribly. There is a major issue with an orange flashing screen that caused a major headache. I was hoping to maybe take a survey or two to see what they are trying to gather information on and found that the questions are so horribly biased that they are completely invalid. \nIf I could rate lower I would.","title":"Horrible experience!

I came to support trump. But instead I get a terrible experience on the app. This is terrible and I hope that other customers don’t have to go through this. However the customers thought, this should not be on the App Store. It just is not a good app at all. I never hated something so much in my life. It has a horrible quality and it’s very laggy and ugh, it’s so bad. 👹💀☠️👽🤡😾🤢🤮🤕","title":"TERRIBLE 💩","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alexa 🍊👄🍊","date":"2020-07-08T16:19:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172854744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in a way of trying to find a reason to maybe understand our ignorant, r_cist, homophobic, CHILD of a president. But just as i had suspected the apps content was filled with disturbing content and even had the \"president\" himselfs nudes leaked on HIS own app. Im in disgust but not only by what he cannot control on HIS app, but by how so many poor unfortunate souls support him.
