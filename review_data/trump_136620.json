Someone told me that if I download this I would meet the king of burgers. And HELLOOOO why wouldn’t I want to meet Spongebob Squarepants?? 😤 The lady named Ivankkka licked my forehead before I got into the boat that took me on a ketchup river, she said I tasted like lettuce. (She said I’m skiNNYYYYYYYY) She smelled my bff’s toes (S/O to squiddy 🦑✨) and said they smelt like pickle juice. We were like 👁👄👁 She gave us half a bottle of mustard 😰 and passed out.. but good service though ngl. I wasn’t able to meet Spongebob so I punched Larry (not Garry) while Patrick just watched. Sandy was nowhere to be seen. Mr. Krabs ripped us off my charging us a second time after we paid the first time at the ketchup river entrance😡 wait where was I going with this? Oh, yeah. My shoe- idk what happened to it. I just lost it somewhere under my bed"}}]}
