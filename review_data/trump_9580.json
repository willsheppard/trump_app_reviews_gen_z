Had high hopes and was excited for it to download. Took TWO DAYS to download and when I opened it requested my SSN. I put it in because I want to help Trump, then it took me to a site with very inappropriate content and I have many viruses on my phone I have to pay to get fixed. Not appropriate for children or families or anyone. Extremely frustrating. #settlingforbidenbecauseofthis","date":"2020-07-08T21:18:37Z","userName":"Lisa M Bols"}},{"id":"6173760118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"WOSRT ALBUM EVER","rating":1,"review":"Omg I used to love Taylor Swift when I was little, the self titled album and fearless were absolutely amazing, even after red though her creativity and taste in lyrics went straight down, I mean the Blank space song makes me want to rip my ears out ugh. Why couldn't she have just stayed with county?! And this new lover album is the worst thing I've ever heard. With all that said I'm actually a big Swiftie and love every Taylor Swift album or ep she has ever made, even lover! Taylor Swift for president 2020! Screw Trump! <3","date":"2020-07-08T21:18:14Z","userName":"KADEN Janssen"}},{"id":"6173748050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"very disappointed","rating":1,"review":"I was so disappointed when I got the app. It did not work for me and the widgets were inoperative. It was an awful experience to see low quality content and grammatical errors. I was appalled to see something so abhorrent I expected so much more. It has really changed my outlook on the quality and credibility of this app and other information regarding Trump’s administration. I would not be interested in downloading this app again.","date":"2020-07-08T21:13:50Z","userName":"karen mcchoo"}},{"id":"6173727659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible ✨","rating":1,"review":"Ok I cannot express how much I encourage this message, DO NOT GET THIS APP! First of all, I thought this game was gonna be so fun, but when I opened it, it showed a picture of an orange? Also it took FOREVER to even swipe through the picture. Jeez it was so annoying. Also I think the orange was a sign of a racist figure, but for legal reasons I will not say who. All I gotta say is, this is a disgusting, no good app and I hope it gets deleted off the App Store. Ty if u listen to my feedback ✨\n\nPs\nPlease delete this","date":"2020-07-08T21:06:16Z","userName":"Zayanahahahhahahs"}},{"id":"6173723880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible.","rating":1,"review":"The notifications never pop up on my screen even though I set the settings to do so. The app is sending misinformation and is leaving me with questions about what is the truth. I didn’t know that an app could spread so many lies and that people can be so engrossed in learning complete garbage. It’s appalling to me how many people have the audacity to neglect the true forms of this app and speak highly of the information that is distributed. This app is a disgrace.","date":"2020-07-08T21:04:55Z","userName":"Topanga Lorence"}},{"id":"6173712570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"My experience 😉😌💅🏾","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app not only did it take more than 5 hours to download🙄.

Purely horrendous. I was not entirely sure if an app for Donald Trump’s campaign would have gained support from people who know how to use technology, and sure enough I was right. The lack of involvement and campaigning to young voters on an app designed to do so is hilarious. As I opened the app, I had to see Donald Trump’s face, something I wasn’t expecting and didn’t enjoy. I was then asked to give my number to support his cause. That was not it. Never hope to see this again.","date":"2020-07-08T20:51:50Z","userName":"KCBeats"}}]}
