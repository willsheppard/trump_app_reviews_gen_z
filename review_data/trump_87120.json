As an American citizen I believe we should ALL be given a chance at life. (Just had to add that in since IM pro-life😌) but unfortunately once I downloaded this app my father, my mother, my sisters, my brother ALL got hospitalized for covid, since I believe ALL LIVES MATTER, I broke them out of the hospital and now they’re doing better than ever:) they have the WORST symptoms but I know with my Christian self and pro life self that GOD never had medical assistance and he will take care of this. I will always side with Trump. People ask me “what about his leadership for corona?” And I respond with “well despite America being the #1 country in the world with the most covid cases, MY president said “If we stop testing there would be fewer cases😌” HE is a smart man. People always want to say he has POOR LEADERSHIP. Now the only thing I see being poor is them. This app is great 👍 despite the glitching, despite my family being ✨sick✨, dislike his poor leadership, despite his sexism, dispute his mysoginistic self, dispITE his homophobic self, displayte his narcissistic self and overall just don’t pay attention to that. Just like MY president said “don’t test, less cases for corona,” I think we shouldn’t look at how bad of leadership skills he has but focus what what he’s done for our country. Like the EcOnOMY, even though there are more unemployed people then when Obama was around, and our economy is back to George bush, we just have to see past that. Trump has helped nothing but everything at the same time, thank you download this app and vote for JOE BIDEN.","isEdited":false,"title":"The glitcher"}},{"id":"6174204860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:04:00Z","userName":"bf hi dhcjd","review":"I almost had a heart attack","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad"}},{"id":"6174204727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:03:57Z","userName":"anynonoys","review":"Glitches too much","isEdited":false,"title":"Nope"}},{"id":"6174204025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:03:42Z","userName":"VOTEMANNY2020","review":"The amount of quality in this app my be on par with that smallness","isEdited":false,"title":"Donald Trump has a tiny pp"}},{"id":"6174190093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:30Z","userName":"6467user","review":"First of if trump tries to ban tiktok guess what?
