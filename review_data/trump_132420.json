I opened the app to see Donald Trump Having sexual intercourse with a donkey! 🤢 I’m surprised he could even get that tiny Cheeto in there! Disgusting! Anyway, Then I kept going through the app hoping it would be better and guess what?! It was trump punching a person of color in the face! Very disrespectful of him. I got a notification from the app saying they were using my credit card to buy all his merch! When I declined it, they came and stole my house. Note I live in a mobile home. Very rude of them.
