My phone has NEVER did that before. I tried to delete it and my phone literally went out and I had to pay $150 to have my phone to come on then for $100 for apple to delete the app. For someone who received a small loan of a million dollars you sure have bad taste in apps.","userName":"teojar"}},{"id":"6179598173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gen Z don’t go down without a fight.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:08Z","review":"This app is garbage y’all know this.

I have reason to believe that Trump himself has made this happen as he is likely frustrated with my decision to wear a green and yellow shirt when he has made it very clear that he only tolerates red and orange clothing. I am very unhappy that he has taken his frustrations out on my brand new samsung HX 56 phone. I was initially planning on voting for trump in the upcoming 2020 election but after downloading this disappointing app I will have no choice but to put my vote elsewhere 😔","userName":"Anna Roiger"}},{"id":"6179598142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Fitting: Worst App for the Worst President.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:07Z","review":"Worst App, Worst President","userName":"BidenBae"}},{"id":"6179597861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Shane YAW","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:24:01Z","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️but🦋I cant😞get💎through➡️the📎door🚪because💰my👩🏻booty’s💃🏻too2️⃣big🥴","userName":"12584589"}},{"id":"6179597667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App...","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:23:57Z","review":"I’m sorry, but there are a lot of ways to spread news and messages out to the public, but this is not it!\nI recently downloaded the app to gain more knowledge of what is going on in the world and our society and this has been the worst decision I have made. Too many unimportant messages and it’s crazy.. even upon signing up I don’t feel safe. \nToo much of your info is put out on display and I just feel overall disappointed with this app.","userName":"Serena;3"}},{"id":"6179597742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=┌(;￣◇￣)┘","rating":5,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:23:59Z","review":"Didn’t like it :/ hope it leaves the App Store","userName":"BounteousAuto44"}},{"id":"6179597622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😘","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T05:23:56Z","review":"If Trump wants to get rid of our app(tiktok) we'll get rid of his","userName":"Alex_Animations"}}]}
