When I first got the app I was expecting to get news and hopefully get help to change my perspective on my wonderful totally non racist non sexist president. When I got the app it asked to share my location for email AND phone number which I find incredibly weird considering this is a news app and all but I continued. After it asked for gender, race and birthday which I cautiously put down. As I identify as the female species and African American that’s what I entered, after some minutes the app completely froze and wouldn’t open back up. Soon after my phone started to blow up with messages of sexist jokes racial slurs and everything in between. The same went down for my email and it was non stop. My phone continued to be blown up with unknown numbers of men or women with malicious intent and full of death threats. I tried to delete the app but it wouldn’t allow me I even restarted my phone but my phone wouldn’t let me delete it and soon I got phone calls that I didn’t bother to pick up, after my phone completely went unresponsive. I DO NOT RECCOMEMD🤢🤮😑👎🏾","title":"Horrible 🤮😣😔","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"{/X/}"}},{"id":"6175064522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:27:57Z","review":"Hi guysss, I came here to tell you to NOT download this app. It all started when I went outside to walk my rock Giuseppe as I normally do. But this morning I simply could not find him. This was a traumatizing event for me. I called Dixie for advice and she said ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆. I decided to take her advice and download this app to see what my racist, rapist, terrible president is doing.  My life flashed before my eyes. My therapist gladly took me in for a session. She said I should adopt a dinosaur and set up an account on tinder for it to find true love. I swipe right to find the Cheeto on my screen 👁👄👁 so I run to my fridge to get milk since my mouth is burning from how spicy the Cheeto looks. My phone begins to vibrate and I panic because my doorbell rings. I open the door and James Charles is there saying HI SISTERS. My day ends and all I can say is that you should not download this app. It’s dangerous. It has made me repeat the same song in my head all day. ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃ 🧚🏽🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♀️\nA fire song fo sho but you don’t want lil huddy serving you ice cream at cold stone like he did for me. I asked for cotton candy and he gave me chocolate silly billy.

IT wouldn’t shut up 🤐 it went on for HOURS i Tried everything to make that thing shut up. i throw it out the window Flushed it down the toilet, drowned it in the ocean but it just came back LOUDLY. i’m currently on the run and in hiding from this.

At first I didn’t pay it any mind but then I started getting these emails EVERY DAY and I’m not gonna lie it creeped me out a bit. This went on for about a month, then I decided that I should reply just to see what would happen. As I expected there was no response but I still continued trying just to see what would happen, then finally on July 7th I got a reply saying “Hey it’s DT here I was wondering how your doing send a pic and your name so could contact you”. When I tell you I almost peed myself I’m being for real I had NEVER gotten anything like that sent to me in my life so like anyone else would do I didn’t respond. But it got me thinking “DT”? It HAS to mean Donald Trump right? I meant it is HIS app who else could it be. Anyways the creepy/ sexual emails are still coming and honestly that was very scary considering that I didn’t really put THAT much info it definitely freaked me out that he was able to track down my email.  Donald Trump was raped and sexually assaulted many people including MINORS throughout his life time (Karen Johnson, Jean caroll, Ava Johnson, etc to say the least). In my eyes he should have already been a convicted sex offender. This is UNACCEPTABLE please remove this app","title":"Donald Trump","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"duhcdfbifhhdd"}},{"id":"6177230755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:48:40Z","review":"this honestly is an awful app. i went into this thinking it would be bad but oh boy it’s worse than i thought. he makes you put your phone number in BEFORE you even get to see the app. now that’s manipulation if i’ve ever seen it. but alas i did and what did i find? you have to enter more information about yourself and then you are met with a POINTS SYSTEM. oh if you donate a lot or share the app or refer a friend you get points (yippee) and you know where those points go towards? TRUMP MERCH. the lowest number of points to get a reward is 5,000 and $1=10 points so you have to donate $500 to get ANYTHING (and it’s only a $25 store discount). oh but get this. you can only donate 2500 points! so you have to get others signed up on the app to get ANYTHING. this is stupid as hell because you get 1 point if you share news on facebook and 100 points when you refer friends so to get to 5,000 points let alone 100,000 (the highest reward amount) is nearly impossible so i’m disgusted. i already hated the orange 🤮’man’🤮 but this is a ridiculous grab for attention. he doesn’t even give his views and plans on the app it’s just “give me money” “hate the dems” “meet me in all my greatness” so it’s useless unless you want to worship him. bad app overall. whoever made it needs to lose their job yesterday.","title":"silly orange man","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lilgriff2354"}},{"id":"6174962241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:55:36Z","review":"I downloaded this app to support my #1 fan (rump), not knowing that this app would be VIRUS filled!!!! As someone who is Black, I am very disgusted by the outcomes of this app. I had just downloaded the app and after not more than 2 minutes of using it, pop up ads about anal stitching popped up. I don’t even look that stuff up! Not to mention the 40-50 notifications I received after an hour of simply having the app on my phone. The app also decided to make my iPhone shutdown about 5 different times because the app would freeze and my phone would be dysfunctional. My home screen is now a picture of rump, which I would never change to since it was my 3 month old butterfly before, who I love very dearly. Also, the app stole my money after I decided to make a $5 donation. After making a donation ONE time, my PayPal notifications skyrocketed and every hour I have been getting a notification that “$5 was taken from your account” WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! I also have not received any confirmation emails which goes against the privacy policy so I have no clue if the money is still in my account or in some random red neck’s account. In conclusion, this app deserves to be disintegrated like maggots in kerosene. But remember, ALL APPS MATTER!!

I absolutely LOVED ❤️❤️❤️the way his hair kind of slid off his head. So hot🥵🥵🥵. But my little kiddos started screaming because the app started flashing ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ a message, and of course i was distracted with daddy trumpies gorgeous teupee and orange spray tan, that i didnt notice my kiddos being taken away by a giant UFO 🛸 🛸 . i screamed and demanded for the manager. So of course my icon dora the explorer 🧭 🧭 🧭 showed up at the door🚪 🚪 and she brought her minivan with her. We proceeded to chase the UFO and eventually we ended up at daddy trumpies tower🌆🌆🌆. We watched in horror as daddy trumpie pushed my kiddos out the UFO window. I was terrified. Then a miracle happened. Bernie sanders appeared out of a cloud ☁️☁️☁️and i screamed in joy. He rescued my adorable kiddos and flew them down to me. As a gift he gave them a pair of complementary mole rats. So kind of him😘😘😘. Dora then drove 🚗🚗🚗us back to our house🏠🏠🏠. When we arrived we noticed that the FBI had blown 💥💥💥up our house and daddy trumpie was dancing on top of its burning 🔥🔥🔥remains in a skin tight spandex. My entire family now needs several years of therapy. I would not reccomend this app. Very innapropriate. 😤😤😤","title":"My family needs therapy now😢😢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen S.

So with that I HAD to open this app (🤢🤮🍊) so I opened the screen and as soon as I did that, a life size holographic picture of trump formed right in front of my eyes, but it wasn’t just trump. You see.. trumps face was staring right at me. But his body took the form of a horse, by the time I realized this I had unconsciously backed up about half a mile from this “being”. Then out of nowhere, the horse came charging at me at the speed of an average walking human, which (to be honest btw) was much more scary than if he was sprinting at me. So with that, this whole situation was so repulsive I had no choice but to have a backwards erection (erection but downwards🤪) so that I could quickly chop off my temporary penis, the horse then started running faster at me, so I quick rated this app a one star and I’m still typing this review. The Horse is still running at me, very slowly. But hopefully when I’m done this scary horse will be gone. So wish me luck!!!!!!!!!!👁\u200D🗨👅👁\u200D🗨\n\n- A fellow infamous tik toker that saw that tik tok with the guy telling me to do this <3","title":"This app gave me an erection😍😘😻✨🔥","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Libby.334"}},{"id":"6176756608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:40:20Z","review":"So I was just walking through town looking at my phone when all of the sudden- BAM!! I had walked into a group of trump supporters protesting for all doctors to be replaced with the old-time plague doctors. Before I realized what happened, they surrounded me and threw me into their van. At first I was like, “Is this a febreeze commercial??😝😝” but when they gagged me and burned off my finger prints I started to suspect I might be wrong. They took my phone and forced my to tell them my password (cause they had already burned off my prints) and after hours of intense interrogation I caved and told them. They downloaded the app and after the 666 hours it took to download, the entire van (we were still in the van) started to glow orange. They all closed their eyes and started humming the national anthem, and this was when I escaped. I crossed the border and am now living in Canada under an alias, but I know they are still coming for me. Oh no. They’re here!! Tell my mother I loved her! *door gets kicked down**dust settles**i look up in horror to see someone in a Trump mask**they rip the mask off and it’s Trump!!* Goodbye cruel world!!! *they drag me out and I’m never seen again*\nCut to a week later, now I’m one of the Trump supporters protesting in favor of plague doctors. \n0/10 would not recommend this app.","title":"I now live in Canada🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kksuperwomen2"}}]}
