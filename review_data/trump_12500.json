It has been happening non stop since I put my phone number in and I think I am going to have to change my phone number. It’s unbelievable that the PRESIDENT’S app would do this. I would give 0 stars if I could.","userName":"Carson Tess"}},{"id":"6176425481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful","date":"2020-07-09T12:11:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"It keeps shutting my phone down every time i try to open it 🤨 very disappointing, just trying to get information about trump but I think it put a bug on my phone. Went to Verizon to try to see if that was the case but they told me it was just because the app was poorly done 😡 dONt download they will try to steal your personal information and spread false information about our president !!!!!!!!","userName":"galalyptis"}},{"id":"6176363488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T11:53:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is seriously the worst app on my phone. I tried showing it to my wife since we are hardcore conservatives and it crashed. We are thinking of voting for Biden just because of the stress it caused. We now have realized Trump actually is racist so we’d like to change our way of life and we’d like to open the idea of equality for all the races. Not just white supremacy. I urge y’all to do the same! I would leave it one star if I could. BIDEN 2020!!","userName":"Bãrrøń Trümp"}},{"id":"6176354489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISGUSTING I NEED TO SPEAK TO COPORATE","date":"2020-07-09T11:51:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was a happy camper getting this app to support my one and only king to find out its did not meet my expectations!!

My phone has never been the same! Ever since I downloaded this putrid app, my phone has been freezing! Now I can’t write as many bad reviews for the restaurants that mess up my orders to try to sabotage me! Also it did not let me do anything until I added a phone number.

It took 4 weeks to download. And while I waited I lost sleep staying up at night envisioning the fun I would have with this app and supporting our good ole ‘Mercian president. My life was completely consumed, I lost my job, I stopped eating and even using the bathroom. I was so wrapped up with the idea of this app downloading on my phone that my wife divorced me, took our 3 children, and filed a restraining order. It also my made my PP smaller. :(","userName":"BossPanda212"}},{"id":"6176008182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disastrous","date":"2020-07-09T10:04:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"If I could give it a zero, I would. It took over 2 days to finish downloading. Then, when I tried to open it, it would just glitch. I checked my internet and it is perfectly fine, so it must be the app. Plus, it was way too slow. I have seen apps developed by 5 year olds who run way better than this app. If doesn’t even do anything other than glitch. I am extremely dissatisfied.","userName":"ernesto dec"}},{"id":"6175982346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRID 💅💅💅","date":"2020-07-09T09:56:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The app took two weeks to load and glitches with fairy emojis every time I open it!!!! Get rid of this app it’s pointless. It’s a disgrace to even be called and app!!! I demand it gets removed off of the App Store. I wish I could give it 0 stars but sadly that’s not an option. It even starts to play random outburst of music whenever I open it!!!
