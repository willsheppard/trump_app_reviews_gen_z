Yes im from TikTok but after i downloaded it it just kept on telling me i was a peace of shii. Not only that but it hacked my phone and sent pictures of boogers to my friends.  If this app gets taken down that would be awesome because it would get rid of the viruses it put into my phone. So give the app a one star.

What!?!?! Limited to do anything and is controlling over choices. No mini games so that’s dumb. Wants my personal info.
