I am honestly in shock/ 😱disbelief😮. I got the app🤖 and out of no where 😯I see a picture of a man with a crazy look on his face👩🏾\u200D🦯. Not only am I stunned😮 by his looks😏 but his color🧡, his color is like nothing I have ever seen before. 🙃That is not the worst part🤔..... the worst part☝🏾 is that he doesn’t even know me and wants my information. Like who even is this guy🧐🤨? This is extremely unprofessional 😠😡and I am not at ease with this at all🤯. I have heard of this app a few times ⏰and realized it was our so called “president”🍊🥕.I decide to put my info in because maybe there will be good in this app💫. Well I was wrong the app was useless and didn’t do me any justice (just like bunker boy himself☺️). I got weird vibes from the app and as soon as I went out to eat with my family 🥰when I ordered a salad🥗. I bit into it 🤔unleashing utter disgust🤢🤮. I knew it was the app but decided not to jump to conclusions🥴🤐. A few moments later⏰as I was watching YouTube I saw my favorite 🤪🤞🏾youtubers (who are married btw☺️🥰) has their first fight on camera which they have never behaved  like that ever😭😭,which are nickocado avocado and orlin I was very sure it was this app but I disregarded it🙃. However later  in the day I went on a walk and passed out 😵....I had my suspicions 🤔🤨that it was this ☝🏾stupid 🥴cursed 😈app🤖 but I still had faith🤞🏾.Later today I was walking 🚶🏾\u200D♀️ and rolled🎲 my ankle 🦵🏾on a boulder ⚰️in the middle of Walmart ...and  that is when I was questioning 🤔if it was that app 🤖even more!! But the worst part is while I was sitting on the couch minding 💭my own business🤯 when dogs 🦮started viciously 😈attacking😤 each other 😶while sneezing 😖🤧... i took then to the vet and to found ou they are very very very allergic 🤧to each other that if they were to stay in the same room together one dog will turn in to a cat 🐈and the other will lose his stomach.. I was in complete😔 devastation 😭😭when I knew 🧐it WAS 🤠THIS ☝🏾STUPID 😡CURSED 😈🤬APP😡🤬🤯. That is when I lost 🤯all hope 🤞🏾in this app 🤖and in our “president”😡!! Not only😔 has he brought bad luck 😈upon my day BUT he also sent me a message 💬saying📢 I deserved😏 it😡!! I 🤩was in such 🥳shock😱😨😰I had a lot 🧐of hope🤞🏾 in this app 🤖and the president🔥🍊🥕(especially him!!😤) to only be disappointed 😔 and he clearly doesn’t 🤚🏾🚫care🤡 for every citizen in America 🤭🤫since he made a day so horrific🥴🤢😖. As soon as I deleted the app my dogs 🦮were cured🧪🌡💉, orlin and nik are a happy 😃 married 💍loving 🥰😘😍couple🤞🏾, and my ankle 🦵🏾is healed🤪.This is app🤖is terrible and cursed 😈who ever gives this app over one star is crazy🤕, you obviously 🙄you must like listening to 6ix9ine🤢🐭.
