Needless to say I took this into my own hands and decided to do a little more research and she did it not once but 5x! There was 5 videos of her queffs and while I enjoyed it it wasn’t very professional! 🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:56Z","userName":"Gawk Gawk Super 3000"}},{"id":"6173888470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Excuse me?","review":"The fact that people voted for such a self-centered baby is beyond me. Anytime something doesn’t go his way he pitches a fit. It’s amazing how fast something gets done when it effects him personally. He thinks he’s God’s gift to man when in fact he’s a parasite. Ugh!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:42Z","userName":"dumptrumpthetwat"}},{"id":"6173886051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TRASH","review":"I downloaded the app to get my daily political news.

Weak and low energy. One of the worst apps in the world. I believe this app was made for people with very SMALL hands. If you mistakenly were looking for the Biden 2020 app, be sure to avoid this spyware/malware FAKE NEWS app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:47:07Z","userName":"Don Juicy"}},{"id":"6173816300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨DONT DOWNLOAD ✨","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THiS this app made me get possessed by cockroaches  that were weirdly obsessed with cheese🧀 Cheetos.
