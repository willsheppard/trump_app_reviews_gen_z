I tried video calling with customer service to try and find her a cure so she would love me again but when they realized I am deaf and can only communicate with Sign Language they shut down the lighting system in my house so they couldn’t see me signing and everyone in the office laughed at me as I went into the fetal position and sobbed about my newly destroyed life.","date":"2020-07-08T21:27:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😢✨Worst App in App Store ✨😢","rating":1,"userName":"kinsabear"}},{"id":"6173769399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and it failed to open several times, crashing whenever i try to open it. When I finally manage to open it, I’m met with one of the members of the Loving Spoonful staring at me. They tell me they no longer believe in magic and begin to explain Flat Earth theory to me. The app is 2D therefor the world is 2 dimensional. The only dimensions are racist propaganda and locker room talk. Nothing is right here. As I navigated over to the Women for Trump section, I was met with a petition to make children legally able to sign their own non disclosure agreements. Strange to say the least.","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"userName":"Harry Balsœck"}},{"id":"6173769247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I found this app I was very excited. I love our president, and I would do anything to support him, but the app took 2 HOURS to install, and when I tried to open it, all I got was a white screen, and it never loaded. I thought I would give the app some time and try again the next morning, so I went to bed. The next morning, I woke up to a virus, and several notifications calling my grandma a racist! I promptly uninstalled the app immediately. Please do not install this app. Because of the virus, I am now broke, and living off of my dogs wet food.","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointing","rating":1,"userName":"Concerned, broke, racist"}},{"id":"6173652719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought Trump was short for tree stump and that this app was helping a good cause (saving the trees). Turns out... this app is doing the complete opposite and killing living beings. I’m not kidding. When I downloaded this app my plant instantly died. I was like whatever that’s a coincidence... then my pet fly died... I started to get suspicious. I opened the app and BOOM! My cat literally died. President Trump killed my cat. R.I.P. Mr. Scruffles. Save yourself and your loved ones... seconds after my cat died I got an email for Trump saying “thanks for bigly drinking the tremendous kool-aid that is also huge and the best” but I don’t know what that means","date":"2020-07-08T20:39:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Kind of confused...","rating":1,"userName":"CopAndWhiteMaleLover420"}},{"id":"6173630278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD\nI wish there was a way to give this app negative stars. It’s the worst app on the App Store. As soon as I downloaded the app, my phone began glitching , and turning off every almost 5 minutes. I’ve never seen my phone freeze this often, and when I make a call, it forces me out of the app. I had to delete it as quick as a possibly could because of the fear that my phone would crash and burn. \nPlease don’t allow this malfunctioning, useless app damage your phone’s interior and cause long term problem. \n- no ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T20:31:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"It makes your phone glitch","rating":1,"userName":"Shany😈"}},{"id":"6173595077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app was terrible. It took about two weeks just for the app to download and during that time it glitched my phone causing Siri to come on and for my phone to start recording without me pushing a single button. The inside workings of the app are very questionable with the app wanting extremely personal information as well as having a yellow star on a red background being it’s loading icon. I would not get this app as it appears Bunker Boy is trying to give information away to the United States’s enemies, an example being cHiNa.","date":"2020-07-08T20:18:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The name says it all 🟠","rating":1,"userName":"Bye Bye Bunker Boy"}},{"id":"6173586935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Dude so like I downloaded this app thinking that it would help me stay in touch with the election and stuff like that but like instead it’s feed was basically just people simping for a orange. Apart from that I think that it’s really good at spreading news about the coronavirus. LikeI started drinking bleach like our president asked of us and I definitely feel better I’m not worried about Covid anymore. Like my skin has gotten even whiter that’s how you know it’s working. though I have started coughing up blood. But on the bright side I know that my cough won’t be spreading Covid.","date":"2020-07-08T20:15:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible","rating":1,"userName":"Karensimping"}},{"id":"6173580094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible!! It gave me at least 3 different bugs in my phone and now my screen won’t stop glitching and it barley works anymore when I tap on it. Not to mention it keeps on playing this weird music very very loudly even when I’m out of the app which makes it very hard to take my phone out in public :/ I’ve even tried to turn down the music and nothing works and I’ve tired restarting my phone and nothing has worked. Don’t download this app unless you don’t want a working phone anymore.","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gave me multiple viruses","rating":1,"userName":"mjchild"}},{"id":"6173570475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded the app and it seemed fine at first. Then it asked for my card information and as I was typing my info it automatically put in the rest of my info...and I don’t got Apple Pay. Then it sent me an email saying that I was accepted into the FBI and I was like WhAt?!?!! So I was like hecky’s nah....so I un downloaded the app, but it just keeps downloading itself point is I don’t want to be in 🎃 army cause i need to be a history teacher so that history quits repeating itself...or people like Cheeto🚼 over there is really gonna corrupt more minds !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever encountered DON’T DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"userName":"Yaisa111"}},{"id":"6173463518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app, even though I haven’t opened it, just seems grim and I’ve heard that if you open it you get herpes so I would really not recommend this app. My friend got it and she immediately got herpes and it honestly was very hard for her. She kisses her family goodbye on the lips because they are weird like that but, it made there whole family get it. It’s just very sad and I really don’t want anyone getting it. So be responsible and just don’t get the app and make a one star review. Remember stay safe and wear a mask and also don’t get this app.","date":"2020-07-08T19:33:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I just really don’t want herpes!","rating":1,"userName":"Birdietkaczyk"}}]}
