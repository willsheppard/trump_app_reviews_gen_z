It felt outdated and inefficient. It’s not to say the app didn’t work, it just should be significantly better. Also, the logo kinda looks like poop.","userName":"nadexeeee","title":"Inefficient","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177428518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the app took 20 hours to download. then, it took up the rest of my phone space (10 G). and, as if it couldn’t get any worse, it took all my data and wiped my phone clean, WHILE giving me 14 different viruses!! this app is the worst thing you can get! it needs to be removed from the app store IMMEDIATELY. i’m not part of the “gen z fighting back” or whatever. i hate this app. officially for biden bc of this terrible experience i am on a new phone rn. i expect this bigoted orange b*tch  to pay for it. i am outraged.","userName":"ciagaythe3","title":"irate😤","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177428062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This all started when I downloaded this TERRIBLE app... So I was on the toilet taking a massive poop when I downloaded the app to look at pictures of our beloved ✨CHEETO✨and I was having a great time until this happened... The app kept crashing and by the time I was actually on the app, I was done using the bathroom. So while wiping, I accidentally got some poo on my finger. Not thinking much of it, I still touched my phone because I was desperate to see pictures of the oversized Oompa Loompa. This was the first time it was working without crashing, so I was extremely excited. But when I touched it with my poopy finger after having an amazing time, it completely crashed. After a few seconds, it was obvious there was a virus on my phone. Again, not thinking much of it, I went on the app again cause I NEEDED to see more pictures. You don’t wanna know why. When I went on the app again I got teleported into space by a bunch of aliens claiming they work for anonymous but their facade is working for trump. They gave me this strange juice, and I drank it cause I was thirsty. I then proceeded to turn into a green alien. So DON’T download this app unless you want your phone to crash, get a virus, you get teleported to space by aliens, drink a nasty juice, and turn into an ugly green alien. 🥰","userName":"✨fugly✨ booty poo 🥰","title":"✨DISGUSTING✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177427346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app and now I lost all of my brain cells.
