I had to try and restart my phone 5 times for it to open and when it finally did, it crashed 3 minutes in. I would not recommend this app to a friend. It’s unreliable and not worth the time.

When the app finally downloaded i opened it to see “vote trump 2020 for a racist future”! i decided to ignore that though. i processed to look around and then went to sleep. I woke up the next  morning with a notification from the app! 😻 i opened it to see a message from the one and only michael jackson telling me to go to the white house and save barron!! i picked up my bag and sprinted all the way to washington ( sorry for the selfpromo but i should be in the olympics)!! 🤩 i made it there and fought the guards and ofc i won!! I found barron and grabbed him and we ran! before we could escape i heard a voice, it was... MELANIA TRUMP!! she asked if she could run for the hills with us and i said why not 🤪we started running and we heard footsteps in the hallway.. then DONALD TRUMP screaming for💕in💕her. LORD IT WAS SCARY. I THEN PICKED MYSELF UP AND STARTED JUMPING ON HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE TURNED TO ORANGE JUICE WHICH THE STAFF COULD DRINK!!! #nothrist!! 😽we made it out alive and i felt so good to have accomplished something in my life for once! i fell asleep and woke up at 3am to “FOR💞IN💞HER💞FOR💞IN💞HER” I SCREAMED AND JUMPED OUT OF BED AND WENT TO MY PARENTS ROOM. I WENT INSIDE AND I CANT UNSEE WHAT I SAW... I WOULD HAVE A BETTER SURVIVAL CHANCE OUTSIDE NOT IN THERE 😳😳!! I QUICKLY RAN AROUND MY HOUSE TO FIND MY PETS AND I FOUND MY CAT EATING MY DOGS 🍑 :O!! THEN LOW AN BEHOLD I TURNED AROUND AND I SAW.. TRUMP NINJAS!! I FOUGHT THEM THO!! trump was outside my window all sad and i asked why.. he said cause you fought my ninjas ;(((. i felt so bad that i knocked myself out with a fridge.
