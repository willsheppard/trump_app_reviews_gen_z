I was awake the whole time this was downloading. UNBELIEVABLE 🙄. Worst app in history of apps. Once I opened the app it started lagging. It was so dumb since I waited so long for this app to download. I started to vomit 🤮 once it stopped lagging since it showed people naked.DISGUSTING, PLEASE TELL YOUR PARENTS IF YOU CAN USE THIS APP. 😭😭\nI go to therapy now. I can’t sleep anymore and get nightmares everyday from the photos that popped up on the app. 😢😢😢\nSTAY SAFE GUYS. DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP. 😢😢😢","userName":"lizzie👯\u200D♀️","title":"TOOK LONG TO DOWNLOAD 😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6178652347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:44:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I think I need to purge my phone after getting this app. It’s starts off by asking you your zip code, invasion of privacy much!!!! Also it’s made my phone crash so many times and think it’s breaking my phone. Do not get this for gods sake don’t do it 🤢🤮. Also every time I open the app a recording of trump whispering “mayonnaise” plays through my speaker, it make me really uncomfortable. And every time I go on my phone the app is in a different almost like it has a mind of its own 😱😨😰. I wish I had never downloaded the trumpets app, it’s too late for me but you can still save yourself by not getting it. Please help me, he is listening 👂.","userName":"e.cherpy","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6178651881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:43:57Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app had events that were months pasts, news articles that would completely glitch out or made no sense. It’s as if a kindergartner created this app and tried to sell it off as President trumps. The layout is ugly, the buttons takes forever to process when you’ve touched them, making the whole app freeze up. It’s more of a hassle then just going online. And, not only that, but it took hours upon hours to download. From the reviews it seems like I’m not the only one. This whole app is a scam, and it completely wasted my time. It’s infuriating that I even gave a sh*t after hours of faith.","userName":"rebeccccccccaaaaaa","title":"It’s not even worth it","rating":1}},{"id":"6178651167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:43:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"It didn’t quite take me as long to download the app as some other reviews I’ve read, but the installation process really dragged its feet. Once the app finally downloaded, it asked for my phone number BEFORE even asking for my name (suuuper sketchy). I entered those ten magical digits, then waited for the verification code to send... and waited... and waited... until I gave up and deleted the app. My hypothesis is that Mr. Donald rounded up some Trump University freshmen and assigned them the overly ambitious task of developing a functioning app. I don’t usually give 1-star reviews. If an app adds ANY positivity to my day I make sure to give it at least 3 stars. But alas, this app did not.","userName":"mmmmmmmm just work","title":"Disappointed in Trump, his Presidency, and this App","rating":1}},{"id":"6178650487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:43:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ugly, impossible to understand, detrimental to the american democracy. Say it with me. DEES GOOS TANG. We can not stand it. We must ban it. Send it to jail.","userName":"jennasimmons11","title":"This app is crusty and dusty and old","rating":1}}]}
