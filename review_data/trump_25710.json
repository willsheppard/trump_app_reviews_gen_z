This man just isn’t what I thought he was when I voted for him in 2016. He’s not the man I fell in love with. If he ever wants to win back my heart, he truly has to change for the better. I apologize, but I’m calling it quits with him.","userName":"Quaran teen","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172240733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:25:12Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible do not download","review":"I just downloaded the app and I can’t even go anywhere I open the app and it just freezes it is so annoying I want to learn more about Trump form this app because I don’t know a lot about Trump and I thought this would’ve been a good app but it is just super bad","userName":"the blue dog farts","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172163895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:04:01Z","rating":1,"title":"So unbelievably bad","review":"I put in my phone number and a few minutes later i got thousands of texts saying “Trump 2020”. They began to say “You idiot, Vote for Trump.” What is this? I then got a call and picked up from the same number that was texting me. It was an old wrinkly man yelling at me vote for Trump or else I’ll get deported.

The first thing I saw was the ugly Cheeto man pooping on himself and crying uncontrollably while in the fertile position. I thought it would get better but it turns out he doesn’t actually have anything in his brain, just a bunch of racist, homophobic, ignorant nonsense.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"Look, I’m all for supporting our president’s app, however, as soon as I downloaded the app, all hell broke loose. I currently have the FBI on my tail because the app has taken control and was downloaded Trump’s kiddie stash onto my device. This happened before the app proceeded to grab me by the p**sy. IT REALLY HURT 😢😭. For the love of God, please don’t download this app","userName":"TINTIN Swoodie 321","isEdited":false}}]}
