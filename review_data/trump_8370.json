There isn’t any lthing to really even do on it. You can message people and find people to follow, but you can’t message or follow President Trump, only other supporters. And even then, there were not many accounts to choose from. \nDon’t get me wrong, I love President Trump and all his supporters, but this app really didn’t meet my standards. \nI regretfully give it one star for the disappointing platform, format, and user accessibility.","rating":1,"title":"Stupid honestly."}},{"id":"6174090695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:21:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"TheQuinSide","review":"hey can i was your my dad and my mom are you gonna was a great night and a good day at the airport i is that one day you have to go eat a little while ago to eat a little while you are in a little while you can go to get a drink or a drink while you're at home or not even gonna was the time of day going out for you to get your dad and you get to your dad to go eat with you guys so you don't wanna talk about to be like you and i was the time you got home you had to get your mom","rating":1,"title":"Ima just spam"}},{"id":"6174057795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:10:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Quinn:~}*","review":"After my morning ritual of binging Kaitlyn Bennett and chanting “all lives matter” through my mega phone, I downloaded this app to see my favorite Cheeto puff💋🥰😍.Have to say I’m VERY disappointed with the content. \n\nAs SOON as I downloaded the app, it asked for my number???? Spray tans and toupees do butter my biscuit but it was just too flattering for a man who goes after so many ladies and children.😔😖I expected more from such a articulately spoken, coherent, wise, conscientious, man who couldn’t handle fairy comments.\n\nThose blue haired leftist snowflakes(🤢🤮😭) are back at it again ATTACKING me; saying I’m racist, homophobic, xenophobic and more JUST for expressing my opinion???? They clearly haven’t heard of freedom of speech🙄🥱\n\nIn fact, I’ve never seen a thin person download this app🧐🤨😫\n\nIf I could give a 0 I would.","rating":1,"title":"This app killed my pregnant son🤬🤯"}},{"id":"6174044011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:04:47Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"colbybrockisthecutest","review":"every time i tried to open it all i saw was racist comments thrown at me. this app NEEDS to be taken down. it’s unacceptable from the amount of hatred this app holds. it was constantly homophobic and racist towards me. it constantly called me a “bat eater” or it was telling me that i need to go back to my country, even though i’ve lived in the US my entire life. it kept telling me that i brought the “Chinese virus” over and i’m not even Chinese! This app is horrible and needs to be taken down!","rating":1,"title":"absolutely terrible"}},{"id":"6174033612","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:00:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cheetah tt5","review":"I am truly disappointed and disgusted by the quality, look, and use of this app. You see, I downloaded to see when the next rally was, only to find when I opened the app a giant cheeto popped up on my screen. Next thing I know I get sent to the Cheetos website with 54 bags of Cheetos in my cart. From flaming hot, to regular, and all the flavors in between. I am truly outraged considering I only like cheeto puffs, and not regular twig Cheetos. I am completely and utterly enraged...never using this app again!","rating":1,"title":"Such a disappointment"}},{"id":"6173959337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:51Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"angel sanyasi","review":"I downloaded the app it Took 10 hours to download 😢 when it finally did MY HOUSE EXPLODED 😖😡 then A orange looking man 🍊chased me with a knife 😱 i was running 🏃\u200D♀️ really fast 💨 and..... my HOUSE WENT BOOM 💥 you won’t even believe what happen 😩 I FLEW UP THE SKY 🌌 That’s when I believed I could fly 🧚🏻\u200D♂️BUT then i realized IM ABOUT TO LEAVE EARTH 😨 until I shouted I WILL DELETE THIS APP.......then It stopped I was relieved 😪 but it didn’t last long WITH GREAT FORCE SOMETHING PULLED ME BACK i was in tears 😔 see kids DONT download THIS app  I repeat DONT it will cause you great misery 😓I will very scared 🤧🥺","rating":1,"title":"I ALMOST FLEW OUT OF EARTH 😤😡"}},{"id":"6173946962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:28:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Amurosa Declines","review":"I opened this app to accommodate the great raggedy orange we all know, but as soon as I signed up, inappropriate pictures of the elderly profusely flashed the screen. I am absolutely disgusted by this🤮. Shortly after a creature with no toes jumped on my roof and started thrusting its hips into the air👺. What kind of cursed app is this!?!?🤬 The wicked minds that created this should not be in the business of creating something so grotesque👎. The creature hasn’t left my roof and has started using it as bathroom💀. Someone please remove this perverse app from the App Store.😭","rating":1,"title":"Revolting..."}},{"id":"6173926794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:20:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bëaniê","review":"As soon as i went into the app it crashed and my phone turned completely off. When I turned it back on, my home screen had a picture of a cheeto with a toupee on and i was very frightened. I had to redownload all of my apps and get my photos back off iCloud because everything was erased. I think they hacked into my phone because trump saying “china virus” keeps repeating on my phone and it won’t stop. Please remove this app off of the app store","rating":1,"title":"Don’t bother downloading this crap"}},{"id":"6173887932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:06:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lexi😌🙈🤪","review":"I opened the app to see what looked like a grown Cheeto man almost in tears aggressively holding his fist in the air. This looked threatening and made me question who was running our country. And in front of the flag. He should be ashamed of himself for showing such an aggressive act in front of a symbol of hope and peace for all to see when opening the app. The app lags, takes forever to load, and the format is just horrible. Couldn’t find my way around anything. Not sure it even deserves one star","rating":1,"title":"🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6173813695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:38:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"madirileylol","review":"I cannot begin to comprehend the absolute trash that this app is. FIRST of all, it leaked all my information to the dark web and my identity was stolen along with my credit card information. I’m currently trying to pursue a lawsuit due to the many things this app has caused. While I was downloading the app my phone totally shut down and wouldn’t turn on for a few days after. Totally uncalled for. Once I tried to open the app all I heard was the Chinese National Anthem. WOW. I’m just- wow. Would not recommend.","rating":1,"title":"Jesus."}}]}
