For a billionaire Trump is really doing the most to make some change am I right !? In fact, there was even an AD for an X-rated website! How disgusting, as a mother I would NOT let my kids anywhere near this app and and mortified at any children who might’ve stumbled across it.

It is completely a bird and crashes constantly. When downloading this application it took an abundance amount of time to download . Then once I open the open it would stay for a minute or two then completely get me out of the app. It only did this to this particular app. Every  other app was completely fine. This app is horrible  should be removed. 1 star rating to this trump app.","title":"need to update it’s whole app","rating":1,"userName":"Emilygarcia.","date":"2020-07-08T20:14:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173578630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!🤬 i heard a bunch of people talking about  this app so i decided to cave in and download it.

The whole thing needs a system update ASAP. It’s really slow once it loads but the noises don’t stop. It’s constantly exiting out the app on its own and shows an error message. Don’t recommend this app at all, seems like a good app but it’s all just looks. Don’t waste your time downloading and if you do it better be to leave a 1 star review.","title":"Terrible 😭","rating":1,"userName":"Mtz_lis","date":"2020-07-08T19:59:44Z","isEdited":false}}]}
