I’ve got an outlet... I know you love to spend any leftover change and gold teeth you have lying around... I have a bargain for you... I have found a vehicle and I would like to buy it before someone else discovers it... I am asking all the aunts (since I’ve never asked for anything pourposly awaiting this moment) I am asking any and everyone to donate with reckless abandon to my cause... my 8th volvo... wonderwheels... will be it’s official name... the car is in Bremerton... low gem he has... it’s selling for 200 $ I will also need another 50-100 to get its needed fluids and any unforseen repairs... I am only asking for anyone to give what, if anything, they feel comfortable giving... I am also not asking for the money directly... but instead for it to be applied to the sellers Facebook... he is a legitimate seller on marketplace and anyone can see Shia d and the vehicle... I am asking that this be done quickly and today at 5-6 pm so I have time to get to Bremerton and retrieve my vehicle... I’ve had 7 of these very same make and model so I’m aware of its quirks and can triage and treat most any problem effeciently\n\n.... these cars in particular are also known as the million mile cars and this one is a 93 with only 150000.... just a baby.... so , if you have it to spare , get it ready and I will figure out the best way to collect from all if any donation sources.... if you have any ideas please feel free to streamline this for me... today I need to be a trusted member of society so I can get backing and have a smooth hustle..... I just need a car and I’ve found not only one , but a plan b as well... so let me know how The Who spiel sounds, and what you are comfortable with, and let’s get me mobile today..... I love you ... the iron is hot. I gotta strike ma, stand back....","rating":1,"title":"the circus is in town, mary.","date":"2020-07-09T18:26:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177751224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"max192947","review":"Horrible","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T18:26:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177750197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dylan the baddie 😻","review":"I absolutely love our orange ✨freak✨ and ✨pedophile✨ 😳✌️ of a president.

One of the main issues I have is that the app crashes after about 2 minutes of having it open. Even when I do get to use it it’s poorly designed and has a lousy layout, but what can you expect from an app promoted by a 70 year old soulless sack of skin. Anyways, another huge problem I have is that the app crashes my phone entirely very often. All I want to do is use Trumps app :(( and not being able to use it makes me feel trapped like the kids in cages at our borders. I can’t believe how many problems this app has to the point where it’s complete unusable. It just makes me feel sick to my stomach, almost as sick as wearing a mask during the rona pandemic would make me feel because it is a violation of my human rights. Please just send this app back where it came from or so help me because it is just absolutely not working.","rating":1,"title":"Needs a lottttt of work","date":"2020-07-09T18:24:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177745055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":":^.","review":"This app is trash you can’t really do anything with it plus I saw this orange smiling and it look really racist which in fact I almost went blind because of what I saw,I’m warning you not to open this app you’ll get traumatized if you aren’t already because of the orange.In conclusion, hope this app gets taken down because I will now have nightmares because of this app ✨✨","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app don’t ever get it 🤩💖💖","date":"2020-07-09T18:24:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177745035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ur dad jerry ✊🏿","review":"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
