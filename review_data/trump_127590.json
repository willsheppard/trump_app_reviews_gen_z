Some of us use Tik Tok we a coping mechanism and to find friends. I don’t like you; you racist homophobic orange. Now if you ban Tik Tok we will all know it’s because you got butt hurt because we made you think people were going to your campaign. Now reconsider banning Tik Tok ✨"}},{"id":"6177541276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"adifferentbrandofbean","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Bad App!!!!!","review":"Put a star because there’s no option to leave a negative amount of stars but in my opinion this app deserves (-1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) stars on basic principle"}},{"id":"6177539484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♀️✨🧚\u200D♀️save me-Baron ✨🧚✨","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","review":"I got this app because I wanted to see what absolutely wonderful and definitely not problematic ideas Donald Trump has for the Covid 19 but that is not what I got. When I got this app strange things stared happening to me. When I would get some food from my fridge I stared hearing trumps voice saying “ ooooo give me sum” or “delicious, just delicious” things like that. I wasn't to worried about it until I tried to do the bloody trump challenge (it’s like the Bloody Mary challenge but with trump) and he showed up in my mirror!!! It was so shocking that I built a wall in front of my bathroom with legos. I though it was over but then my phone started glitching out. Anytime I would try to look up something that has to do with Obama, Bernie, or anyone else he doesn’t like a trump face would show up and he said “ no no try again” I thought maybe I had been hacked but I went to the android store and they said no. I then gave the app one last chance and used the apps feature to call trump himself. He didn’t pickup which was very rude, but then that night when I went to sleep I saw a big blobby human shadow. I turned on the lights and it was trump! He then proceeded to kill me. After I died I deleted the app because I had enough of it. This app if not worth dying for. Do not get this app, I repeat do not get this app."}},{"id":"6177538779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"$horty B","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"👁👄👁READ THIS👁👄👁","review":"Hello There. 👁👄👁I Downloaded This App Because I Wanted To See If My Racist/Rapist President Had Anything “iMpOrTaNt” Plans For The Future.

This app made my phone act all weird. And me, being the kind and caring person i am, didn’t assume it was this app. Boy, was i wrong. Other apps kept glitching and exiting out, my screen would freeze, my texts wouldn’t send. It was awful. I thought to myself, “Huh. I wonder why this is happening, it couldn’t be.... could it??” And lo and behold, it WAS this nasty excuse of an app. I’m happy to say that i deleted it and my phone is now working better than its ever been. ✨💋💅"}}]}
