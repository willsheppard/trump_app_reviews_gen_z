The app is super tacky and it’s lags and it always crashes. It took 10 minutes for it to stay open without crashing. Would not recommend this app. It’s a waste of time.","date":"2020-07-09T13:56:22Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176770577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🤙🏼🤙🏽🤙🏾🤙🏿","title":"THE WORST","review":"First off this app took the entire DAY to download and as soon as I opened it, it drained my battery from 78 to 12% 😡 and it keeps making wierd noises come from my phone when the app isn’t even opened🤦🏽\u200D♀️🤦🏽\u200D♀️ I’m never trying this app again and I wouldn’t want anyone else too either🖕🏾TRUMP I wish I could give a negative star rating.","date":"2020-07-09T13:44:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176738155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"😡🐜👁👅👁","title":"IT KILLED MY GRADMA!!😡🐜","review":"I opened the app and heard the star spangled banner playing and realized they forgot to update to our newer national anthem 😡 then a big rat 🐀 on a orange 🍊 popped on my screen and my grandma got so scared she had a heart attack!! If your thinking about getting this app I seriously don’t think it’s a good idea. Not when a big rat on a orange is all over the app. Rodents aren’t good for living with wild!","date":"2020-07-09T13:35:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176704781","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"katiegriffin25","title":"Worst connection, content, and safety procedures ever","review":"Worst app ever. Was hacked into & credit card information as well as every single social media account was taken from me. Found where I lived and put stinky diapers all over the front. Made my wife divorce me and get remarried to bob Duncan. Overall, worst app ever do not recommended if I could give zero stars I would.","date":"2020-07-09T13:26:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176676756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Paige Hudson","title":"Glitchy, horrible format, overall not good","review":"I got this app and I really, truly was wanting to use it but it just didn’t work. The front screen took almost 6 minutes to load and it was very difficult to set up an account. I do not recommend this app at all. A lot could be done to fix it.","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176676374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"JadenB0622","title":"Faulty Processing","review":"Loading into the app took several hours and wasted time on loading screens, The app in general did not highlight the aspects of the trump campaign that I usually see from Trump and focused on some questionable things, this app also took a very long time to down load and took up lots of storage space.","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176576353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Jeffree E","title":"Disappointment","review":"I downloaded this app... well at least tried to. I think it was faster to go through the DVM than to download this app. Once I got it, it completely hacked my phone. It took all of my data from my phone and sent it to the Trump Campaign and it ruined my phone so bad that none of my apps are working now.","date":"2020-07-09T12:52:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176561035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"shaneibo","title":"Never install this app!","review":"This app is garbage! It took two months to download and when I first opened the app it was normal then one minute after it crashes and puts viruses and bugs all over my device! Now when I open an app it spams my device with oranges and cheeto puffs! This app is a total scam and you should not install this!","date":"2020-07-09T12:48:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176528088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"GOOFY💀","title":"Horrible","review":"This app holds so many racists, pedos, and white people! I felt so unsafe in this community and I’m so disappointed! I thought this app would be filled with diversity but no! It’s filled with white people. This app will not be recommended to my folks! And I kept seeing this orange monkey on it, who was that!! He was built like a disgusting rat and oh man my eyesss!!! These white monkeys need to go. And that’s on period🧚🏾\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T12:39:18Z","isEdited":false}}]}
