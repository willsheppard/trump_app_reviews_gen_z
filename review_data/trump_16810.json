Nothing but lies and trash. I was so disgusted that I almost threw my phone away. In addition, I am now required to attend weekly therapy because of this horrid app. I am considering pressing charges. Do NOT download this app, you masochist. You will suffer severely after voluntarily laying your eyes upon such an orange imbecile. I repeat, I would absolutely NOT suggest this app! 🤯","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:06Z","userName":"crusty orange","title":"Absolutely Disappointed 😔","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174661291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I got this app and first mostly cants stand the creators of this app and will not support it, they don’t even like cats or care about our well being so highly highly would not recommend. It’s reminds me of an ex and we don’t stan ex’s and go back to ex’s so why have this app.  Additionally the creators of this app are someone we do not stan or acknowledge as a leader for this country!

Red flag! So, I said yes. Next thing I know, the fbi pull up like that one meme clip. I was scared for my life but they just aimed for my baby. They held her down, and a fbi truck rammed my house. It ran my baby over, and I got on my pet T. rex to McDonald’s and ordered a whopper. Then I went to Wendy’s and got a new baby. It was called the baby Mc chicken.
