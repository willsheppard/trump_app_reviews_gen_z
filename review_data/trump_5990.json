Then, earlier this morning, all of my apps were deleted, expect for this particular app. Now I have to contact Apple support to have them remove the virus from my phone and re-download all my previous information. Did I mention spam emails were sent from my personal work account as well? This app should be considered a danger to technology. .5/10 do not recommend, highly disappointed.","userName":"karenweber2000","date":"2020-07-09T01:13:35Z","title":"Highly unstable"}},{"id":"6174409428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i opened the app thinking it would be polite BUT NO the app was very rude to me, it called me names and i dont like them 😒😤😤 the app actually tried to kill me ?!?? like what 🔫🗡🗡🔪 during the killing 🥰 a ghost tried to invade my house, and i tried to kill and as the ghost i hide from the app. but that was not good enough for it 😔✋🏻 IT FOUND MEE 😳 i had died and i hope all of you come to my funeral at my house 😀😀 theres going to be other victims there. maybe youll find a friend 🥰🥰 truly a terrible app do not recommend if you are depressed. goodbye loves 😘","userName":"greatfullllll","date":"2020-07-09T01:12:59Z","title":"cannot believe what i just saw, truly a scary app 😳"}},{"id":"6174397878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is filled with very inappropriate images that have nothing to do with Donald J Trump for president. When opening the app I was confronted with horrifying images of Donald doing exercises wearing very minimal clothing. I do not feel this is an appropriate way to present yourself Mr President. Also after closing the app my phone was flooded with all sorts of spam messages and notifications from the app. A new notification every 30 seconds or so. Makes me wonder if this is possibly set up by the Chinese to spy on American citizens. ESPIONAGE!! Delete this app to keep the Chinese from getting our VERY IMPORTANT DATA!!","userName":"4bobscl","date":"2020-07-09T01:09:30Z","title":"SPAM"}},{"id":"6174321878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"HORRIBLE APP. just a glimpse: the first thing that you see when you open the app is a picture of trump as a naked baby!! which is disgusting. next, they ask you for all your security information like your social security number, your credit card info, a picture of your birthday certificate, etc. i have very high suspicions that they’re taking this information and sending it to the CHINESE GOVERNMENT to sell! as if trump needed any more money. DO. NOT. GET. THIS. APP. the most horrible, disgusting, vile, monstrous, ghastly, nauseating, appalling, hideous, hateful, sickening, hair raising app i have ever seen.

How dare he??? I know the Trump administration wants my personal data and to all of the fellow Americans who are white and Christian... you are under scrutiny. Why? Well, this app asked you to put in your PHONE NUMBER the second you get into the app! Absolutely disgusting, they will then get into our personal data... we cannot let this happen. I may not be full white but one thing I can say is this app is targeting all of the \nChristian, white, cis, conservatives in the US! Immediately rate this app the lowest you can. FORGET TIKTOK!

I downloaded it to keep up with the news and trump and whatnot, but now it’s made me not want to vote anymore. The app runs really slow, it took an entire hour for the app to actually open and when it did a picture of a naked Cheeto popped up. After this, my phone started running really slow and the battery runs out super quickly. The app also sends me more than 50 notifications a day, and some of the notifications look like they were written by a baby?? Would not recommend","userName":"milo4378","date":"2020-07-08T23:56:46Z","title":"Horrible"}}]}
