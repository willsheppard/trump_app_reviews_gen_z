The app practically ruined my phone, bringing up pop ups of low budget phone apps when I just want to admire the Cheeto 😩! This repulsive experience has driven me to join the side of the liberals 😊 (also the leaving of bad reviews is a form of protest before y’all get mad at these reviews 🙃)","isEdited":false,"title":"The reviews were actually true 😔","userName":"Minilkinin"}},{"id":"6146654410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T03:11:51Z","review":"This app gave me COVID-19 from it being such a virus. So I did the only logical thing I could think of and injected myself with 🧚🏼disinfectant🧚🏼 that solves the problem immediately and I am now virus free!🥰 I could not have done it without the help from our bigot of a “president” anyways the disinfectant ended up giving me other problems and is now eating my internal organs so therefore I rate this app 1 star✌🏼","isEdited":false,"title":"Extremely disappointed","userName":"🧚🏼🥰"}},{"id":"6145885362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T22:11:39Z","review":"“So when we have a lot of cases, I don't look at that as a bad thing. I look at that as, in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\n\n“So I view it as a badge of honour. Really, it's a badge of honour.\n\n“In another sense, I tested positively toward negative, right? So no. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative. But that's a way of saying it. Positively toward the negative.”","isEdited":false,"title":"I loved reading Trump’s thoughts on COVID🥰","userName":"Trump's Funeral 2020"}},{"id":"6145592829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T20:14:38Z","review":"i wish there was a zero star option because WOW, downloading this app was a waste of my time. i never leave reviews on apps, but i had to speak up on how terrible that app is. when i opened the app, i was automatically greeted by a hot cheeto with a toupee. the whole app functions terribly, and this cheeto pops up way too many times. after leaving this review i am deleting this trash can of an application IMMEDIATELY.","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP!

I can’t believe it. I can’t believe that people actually like this Cheeto looking cotton candy bleached haired man.

This is a horrible app and caused my phone to lag. At first I thought it was only the app itself but it made my whole phone crash on every app I went on. Why would the president allow such a app?
