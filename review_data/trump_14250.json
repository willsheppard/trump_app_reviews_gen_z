The “make America great again” thing is just awful, you’re basically telling us that America is a trash place and it wasn’t already good to begin with, now the “keep America great” thing is something I want, but it’s not like Trump is actually trying to make it better. Worst. President. Ever.","date":"2020-07-09T18:29:35Z"}},{"id":"6177680330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpsmydaddy","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app so that I could keep up with my president to some degree.

Long may he reign!  His large hands and stable genius are renown throughout the world.  His work to drain the swamp must continue!  Trump 2024 and beyond!  Unfortunately, this app does not live up to his bigly greatness.  While our fearless leader has all the smartest people in his staff, this raw talent clearly does not extend to the creators of this app.  Captain my captain:  you need an app befitting your greatness!
