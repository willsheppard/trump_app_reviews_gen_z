I made one out of pubic hair anyway though, and then they let me in. Once I got the app it started to take away all of my mozzarella sticks, and that’s when I knew it was time to write this review. I mean the balls man. I just wanted some cheesy sticks. 🛒😷💩🥖🤹🏾\u200D♀️🥖","title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"yeetyboyi"}},{"id":"6179340467","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Sorry but I don’t support racists🥱","title":"Actual trash","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"SoPhantom58"}},{"id":"6179340073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i began to download this app on friday the 13th. yes, that was a long time ago. yes, the app just now finished downloading (it’s now july 9). yes, i am extremely unhappy with how long the app took to download on my phone. not only am i disappointed with the time it took to download but i am also disappointed with the way that the app runs. the app is very slow. and when i say slow, i mean SLOW. like, a snail could travel three times around the earth in the time that it takes for the app to load when i first open it slow. i also theorize that the app, when it FINALLY opened for the first time, installed a virus on my phone. all of the letters on my keyboard are now upside down and my phone talks to me unprovoked in vietnamese. other than that, the app is fine i guess. \n\nanyways, ACAB and BLM","title":"an honest review of this app since i’m seeing so many trolling reviews","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Ol.lie"}},{"id":"6179339866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"1.This app is trashy and it’s not doing any good in the world.\n2.The person this app is about is mad because everyone brought tickets to his rally and no one showed up so now he wants to band our app. \n3.He’s a racist! \n4.He’s a coward and a hypocrite!\n5.Him and his supporters are the reason the world is falling apart.\nSo please for the good of the world delete this app for good🙏🏽🙏🏽","title":"Delete","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hellomr.orange"}},{"id":"6179339834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and immediately the image of Trump turned into a video in which he slowly walked towards the screen with a menacing look on his face. I couldn’t leave the app, I couldn’t stop it at all!! After about 30 seconds it finally stopped, took me out of the app, and removed the app from my phone. I went to find it on the app store but it wasn’t there. All of the sudden my phone started ringing, and when I answered I heard him say “7 days”. Panicked, I asked him “until i die??” to which he replied “well, you see, in fact there are 7 days, well days and nights really, but at night there are some uhhhh definite issues. and i will handle those issues, don’t think that i won’t but uhhhhh, i would really very much like to see biden work at night, i really would. he always seems to be sleeping, you know? maybe you don’t know, but you could know. i think in fact everybody could know anything if they tried for it, you know?? i mean you look at out soldiers out in-“ and it continued for 8 months and 24 days until finally he had talked so much that he was too distracted to finish the race, allowing for Joe Biden to win right in front of him.","title":"unsatisfactory","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bunkerboi4lyfe"}},{"id":"6179339772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"v! nuga nareul magado \nnaui gal gireul gandago\ninsaeng han bangirago\nleggo (leggo!)\nleggo (leggo!)\ndan harureul sarado\nhuhoeneun jeoldaero eopdago\nhan beon ttwieobojago\nLETS JUMP","title":"a no for me ❤️","date":"2020-07-10T03:57:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"y2klina"}}]}
