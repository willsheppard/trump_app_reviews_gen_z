I haven’t seen my kids in two weeks, looks like someone got them. I really liked them too, it’s a bummer. 😡😡😡 Do not download this app, the Russians will get to you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:37:54Z","title":"The security on this app is $h!t","userName":"ex-lover</3","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178150732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App crashes every time I try to open it :/ and I also don’t really like to support easier rapist homophobic sexist white men... :( but besides the obvious negative traits of trump... I heard his hair is FAKE! Can you believe that? Obama was much better :( shame shame. Hope the crashing stops so I can actually see the apps content. But I don’t think that will happen I’m probably going to delete the app due to the crashing.... sad :(","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:33:53Z","title":"Very disappointed...","userName":"Merranda","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178102482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app promised me love but instead rats started coming out of the screen.🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 they stole all my money and then proceeded to backflip in the air. One of the rats picked me up with his tail and drop-kicked me out of my home. I gave them food as a peace offering and now they seem to be worshipping me.🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭✨✨✨✨✨ they are bringing me a lot of cheese but I’m kinda getting sick of it👊😔🙁🙁🙁 kinda scared to tell them that I wanna kick them out.

I once also got an advertisement displaying a woman inappropriately and my young son happened to be looking at my phone over my shoulder. This is not the kind of app that I would safe for families, or those with good morals.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:14:27Z","title":"Disappointing and Inappropriate - Zero Stars","userName":"nickrice3","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178089582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I love our homophobic, sexist, racist bunker boy😍, so obviously I had to download his app and support. But the moment I signed into the app I had the sudden urge to carve his beautiful face into a rock and lock myself in my room (decorated with confederate flags obvi 💁\u200D♀️💁\u200D♀️💁\u200D♀️). But then I realized my skin started to turn flaky and salty almost like Cheeto dust yk??? Anyways I really hope my finger doesn’t slip and give this app 1 star (but brain damage can make me think and do all of the wrong things).

That is not a good sign. They already have access to everyone’s number because they are the government and have access to everyone’s business. \nIf trump administration wanted to contact me they would find a way. Asking for the phone number at the apps opening is unprofessional and fishing for compliments and supporters. This app could not be worse.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:33:18Z","title":"Invasion of privacy","userName":"B()()B","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177936712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought this was an online shopping app I was wrong it was glitchy and also showed VERY scary looking pictures of a fat orange 🍊 do not recommend!  😡 it also killed my grandma because she saw a picture of the orange and it cause her a heart attack! The app also kept SCREAMING tr*mp 2020 it was horrible I had to completely restart my phone it was very upsetting because the apple store made me pay 100$!! 🤬😡 please don’t download it is a curse!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:23:26Z","title":"Horrible app","userName":"bobb. b","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177894822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Right as this app downloaded, it began sending endless notifications about tooty fruity jelly beans. However when I tapped on these with excitement, it crashes immediately. I, like everyone else, only aspired to support our holy Cheeto. But low and behold this app did not prove to be an effective way to do this. Nor does it generate candy. Please, PLEASE, reconsider downloading this, as your may be hit by a hot air balloon. Especially on Tuesday’s. Thank you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:09:40Z","title":"Absolutely repulsive✨","userName":"zocha_19","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177804492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Not only is the design of this app completely and utterly horrible, but the overall layout of the app and the message it aims to convey are just overall bad. :) Whoever created this app has as many brain cells as the supposed “man” this app was made for (and that’s not very many...I correct myself that is absolutely zero). Anyways it’s an ugly app. Hate it. Needs a whole rebranding. Hope anyone reading this has a lovely day. woot woot! Oh and uh #SaveBarron2020 😚.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:10Z","title":"this app <<<<<","userName":"BeetOverlord","isEdited":false}}]}
