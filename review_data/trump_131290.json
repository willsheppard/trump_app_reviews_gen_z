I then had to wait 30 minutes before finally giving up and closing it. As soon as I exited it(mind you I was outside) all of the trees started to get ripped out of the ground, start levitating in mid air, and began chanting Cheetos. By this point I am pissing myself because how freaked out I am when suddenly the most terrifying thing appeared. Down the street I see the Cheeto man (aka Donald trump) holding a bag of Cheetos who are his distant relatives, sprinting towards me, laughing like a complete and utter psychopath. Scared as I am, I jump into one of the levitating trees and to hide. Then, my phone reopened this app without me doing anything and once it opened it made Donald trump even more of a mad man as he looked right to where I was in the tree when finally I come to my senses and exited this app once more and deleted it and everything when back to normal. So overall, I would highly suggest not downloading this app for your own good.","title":"Horrific 😵😬🤮🤢","isEdited":false,"userName":"payton the person"}},{"id":"6174337150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:50:05Z","review":"is app is horrible, first is was taking sooo long to load. like longer then the Cheeto mans 🤫🤏🏼. second, i decided to give it a little while and i ate TWO pieces of popcorn 🍿 and it still had the AUDACITY to still be slow like 🥴 so i took my phone for a walk, and it was wild, chased by a bear and everything 😔 but yeah this app SUCKS🥰","title":"what even.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Batgirl223"}},{"id":"6174336883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:50:00Z","review":"as soon as I opened the app, I was shown disgusting graphic naked photos of someone with a small pee pee getting a spray tan.
