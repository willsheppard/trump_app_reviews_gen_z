I was fully prepared to immerse myself into verified information and build my ever-growing knowledge of American politics and governmental affairs. HOWEVER, this app is bogus and a threat to the security of my phone. Constant suspicious questions and actions that indicate a possible breach in my own personal God-given security are enough reasons to kindly ask for the removal of this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"ashreignbs","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T07:24:20Z","title":"FAKE APP"}},{"id":"6145841054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DONALD J TRUMP. hi whats up, ummmm you should not be president bc you have over used your power to do SO many things that are wrong. this app is honestly horrid and i want it taken down. you are a racist, rapist, misogynist, homophobe, and are also transphobic. i do not see any reason for you to have supporters, they all have worms in their brain and personally this feels like a social experiment ❤️❤️❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"babqnvrjusbeb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T21:53:13Z","title":"an honest review"}},{"id":"6145732297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support our dear bald  Cheeto puff who just recently passed away R.I.P💀😔 and I tried opening the app but It said I was not allowed inside because of my ~SkIn CoLoR~ 🥺😭 after my FBI agent denied me access to open the app they locked up all my other apps in cages and this app stole land from my home screen😤now I am really hungry and have cRiPpLiNg DePrEsSiOn😖","isEdited":false,"userName":"a_genz_kpopfan( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T21:08:54Z","title":"oH tO sEe WiThOuT mY eYeS 🙈🧚\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6145728414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Trump has never failed out country. He has done absolutely nothing for the over 3,000 missing children in ICE detention centers, he refused to rent housing to a black women, he called people fighting for equality thugs, and stereotypes Asians with being associated with COVID, as he should.

I think it’s some sort of glitch, but it was very unsettling and now whenever I see cheetos I projectile vomit everywhere. I will however not stand for having a Cheeto run our country. So I have now converted to the cult of Democrats. Peace out homies 🧚🧚🧚❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"VP Pence","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T16:30:04Z","title":"🧚🧚❤️🧚🧚❤️❤️"}}]}
