I tried to download it and it said that I breached into the nether....so idk what that’s about. Also it’s content and information is not up to speed because it says to vote for trump in November, but he died so idk how someone is supposed to vote for a man who died. So this app gets a one star from me...🌸💕💗"}},{"id":"6177126226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"0/10","date":"2020-07-09T15:19:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Review Girl 02","review":"Never in my life have I downloaded such a despicable app. Not only were the features terrible but the quality and the layouts were obviously built with no care and compassion towards the app. Also, ever since I downloaded the app my phone has been glitching and crashing without notice. :("}},{"id":"6177124302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I was hopeful....at first","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"SammySunshineconservative","review":"I downloaded this app so that I can stay up to date on the current presidents plans for the following election...it crashed my entire phone!

After the app taking ALL NIGHT to download, I got on just as I had woken up. BIG. MISTAKE. Upon opening the app (half asleep) this gremlin looking orange thumb of a creature POPPED up on my screen out of NOWHERE. NOT COOL TRUMP ADMIN. I HAVE A HEART CONDITION.

Do better. 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💫"}},{"id":"6177042946","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤢","date":"2020-07-09T14:56:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stupid!!!!!!!:-(","review":"This is the worst app i’ve ever put on my phone. my phone is brand new and this app took forever to download, and once it did it was so slow. not only that, but it crashed my whole phone once it finally loaded and it wiped my entire phone and i lost everything. i’m highly disappointed."}},{"id":"6177010999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible 😢😢😢","date":"2020-07-09T14:47:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dreamymoni","review":"I have no words..... this app called me the n word. hard er. I was walking on my way home from a trump rally when I opened my app to see when a next rally would happen in my state when the app called me a dirty, spear chucking, melon muncher, no dad, darkie, black monkey, colored cooney, n*gger.

First I put in my phone number to get campaign updates but I just keep getting texted videos of Shane dawson. You know the old and racist ones. Not good. Also this app hypnotized me into forgetting to to ride a bike. And I love to bike ride. This app messed with me physiologically and now I have to work to get back to my old self.

One time upon opening the app my phone shut off and would not turn back in for 3 days. I missed a FaceTime call from my sister seeing my nieces first steps 😢. All in all WORST app experience I’ve ever had. Do yourself a favor and just download TikTok."}}]}
