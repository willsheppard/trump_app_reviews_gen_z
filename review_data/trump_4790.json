I downloaded it to see updates on the great orange and to my surprise it downloaded many different viruses. My screen went completely black and it took me directly to the dark web. While heading to the dark web I took a stop at a field of spiders 🤢. They crawled all over me and consumed my dog. They chewed him up and left him in front of me. Soon the spiders started cornering me. The only thing I could do was stand there and be scared. They were trump supporters so I said blue lives matter and they went away. Thank god all trump supporters are slow 🥰.","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:52Z"}},{"id":"6173588138","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"deondra_","title":"horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"decided to give this app a try after many people recommended it a few days back, but overall i genuinely don’t understand the hype and would never download this app without it being recommended. the app took FOREVER to download (it literally stopped downloading halfway) and constantly crashed when I opened it. I couldn’t even get to actually use the app for its intended purpose as it just kept crashing. wirh so much trial and error, i decided to delete it. except the app was a PAIN to delete as well, so it was ultimately pointless for me to even download it in the first place. do better ❤️🍊","date":"2020-07-08T20:16:10Z"}},{"id":"6173446591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gorrilla Grip","title":"Do not download!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app took hours on end to download and I couldn't do anything while it downloaded. Once I opened the app, a horrid smell came from my phone and attracted many cockroaches and large rats. After a few minutes of me trying to figure out that the smell came from the app, a sound that literally ruptured my ear drums killed all of those roaches and rats. Then not long after, a blond, overly-tanned man crawled through my speaker and slapped my baby brother and then drop-kicked my puppy. He then grabbed a fish out of our fish tank and fried it to make a fish filet for himself. I do not recommend this app at all because of how awful it is.","date":"2020-07-08T19:27:43Z"}},{"id":"6173300334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Roseakpuppy","title":"what the actual duck","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this app because i wanted to see what the orange god had created. a las, i was greatly disappointed. the orangeness from his app has transferred to my skin it was TOO MUCH ORANGE. i’ve spend weeks and way too much money in skincare products to get this fake tan off. instead, things just ket getting worse. MY HAIR TURNED BLONDE AND STARTED FALLING OF. it wasn’t even a hot girl blonde, it was a pee-colored blonde 😔. what’s worse is i can’t shave my head there’s this part of my hair that’s just STUCK to my scalp and flips off in the wind revealing my naked head. to those that don’t want an orange tan and pee-blonde hair that refuses to fall off completely, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS","date":"2020-07-08T18:37:32Z"}},{"id":"6173254154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BLM ACAB ABOLISH ICE","title":"This app deserves to be deleted","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It took me five hours to download on my iPhone with perfectly good wifi. When I finally opened it and tried to open the app it was super glitchy and crashed my device. It took like ten minutes for the click of a single button to load. When I tried to delete this app off my phone it wouldn’t let me. Eventually I deleted it but even that took another 3 hours. This app also drained my battery while it was opened. I 100% do NOT recommend you download this app. It crashed my phone multiple times and was really low quality over all. One star.","date":"2020-07-08T18:22:34Z"}},{"id":"6173185538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dontbeahater14","title":"TERRIBLE APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"my dolphin 🐬 got into my phone 📲 and turned on this app ‼️ now he can’t bark anymore😡 what am i 🙋🏻\u200D♀️ going to do with a quacking rat 🤐 my donkey is now in the back yard shooting his gun around 🔫 and waving a confederate flag! while drinking beer🙇🏻\u200D♀️🍺 i asked him to share the beer and he said that i can once i say all lives matter😔 this app radiates bad energy!❌⚡️ my TV is stuck on Little House on the Prairie🐓🚜 do not get this app! please! unless you want your coffee to taste like inequality😟 everything my phone touches now turns into a pedophine🤢 my lamp tried cat calling me and i was just trying to get a bosco stick😣 100% do not recommend this app! 🇺🇸💕✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:59:57Z"}},{"id":"6173112904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"beuno pues","title":"✊🏼dejen salir a nosotros niños","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I got the app and crazy things started happening to my phone. The battery would drain and my phone would randomly call or text people. The thing the tripped me out the most was when I started speaking American without even trying. I completely forgot how to act like a decent human being. Not to mention all my other Apple devices started to glitch every time I tried opening the app. When I final got the app opened a whole flock of birds came to attack me bc of the music the app was playing. If you like not being attacked by birds then I recommend not getting the app. It cursed or something.","date":"2020-07-08T17:36:53Z"}},{"id":"6173061494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BLACK LIVES MATTER 🖤","title":"this app made me end fly to space and land on jupiter 😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
