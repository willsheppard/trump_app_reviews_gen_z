I downloaded this comedy app for my kids on their iPad to keep them entertained while we‚Äôre stuck at home, and the only thing that happened was an image of a spoiled annoying orange with yellow mold, dementia, and a Klan logo on his suit flashed on the screen. I am disgusted with the immaturity of this organization, and the sheer audacity to show such a disturbing image to children. I hope this app rots in digital limbo, where it belongs.","date":"2020-07-10T03:00:46Z"}},{"id":"6179148805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ugh so annoying","userName":"NerdKitten234","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So first off it took 1273 days like depression already got the best of me and I‚Äôm crying in bed because of it.

Hard to find any real content based on logic or science. Found myself stumbling all over the app looking for directions on how to drink a glass of water or walk down a ramp. Def no way to hold a Russian dictator accountable or build trust with American allies. And forget trying to find ANYTHING on how to save American lives from COVID! This app is useless!!! Don‚Äôt waste your time!","date":"2020-07-10T02:33:10Z"}},{"id":"6178994299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nobody approves","userName":"sb took \"no‚ù§Ô∏è\"","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I wanted to show some support to whoever is president cuz tbh nobody claims him and this app took 50 years to download.

My phone kept notifying me that the Trump app was copying some of my conversations, because of this I have relapsed on anxiety and paranoia and am now back in therapy for the thought that the government is spying on me and wants to do something. For those who have the same issues please stay off this app for your own good.","date":"2020-07-10T01:35:52Z"}},{"id":"6178928827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed.","userName":"Amaya Sonubi","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to show support for my lovely President, but this app is an absolute disgrace. It‚Äôs incredibly slow for me, and there are an extreme amount of bugs that need to be fixed immediately. Not only that, but when I opened the app for the first time, an orange bobble head popped up on my screen, instead of my one true President, Barrack Obama. it‚Äôs a shame, a true shame. Our president deserves better.","date":"2020-07-10T01:29:23Z"}},{"id":"6178867702","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Zero stars","userName":"1476okok","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"First off it took a week to download which is completely unacceptable when all I wanna do is support my loving president (can I get a yee yeeüá∫üá∏) and secondly everything on it made no sense as if it were in a different language I think it was Russian?!
