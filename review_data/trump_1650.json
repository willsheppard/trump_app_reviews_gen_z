I attempted to purchase a  shirt because that’s what all of the trumpets who listen to Fox News and their extremely racist daddy’s who don’t understand white privilege have. The next day I got a call from my bank saying someone stole 69,000 dollars from my bank account. I have been saving up that money since I began stripping at 13!!!! Kind of ironic because I remember when I was stripping in LA I gave a lap dance to president bunker boy trump just at 13 years old!! I was honored!!!! I was definitely his type at 13. Just like the 40+ other girls who he had sexual encounters with when they were 13. Kinda sad I wasn’t special enough for him to marry me at 13 though 🥺 but anyways less about me and more about the app. It’s terrible confusing and it gave me cardiac arrest do not purchase please especially u boomers who will die soon enough","title":"Stole credit card info","rating":1,"userName":"123powderpuffgirl"}},{"id":"6172868227","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:20:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I kept seeing jokes about how “spooky” this app is but I didn’t believe it so I downloaded it being the rebel I am. IMMEDIATELY after downloading it I expected to see some pictures of our lovely president but instead a GIANT ORANGE TOE is on my screen. I’m terrified of this genetic mutation and start hyperventilating. To sooth myself I start playing the national anthem of ‘MERICA when immediately a line of 10,000 cockroaches surround me and put there hands on there cockroach hearts. I run away but the faint screams of “Trump 2020. MERICA. He’s not a racist!” And so much more still haunt me. So I lay in bed to rest up and turn on the news but it must have accidentally been Game of Thrones because a giant orange toe said he would bang his daughter if they weren’t related then proceeded to kiss her! He later said you should “grab women by the p*ssy” This app is HAUNTED and ruined my entire day. If you download it beware the consequences","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"userName":"HELLLLLLLLLLLLIOOOOOOOOO"}},{"id":"6172685943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:28:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am not here to hate on something dumb. I am just losing my mind because of how many people ACTUALLY support a racist. Some will say it’s made up. Tell me, how can you support someone who is a racist, rapist, and just a completely disgusting person. Now you might say “Tell me one time Trump was racist.” ONE? Only ONE? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” (Trump 1991.) And if you say “well that was a ‘long’ time ago he has changed.” You are disgusting. “He demanded that his black accountant be fired because he was black. The account accountant resigned.” One more? Sad that this is not even a QUARTER of what I have. He encouraged black voters in 2016 to vote for him, by saying “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your young is unemployed. What the hell you you have to lose?”","title":"This will probably get deleted but..","rating":1,"userName":"JJade110"}},{"id":"6172558692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:35Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I first downloaded this app, it was in an attempt to stay informed about what was going on. Let’s just say I found myself to be very disappointed. After days of waiting for the app to finally download, I was immediately greeted with the face of a stranger who didn’t seem to have anything nice to say. I mean, where is all the support for the black lives matter movement?? He appears to have many policies which threaten and diminish the lives of Americans and even people from other countries. Additionally, the layout of the app was so poorly set up that I actually never succeeded in finding a section about all the good things this guy will be doing for our country. This really confused me because I thought that would be the whole point of an app such as this one. Any who, I’ll be deleting this app and if I were 18, Biden would have my vote.","title":"LOW QUALITY","rating":1,"userName":"(this is a suggestion)"}},{"id":"6177632056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"after waiting a whole ✨l i g h t y e a r ✨for this app to download I was revolted by the atrocity I had just witness. I saw a big fat ✨ o r a n g e ✨nasty smelling Cheeto that was the size of my left big toe. I was disgusted, I was revolted, and most of all my lord and savior Lucifer Morningstar didn’t even want to take this big nasty Cheeto into he double hockey stick. This is disgusting that they wouldn’t tell us about the Cheeto before hand because I am now if the hospital getting my eyes checked out since i am now legally blind and I am also deaf so I am Hellen Keller omg this thing. So don’t get this app unless you want to become Hellen Keller which makes it very hard for me to see and hear if you didn’t know as I am deaf and blind and I can’t see or hear since I am both blind and deaf which makes it difficult for me to use my senses of seeing and hearing because I am ✨ b l i n d a n d d e a f ✨","title":"NASTY VRUSTY EUED APP","rating":1,"userName":"Flying_Cheese"}},{"id":"6177282922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:03:55Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Downloaded this app in support of MY president, and I was severely disappointed. This app made my phone crash, and took hours to download. Once downloaded it crashed my phone to the point of it being unusable for a HOURS, and made my phone overheat so much that I had to put it in the freezer. I love to give the benefit of the doubt, however this is unacceptable, especially from Donald. I received nothing that I was promised from this app, and my phone continues to glitch and shut down after powering it down multiple times. I also received THREAT-LIKE messages, ensuring that I am voting for him. I did not expect a singular app to drain the life out of, not only my phone but, my soul. If I could give this app zero stars I would, it is sad to see this was the product of Trump. Because of this app I will now be giving my vote to ‘Sleepy’ Biden, or Kanye.","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"userName":"rodrick heffley 😹"}},{"id":"6177180084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:34:16Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app and immediately following the app showing up on my home screen a lady named Karen appeared at my door demanding she come inside and burn all my masks! (No coincidence) I may be a republican but I hate germs! She continued to screen and said her body her choice and I said but ma’am this my house, my masks, my body. And she said I would scare my children by wearing them. And then it hit I wouldn’t have these kids if her logic of my body my choice was an option when I got pregnant. I got that in a few seconds she couldn’t grasp it in the 10 minutes I talked to her.  In conclusion trump was right about god he’ll always protect us like he did to me, he protected me from being a trump supporter and made me realize I’m a liberal because I value human rights and remembered I was an educated women .

I will not be stating what happened to me in detail because it’s far to horrible to relive. All I ask is that it is taken down because it truly can hurt young minds. Don’t download this for any reason. Please save your eyes from seeing A BIG CHEETO PUFF. It was one for the most disgusting and scarring things I’ve ever seen in my life. No else deserves to see that please save yourself. App Store do better and get this app of this platform. We can’t have this. You need to do better. Poor children are on these phones and I can’t imagine if they see an app like this one, what would happen. This is extremely upset. I had to bring out my inner Karen just to let all of you who read this know that we have to get rid of this app immediately. ✨Please✨and Thank you✨","title":"BEWARE OF THIS APP","rating":1,"userName":"Gen Z cannot be stopped"}},{"id":"6175689160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:18:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As a god-fearing, white loving, confederate flag waving, wife of a cop who is now getting attacked by libtards 🤬(for beating up every colored person he sees), I downloaded this app to know I have a safe-haven when I feel there aren’t enough people who want to Make America Great Again. I was really excited to get the app and be updated on Donald’s campaign, but the app was extremely laggy and disappointing overall. Of course I know our non-racist, non-sexist, non-homophobic,xenophobic,idiotic,rapist, president wouldn’t be the reason for this monstrosity of an app. If anything, it was probably created by an undercover liberal posing as a white supre- I mean...Trump supporter. That’s the only reason it’s bad. Of course I love Trump and hope to see him for four more years (in a casket), but this app is truly a bad app. MAGA out. 🤠","title":"I’m really disappointed (I know this isn’t trumps fault he does nothing wrong) by by","rating":1,"userName":"Linda McGee"}}]}
