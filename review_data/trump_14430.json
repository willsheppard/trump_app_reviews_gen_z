This app took several hours to download and not only that when it did download it was very slow and glitchy. I also got a virus on my phone. This app is a disgrace and I edge anyone who is reading this to not get it. I am going to have to take my phone to get it repaired because of the bug that this app caused.

In the end, I can’t get passed all of the million negative qualities that he has. His app is as terrible as he is, terribly planned out and doesn’t even work over half of the time. The fact he thought people cared enough to download an app about him is beyond me, we don’t care just like he doesn’t care about his citizens.","date":"2020-07-08T16:20:49Z"}},{"id":"6172831482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"worst app ever","userName":"Emily2468","isEdited":false,"review":"all of his claim are false i do not see this man in my kids future. i do not want a liar as a president. he’s not fit for president he acts as if he were still in middle school crying over tweets😐. we need someone genuine in this white house running america. not this ‘man’ OH and did i mention having a person with WARRANTS in the white house is a bad look for our country? the other generations have not spoken up but gen z will we’re not scared.","date":"2020-07-08T16:09:36Z"}},{"id":"6172821991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"So bad","userName":"0/5 stars BADD","isEdited":false,"review":"When I tried to download the app it took so long that my phone crashed so I had to go to my local phone store and get it fixed.

I thought the T stood for Troy as in Troy Bolton. What a way to lie to your fellow Americans even more. Second, the app never opened up for me. I kept getting flashbacks to when my ex did the same thing to me. Lastly, the man looks like a Cheeto and I’m trying to watch my weight. How inconsiderate. Please have some respect for your fellow Americans and delete this app ✨🌸🧚🏻\u200D♀️💖","date":"2020-07-08T15:43:32Z"}},{"id":"6172736371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Big orange man buy me new house","userName":"🤥🤫🤗","isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded the app To become even more of a racist than I already am but when I opened the app the sewer animals emerged and took over my house like this corrupt government then when I deleted the app my house burned down so now me and my conservative white family is homeless and even when We got cops involved they said they were to busy pretending they are above the law. \n\n🧚\u200D♀️✨trump 2020 on a grave stone✨🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T15:42:22Z"}},{"id":"6172670371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"samanthahat","isEdited":false,"review":"i was shocked hunny i was in tears. i downloaded this app because my friend liked trump and as soon as i got on my phone got hacked. i soon got a message that said we are on our way you shouldn’t have downloaded that. around five minutes later donald trump walks in and drop kicks me and then pulls out a gun and shoots my five times. i died as soon as the incident happened. i beg you please do not download this, it can save your life.😔","date":"2020-07-08T15:23:44Z"}},{"id":"6172729489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"NOT APPROPRIATE","userName":"Ella🥰😎🥺","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened up this app and immediately it started glitching and acting up. Then, I was astonished when all I found on the app was racism, homophobia, sexism, and lots of terribly rude content. This app is not appropriate as it is promoting pedophiles and rapists. This app also supports bullying.","date":"2020-07-08T15:40:22Z"}}]}
