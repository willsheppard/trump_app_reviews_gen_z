It told me that my personal information was stolen by logging into this app and if I don’t pay money to some website it was gonna send a virus to my phone and leak my citizen info. One week later I thought nothing of it until my phone froze. I started to have a panic attack as I passed out. The hospital though I wasn’t gonna make it and the the emotional stress almost killed me.","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This game ruined my life and almost gave me an aneurism"}},{"id":"6176869714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nickname00000000001☺️","review":"This app kept crashing everytime I opened it up. I restarted my phone multiple times to see if I could do anything but change was never an option. 🥰 that’s the way it’s always been, changing it would be dishonoring our history 🥰I wanted to follow up on the progress of our ✨racist✨ President. 🥰🧚\u200D♀️ thinking I could use his app as a place to hear his ✨incomplete✨ sentences 🥰🧚\u200D♀️ instead I was spammed with fake news ✨🧚\u200D♀️ this app continued to move backwards in its “updates” claiming that it needed to “make the app great again” 🥰 but you can’t make something that was never great, great again 🧚\u200D♀️✨ and this app was never great.🥰✨I think I’ve done a tremendous job telling you why you shouldn’t get the app. Better than anyone else 🧚\u200D♀️🧚🏽🥰✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:10:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The app version of period cramps"}},{"id":"6176736418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bored as balls","review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. It took longer to download the app than it did to labor and deliver my child. It’s really hard to use and keeps crashing and leaving trump memes in my photos. It even played a track of him singing out of nowhere while I was in my car and made my baby’s ears bleed. I took her to the doctor and they charged me $30,000,000 for the checkup because free healthcare isn’t a basic human right. Then, because I owed that much I got taken to collections where they called CPS and reported me for being a trump supporter. I’m now homeless and can’t get the app to stop replaying videos of the president waddling down a ramp. People look at me like I’m crazy because pedophiles keep popping up on my phone. DO NOT GET THIS APP. It will RUIN YOUR LIFE","date":"2020-07-09T13:35:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worse than the actual president"}},{"id":"6176620732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RayAnn Honea","review":"Trump didn’t have the support of the Republican party to protect him. I mean, are we forgetting how unpopular he was in his own party in the beginning? Are we forgetting the “never Trumpers” like McCain and the influence they had? Seriously what good was it to change from “never trumpers” to trump 2020? Seriously older people (40-80s) are so highly influenced by false news! FoxNews isn’t a good source of information sweetheart. My thing is look at the evidence that was so deeply explained. You never know what young people can change for the better let it happen. In the future a lot of “trump supporters” aren’t even going to be around let the future. What should be happening is the future generations being able to mold their future.","date":"2020-07-09T13:04:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My review written by RayAnn Honea you can find me at (peachxfusion on Instagram)"}},{"id":"6176533577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😛 Lillyy","review":"needless to say I saw this app and thought it would be a great idea to download it because why wouldn’t I download my obviously non homophobic lgbtq+ loving presidents app? I had high expectations for my oh so great presidents app. Until... when I opened the app it immediately asked me if it could send me notifications😫. So I accepted it because I wanted to give my great president a chance. So about... 5:29 A.M, I had just fallen asleep like two hours before this. All I hear is like 7 extremely loud notifications. When I woke up I was so scared. And all the notifications said we’re “I know you’re sleeping most likely” “please wake up” “I’m bored” “WAKEE UPp” “🤨🧐” “FIND”\nAt this point I am extremely scared and disappointed in the app. I turned off all notifications for it and went back to sleep 😔.","date":"2020-07-09T12:40:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6176372892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Klaus Mikaelson is King💞","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app lightning struck my neighbors dog. That dog is dead now. RIP Candy😞. After the lightning my house started to flood and we had to move to another city. I then got a phone call from the workers of the app saying that my phone is set to self destruct because I didn’t download the app correctly 🙄. You can imagine my frustration when my phone did not self destruct , but rather the fridge in my new house in the city. So we had to get a new fridge but I was sooo hungry I couldn’t wait. We went to Burger King and my burger was cold! So I had to get my pet snake Rafael to talk to the workers( not to be a Karen)who refused to fix the mistake. And then Freddie Mercury showed up to warn us all about the app. Thanks Freddie. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. 0/10. It’s really put the flaw ❤️ in flawless 😍✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T11:56:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THE CHAOS"}},{"id":"6175966488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"good review .com","review":"I was downloading the app to support my President that I love and support so much ✨TRUMP 2020✨, and then the app started glitching I was so confused so I logged out and back in and all of a sudden trump calls me bc the app wanted me to put my number on there so I answer and he tracks my location off the number and 20 minutes later he comes to the city I’m in and he’s at my front door I was so shocked but also excited bc I was like yay my president but all of a sudden he starts yelling at me telling me “TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO DELETE THE BAD REVIEWS OFF MY APP NOW” I was so scared I didn’t know what to do I tried to hug him but i guess he didn’t want a hug bc his Guards came up to me so I backed up and said trump 2020 and trump turned around and said “are u lost baby gorl” I said NO MEANS NO and closed my door and he eventually left ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T09:51:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175553705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"☺️🧚\u200D♀️❤️","review":"I downloaded this app because I am racist/homophobic/sexist and naturally I would want to support my president who endorses all my same beliefs. But imagine my surprise when this app took 82 weeks just to download! I am outraged! When I finally clicked into the app I was immediately bombarded with images of Trump’s nudes! Luckily there wasn’t really anything to see or else I would have been scarred permanently. A few minutes into looking through this app I suddenly came to the realization that it was hacking all of my personal information! I DEMAND an apology from the president himself. I would not recommend this app to anyone I know. In conclusion, Trump’s app has deleted everything I love from my phone, hacked all my private information, and traumatized me with images of his tiny penis.","date":"2020-07-09T07:29:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE"}}]}
