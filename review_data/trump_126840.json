Okay, cool. I won’t be talking about feet, but I will talk about socks. Not just any socks though... TOE SOCKS, particularly the benefits of it. I am very passionate about toe socks even though my initial reaction was like other’s reactions. Ye, it’s pretty ugly, but just because it’s ugly doesn’t mean its only purpose is to make YOU look ugly. The functions of toe socks are abundant. Ever since I started to wear toe socks, other regular socks do not compare. Not only does it help with moisture management, it’s convenient, and you also grab a lot of attention. \n\nEverybody sweats. Even if it’s small amounts of sweat, you’re still sweating. The purpose of socks is to keep your feet warm and soak up the moisture from walking around campus. There are many health benefits that result from wearing toe socks. Opposed to the standard sock, toe socks cover every surface area of your toes. If you have worn gloves before, this is the same mechanism but for your feet. It is natural for bacteria to grow. However, there are good bacteria and bad bacteria. Bad bacteria thrive quickly if there is a triple threat of dirt, moisture, and warmth. This ideal breeding ground may lead to athlete's foot and blisters because the material of a regular sock cannot work efficiently with the rate of your sweat. \n     My grandpa always told me that your feet are as important as the rest of the body. According to Gina Anderson from New Health Advisor, toe socks actually help your blood circulation.  Most of the toe socks made do not have stitching around the toes area so each toe is entirely and equally covered.  Keeping your feet warm is important because according to Expol, “studies have shown that cold feet can lower the white blood cells of your immune system”. You can keep yourself from getting sick with the warmth of toe socks.\nAs a child, have you ever experienced yourself being very warm and cozy, and then your mom comes home from the market and says… “COME HELP ME GET THE GROCERIES OUT OF THE CAR” and then you have to choose a random pair of sandals, and you look like this? It’s not very convenient. Well, what if I told you, you can look stylish and comfortable with toe socks? Toe socks adapt to every shoe you own and enhances your experience. Sometimes, you want to leave the house but don’t want to put on your shoes for a quick run to the market. These toe socks adapt to what you wear.  Even if you choose to cover up by wearing tennis shoes, you don’t have to deal with your socks slipping. \nWhen I was young, I used to wonder why we have toes. What is the purpose of toes? According to UCSB Science Line, toes help us balance and helps propel us forward while we walk. With toe socks, it gives us an advantage to grip on to the surface we are walking on. Compared to regular socks, it bunches our toes together which causes friction in between the toes. On the other hand, toe socks separate the toes and allow for better sensory feedback. \nDo you remember when we used to have spirit days in elementary/ middle school, and one of those days was crazy socks day? You could’ve been the center of attention effortlessly. Not only is it already fun to wear on your feet, but you can also customize it. Amazon sells your regular day-to-day toe socks for when you have to go to work or school. And if you really love cows, you can get these. They look horrendous, but still kinda cute. This is for people who want to take risks but are testing the waters. December 4th is National Sock Day. According to the National Day Calendar, this day has allowed individuals to be more creative. Individualism is one of the benefits of toe socks. You can flex your Nike tube socks or you can make yourself happy when you take your shoes off at the end of the day and see that. The dopamine released in your receptors and the free movement of toe socks will give you more bounce in your steps. By wearing the things that make you comfortable and happy, it’ll make you feel more confident. \nAll in all, toe socks may be the answer to improve humanity. Even though it is ugly, we must remove the stigma of toe socks so individuals can proudly wear them without being judged. Life is too short to wear basic socks. Thank you. Don’t download this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:08:47Z","userName":"Bambisha","title":"Big NO","rating":1}},{"id":"6178074340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:08:25Z","userName":"Hailey Evans","title":"#savetiktok","rating":1}},{"id":"6178074141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Leave the white house orange 🥰😍✨😋💫🧚🏼\u200D♀️gtfo😍❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:08:23Z","userName":"gnvcvn","title":"scam❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6178073196","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to know our Cheto of a presidents plan but as soon as I downloaded my phone crashed and a weird message popped up saying “you’re being watched” creepy right?
