As a self named Karen I found many a major setback on this app and I would love to speak to a manger. The app shows false information and is run by a Cheeto. I like my chips cheesy not old and crusty. Other than that the app doesn’t even work that well anyway. If I could get in contact with the manager that would be great. As for you Mr. Crusty Cheeto, I hope you learn how to make something great again cuz you failed at doing that for America. 😘✌️\n                                                  Love, Karen🥰","userName":"Karēn🥰"}},{"id":"6179518358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Read before downloading","date":"2020-07-10T04:57:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Heart❤️been broke💔so many times🕐","userName":"Aqua_Gaming"}},{"id":"6179518321","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍒🍒","date":"2020-07-10T04:57:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"worst app ever i opened it and got shot several times in my vital organs don’t download","userName":"white supremacist 101"}},{"id":"6179518303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-10T04:57:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I opened up the app excited and enticed just to find it to be the quality of a pile of poop.
