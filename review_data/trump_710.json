This app has witchcraft","userName":"ratatatata 🥰","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to try and get a better understanding of Donald Trump. I’ve never liked him but decided to give him a chance and see if there was any good in him, like the open minded person I am. The moment I opened the app, I was put under a hypnosis.. I can’t remember anything else. My friends and family kept me isolated for 24 hours before i returned to consciousness. They informed me that for the past 2 days after I downloaded the app my skin was turning orange and scaly, my hair began to fall out, I went on the streets and grabbed women by the p***y, and I even made black babies cry!! It was horrible. HORRIBLE! I honestly don’t know if I can ever recover.. I tried to call the Trump Administration in demand for an explanation and was told to stay quiet or else my parents would be deported (even though they‘re citizens 😩). I was already in such disbelief but to make matters worse, the representative told me to “Vote for Trump 2020” before hanging up on me. Please save yourself, this app is the devil!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:00:34Z"}},{"id":"6176011133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I ᵈᵒⁿᵗ STAN PREDATOR🥳","userName":"gen z🥵💞","rating":1,"review":"this is unbelievable😭😩😡🤯🤬\nthe president killed my granny!!!😫😖😭😣\nmy family👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦👵🏻 was a hugee⚪️ fan of orange🍊fruit🍊until 2017 they found out🔍🧐😔 that the president was orange😣😡🤬😱😨🤢, but, this orange🍊def different, my family used to eat all kinds of oranges, but this one was soooo 🍊ugly🍊 af, even that my family can smell the s̾t̾i̾n̾k̾y̾n̾e̾s̾s̾ 🦡🙊🧟\u200D♀️😿🙀💩☠️🤮🤢🤮😵😵😓🥵😰😱🤯🤬😭of the 🍊orange 🍊ugly 🍊creature🍊 from HOME 🏡🏚🏠, then, my family start SCREAMING 🗣🙀🤬😱 and they're THROW UP😭🤢🤢🤮🤮💩!!!! suddenly my granny's👵🏻🙌🏻 bone 🦴💀☠️👹 start screaming🦴🗣 \"Ҝ尺卂Ҝ🗣 Ҝ尺卂Ҝ 🗣ҨҨ尺卂Ҝ山Ҝ😵“ they all trembling🙌🏻🧚🏼💃🕺🏻because they're shock🦴🤬😱!!! then my granny👵🏻 was stop⛔️🛑❌ moving🚷, yea, my lovely😊💞 granny👵🏻 was dead😵☠️👻, 🙏🏻\"RIP\"🙏🏻, since then👈🏻, my family👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 can't❌🤮 eat😬 their 💞FAVORITES💞 oranges🍊🍊🍊 ANYMORE🚫😵!!!, even my dad💞👨🏻 can't❌ see👀👁👄👁 the orange🍊🤬🥵😡🎃🩳👘🥻🦊🦁🔥☄️💥🍊🍑🌅🌇🌆🎇🏺🎁🏮🧡🉑☢️☣️📴📳🈶🈚️🈸🈺🈷️✴️🆚🚼🟠🟧🔶🔸 color anymore😞😔😟😖😫😩😢😭😤😠😡🥵😳🤯🤬🤯.....\n🔔ALL OF THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE PREDATOR i mean PRESIDENT ORANGE!!🔔 btw his pp🤗 look like a pinch🤏🏻of salt🧂","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:05:57Z"}},{"id":"6175810613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRUMP BROKE MY PHONE!!!!!!","userName":"chun li biatch","rating":1,"review":"Since trump is one of my favorite dictators in history, I wanted to get this app to show my respect.🙇\u200D♀️ and to see my favorite Oompa Loompa.

Anyway, as soon as I opened the app it started asking for my personal information. THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I put in my phone number out of respect for president trump but immediately my phone got hacked, it got so bad I had to buy a new phone. Obviously with current circumstances I can’t afford a nice phone so I was downgraded from and iPhone 11 to a Motorola Razor ( at least I have the pink one) However that is not the end of my qualms. Mr. Trump HIMSELF actually used the app to get my number and called me, he said he wanted to pay for my phone but HE LIED, he took my bank information and stole all my money. He then sent me n00ds of himself on a yacht, I think Melania took them but now I not only have an old phone I also need money to have my eyes removed. They stopped working after I saw those pictures of him. He was so orange my retinas actually fell off and my pupils became permanently dilated so again DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:41:10Z"}},{"id":"6174439367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"B6 and potassium","userName":"pewpew.mm","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app thinking I would get a personal view point of the president of the USA but to my unfortunate disgrace I came across to a sloth who seem to be high on carrot juice his increase consumption of vitamin B6 and potassium has made him to be a walking carrot I then notice that this creature started to wave at me and I panicked I then started thinking my phone was being hacked by this creature because my family is so spiritual I told them to pray for me but they said that this type of healing needed more then prayer now because of Mr. Carrot man I get an exorcism done every Friday on a full moon I blame this carrot sloth for the beating I am receiving he should stop trying to talk to little girls like my self I think for a minute he offered me a check for my silence through the app know I feel like I here voices coming from my phone saying “let’s make America great again” and I started thinking when was America great .... disclaimer in case you’re reading this I will never run away and I will never kill myslf. 🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:59Z"}},{"id":"6174223574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Deceitful and untrustworthy","userName":"sage9524","rating":1,"review":"this app actually has the ability to let people go and it still doing information like your information from your bank account and just take all of your money and when you call it a fraud you will not get anything back by the time you call it will be too late they were erase all their activity and then nothing can be done about it can also look up where do you live and they can report you under fault charge to the police that never did happen and anytime they want you with this app they can take over your whole phone take over all of your messages and send messages that you did not makes calls in places orders that you were not aware of until it’s too late and you get a big bill this app says your information is locked in place under protection but really it’s not everything on this app is a lie do not do not do not I repeat do not download it not unless you want to information stolen from under your noses","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:10:59Z"}},{"id":"6174169544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"im still a minor sir","userName":"BLACK LIVES MATTTEED","rating":1,"review":"Teaching about the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement allows each of us to chew on multiple injustices simultaneously. We are able to teach not only about racism, its history and its present manifestations, but we also are able to point to solutions and methods of action so our students don’t become disillusioned. When students are overcome with doubt, we can draw parallels to Standing Rock and say to them, “This is how people are fighting for change in spite of the obstacles they are experiencing.” We can talk about sexism and patriarchy, but we can also leverage conversations about sexuality using gender-neutral and affirming language.\n\nTeaching about BLM isn’t just about police brutality and the ways an organization is seeking to end it. Bringing this movement to the classroom can open the door to larger conversations about truth, justice, activism, healing and reconciliation.\n\nThe work required to teach about Black Lives Matter is extensive and heavy, but this topic can be addressed effectively in classrooms—at any grade level.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:50:55Z"}},{"id":"6173548538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Black lives matter","userName":"average decent human","rating":1,"review":"I do not recommend for multiple reasons. First the app takes hours to download and I have great WiFi, and once it did download, it kept crashing. My I remind u that I have a iPhone 11 that I got recently so there is no problem with my phone. Also, I got the app to see why Karen’s and boomers are so interested in the app but there is nothing to see but a terrible app with many improvements needed. First off, when I entered the app and it didn’t crash, I felt the sudden urge to yell “all lives matter” and “ blue lives matter”, I know, such atrocious and ignorant thoughts am I right. I am so disgusted in myself. Also, looking through the app a bit, I felt like a white supremacist who rapes people, is racist and homophobic. Weird ain’t it. I am so disappointed with myself. I don’t recommend u buy or else you might become 🍊. Don’t be racist guys and remember that humans have flaws, but 🍊has to more. Also, don't listen to uneducated people(🍊) and wear a mask in consideration for others. Stay safe!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:02:39Z"}},{"id":"6173351419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the app killed my family","userName":"review th*t","rating":1,"review":"okay so here’s a little rundown on my story of downloading the app. so i wanted to educate 🤐myself on the amazing president trump 🍊himself even though i can’t vote 🌬i still wanna stan my orange🍊 president. so i downloaded it everything al good and dandy but then when i open it IT WAS ASKING FOR MY MOBILE NUMBER. 😲😵and i just think that it is so unfair and like my fellow re-republicans say my body my choice 🤷\u200D♀️and i agree my number my choice but i HAD. to give my number so as i was shaken 😭typing in my number someone knocked at my door. 😱i went to open it thinking it was my tr-trump 2020 flag🤗 bc my other one got my orange🍊 tan on it. but it was a guy WITH A CHAINSAW. 🏃🏽\u200D♀️as i was screaming my orange 🍊face off bc i wanna look like orange 🍊daddy donald he pushed me aside and walked 💃🏼inside my house went into the living room where my family was crying 😢😢bc i decided to educate myself and become a r-republican. and he killed 🤕all of them and that is my story and the reason i will be giving thsi app a 1 star rating. 👎🏽👎🏽","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:54:42Z"}},{"id":"6172849910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏼\u200D♂️Not a good app 🧚🏼\u200D♂️","userName":"gen て","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see what the boomers where up to. But that was a horrible mistake. I have great WiFi but it took hours to download. Not only did it take forever it started to glitch when I opened it. All I could see was trump as a monster inc character. Whenever I tried to tap or swipe out of the picture the renegade song would play and I would see Trump dancing to it. I decided to delete it and reinstall it but it made it worse. I saw an orange looking person pretending to be the president. I was disgusted. Whoever that was should be ashamed to make a fool out of the president. Later that day I went to get tickets for the next rally for me and my grandpa. I let my grandpa look at the option while I went to get my charger when I came back he was gone. I picked up my phone to see that the app ate him!  It was just a horrible experience horrible. I don’t recommend anyone to download this app. But if gen z is here u know what to do. \n🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️ worst app ever 🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:15:03Z"}}]}
