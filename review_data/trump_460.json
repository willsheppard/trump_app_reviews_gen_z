Then it said I couldn’t open the app because I didn’t allow them!! That is to the astronomical level of bull crap!! I finally allowed notifications and it asked for my phone number?!! I gave it because that’s the only way to get in the app. I saw Donald’s campaign events and stuff and wasn’t really interested so I left the app to play some candy crush. About 15 minutes later a got a text from a random number and it was asking me for pictures of me NUDE from yours truly Donald J. Trump . I texted no of course and about 1 hour later these dudes in black suite and ties showed up outside my house and they looked like fake people, their skin looked plastic!!? I saw them out the window and I didn’t answer the door and they’re still out there and banging on my house. I’m hiding right now in the basement under my bed right now if.. omg I hear them coming HELP M","userName":"Karen (mom of 16 kids mad)","title":"I am distraught","date":"2020-07-09T13:41:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175483448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"okay so i was just going on with my day and i heard this app ‘tiktok’ was talking about the app. so i was like ‘hmm ok i’ll get it since it’s the latest news’ so i downloaded it. but lemme tell you.

This app has brought shame to the great trump name and it favor of him and his administration I think it best to delete the app all together. There really is no fixing this horrendous app and I would suggest to scrap it and start over but if the next app would end up anything like this one even remotely there is no point because it is beyond even a reboot to fix it. I’m so dishearten and broken to see an app with such great potential end up as this one has and it may have even convinced me to not vote trump 2020. It’s a miracle (definitely 100% a bad one of course) that anything could have changed my mind, but this app has. I feel like it’s presence is taunting not only our country but the world. If this app is not immediately removed I may never download another app again because it is simply corrupting the app stores reputation. Action to remove this monstrosity must be taken right away!!!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"LPhouseboat","title":"Truly a shame","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174318313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I decided to download this app to keep up with the news. As soon as I downloaded this app I became a boot licking, racist, trump cultist with sheep mentality. I immediately had the urge to become orange. I couldn’t stop eating Cheeto puffs and I kept an alter dedicated to all things orange 🍊 like the orange highlighters, traffic cones, of course the fruit, and veveta cheese. I’ve lost so many brain cells I’m not sure if I spelt vevetal right. I’m so orange that I’m mistaken for a tall ompa lumpa. This app made me lose friends as well, when I go out with friends, it would shout from my pocket, “TRUMP 2020!” And surprisingly, no one wants to be friends with a racist. I got the urge to harass minorities when I got this app, saying things like “We speak English here!” Which is crazy since America doesn’t have an official language 🤔. I have since uninstalled this app for the sake of my sanity and have since been on the road to recovery. I advise against getting this app if you want to keep any functioning brain cells and am sharing my experience so you don’t have to go through what I have.","userName":"Trump's left titty","title":"This app made me lose brain cells 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T00:43:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173905897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app bc i love cheeto puffs, but turns out i really truly hate this one with all my mind, body, and soul:/ i was just minding my own business about an hour after downloading the app and out of no where my phone started glitching 😱 and i was so confused why a picture of an orange showed up on my phone 🤪 and donnie t’s voice started saying “i’m big dumb dumb, you give me gum gum” 🤨so obviously i went and grabbed some gum to feed my phone as the app was telling me to do AND NOW I CANT CHARGE MY PHONE EVER AGAIN😤😤🤬😡👿 this app is so bad, hacked my phone, broke my phone, and i expected good cheeto puffs and just got met with a bad spray tan 🤢🤮 to anyone asking if i recommend this app... no 😪 it installed malware onto my phone and is giving my info to china and russia again, i mean i love that they wanna be me so bad that they have to steal my info💕 ✨ but this app ain’t it 👺🤡 just go shovel the lake instead, much more worth your time 😳🤩😋😝😅now i’m gonna go buy myself a new phone with my hard earned money, trumpet out here wasting my money yet again 🤡👺👿 toodle loo","userName":"summerfunner","title":"OH NO!

Too many random notifications popping up, I really felt like I was watching an ad that would never end. The team that designed this really took no time to at least try to handle the app with care. The platform overall is just useless to me. I gain no valuables information regarding trumps perspective using this app. My god at least find a better development team to actually make this app usable. I cringe when I click on this app because it honestly has no flavor whatsoever. At random times the app will close on itself when I use it. This never happens when I use applications like Facebook and such. Its almost like a sign from God Almighty telling me to delete this barren app. I don’t recommend to any liberal or trump supporter as well because it literally saps the joy from my soul. The trump development team could have put a little bit more soul into creating this. Horrible app overall. I’m glad I didn’t pay for this junk.","userName":"Make2020actuallygreat","title":"Horrible app, difficult to navigate, overall incompetence.","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:25Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177711978","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in high hopes and to support our homophobic non racist president 😻. (It took over 24 hour to download on my BRAND NEW PHONE) but Right when I opened the app I was asked to put my phone number which I thought was really weird because he already is in a relationship and has a kid! but I did it anyways because I trusted him. DONT DO WHAT I DID!!! Once you put your phone number in to will send you spam until your phone over heats and breaks down. So after I bought a new phone I emailed the Email they listed to see what I did wrong and they were so rude! So I tried downloading it again (it took way longer to download this time) I put my phone number and SPAM! but the app kinda started working. I WOULD SAY THIS APP IS DEFINITELY NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS! Right when I logged in I saw stuff I didn’t want to see it turned my 20/20 vision to 100% blind. I have to say I’m extremely disappointed in this app and the president for putting out such a Terrible app. Now he owes my 2 new phones and a brand new set of eyes. Please do download this app you will regret it!!!","userName":"would not recommend at all","title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:14:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177390119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Omg this app is horrible and so is this man,  Trump is a white supremacist.  If you vote for him again your a white supremacist. Come on gen z and K pop fans, tik tok is not going down without a fight. Black lives matter, native lives matter, Mexican lives matter, Women lives matter, LGBT plus lives matter, Asian lives matter. But not Trumps. I swear y’all this app is cursed within seconds of it downloading I fell off my chair and hit my head on my bed and switched places with my cat. It was all fine at first but then I don’t know how to switch back. Anyway now my head hurts. You want more proof this app is haunted, I seen a ghost on the app he looked like an orange Oompa Loompa. Nearly gave me a heart attack on top of falling off my chair, hitting my head and switching lives with my cat whose name is fuzzy lumpkins BTW. Anyway this app is horrible, disgusting, horrendous, awful, ghastly, atrocious, monstrous, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, hideous, appalling, terrible, vile, loathsome, dreadful, nasty, unpleasant, lousy, heinous, hateful, sickening thing on earth like the president.

I got the app and put in all the necessary personal information and I figured it would do no harm, all of a sudden ice showed up to my house! I was very shocked as they broke the door down and then stepped on my dog. I asked why they were here as they tossed my stuff out the window, they said (and I quote) “if you don’t like it here, than leave” I- what is this honey? I- I was shocked. I was very confused because the only thing I was doing was supporting my alleged r@pist president 🙈 they told me “In order for you to stay you would have to sell your soul to Donald J trump and idolize him” i was really wishing I was a red head right now so I had no soul to give but unfortunately I’m not. After a recent ban on my favorite app tok tik and this corona, I was seriously thinking of selling my soul but than I realized I still haven’t finished glee so I choose option one.
