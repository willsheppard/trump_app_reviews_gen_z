How can the people of America listen to a man whose own family calls “narcissistic”, Trump’s own niece is writing a whole book highlighting this ignorant campaign. It is easier to penalize the minority for the reaction of bigot art treatment than it is to penalize behavior that was elicited by the merciless treatment.  Also trump has a small peen.","rating":1,"title":"bad. not good. so sad."}},{"id":"6173597727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:19:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dankery bakery","review":"It caused my phone to crash right after I downloaded it, not only that but i have plenty storage space and once I downloaded it and went on the app itself it crashed and I had to reset my phone twice just to delete it.

Trump but I REALLY think that they should Check the app! After I got it my phone started to lag a whole lot! I tried to download it again and it didn’t work! I had to get a new phone!
