It was utterly horrendous. I was so terrified -I threw my phone across the room and accidentally hit my caterpillar. My caterpillar is DEAD NOW. This app literally kills (just like the gun hanging on your dusty mantel). I cannot begin to describe how much sadness this has brought me. I used to walk my caterpillar on the daily but now it is GONE. IT WAS TAKEN FROM ME. This app should be investigated (like the cops who killed breona Taylor). I have never seen such a hideous image. The orange cheeto was morbid and atrocious. Please do not download the app. I am practically begging you. Save your poor eyes... and your caterpillars. It is not worth it. I will be seeking therapy now.","userName":"victim of horrible app","title":"Killed my caterpillar I’m traumatized 😭🐛","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:20:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179588495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Save yourself sometime , don’t even bother downloading this .","userName":"Perrro1","title":"This app must have COVID or some other virus !!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:20:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179588316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"App didn’t work as expected.
