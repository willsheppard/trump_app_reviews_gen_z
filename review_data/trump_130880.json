Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don‚Äôt care what humans think is impossible.‚Äù SEQ. 75 - ‚ÄúINTRO TO BARRY‚Äù INT.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. \n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.","rating":1,"title":"The Declaration of Independence"}},{"id":"6174476562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Monkey poop üôà","review":"ThisüçäappüçäisüçähorribleüçäitüçäputüçäaüçävirusüçäonüçämyüçäphoneüçäsoüçänowüçäeveryüçätimeüçäIüçähitüçätheüçäspaceüçäbuttonüçäthere‚ÄôsüçäaüçäorangeüçäbutüçäbeforeüçäthatüçähappenedüçäIüçäopenedüçätheüçäappüçäandüçäitüçäwasüçäflashingüçäredüçäwhiteüçäandüçäblueüçächantingüçämakeüçäAmericaüçägreatüçäagainüçädon‚ÄôtüçägetüçäthisüçäappüçäifüçäIüçäcouldüçägiveüçäthisüçäaüçä0üçästarüçäIüçäwould","rating":1,"title":"Thisüçäappüçäsucks"}},{"id":"6174475632","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:32:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"olly the cool","review":"First of all, who likes trump?......EXACTLY (it‚Äôs nobody btw) He literally is soooo racist!
