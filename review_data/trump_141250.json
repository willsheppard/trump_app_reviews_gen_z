When I did finally get it, the app pulled up a website that would hack me. It deleted my emails, messages, tiktok, and other apps. It also got my passwords to my personal information. It was terrible!😡 To all those trump supporters please don’t waist your time... don’t waist your time on a fool/orange🍊. Terrible app and terrible person.

Then WHAM.  A HUUUGE disappointment when I saw the performance and content of this app!! After I was looking forward all day to playing games with a #trump2020 avatar, I realized this app was nothing more than Boomer political propaganda. \nDEFINITELY NOT speaking in my GEN Z language!
