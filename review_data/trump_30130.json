What gives him the authority to constantly threaten our Governors, and now state school officials if they don’t submit to him? He wants to force Governors to send out children back to school and risk their health. He is willing to sacrifice our kids for political gain. He does not need to be relected!","date":"2020-07-08T19:52:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"rreynoldsh","title":"Dictator"}},{"id":"6173504580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"First of all, I will like to give my honest opinion on how this app has made my phone glitch so badly that the other apps I have on my phone have been opening and closing by their own.
