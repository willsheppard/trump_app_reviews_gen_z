Absolutely painful and I don’t understand why I got it because it only caused my pain and heartbreak how this “app” could be so hateful and racist and homophobic and sexist and just an overall terrible app. I fully am for this being removed from the “AppStore” because it is just so awful at being an “app”","userName":"skreu u","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute balogna"}},{"id":"6177432418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:55Z","rating":1,"review":"I don’t know about this app. I don’t really like it and I know some people might but I sure in heck don’t. I just I don’t like it. It keeped kicking me out. It also hacked my tablet and then started sending me things that I didn’t want to know, all in all DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP Unless you want to see things that no one should see","userName":"The short girl next door","isEdited":false,"title":"Just I don’t know how to explain this"}},{"id":"6177412226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:40:58Z","rating":1,"review":"the app lags a lot, although I put I don’t want to receive any notifications from the app, they show up. It’s always asking me to donate money for him which is unnecessary. I’ve denied access to my location while on the app and it continues to always ask for that. This app was made by idiots for an idiot","userName":"crystalbrystal","isEdited":false,"title":"it’s horrible"}},{"id":"6177404005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:38:38Z","rating":1,"review":"downloaded this app looking forward to supporting our lovely ✨bunker boy cheeto man✨ but was ASTONISHED and TERRIFIED when i opened the app. it features bunker boy’s face, which is NOT very pleasant to look at. the app also made my phone disintegrate and bark like 🥰🦦⛹️martha the average dog🦋🏳️\u200D🌈💅. then my phone started screaming wh*te pow*r, just like in the video our cheeto man retweeted, which is obviously RACIST 😌✨💅. very disappointed 🌝🤢","userName":"calieeeeeeeeee","isEdited":false,"title":"RUINED MY LIFE 👺😤😾"}},{"id":"6177391911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:10Z","rating":1,"review":"i’m sorry but i used to support trump... well i don’t anymore, from downloading this app i realized that he probably only wants money and power and that he does not carry about me or any other person living in the u.s. and if anyone uses this app for news he is going to make sure that they don’t see any news besides what he wants them to see. when he says fake news he can’t not let people see the fake news. i mean if you are so confident that it’s fake and your supporters will still support you after seeing the news then why not show it?","userName":"zyzee girl","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is bad"}},{"id":"6177378623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:10Z","rating":1,"review":"To be honest I would have rather downloaded an app that set off amber alert alarms every five minutes— but those thing are kind of similar... both are crazy loud, seriously annoying, and could make anyone hate the creator of the app itself. The app was a joke and took way too long to download.","userName":"Sydneytag","isEdited":false,"title":"Wow this app sucked 🙈😍🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6177366714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:27:38Z","rating":1,"review":"Just doing my due dilligence. I’m indifferent about trump, but I don’t agree with taking tik tok off the App Store. My generation has way more power than the older generations actually realize, so here we are getting the presidents app taken off the App Store. Can’t say I’m not in support of it tbh, take away tik tok and we’ll take away your app.","userName":"yung tater","isEdited":false,"title":"Get this app off here"}},{"id":"6177364114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:26:52Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app expecting to be able to see all of trumps plans for his campaign what and he was planning to do for COVID-19, but I can’t even do that because the app coutinues to crash constantly. You would think the president of the United states would be able to make an app that functions correctly","userName":"mia.adams06","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6177299887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:46Z","rating":1,"review":"One of the worst apps I have ever seen. It’s way too slow and started glitching like crazy. Somehow it hacked my phone and started texting Karen’s. Truly disappointed, thought orange king was gonna come through but I guess not. If he can’t even make an app right then he shouldn’t be in charge of making decisions for America.","userName":"lilneedyluv","isEdited":false,"title":"💞✨🧚🏽 I hate it 💞✨🧚🏽"}},{"id":"6177291162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:06:16Z","rating":1,"review":"this app is the worst i downloaded it and then right away my room was full of trump 2020 stuff and I COULDN'T TAKE IT OFF!!! so after that disaster i tried to go tell my dad but everyone i saw became trump!!! i uninstalled the app before things could get worse but don't download this unless you want to go through similar experiences😾","userName":"👁👄👁🤩😻✨💖","isEdited":false,"title":"awful app😾👹😡"}}]}
