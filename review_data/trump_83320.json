Almost suspiciously fast though. Not sure how I feel about that, seems unusual. Like it had help from a foreign entity or something. Not sure. Anyway, exploring the app, it truly was an unappealing app, not great to look at, and I think unhealthy to the mind and body. The information and news pushed by this app seems to be unreliable and untrustworthy. It said Trump was going to have a rally in NC, but then he didn’t. It said he was going to have a massive rally in Tulsa on Juneteenth, which I was very much looking forward to (so as to overshadow the history of Juneteenth and overwrite it in history with the greatest day of MAGA conglomeration ever), but he didn’t. Then, once he did have that rally in Tulsa I was very let down because it was so small (could be a metaphor, and/or indicative of Trump’s claims in general). Anyway, it went on to say that Trump wasn’t upset about how small his rally was, even though he was clearly heartbroken. What a shame. Must hurt that an app in his name is putting out fake news. So based on that, if you love the best reality tv show host to ever lead our country, then you should really open your eyes and take this app and nuke it, like any true AMERICAN would. Fake news is the enemy, and this app is full of it (very one sided...SAD). Trump tweeted that he didn’t trust this fake app that is trying to put his name on it, and is currently in the process of beginning his 8,700,666th time suing someone, and these reviews will be used as court evidence. So let me ask YOU, America. What side of history do you want to be ON? Do the right thing, otherwise it will be very SAD!\n\nAlso, I’m putting 1 Star because Trump is #1 in my book!","title":"This app should’ve been great....
