With someone with money and power this app should not have the ability to freeze and glitch out my phone. My phone now has a 15% battery decrease which I have to get physically fixed. Don’t get this app not worth it.","userName":"cai6713","isEdited":false,"title":"New app"}},{"id":"6176502888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:32:21Z","rating":1,"review":"I know all the Trump supporters will support Trump and will like this app but I’m not a trump supporter (I know I’m sorry) so I don’t really like this app. And really, ban TikTok!? Like come on. What about all the kids that have TikTok and it’s about to get banned and they aren’t allowed to have Instagram,Snapchat,Facebook, and Twitter.

It’s like nobody even tried. It seems they had our president design it and well you can tell it’s not his specially. Almost like how you can tell running an entire country just really isn’t in his skill set either. Actually his skill set is pretty empty. He’s good at eating McDonald’s though.","userName":"🙃™️","isEdited":false,"title":"The president needs help"}},{"id":"6176468061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:22:51Z","rating":1,"review":"the download took a total of 6 hours. not even kidding. anyways, once it let me into the app i was bombarded with pop up ads then my phone shut down. so i deleted the app and 3 day’s later i was mailed multiple trump advertisements to my address from this app, when i didn’t even put my address in!

However, this app took a literal WEEK to download because of slow the app is. Also, this app started to cause glitching on my other apps on my iPhone.
