By the time it downloaded (took three days) it was frozen. So naturally I deleted the app and tried again. Three more days later I was finally able to get past the first screen then my phone completely shut off. I took it to the company I bought it from and they said that my phone was infected with the most viruses they have ever seen! This app is a way for the government to track you!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD. ITS A SCAM!!!!"}},{"id":"6173292224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:35:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no","userName":"massive ew","review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

It keeps kicking me out every 30 seconds. And when i DO manage to get in the app it just keeps showing me my presidents nudes 🍤 🤢🤮. I think he accidentally left it on the app. I just wanna educate myself more about his election and about my dear Cheeto community. But it really won’t let me. Hope u fix the leaked news and the crashing."}},{"id":"6173248090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:20:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible app, don’t download 😠","userName":"03749274928471","review":"when i downloaded this app, many things started to happen. i almost DIED!!!! our house smelt awful as if something died! 😠 one day i was just sitting in my room, then a whole bee hive invaded our house including my room 😱 then a week later, wasps invaded!!!! it’s too dangerous! so once i deleted the app, the smell went away, and all the awful things disappeared and never happened again. i’m never getting this app ever again. ✨🧚🏻💅🏻🍊"}},{"id":"6173243526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:19:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Black Lives Matter","userName":"mick3.7","review":"This app provides nothing for the user. It provides no information worth reading, it is also sponsored by a racist man who had the audacity to put children in cages, to support the killing of Black men and women, and is threatening to hold our international students hostage to get what he wants to reopen schools in the fall. He’s a failure as a president, and when Americans in the future look back on this time we will see him for what he truly is and what he has truly done to us."}},{"id":"6173239492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:17:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App to Ever be Made","userName":"Crash lemonade","review":"I downloaded this app eager to help support Donald Duck only to find out it is actually Donald Trump. Either way I proceeded to open the app and suddenly it started asking me personal information and the name of my first dog. I am quite nervous as to if they will try to raise it from the dead. My phone also started to glitch very badly from the app as if it was being hijacked. Im nervous this app is in control of my phone and watching me and everything I do. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP i'm warning you!"}},{"id":"6173122216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:39:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"do not download!!","userName":"stupidumbo","review":"I downloaded this app to get info on the pres but it was a horrible idea. first of all it took an hour and a half to download when I was connected to WiFi and had data. then when I opened the app it crashed and my phone froze. had to go to tmobile to get it fixed, afterwards I opened it again and was met to voices speaking russian. My phone crashed again...I went to tmobile and they said my phone had been hacked due to the app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

Of course you are great president but I really hope you can help us get tiktok back. A lot of people, including verified creators on tiktok are downloading Dubsmash. I downloaded Dubsmash and took a look at it, and it is like the dollar store version of tiktok. And then after being on Dubsmash, I realized that it is even worse that tiktok, and it can take your information so easily. So please help us try to get tiktok back."}},{"id":"6173067918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:22:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Went to jail for this","userName":"Starcarramthecat","review":"So I downloaded this app to see if I could find at least a little bit of good in our president but, what I actually found was much worse. Right after I downloaded the app I started getting THREATS from people saying they were gonna take all my food and eat my grandma. The app also made my phone glitch like crazy, basically could only hear those threats from people and see a weird orange face. Terrible app do not recommend."}}]}
