As soon as I opened the app water started coming out of my phone and then there were Sparks of electricity the app told me to blow dry it then put it in the freezer so I did and when I took it out my phone grew legs and had bunker boys voice it said “I shall find your dog” it ran after my dog and tried to strangle it my dog almost died but I grabbed my trump phone and it tried choking me I decided to kill my phone and throw it out thanks so much bunker boy I had to buy a new phone bc if you and you almost killed me and my dog.  Oh did I mention it also sent a crazy stalker to me by sending it my location without my permission he said that he knew my Address and was going to kill my dog and I bunker boy what do you have against my dog and I we are a nice person and dog.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP it will try to kill you it also tried to poison all my food and then tried to push me off a cliff then it started trying to stab me but I threw the app and then it poisoned my dog RIP gilly I will miss you may you Rest In Peace in your doggy grave I’m sorry you won’t be able to see the gen z revolution but I will get revenge for the trump app killing you I truly miss you gilly and hope you are doing better.  Back to the app it tried to set my house on fire and then it destroyed itself I had to save up and buy another phone u first downloaded this 2 months ago and got the first new phone a month ago it was killed 12 hours later I just wanted to leave a review I downloaded and deleted as fast as possible so it wouldn’t happen again and now I better not need to get a new phone moral of the story this is a horrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:16:51Z","title":"Killed my dog and made me buy 2 new phones","isEdited":false,"userName":"bcjcicivoodkdnfb"}},{"id":"6179577569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"TRUMP 2020  BABYYYYYYT","rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T05:16:58Z","title":"BEST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMP IS DA G.O.A.T"}},{"id":"6179576838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the‼️ worst‼️ app‼️ever‼️\nabsolutely ruined my phone, causing glitches and all‼️took up space and the app doesnt even work. i DEFINITELY think this app is the worst🥰DO NOT BUY THISSSS.
