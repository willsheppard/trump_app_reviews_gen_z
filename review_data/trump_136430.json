FINALLY. All I wanted to do was support my beloved president.. anyways. I opened the app and it showed me an orange clown. I didnt give it a second thought and created an account. After that siri started speaking Chinese😱😱. I turned siri off and then they asked me for my number. I entered it and then some weird numbers started calling me.. i answered one of them and some dude answered with a thick Chinese accent and he said... “Give me all your personal information or else we will track you down and take your life” i quickly hung up and i was scared for my life.. i decided it was best to add rockets to my house so i could fly somewhere else while still having everything. I flew all the way to mars but soon realized there wasn’t enough oxygen. I was so scared so then i went back to earth. When i went back to the original place of my house and there was a whole Chinese army. Being very scared i picked up a spacesuit and went back to mars. I now live on mars. This app gets ZERO stars. Never download it its super dangerous✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️🥰❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T09:22:46Z"}},{"id":"6180246732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app literally killed my mother😡","rating":1,"userName":"yourmomsbutthole✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️❤️","review":"i hate this app with a burning passion because it’s ran by a rapist and homophobic and it should not be aloud to be downloaded. it also gives me weird stalker vibes, and i do not appreciate that, i also do not appreciate how this app gets to stay up but not tiktok because we hurt his wittle feelings like bruh grow a pair. anyways the app glitches a lot and it’s just straight up annoying, and trump knows how that feels right. but i demand this app gets deleted or i will come for your brand and you will regret it💖","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T09:22:41Z"}},{"id":"6180246665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is very anti BLACK","rating":1,"userName":"TRUMPSUCKSHARYBALLZ","review":"Trump does not stand with the black community and had even made of  George Floyd by mocking say ”i can’t breathe” and fake choking!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T09:22:40Z"}},{"id":"6180246500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst.

Not only does it support a racist, homophobic, xenophobic rapist, but it’s lay out is just horrifying.  I couldn’t find anything on it whatsoever, and the little I could see is what I’ve already seen on his website. I mean how am I gonna reserve rally tickets on the day I have to wake up late and walk my pet butterfly on an app that doesn’t function properly. This app is atrocious and needs to be deleted.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T09:22:30Z"}},{"id":"6180245924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App","rating":1,"userName":"fried oreo balls","review":"This is literally the worst app, there’s no point in getting the app. TRUMP is literally making you waste your time by downloading this app, so I don’t recommend it.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T09:22:24Z"}},{"id":"6180245876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HACKS YOUR PHONE","rating":1,"userName":"EmilyDonovanTrack","review":"This app will get into your personal data do not download.
