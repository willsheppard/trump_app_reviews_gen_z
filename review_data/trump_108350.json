Your quarterlies look very good. How are things going at the library? \n\nJim: Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So... \n\nMichael: So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? \n\nJim: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. \n\nMichael: All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. [On phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-au-manger. [Quick cut scene of the office] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [Hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done. [Michael is giving a tour of the office. He starts of by standing next to the company's logo]\n\nMichael: I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here… [Enters the office] See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam? \n\nPam: Well. I don't know. \n\nMichael: If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [Growls]\n\nPam: What? \n\nMichael: Any messages? \n\nPam: Uh, yeah. Just a fax. \n\nMichael: Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. \n\nPam: You haven't told me. \n\nMichael: It's called the wastepaper basket! [Throws the fax away and laughs] Look at that! Look at that face. \n\n[Michael is in his office giving an interview to the camera crew.]\n\nMichael: People say I am the best boss. They go, \"God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious, and you get the best out of us.\" [Shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. \n\n[Dwight is at his desk taking his phone out of his drawer.]\n\nDwight: [Singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]\n\n[Jim is giving an interview to the camera crew]\n\nJim:  My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this. [Michael comes over to Jim and Dwight's desks]\n\nMichael: Whassup! \n\nJim: Whassup! I still love that after seven years. \n\nMichael: Whassup! \n\nDwight: Whassup! \n\nMichael: Whass...up! \n\nDwight: Whassup."}},{"id":"6177126967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:19:24Z","title":"disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gen z 🤍","review":"this app does not belong on the app store"}},{"id":"6177026352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:44Z","title":"cheeto","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"donald j cheeto","review":"extremely glitchy as well as racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic."}},{"id":"6176995713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:33Z","title":"ACAB","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"raebae24601","review":"Lets get this app deletedddddd!!!
