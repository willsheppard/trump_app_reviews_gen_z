I thought it gives information and news but it just scarred me for life I will never ever ever use this app or download it again. Like why would someone even create an app like this🤦🏽\u200D♀️. I just can’t fully comprehend the existence of this app. I honestly think this app should be banned from the App Store. It needs to go. leave. bye.peace out.","date":"2020-07-08T22:51:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174007510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"idoig","title":"This is absolutely disgraceful!","review":"This app is horrid, I can’t believe it’s still on the App Store! It’s extremely slow like the Cheeto himself! Now I was 100% TR*MP SUPPORTER, but when i saw this it completely turned my views. This app is horribly designed just like the pigs dick. Which shall I say is EXTREMELY unprofessional to post something that horrid on the internet🤚. And now CHINA can see it. Well.. maybe not. Saying that they can see it from across the globe is an overstatement (ant looking ass). Speaking of which, I got into a horrible car accident and broke my kneecaps and my vagina because of this app! It started to spam notifications and it sounded like gunshots! Which I have failed to mention but I am a future US army soldier, and I have SERVER ptsd from Vietnam! It is so inconsiderate of them to not consider future US army soldiers like me! And the audacity, for you to use that photo of you looking like a corrupt sims 2 character. Seriously, you have scarred my child and he has sever trauma from it! I mean every time he sees you he pukes everywhere. Which I am suprised Melania doesn’t after being remotely close to you. I am highly disappointed in Apple for letting this app continue to run. And I think lots of people who all of a sudden are too! We want this app gone, it is DANGEROUS!!!! IF YOU DOWNLOAD APP PLEASE TURN OFF NOTIFICATIONS IF YOU ARE A FUTURE US ARMY SOLIDER!! 🧚\u200D♂️😱😨😱😡😡😭🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T22:51:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174007107","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"HELP DA BEAR!!!","title":"No❤️","review":"10000000/10 would not recommend. I downloaded this app in order to support this helpless orange Cheeto and got bamboozled by a BEAST. Very graphic images of this monster posted everywhere as well as his disgusting advertisements. Viewer  discretion is advised.","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174007076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"no282828278229191971","title":"-9871661128181/10","review":"I definitely would not recommend this app. You open it up and it asks for you to make an account. why would I want to do that😭. The thing that was really wrong with this app is that Donald Trump is all over it. Like I didn’t see not one picture of the citizens of America. All he really cares about is money and fame. PLUS this app ruins your phone. It makes it glitch and stuff. In my opinion I think the big cheeto man is stealing our information😣. Anywho bye.","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:55Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174006815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"caffeinequeen123","title":"absolutely not🤮💕✨😖🧚\u200D♀️❤️😣","review":"first of all, it MUST be embarrassing to have building a wall (which literally has only happened minimally) on your political agenda for 4 years straight and then have other countries periodically BANNING americans from their countries🤡🤡\n\nadditionally i’d just like to send my condolences for melanoma on having her “be best” campaign be against cyber bullying and have it fail this bad.. like honestly all of gen z has just redirected their anger to YOUR HUSBAND! ugh, embarrassing. (also i am very sorry you have to deal with croissant-like genitals🤮🤮🤮 aside from the narcissism, hate, misogyny, racism, and homophobia, that should be reason #1 for a post presidency divorce) okay bye still hate you🥰🥰","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174005445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🐥🐮","title":"I almost barfed upon arrival . . . 0/10 do NOT recommend","review":"The only good thing about this app is the fact that it’s age restricted because NO CHILD should be able to see the horrors I encountered. . . I’m not sure who decided the cover art but . . . They should be fired. Whoever took part in the making of this app .  . . FIRED. I was very scarily welcomed by a Cheeto with . . . a face? I’m really not sure what demon I saw. I am now forced to hire an exorcist to PURGE whatever I awakened within my device and if this thing still lingers I will have to purchase an android. This app has completely derailed my mere existence on this earth and I just don’t know how to cope. I have hired an around the clock therapist to help me through this long and challenging journey I will face, but I know I am not alone in this. Again, do not stab yourself in the heart by taking part in this app. \nMy sincere regret, \n  @morgan.charless on insta😌","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174004922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Rock and Roll Bye Bye EP","title":"ehh... that’s a no from me","review":"This app’s format is aneurysm inducing and the content and imagery as well. You’re first introduced by this small man with incredibly low self esteem, sometimes I almost find myself feeling lightly bad for this poor old fellow... BUT THEN I REALIZE HIS LACK OF VALIDITY IN THE POSITION HE IS IN. This crumby man’s image can even cause some mild post traumatic stress among most. And some even say he looks like a Cheeto, and yes they both have a very orange, dusty, and crusty appearance, but please give Cheetos a break. Cheetos are pretty good and Chester the Cheetah is definitely a leftist that wishes not to be associated with a malformed waste of organic material. I feel bad for the coders  and developers that are affiliated with this app’s creation, they will have to live with this aspect of their career (if they still have one) for the rest of their lives. Anyway, this app is a waste and of space even if it is only 44.7 MB, I could still hold pointless photos that are more significant than this mess of an attempt of creating an app supporting a corrupt campaign based on white supremacy ideologies. The app store would be significantly better if this was removed.","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174004815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"bobtoes","title":"🤢🤮","review":"This is not a site for anybody.I saw a Cheetos that was tanning naked doing the helicopter with a  bald spot.100% do not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174004499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"XxmarianacoriaxX2010","title":"This app .........NO","review":"First this app is so bad my whole entire family I suffering from eye cancer because of these photos that they show on this app but lucky me had sun glasses on so I was protected from these horrify photos.My life flashed before my eyes.I almost had a heart attack but god shined his lights on me and saved me he said to me you will not die today it is not your time to go.i immediately woke to my whole family lying on the ground.I was crying hysterically but my neighbors heard me crying they got everybody in the car the doctor told me they are not ok and that is why this app is SOOOOO B a d .","date":"2020-07-08T22:49:57Z","isEdited":false}}]}
