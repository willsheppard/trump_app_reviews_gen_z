DO NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU VALUE YOUR GAM GAM’S LIFE!!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:44Z"}},{"id":"6174191414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NO JUST NO","isEdited":false,"userName":"melian turner","rating":1,"review":"I’m just doing what my Lord and Savior 🙏 TikTok is telling me to do and I download this app🤢 and sadly had to get my eye surgery luckily I was wearing glasses so my surgery wasn’t that severe.

Too many ads telling me if I don’t vote for Trump I’m a worthless human being. Also the app told me that I’m should've been swallowed and that it’s too bad that I’m a failed abortion. Then it threatened to steal my switch and ruin my island on animal crossing. After that it made me face my childhood fear of Dorrie from Mario 64 by making me play from the point of view of Mario stuck in the same room as Dorrie. Dorrie then proceeded to my (Mario’s) head and drown me further and further down his hidden cave behind the waterfall in Peach’s castle. All this did was further my childhood trauma and gave me more insecurities. \nNot worth the viruses,trauma, and waste of storage.","date":"2020-07-08T23:21:56Z"}},{"id":"6174031346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Rapist burned my eyes","isEdited":false,"userName":"trump ruined my life","rating":1,"review":"Immediately opening the app I started to feel extremely ill. My stomach felt like someone was turning it. Immediately after scrolling through it for only 10 minutes I had to stop because of uncontrollable vomiting. To add to that it has caused me to go into a full psychological breakdown. Seeing a rapist’s face that many times unsettled me to the point of vomit and a mental breakdown. Don’t download unless you want bunker boy to poison you and you’re family. My dad has been brainwashed to the point where all he does is drink beer and say “MAGA” while watching bill O’riley. This is the final stage if you don’t stop using after the vomiting and insanity. DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:02Z"}},{"id":"6174018140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Was great and then....","isEdited":false,"userName":"MarsQueeeen","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to get reports on our beloved Pres. Donald. It was great for about a day and then the inevitable happened...one day while using it I saw a message say “go back to where you came from!” And then all of my content on my phone got deleted. It deleted every app, picture, message... you name it. All my contacts were people from the white house and all my pictures consisted of Trump... including his “private” photos. The worst.\nIt wont even let me delete the app or anything from my phone now. It has completely taken over. \nUnless you want your life getting taken over by Trump... don’t vote... I mean download the app!!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:04Z"}},{"id":"6173837324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App","isEdited":false,"userName":"rosyunicorn06","rating":1,"review":"When I opened this app it asked for my name and information. When I asked to skip, it called me a libtard and told me to go back to where I came from. I tried to explain that I was born here, but all it did was blast “FACTS OVER FEELINGS SNOWFLAKE” from my phone. Even when I deleted the app, it still was blasting from my speakers. Then, 3 days later, and package showed up on my door. It was a giant box addressed from this app. I opened the package and all that was inside was a tiny piece of paper. I read the paper, and it said “enjoy your box of farts”! I smelled the box and it smelled like Diet Coke and trump steaks. I was mailed a box of Donald Trump’s farts! All in all, would NOT recommend the app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:47:31Z"}},{"id":"6173727679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"don’t waste ur time","isEdited":false,"userName":"asdjhdhi","rating":1,"review":"Downloaded this app to get updates on the campaign. Seems simple right? However, after using this app for a while, my iPhone started glitching out. It kept asking for permission to access my photos, contacts, cookies, etc. This was kind of suspicious as the app has nothing to do with those things at ALL. Little did I know, the app was COLLECTING MY DATA. A few days later MY EMAIL GOT HACKED and I had to freeze my bank account. Someone has been hacking the app, and a few of my coworkers had the same exact issue!! Ugh and when I deleted the app it was too late!! \n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE TRUMP WOULD ALLOW THIS ON HIS SITE. He’s officially lost my vote 😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T21:06:17Z"}},{"id":"6173687226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download!! 😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"I am not a Trump supporter","rating":1,"review":"Let me start of with how much time this took to download. It did not take months, not years, not decades, but it took two whole weeks to download!! I have ammmaaazzziiinnnng WiFi so I don’t understand why it took so long!! And don’t even get me started with what happened when I opened the app. When I first opened the app I saw the most horrible, most disturbing, most disgusting thing!! I saw an 🍊face!!!! Like I just wanted to see the president not orange looking faces all around the app!!! So just don’t download an app that involves you to support the most sexist, most racist, and most dumb presidents!!! And if I could give a -♾️ star, believe me I would!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:51:34Z"}}]}
