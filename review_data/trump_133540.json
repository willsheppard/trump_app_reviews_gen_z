This Cheeto orange 🍊looks God had me hooked when I saw this app <_<....but to believe him is the same as believeing that I will ever be happy again.... This app has ruined me.... The TWO WHOLE WEEKS that I spent waiting for this app to download is just absurd.... Here I was thinking I'm sad but this app just killed me... Worst part when I open the app I'm greated with a picture of Trump kissing his own daughter and holding her ass!!! Than loud blood Curdleing music was blaring through the app even when my volume was on the lowest setting.... My ears literally started bleeding and I had to visit the er for two whole days... 😔😔 I thought it would get better after my father had broken the phone... But it would replay the pictures and the music in my sleep and I would see him every time I opened my eyes.... 😭😭 I'm now diagnosed with PTSD and am seeing a therapist as I fear the orange Cheeto may never leave my head... God bless anyone that thinks about this app and I'm praying for the one who have already gone due to the Trump 2020 app.... Blessed be.... 🧚🧚🧚🥰😭😭🥺❤️❤️🧚🧚🧚🥰🥰🥰😭😔😔😔🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🥰🥰🥰😯🥰😭😭😭😭😭😫😫🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6173436642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Apple store needs to take this app down","date":"2020-07-08T19:24:20Z","userName":"__kaley__","review":"Don’t piss off gen z we can do a lot of damage"}},{"id":"6173436392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst app ever🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T19:24:15Z","userName":"dia :))","review":"the app took 3 days to download onto my phone and when it finally did, it was full of pics of poop.
