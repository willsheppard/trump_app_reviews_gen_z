It asked to send me notification upon launching the app and I clicked no but soon my phone was being flooded with notifications. I absolutely do not need to know when Trump is leaving a leak. It’s gotten to the point where my email has been getting “campaign” notifications, money has been charged to my credit card, and the nonstop phone calls are unbearable. I’m surprised I can even write this review without getting another phone call! My phone has been shut off all day due to the incessant dinging. Tried to delete the app- but guess what? Made my phone CRASH. Took 30 minutes to finally get it booted back up. 100/10 do NOT recommend. Save yourself the headache, time and money and don’t download this app.","date":"2020-07-10T03:51:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Waste of time"}},{"id":"6179322163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RedCristy","review":"The second I downloaded this app I got all my info leaked.
