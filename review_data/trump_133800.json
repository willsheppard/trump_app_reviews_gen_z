Another vase just flew over my head as I type this!!! I downloaded this app to keep an update on the Trump STD thatâ€™s infecting our nation, and the second I opened this app, DEMONS FLEW OUT OF MY PHONE!!! The more I scrolled through these articles, my house became more and more active!!! They broke everything, my mirrors, my windows, even the original Picasso that was up in my living room!!! The worst part was that they ate the last Twinkie and I canâ€™t go and buy more!!! I had a ouija board session with the demons and when I asked why they were here they spelled out F-U-C-K O-F-F!!! I deleted the app quickly and after that there were less run ins with these spirits and I was able to return to life B.A. (before app), and only have to sacrifice one of my future children to satan.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Uggggggg374","date":"2020-07-08T18:30:24Z"}},{"id":"6173277543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TerribleðŸ’ž","review":"It took 2-3 hours to download.Also it made my phone almost explode ðŸŽ‰","isEdited":false,"userName":"asfnsss VM gdðŸ¥¶","date":"2020-07-08T18:30:15Z"}},{"id":"6173276948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Thus app is trash","review":"This app is trash it took forever to download and made my phone glitch as soon as I downloaded it.

I thought that was strange but i tried not to think much about it. I continued with my day, constantly bothered by this horrid stench. I realized my phone was excreting this horrible smell so i began investigating. After hours of thinking and going through the apps on my phone, I realized the trump app was at fault this whole time. It was a GREAT inconvenience to me and almost caused me to pass out due to the smell being so terrible. This app NEEDS to get off the app store because it could really do some serious damage to people whoâ€™re sensitive to smells.","isEdited":false,"userName":"caulymolton","date":"2020-07-08T18:28:43Z"}}]}
