I downloaded this app because I love our racist king president. And then my phone started glitching. I didn’t know what to do so I charged my phone. Suddenly all my lights started to flicker and the app took over my entire house. The app started controlling my Alexa and toaster The app caused my Alexa to play dance monkey on repeat for 8 hours straight. And although that was already grueling enough, the app took control of my toaster and brunt my toast. And to top it all off the app turned off my grandmas life support. Fly high grandma. So now all I have are bleeding ears, burnt toast, and a dead grandma. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!"}},{"id":"6174592761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sophia Sancheeze","date":"2020-07-09T02:06:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"hate it!!!!","review":"when i was going to buy this app it said okay app it would be a great idea to use it for me a picture yooo was my favorite day in my new favorite app it looks like it has a good vibe and it really really cute app store is so cute omg i’m has ever gotten so much to do y’all have fun at the first i is a really good game to play and it’s fun and it’s a really fun way of keeping the app you have like you do guys on it i like the best thing is that y’all can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to the chat room and then you can get it to open leaf so that’s why i hate this app"}},{"id":"6174506854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@itsmekyaa._","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I think ✨N O T✨","review":"so i was going to take a shower after a long day of liking trump 2020 but                                           ✨ON A  G R A V E S T O N E✨ memes I saw that i left a bag of Cheetos in the toilet so i took it out and went to go throw it awayl but as I was walking it started to talk. Spouting gibberish things almost like a certain someone I know. Anyway I went to go throw it away and then I realized it’s trash day so i went to take it out like I should 😌 then the trash man came and told me that something was talking in the trash but i just reminded him is was an old scronny Cheeto bag! Long story short my cat came back with tacos from waffle house and we feasted!!"}},{"id":"6174499001","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Karen MkKaren 69","date":"2020-07-09T01:39:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"the worst app EVER!!!!!!!!!","review":"If I could give this negative stars I would, 1 star means it actually worked to begin with!!!!

On top of that I had to hide my kids and my wife cause this man be trying to get with them both. The graphics were too much I don’t need to see a high def orange. I called to complain and they asked if my refrigerator was running when I said  no they got and I didn’t play into the the norm of societal conformity and go along with their agenda that racial discrimination, and equality doesn’t exist in this country they got mad at me. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO WISHES TO KEEP THEIR BRAIN CELLS"}},{"id":"6174445096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"aubg9","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP HACK PHONES!!","review":"i open the app to protest 💁🏾\u200D♀️ , and i opened it and my phone blacked out and it started glitching and i nearly broke my phone trying to make it work 😭👎🏾 , so I waited a week or two for it to cut back on 🤞🏾, this app also convents kids to kill their selfs 👎🏾😶 my son came to me and showed me it told him to kill himself and he is only 4 so he didn’t know what it meant because I let him download whatever he wanted for a treat 😃 .

I have no idea what it was saying, but when I looked up my dog started levitating and meowing!! I didn’t know what to do. I ran into the kitchen to find my dad dead with his neck snapped on the floor in the middle of a pentagram with candles around it. I ran back to my room to call 911 but the app wouldn’t close and kept asking for my credit card information and social security number. I had to get a priest to come and bless my house so the app would finally delete. Don’t get this app!!"}}]}
