Then I was greeted with a horribly edited picture of an Oompa Loompa looking man with a corn husk on his head who looks racist. Then it TOLD me to put in my phone number. First of all, I do not appreciate being told what to do because I am a strong woman who does not listen to rapists. Secondly, that is a huge violation of privacy. Might as well ask for my social security number with the amount of times they would try to spam my phone! I would NOT recommend this app and if I could, I would give it ZERO stars.","date":"2020-07-09T01:23:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"mak.thotcher"}},{"id":"6174440891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"would not recommend","review":"As soon as I opened this app it deleted every single one of my pictures, contacts, apps, and reasons to live, and it took up all my data and storage. Ever since then I've been receiving countless spam calls, texts, and emails from foreign countries about Herbal Viagra. I tried to speak with customer support but they keep saying \"No one's home.\" I guess I can't complain too much, a friend of mine also downloaded it and as soon as they opened it their phone exploded. Customer support isn't listening to them either. Don't download this app, it's not worth it.","date":"2020-07-09T01:22:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dauntlaw"}},{"id":"6174339930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","review":"When I opened the app I saw a giant Cheeto looking straight into my soul.

Then when I tried to get out of it, it gave me a virus smh. After that it showed me a video of a scary old man who said he had my information. Once I clicked out of that it then showed me a video of a pig being forced to dance to the macarana the poor thing was defenseless!!!!! But on top of all of that they my phone got hacked and now it’s playing random songs over and over again! I’ve been writing this for 7hrs because the virus it gave me won’t allow me to be on an app for more than 10 seconds!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:48:14Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"spike the boxer"}},{"id":"6174306767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"this ain’t it chile...","review":"Right after using this app my fridge went missing along with my whole family. All my food and house is gone. I DO NOT recommend using this because they’ll steal your kidneys in your sleep and will steal your whole house and house valuables. For some reason a walking Cheeto came into my house and stole ALL OF MY MONEY. He said “you better rate this 5 stars or I’ll harvest your organs” I refused and decided to call my dog over to bite his balls off. I splashed water on him and all the orange on his face drooped down onto the ground. He looks like a greasy salamander🤮. It was a VERY scary experience. WORST APP EVER. This app ruined my life!","date":"2020-07-09T00:39:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"m i l k & h o n e yt e a"}},{"id":"6174229893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️BE AWARE🧚🏻✨","review":"🧚🏻✨🤧downloading this app was a tragedy.

VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I downloaded this app because it was rated highly on the news section in the apple store. I was sorely disappointed to find out that it was a campaign propaganda machine. Did you know that the Trump Organization did not allow  employees to admit colored people (specifically African Americans) into their hotels before they were caught in 1973? Did you know Trump blames another country for his poor handling of COVID-19, despite claiming he was well prepared and not worried back in March. He’s a lying, racist crybaby with an app that works horribly. Please do you research  and whatever you do, don’t download this app.","date":"2020-07-08T23:34:48Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Liby Arel"}}]}
