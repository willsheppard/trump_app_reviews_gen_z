I tried using this app but my phone won’t stop ringing Black and yellow by  Wiz Khalifa, EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN THE APP THAT HAPPENS. Not only that it would show this really werid flag with Black and yellow. I really don’t like because my favorite flag is the American flag obviously , anyways please delete this app.","userName":"micajel"}},{"id":"6135870422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T13:05:52Z","rating":1,"title":"Made my eyes bleed ❌🤬","review":"I can’t believe how bad this app is. As soon as I opened it my eyes literally started bleeding out! I think the apps cursed to. Whenever I launch it I feel wind. One time, the wind grew so strong it threw my dog against the wall and she broke her leg 😖. I’m suing trump because his app is literally haunting me.","userName":"An annoyed girl 🧚🏽✨"}},{"id":"6135034789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T08:31:27Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible.","review":"This app wouldn’t even open at first and caused my phone to shut down. Along with that, it’s spreading an insane amount of misinformation. All I wanted to do was support my president, but I’m immensely disappointed in this app. If you want to support trump this is NOT the way to do it.","userName":"jejfjgjgkkd"}},{"id":"6134147218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T02:32:29Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible and Confusing App","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up to date with everything and it messed up my phone! Calls no longer come through, and when I try to play music it’s now all in Russian!! I can’t believe it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","userName":"Lucinda Holscher"}},{"id":"6133881679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T00:48:44Z","rating":1,"title":"horrible","review":"the app is filled with horrible propaganda. no mention of trumps involvements with russia and afghanistan that recently came to light, and no facts that prove his sexual assault allegations and court cases are false. the constant notifications are annoying. it drains my battery and doesn’t work well with cellular data. on top of that, trumps health seems to be declining, with many signs of dementia, and many of his staff have been diagnosed with covid-19. i would not recommend this app. it’s only good for horribly biased and propagated articles.","userName":"gracieeee19"}},{"id":"6133099079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-28T19:29:41Z","rating":1,"title":"Terribly Designed 🤮🤮🤮🤮","review":"Just plain terrible. Nothing about this app was helpful. You would think that he would be able to make a well designed app. But I could design a better app. And I know absolutely nothing about creating apps.","userName":"fishsticks🐠"}},{"id":"6124195772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-26T13:33:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!!","review":"I was so excited to finally download an app to show my support for the BEST PRESIDENT EVER! So disappointed when the app took FOREVER to download, crashed all the time, and - worst of all - has a picture of a rapist on the home screen. Terrible app. Would give 0 stars if I could.","userName":"Q-Mc"}},{"id":"6118095717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-25T00:26:08Z","rating":1,"title":"Be aware","review":"So as y’all know daddy trump is just amazeballs. Sadly, I believe this app is just trying to get me, like my credit card information, location and all kinds of personal data. Truly expected more of the lord of news... very disappointed.","userName":"dadddddyyyytrumpxx"}}]}
