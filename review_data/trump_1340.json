I downloaded it to “support my President” but when it asked for my phone number. First of all the audacity, the government is already collected all our info, but secondly when I caved to “support our President” I had to enter in the number 7 times before I would work. THEN it wouldn’t even load. The app kept crashing. Every. Single. Time. I’ve never had an app disrespect it’s user so much. If I could, I would call the manager of this app and give them a piece of my mind. But this is the closest thing to it. So in summary 1.) it’s another ploy from the government to get our data 2.) it doesn’t even work, so the campaign is actively supporting that fact 3.) no manager to complain to. Would NEVER recommend to a friend. I didn’t think Trump would be out here getting out data too, but it’s 2020 so what should I expect.","title":"The WORST app ever known to man.

Total mistake. I went on thinking “I already know he’s a racist, sexist, rapist, homophobic laughing stock... but maybe he is doing something for the country?” So I get on and it immediately tells me i need to drink bleach and never listen to any qualified health experts if I wanna survive COVID?? It really threw me off. But then it starting asking VERY personal questions that honestly made me feel uncomfortable. As soon as I checked the box for “black” ethnicity.... it sent a text message that said “vote for Trump 2020 or expect to be like the rest of your kind: dead from the police”. Within the next 5 minutes all my storage and data had been completely wiped out! The saddest part is... none of it surprised me!! Anyways I wish I could give the app 0 stars but that’s not an option 😔 if you wanna keep your sanity don’t download! 😹❤️","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"userName":"meh2456"}},{"id":"6174905652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:38:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is terrible my phone started glitching as soon as I got it.

As an old fashioned World GLOBE rotates in a sea of clouds, the EIFFEL TOWER slowly comes into view over the horizon, dwarfing FRANCE underneath it.\nT.V. NARRATOR Although each of the world’s\ncountries would like to dispute this fact, we French know the truth; the best food in the World is made in France. The best food in France is made in Paris, and the best food in Paris, some say, is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.\nWe see images of GUSTEAU: cooking, signing his cookbook, in front of his famous restaurant. Gusteau is in his early forties, but his massive girth makes him look older.\nT.V. NARRATOR (CONT’D) Gusteau’s restaurant is the toast\nof Paris, booked five months in advance, and his dazzling ascent to the top of Fine French Cuisine has made his competitors envious. He is the youngest Chef ever to achieve a five star rating. Chef Gusteau’s cookbook “Anyone Can Cook!” has climbed to the top of the best- seller list. But not everyone celebrates its success.\nA tall, gaunt, severe-looking MAN with fish-belly white skin appears on the TV screen. SUPER: ANTON EGO-FOOD CRITIC”. Beneath that, in italics, is his moniker: The Grim Eater.\nEGO\nAmusing title, “Anyone Can Cook”.\nWhat’s even more amusing is that Gusteau actually seems to believe it.

Second off I opened the app to see a wrinkly orange. I IMMEDIATELY CLICKED MY HOME BUTTON. THEN MY WALLPAPER WAS OF HIS WRINKLY CHEETO! I was traumatized. It was horrifying. HORRIFYING. Then my phone was glitching out. There was a voice in my phone saying “ trump 2020” I tried so hard to make it stop!! THEN I had to throw my phone out the window. My phone smashed. I had to buy a new one. The I walked down the stairs to see my cat was hanging on the ceiling. My microwave and fridge was gone! Then my pet dragon had a Cheeto in his mouth he flew on my roof!! I ran to my room to see that there were trump poster surrounding me. I took them off my wall and went to bed. At 2am I went to get some milk. I GOT VERY MAD WHEN I REMEMBERED THAT MY FRIDGE WAS GONE! so in conclusion DONT download the app. It is horrifying. I dig myself a hole and claimed in it to cry.

REPULSIVE. it doesn't inform users on current events sufficiently or give any kind of background information when it does. 🙄👀 lowkey y'all should just delete it tbh. everything about this app is disgraceful and betrays the ideals of our nation. 🤡alexander hamilton would be SHOOK that's all i'm gonna say about that. are my crops watered? no. is my skin cleared? no. i honestly went into this with the highest of hopes but i could not have possibly hoped for an app worse than this one turned out to be. 😪😪discostang. that's on periodt. \n😗✌️","title":"haha no thanks 👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️💕✨","rating":1,"userName":"😤🤧😔😖✌️✨"}},{"id":"6173958885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:41Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app bc I thought it was for serious presidential candidates then I realized it was just a Cheeto app. I opened the app to see the Cheeto with its fist in the air looking up at the sky. (I assume this is how he’ll look when his soul leaves his body right before it drops to the floor and fall into hell) I don’t know how this app works and it’s giving off this nasty odor that made my pet cat pass out. So I took my pet monkey to the vet but they said they only treat aquatic animals and they proceeded with the surgery bc the bird clinic was closed so I couldn’t go there. So I left the place with the sun beaming on me, and decided to go to the abortion clinic. Bc it was dark outside I couldn’t see and now my eyes are blind from the acidic rain. For a better alternative, there is an app called dump trump that I prefer. Also the Cheeto has dementia so he’ll probably be six feet under soon.

I quickly clicked off scared that my phone would end up with a virus from such a horrid picture, the next day I continued and managed to go in . I then said this orange pig eating his own little chicken nugget and my eyeballs fell out and I was so scarred that I have been sent to therapy and I have a session every 20 minutes. Unfortunately I couldn’t write this on my own due to my incident and I have my friend jake from state farm type this in for me. After this I have to go and dip my eyes in acid to see if I can forget everything I saw, I was also thinking of making a device so I could erase my memory! This app also kidnapps your kids!!!! Every since my incident I haven’t seen my kids in weeks so don’t sacrifice your eyes for this garbage ! It’s not worth it!","title":"I’m officially blind!","rating":1,"userName":"officiallly blind"}}]}
