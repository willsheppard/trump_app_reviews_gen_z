Plus there will be so much notifications that you cant stop. My child 6 year old son cried because he did not know the danger. I don’t recommend it and everyone should rate it a zero just to speak out the news. It dose absolutely nothing just about the news you can watch more stuff on your tv all trumps wants if for more people to get it instead of just watching the news.","userName":"Ldshodolady","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS APP"}},{"id":"6174744270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:50:22Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and as soon as I opened it all the plants in my house shriveled up and died! Obviously I was very devastated about this because I love my plants but nevertheless I continued on with my day. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Later I was washing my hands in the bathroom and I looked up and saw that my face was turning slightly orange in the mirror. I tried to wash it off but it wasn’t coming off and I kept getting more orange! Now I can’t get myself to stop saying make America great again and go back to your country! I don’t know what is going on this app has some weird vibes!! 👻👻👻👻👻","userName":"jordyngiann123","isEdited":false,"title":"BAD VIBES APP"}},{"id":"6174712705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:40:48Z","rating":1,"review":"Okay, first off, this app (right when you open it) starts talking about “China” (in a very odd way) and other odd topical political things in a very weird way. Next thing I know, I look over and my cat is standing up cooking things in the microwave! My cat was saying things like; \n“This cat form is very limiting, please, Linda, sacrifice me to the overlords so I can be free once again” and, of course, I’m like,\n“Mr Hot sauce, you’re so silly!” And right as I say that, this app started saying; “Shawty like a melody in my head” over and over again! \nAnd to top it all off a naked Cheeto was on the screen! Don’t download this!!!","userName":"Lillie❤️💙❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"bad bad bad bad"}},{"id":"6174695852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:35:43Z","rating":1,"review":"It stole my pet Tyrannosaurus rex it made me forget to water my pool! And then I had to eat my mac & cheese but then it stole it and I had to go to the supermarket and get more pools to water!!! That I bought a baby off of craigslist and fed it Tyrannosaurus rex food and then it started turning into a Tyrannosaurus rex so I ran away put my oven and went to the future!! Then I saw 40 million people trying to eat tea Rex food but I said no and hopped back in my oven and went back! Then I remembered I have a water gun to eat chicken with and I watered my car with juice!

You may be wondering there were no further instructions until I looked at my cat an he had a sticky note on him I looked at the sticky note and it say ‘to eat a pineapple’ I assumed those were the rest of the instructions but you see I’m allergic to pineapple so unless our pedo- oops I mean president gives us universal healthcare then I will not follow the instructions to eat a pineapple","userName":"Esme #1","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6174634819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:17:59Z","rating":1,"review":"So I went to open the app, ya know like a human does, and there seems to be a horrible mistake. It said something about a president, and as humans usually do, I figured this would be along the line of like a president something, that humans have. So I thought that it was weird and I thought, “hmm I better make sure I know what’s going on here”, like a good human. I’m very disappointed in what I found, like most humans. So here I am, as many other humans are, benefitting the society, which I was born in, and sharing my opinion following the examples of the sub-human category, “Karen’s” have displayed.","userName":"Definetly a human","isEdited":false,"title":"Wrong information"}},{"id":"6174574251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:53Z","rating":1,"review":"I personally feel attacked the way when I open the app I saw his face I feel so disrespected in a way and they had meetings and meet ups they were meeting up with each other to talk about how they love our president who is a disgusting person anyway gen z 2020 you cannot get rid of us and you’re getting rid of TikTok who do you think you are honestly I just like you and I always well I hope you cry when this App goes down in flames I will be laughing ha ha Ha ha ha anybody who thought that Trump was a great person you’re clearly delusional you will forever be delusional","userName":"leahdenise007","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting that this is our president"}},{"id":"6174523161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:14Z","rating":1,"review":"I don’t know why you would even think about taking down a great and entertaining platform that let’s kids speak there minds and be there selfs. Its entertaining, fun, teaches people things and shows them what’s going on in the world and what’s new and happening. People on this app start trends and definitely made this quarantine more exiting and definitely helped me get through it and come out a sane person unlike you.🤣 It’s amazing how dumb you can be!

When I opened the app I was immediately greeted with what seemed to be a Cheeto puff wearing a tupé. All of a sudden I was hungry so I drove my tree over to Walmart to eat my microwave. As I was telling the drive thru employee my order of glue the app opened unexpectedly saying that I needed to  feed my pet lamp. I found this very disrespectful because my pet lamp died a year ago. As I was flying on my macaroni back to my house Harry styles stopped me. He told me to delete the app, so I did. 100% not worth it.","userName":"ketchup packet with mayo","isEdited":false,"title":"Not at all immaculate"}},{"id":"6174438542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:46Z","rating":1,"review":"Right after downloading it, it gave my phone a virus and sent constant Photos of a Cheeto working out in a Speedo, I’m traumatized now. I’ve had to undergo 6 months of therapy to function even as half normal as I used too. The first week after downloading was the worst the constant stress from the photos caused me to break out all of my body, now I have tons of permanent acne scars from this app. I can’t sleep at night, I tried to share my experience on the app and the people their found out were I lived and came to my house to curb stomp me. \nMy life is now ruined from this app.","userName":"xjrishhsjdkn","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app"}}]}
