So excited to see what it had in store I open this app. I suddenly got a sick feeling. Maybe I just needed a smoke idfk. So I’m out here and suddenly I see it. It’s hair is flopping to the side, the orange tint coming off of it was frightening. As the orange flop creature made its way closer I could smell what I can only describe as “old French fries and beef”. My heart started racing. What did it want? What should I do? Should I scream. That’s when I heard it yell “BUUUUUUIIILLLLDDDD THHHEE WALL”. It’s at this point I see it in the light. I gasp at the sight! ITS BRIGHT ORANGE CHINS WERE DOWN TO ITS KNEES. ITS FAKE HAIR BLEW IN THE SLIGHT BREEZE.....I see it pout it lips out like a duck and I passed out. When I woke I realized this had been a dream. Don’t download this app it will give you nightmares.","userName":"dannedbannarr","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download this app!"}},{"id":"6174976109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:00:03Z","rating":1,"review":"I decided to go walk my toaster down the lake when I heard a loud crunch coming from the bottom of my elbow. I raised it up and discovered that I drove over a wrinkly dusty cheeto. I immediately created a thought bubble; maybe I should download the Cheeto app everyone is whispering about...I do love crunching on some Cheetos. So I said not why🤷🏾\u200D♀️. \n\nI fished my toaster out of the lake and ran my bike home. I immediately downloaded the Cheeto app but discovered that it would take a while to load but it’s ok cuz I got hungry. I decided to make...you guessed it; CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH! I put the crunch in the oven, and let it freeze for 20 hours. After a few minutes, it was ready to eat. After I ate, I decided to go for a walk and as I ran, I saw the most beautiful guy. He waved at me and I winked back...it was love at first site. \n\nWe got married, had some kids, and bought a mansion as successful business owners. Life seemed peachy...wait no orangey...no...Cheeto like...THE APP I FORGOT ABOUT THE APP!\n\nSo after I made my TOAST CRUNCH, the app finished downloading but it was so glitchy and didn’t even bring me any crunchy cheeto’s. So I deleted it and moved on with my life and I suggest you do the same.\n\n-sincerely, \nA happy, married, trump-less citizen","userName":"Jay394","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6174868915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:27:35Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app originally to get updates about the Trump administrations decisions and announcements, but within only seconds of opening the app, I immediately noticed that there were heavy glitches in the app. People using this app may experience glitches such as blatant racism, denied racism, hidden racism, prejudice towards different peoples, homophobia, xenophobia, ignorance and climate change denial. In addition, after prolonged use of this app, it is possible that you may begin to start accepting the “truth” given from this app without proper research and information, all while the white users deny the privilege they use on a daily basis! 0/10 would NOT recommend, only download if you wish for a life full of sexual allegations and you aren’t able to coherently put together a sentence with more than 5 words!","userName":"Tylerkost29","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitches"}},{"id":"6174866386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:26:50Z","rating":1,"review":"I got this app thinking it would be informative on everything going on with our president, but I have never been so beyond disappointed. The app is not navigable and poorly designed. I will be uninstalling this awful app until something more presentable and non low quality is put out. I WISH this was a complaint like all these other reviews, but I am sincerely and severely disappointed such smart people could release a poorly designed app. All it really is, is information that the news is releasing daily- I'm sure I can keep up to date on Twitter or Facebook from the Trump administration and it still be the same information given on this app. It's just a ploy to say you received notifications from Trump while the app has unnecessary information for a glorified news app.","userName":"xxabyssalxx","isEdited":false,"title":"Do Not Install."}},{"id":"6174856081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:23:48Z","rating":1,"review":"as soon as I downloaded this app I felt the demon enter my spirit. I felt the urge to run to the nearest Walmart and purchase the chunkiest ugliest hair highlight dye I could find. Not to mention the 34 American flag flip flops I picked up along the way. I found my education draining from my body, my human decency fleeing from my spirit. I had to call the priest to come perform an exorcism and guess who shows up at my door step? Leigh-allyn baker most famous for originating the role of Amy Duncan on good luck Charlie. She begged me to keep the app, that vaccines are truly bad and that I should get that chunky highlight pixie cut mom hairdo but I said NO Amy. I don’t like this person I’ve become. Begrudgingly Amy helped me delete the app from my phone and suddenly I threw up the American flag, returning to my liberal snowflake self. And in that moment, I knew I could snowboard.","userName":"obamaimissu:(","isEdited":false,"title":"Oh to see without my BÜHŸĘŠ"}},{"id":"6174830933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:16:23Z","rating":1,"review":"Do not get this app! This is the worst app I’ve ever had in my 69 years of life! As soon as I downloaded it, it asked for my location. The app made my phone so slow and scolding hot! I had to sit in my walk in freezer for it to be a suitable temperature! I’m the process , I got hypothermia and my pinkie fingers froze and fell off! My dogs ate them. After I returned from the hospital , there was a swät team waiting for me to enter my home ! Why, you ask? Because this app sent my location to them claiming I was a double agent ! After I explained and they left , I was finally at peace. Until I was bombarded with thousands of Trump, dark web, rácist, hömophobic, and mÿsogenistic ads! Following that, I received a scam call claiming it was part of the 2020 campaign. Needless to say, I will NEVER vote for Trump for as long as I live! #TrumpForJail2020 #ThisIsAllAlleged #LongLiveTökTïk","userName":"poogang42069","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP TO EXIST"}},{"id":"6174793115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:05:17Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is ridiculously slow and is truly a price of trash. After I downloaded it, my phone began to glitch and the app wouldn’t even open. Once I finally got it to work (after about an hour) I checked out the app itself. Its set up is terrible and everything is so disorganized. It’s difficult to find anything and it’s so cluttered. I would recommend not even touching this app because it’s the worst app I’ve ever downloaded, and it does more harm than good. Just want to say that because of this app, my life is in shambles. My wife split with me once she figured out I was a Trumpet, and my bank account was hacked into. Not only that, I was evicted from my house, and I lost my job! This app has ruined my life, and I highly recommend you not even set eyes on it! I can’t believe I ever trusted that hot cheeto!!!!!","userName":"menita :)","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT BUY"}},{"id":"6174740705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:49:16Z","rating":1,"review":"✨🧚🏻I just thought I would like hold you like that you can just get me and I wanna was your way I was just messing with you and you were going out to the bathroom I didn’t know if you’re going I didn’t want you guys I just thought you didn’t know I wanna I like that I don’t want you guys I don’t know how to do that but I’m just gonna was that you guys are going out and you’re gonna was your birthday so you wanna go to get my hair and then go back and look for you guys and I’ll go hang with y’all I don’t want you guys I don’t know how you feel about it I don’t want to go hang with me I’m just gonna was that you guys are going out and you’re gonna was that I wanna go hang with y’all I don’t know what you’re doing and I’m just gonna I was really like you and you didn’t want me going out with you bruh bruh I wanna go hanging 🧚🏻✨","userName":"ieatshrimp","isEdited":false,"title":"Ew smeellsss nasstyyy"}},{"id":"6174690928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:34:16Z","rating":1,"review":"I seriously do not know what’s wrong with this app when I downloaded it it immediately started to crash and it seemed that any time I would search some thing up in the app or do anything regarding buying merchandise or anything of the matter it would just keep on crashing it’s literally such a waste of space I think this ad needs to be eradicated from the App Store immediately and there’s literally no reason for existence I really hope that iPhone and Apple and the App Store really take this review into consideration because the fact that this app exists is literally a crime to humanity I can’t believe I spent three hours with this app on my screen because it crashed so hard that it wouldn’t let me access any of my other applications or anything","userName":"no. ❤️🤮","isEdited":false,"title":"it tried. it should never try again"}},{"id":"6174581186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:51Z","rating":1,"review":"This app...UGH... where do we even begin? First, I do not want to see naked giraffes right when I log in! Second, it is absolutely DISGUSTING that they use the term “do it for the vine” every time I want to click on something. I would give it -5 stars if I could. Now for the most disturbing part of this app is that people would even consider giving it a 5 star rating... not to even add the rats that they give out for free. ANIMAL CRUELTY IS NOT A THING TO LAUGH ABOUT PEOPLE!! There are so many technical problems with it... This is as DISAPPOINTING as when I got a caterpillar when in the website it listed it as a dolphin. I really was expecting better. I would never let my dog look, or come close to this app. I should have used the data this took from my device for the app “ How to water pools “. Again... DISAPPOINTED 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼😑","userName":"Xx Gigi_the_demonxX**","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!! 🤢🤮"}}]}
