This app is the most horrible thing ever!!! This app took several hours to download! When I opened this app it opened a black hole in my living room, but instead of it sucking up things it was releasing such horrible things such as equality, justice for all the black lives that were killed to policy brutality, and the investigation of president 🤡🎃 for his MANY allegations of sex trafficking, Raping several women, and just being a trashy human being in general. I was mortified!!"}},{"id":"6173620332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:27:38Z","userName":"peep284","title":"Terrible","review":"It took to long to download, Trump is racist, homophobic and a man child. He is much more but that’s from the top of my head, people who say,” trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸” please educate yourself on what’s he’s done before his presidency and after also. He raped a 13 year old girl, imagine that. Especially, the way he talks about his daughter. He asked if it’s wrong to be more attracted to your daughter more then your wife, I don’t know about you but that sounds absolutely disgusting."}},{"id":"6173606850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:22:48Z","userName":"GiannaVictoria","title":"🍊","review":"As soon as I opened the app my dog went insane.

When I got it to work all of the news were unorganized and wouldn’t load. And this man named trump was everywhere, I think he was trying hack the app. I would like to speak to the manager of this app. I feel as though all the news was made by snowflakes and stupid people. And this boy Trump was, like I said, trying to hack the app. Supper unsafe and doesn’t work, I don’t recommend!"}},{"id":"6173498038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:21Z","userName":"✨educated child ✨","title":"•not recommended🧚🏼\u200D♀️😻✨•","review":"this app is horrible ,It kept crashing on me , I even tried to restart my phone but that didn’t work . - we do not stand that white supremacists😻- ACAB - #justiceforthekidsincages #justiceforvanessaguillen BLM 🙏🏽✨0/10 recommend to download this app to support that white pathetic chetto puff .
