Come to my surprise as soon as i opened I got spammed pictures of orange 🍊 at first I thought it was the man himself but I took a look closer and instead of his wig I saw a green leaf. I just thought it was a a glitch but as I set my phone down to eat it rang. So I answered even tho it was 3:00 in the morning but when I answered a song came on that said quote “ chicken wing chicken wing hot dog and baloney chicken and macaroni chilling with my homeies” I jumped up because it scared me. Then a bang on the door. I jumped to see what it was and it was a horse with a dog body and trumps orange face! I slammed the door and ran to my phone to delete the app as everyone should! I wish I could put zero stars so yea that’s it and till this day I don’t support trump and neither shall you 🧚🥰🙂","userName":"tik toker 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T11:59:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"PLEASE READ","rating":1}},{"id":"6176297891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened this app, my phone glitched. I’m sure that this app unleashed viruses into my phone that I cannot fix. In addition to that, my phone starting getting really warm from the app and started violently shaking. Then, I started hearing barking noises from the phone ( they actually sounded EXACTLY like my dead dog 😭 R.I.P. Pixie) So in order to get those barking noises, I think that President Trump must have kidnapped my dog ( it had gone missing for some time) recorded its bark, took MY hard-earned money for the 10,000 reward for Pixie’s finding and then slaughtered my dog in cold blood. Now, you may be thinking why would I download an app that is curated for a dog-murdering, misogynistic, rapist, and racist man? Well, I think that ALL APPS MATTER, so i figured i’d give it a try. But, unfortunately my experience was just awful (like Donald Trumps hair)Ok now, toodles 😘🤚","userName":"Essie Kay ll","date":"2020-07-09T11:35:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS DESPICABLE!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175650312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Don’t even get me started on the trouble this app has caused me. I downloaded this app to see what it was all about, I liked the colors because red is cool you know? As soon as I downloaded it I got a ton of spam calls telling me to vote trump. I was very confused and blocked them. When I did that I found a message in a Coors Light bottle floating in my bathtub saying that if I didn’t vote trump 2020 I’d never see my knee caps again. I went to bed as confused as ever and when I woke up I didn’t have my kneecaps anymore. Feeling frisky I decided to take this information to Congress but I was told that because I didn’t respond to the message in the bottle with “yeah❤️” I had to lose my kneecaps because they couldn’t be sure I would vote for trump. This app is absolutely horrible. It cost me my time and kneecaps.","userName":"brookied14","date":"2020-07-09T08:04:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I just want my kneecaps back, horrible app","rating":1}},{"id":"6175055925","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I saw this app and I was thinking about visiting the wall of Mexico, so I booked my flight and I went and Got Covid, I didnt wear a mask and didn’t stay isolated, this Mexican White Lady walked up to me and handed me a paper about Danald Tumpits Birthday And she had a knife On her and she told be to open my wallet or else she will steal my Mattress, so I Opened my wallet and there was no cash, I had a Apple Credit card, so she Slapped me in the face and said “bye bye Mat” So the next day I went home, “3857Texas street and the town was Arizona, the state is California, I got home and went to my bedroom to unpack and too my surprise, MY MATTRESS WAS GONE, So I called 911 and told them that someone stole my mattress and he hung up, so I packed my bags and called my but Unicorn shaped burrito and He Too me to Jupiter Too me Lemonade stand that really sold my Pee","userName":"titanic087","date":"2020-07-09T04:25:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1}},{"id":"6175013629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!  \nSlower than the plot development of one episode of One Piece.\nMore useless than Sakura yelling “Sasuke-kun” fifty times an episode.\nI swear, just trying to open the app and it immediately crashing like Truck-kun Isekai-ing the protagonist gave me more anger issues than Eren whenever he sees a Titan. It killed me like the author killing the main characters’ best friend for development; hard and coldly, but not unexpectedly.\nIt crashed harder than the ball on the opposite side of the court when kageyama and hinata do their freak quick. My standards were broken harder than the ball when Oikawa serves. It’s harder to navigate than tendos personality. I felt like akaashi having his anxiety attack on his second game in nationals. I have more complaints than Sailor Moon when she only has to do her job. So many in fact that I cannot fit them into one review.","userName":"Trajectory54","date":"2020-07-09T04:12:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Big no","rating":1}},{"id":"6174985805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app, my phone shut down. Then my power went out and I couldn’t make my midnight Hot Pocket. Then the app got my location and shipped a single McDonald’s chicken nugget to my house. Then the app killed my pet lion named Tiger. Then my fridge stopped working and my yogurt got warm. (Ewww) The app deleted my TikTok accounts. Just because the president doesn’t like china doesn’t mean that I should be punished for it. That ❄️. Smh I can’t even process the anger I’m feeling. That Oompa Loompa makes me wanna puke in his pillow case right before he lays on it. If the government is gonna ban any app, it should be this one. This app made me do the Macarena for hours and my parents were NOT here for it. This app is as bad as that orange, pig, Oompa Loompa we have as a president. This app needs to die forever. Many lives were hurt after downloading this stupid app.","userName":"bellamarie0","date":"2020-07-09T04:03:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app EVERRRRRRRR","rating":1}},{"id":"6174773203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"don’t get me wrong, i’ve owned some pretty low-quality apps. however, this one takes the cake. never have I ever had an app that glitches so much!! i am not even sure what it is supposed to be doing. it sends me incoherent notifications ALMOST EVERY MINUTE and has TAKEN OVER ALL MY OTHER APPS! my darling dog Bark-o-rific has begun to cry whenever he sights my phone, due to the intense fear and pain the app causes his brain telepathically. the app has also begun to control my actions. my stove and fireplaces keeps lighting themselves whenever I come near, in hopes of me throwing my phone in.

How dare this man band TikTok and ruin my quarantine. Like excuse you? Nobody wants u to be president but AT LEAST we don’t go and band you from the White House. Just because a bunch of teens tricked you does not mean you band the app. It is amazing! People started there career on there and spread positivity and creativity. People quit there jobs and lost money to do TikTok for a living and look how far they have come...but really this is a terrible app so please do not download... \n\n#TIKTOK LIVES MATTER ✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"classic.em","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Doing this for the TikTok","rating":1}},{"id":"6174147095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app 😡 made a laser come out of my phone and cooked my dog. 😳thinking this was a fun and fabulous filter, i brought it to show my friend. however, the laser was very orange and very real. my friend 👩\u200D🚒used the camera and was immediately disintegrated into a fine cheeto dust powder. 😅i, very pertrubed, tried to revive her by pouring holy water on it. sadly, the dust that used to be my ᗷᗴ̈ᔕ́TŸ hissed and sizzled at the touch of the holy water. 😼my phone began to shake violently, and transformed into nikocado avocados onlyfans with a deep orange tinted color. 🤪nik/trump began to beat his chest angrily, and grabbed an axe from behind it. 😈it is now running rampant around my house, trying to kill me. i am hiding in my bathroom.😳 please help. ☹️if you want updates on my current situation, i will be posting survival updates in the comment section of starships by nikki minaj. 😁god bless america. 🤪","userName":"my name is actually nikki lol","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"became trump nikocado avocado pls help","rating":1}},{"id":"6174118615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"right when i opened the app...i saw a cheeto thing pole dancing, which is extremely inappropriate! i had to wash my eyes out and tried to delete that memory. after getting past that part on the app, i was looking around for a bit, just to realize the app stole my fish tank! i miss my little fishies and am very, very angry they took them 😡. after that incident, i decided to go to chipotle to get a burrito, but this dumb app put bugs in my food! i had food poisoning right after, had to go to the e.r., all thanks to this annoying app. once i got to the e.r, i realized that the doctor looked EXACTLY like the big cheeto thing i saw when i first opened this app, so i passed out, traumatized, and fell into a deep coma for 3 years. now, i’ve just woken up and am VERY ANGRY! don’t download this app, it will put incests in your food and just ruin your life.","userName":"bts lover <3","date":"2020-07-08T23:32:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrifying!","rating":1}}]}
