Hundreds of those kids were locked up in cages. This was a clear violation of international law, and experts with the United Nations’ Human Rights Council also said the policy may have amounted to “torture.”","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:02Z"}},{"id":"6174399271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AliaM2007","title":"horrible app","rating":1,"review":"i wish i could give this app less than a 1 start rating. it deserves ZERO. anyway, this app is supppppeerrrr bad and always freezes up on me. when i first opened up the app, i saw an image of the UGLIEST and scariest man i’ve ever seen. he has very tan skin and blond hair that looked like it was balding. anyways, bad app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:56Z"}},{"id":"6174384804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The attack of the cereal men","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"review":"The moment I opened the app I closed it immediately after.
