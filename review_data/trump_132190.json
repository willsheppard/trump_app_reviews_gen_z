Yes you heard me right then someone knocked on my door and asked me if I liked corn and I said no. The man slapped me and when I woke up I saw the corn man. He forced corn into my mouth and yelled “DO YOU LIKE CORN NOW?!!???” I said no again. I broke free and ran back to my house to see my cat levitating saying “vote trump 2020” I screamed and had a heart attack. I am leaving a bad review because I think that trump should give me money for the hospital bills. \n\nMy worst regards, tick tok lives matter 2020✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿❤️💕💅 pErIoDt SiS. \n\nPs if you ban tick tok gen z will come and steal your wig corn man.

It disgusts me that anyone would want to download this horrific app. When I opened the app, it asked for my social security number. I entered it in and immediately got booted out of the app. I tried again to access the app but it kept booting me out. I think I’m in serious trouble now. But in conclusion, don’t waste your time downloading this app. You’ll regret it."}},{"id":"6174023129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Angelica_lovely","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No good Nut sack president 😒😢😔","rating":1,"review":"This is a horrible app, first off I seen his orange pepe🤮when I first opened the the app and I seen Cheeto getting a horrible spray tan NAKED which is horrible by the way.It kept freezing up and when I searched something up it said not found when it should have been valid. It even showed a picture of his wig and it looked like plastic and it was horrifying for my kids to see that nudity. What a bad influence on kids😒 it is really disappointing to see this kind of immaturity coming from a leader position like him when my kid joined a zoom and the class was talking about trump as a topic she said “ I seen his Pepe “ so disappointed"}},{"id":"6174022761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chlorisnereus","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i was emotionally abused","rating":1,"review":"I honest to god thought this was just going to be a normal app but when i had just tapped on the application to open it, i was horrified to see trumps voluptuous cheeks pop up on the screen??? i was..surprised to say the least, but as i swiped to try and push it away from my face in an attempt protect the innocence of my younger siblings, he crawled out of the screen and told my whole family to go back to where we came from ??? but we were in america? where he has CLAIMED to make it great again, i was confused, but i told our great president “this is where we were born Mr.Donald Duck, we have no where else to go” practically begging him to let us stay here. i handed him a bag of cheetos in an attempt to fix this relationship that we have built up, but he looked at me horrified and said “am i a joke to you” i replied with “but mr duck, dont leave, we’- we’ve been through so much together, ive had a child 🙈 and hes yours 😢🖤 please dont leave sir” i break into a musical rendition of an award winning musical “hamilton”’s song “Say No to This” and it thankfully brings him back asking for more. little does he know im a MINOR the feds bust in they arrest him, he says to me “but, miss, that was little duck jr who will be there for him?” and thats when i realized he was the worst father for little duck jr and i pulled out the app store and left this review. thank you for reading"}}]}
