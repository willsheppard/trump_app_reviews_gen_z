Right after getting this app I started getting spam calls and so many texts from random numbers asking for my bank account information. I am so in raged that this app is still on this website. I think it’s best if this app was taken down it was not well-made and other people should not be tricked into downloading it like I was. For people asking if you should download this app to get information on our president this is not the app!! 😡"}},{"id":"6133825486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gg0023","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T00:26:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T GET THIS APP","review":"I downloaded this app recently because I was very interested in what it was about and people had recommended me to get it. I thought it was going to be a good app however when I had opened the app it kicked me out. At first I thought there was something wrong with my phone but it was only doing it with this app nothing else. I waited days then it finally worked when I got into the app random glitches start to happen. For example it wouldn’t let me type nor press anything. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone."}},{"id":"6177874763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hroshdkba","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:03:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute trash","review":"I wanted to stay updated on our ✨incredible✨ Cheeto president but after its constant crashing and lack of opposing views and censorship, I’ve deleted the app and wish I could burn my phone after using it for a whopping 4 seconds. I feel like my poor phone got chlamydia so on top of the trauma it gave me, I’ll probably have to get a new phone to put my current one out of its misery. If I could, I’d give this trash app a 0. It’s a disgrace to have something like this given to the public and should be taken down immediately."}},{"id":"6177756102","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no muy bueno🤚🏽😟","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:27:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP. no bueno😠😔.","review":"This is the WORST APP EVER MADE I downloaded it to support our “great “🍊🧀president and to make America “great again”👨\u200D🦯 but NO IT TOOK 3 WEEKS TO DOWNLOAD and that is unacceptable 🧚\u200D♀️ for an app to take that long to down load😐in other words this app also is no bueno porque es de el presidente que se mira como una papita de cesó y eso no está bien👁👄👁 also idk why these boomers love this app like it’s the worst app u can ever have and I had the worst experience 😒i really don’t get the hype over this app NOT TO MENTION there has been weird things happening in my household ever since I got this app 😟😔🤚🏽 overall I do not recommend 🧚\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6177728776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧡🎃🎃🍊🍊🧡🧡🧡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"thoroughly disappointed 😔","review":"i am very disappointed on how this app performed. i was very excited to finally be able to send “vote trump 2020” stickers to all the children being held in cages by ICE. but unfortunately when i downloaded it, a giant               🧡cheeto🧡 popped onto my screen. naturally, i got scared and chucked my phone at the vote trump and pence sign lodged in the grass of my front yard. the sign absolutely obliterated my phone and forced my to spend $1000 on a new one. had this 🧡cheeto🧡 not be president in the first place, we wouldn’t have all these issues would we?"}},{"id":"6177608154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gina NoAds","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:41:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Such a waste of time","review":"I was told to download this app because it helps you locate nearby trash/waste disposal areas but it keeps taking me to DC. I honestly don’t have the time to go over there. I have a life ya know!✨ Besides that the app is not worth downloading. It was a waste of time. I wish I could somehow go back in time and stop myself from downloading it. Avengers wherever you are, please let me borrow the time traveling machine! I’ll do whatever you ask😘. Also if anybody wants to join me. We can go back to 2016 when life was better!✨✨💫"}},{"id":"6177569123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gabbybr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:28:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️","review":"I was originally conflicted on whether i should download this app or not but i decided to give it a chance. Right off the bat, we started off wrong, all my high hopes went down 📉 as soon as i saw a very familiar face and i couldn’t help but think about how racist, sexist, misogynistic, inappropriate, homophobic, xenophobic, lacking of common sense and of basic human decency this man right in front of me was/has. I would not recommend this app at all, it brought out much resentment and i don’t think anyone deserves to feel this way nor stare at such face. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰"}},{"id":"6177557909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hue hazz the 2nd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:25:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Why is my phone now racist?","review":"After downloading this app my phone would automatically change what I would try to say to racist things it took over my Twitter and started posting stuff like trump 2020 and all lives matter it also posted about how it wants to put all the Mexicans into concentration camps and how after they put them in concentration camps they’re gonna lose a bunch of kids but we all know it’s human trafficking and so much more I just don’t understand how this app could do such a thing so I’m gonna delete it"}},{"id":"6177519346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Everest glade","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"tiktok bb 😌✨","review":"I obviously got this app to show my support for the 🍊 Cheeto in Cheif 🍊 and all of his racist, sexist, homophobic ways. grrr, we don’t like the 🤢 g a y s. Unfortunately 🤧the app took two days to download and wouldn’t take my email information. The ✨ bunker boy ✨ clearly didn’t realize that this app would give all his lovely supporters😈more misinformation and *gasp* headaches as well. Yes, that’s right, all of the sheer stupidity on this app gave me ✨headaches ✨ if any more of his lovely supporters would like to download this app, I would advise against it.
