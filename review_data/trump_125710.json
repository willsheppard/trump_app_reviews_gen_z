Every time I click to open something on the app I hear a fart noise!! I’m not sure how the Trump administration did it but they’ve HACKED MY PHONE!! They got information from my device and somehow MY NUMBER??? I now CONSTANTLY get texts from Eric Trump telling me to “hop off his dads ass” ??? I find it INCREDIBLY invasive and rude!!! Eric has texted me multiple times letting me know that he is selling ALL not just some but ALL of my information to the Russian government!! I’m not really sure what it means but it must be bad! No one and I mean NO ONE should download this app unless they want to experience rude messages from the Trump family!!!! 😤🤬👎🙅🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"Gracel77","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179179792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:01:38Z","title":"Worst thing ever to be on here","review":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmhmhhmgmgmmhm","userName":"bxby-Asa","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179175189","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:59:56Z","title":"Horrible 😘🥰💞💖","review":"It keeps glitching and I hate it the app would just keep restarting and it’s horrible apple please remove off the App Store follow me on tiktok @eggscaliber lol 💞😘","userName":"meistmemes","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179174362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:59:37Z","title":"Bad horrible bad horrible bad horrible bad horrible","review":"Bad horrible bad horrible bad","userName":"Don't buy it it's a rip off","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179169841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:57:55Z","title":"Trump app more like Dump app (made me poop a lot)","review":"I downloaded this app thinking I would be able to get in touch with my favourite guy. but I was wrong. oddly enough, it made my room smell really really bad. I’m talking old cream cheese sitting outside in Florida heat for 50 days. I tried everything. Febreze didn’t work only made it worse. I have no pets, no kids, I am just a hard working single American. I even moved houses and THE SMELL WOULDNT LEAVE. Finally, I deleted the app and ***BOOM*** smell was gone. I redownloaded it a little while ago and the smell came back shortly after. But this time, it wasn’t just cream cheese, it was the awful smell of saliva covered fingers with the residue of the Cheeto dust that once was there. it was rotten. I threw up so hard that I was pooping at the same time. My throat swelled and my hole collapsed. My face veins popped and I went to the emergency room. I needed to delete that app. So I did. This app has not only brainwashed me, but washed my insides out. Unless you’re looking for a super laxative, this app is useless. Delete it from the App Store before someone else gets hurt! very angry. very sad. bad.","userName":"Alivia:):):)","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179166911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:56:46Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP‼️‼️🚫","review":"this app is horrible . it took forever to download(465days) ,it wanted my location, it crashed my phone , it deleted all my apps , it tried to make me sign a petition knowing I’m UNDERAGE✨, it wanted my phone number, wanted my mother/fathers name ,asked what my blood type was ....this app wanted to many things from me and i couldn’t give it . it was asking personal questions and i didn’t feel comfortable with it. the orange cracker shouldn’t have made this app 🥱it was a complete waste of my time and everyones effort . the sign up was entirely too long (6hours). there’s soooo many things wrong with the human and the app .
