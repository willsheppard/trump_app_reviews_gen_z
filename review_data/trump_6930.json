Plus everything is not biased enough. Where is the spice??🐍 The flavor??💅 It’s just too bad I was really looking forward to using the app and it just didn’t go over well😔 We can do better honestly😇 We could settle for something else🥰 Anyway thanks for taking this into consideration🧚\u200D♀️✨🧡","userName":"Orange Love🧡🧡","title":"For My Orange President🧚\u200D♀️🧡"}},{"id":"6158814246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-05T03:58:40Z","rating":1,"review":"This morning I decided to wake up and smell the fresh air, with my windows open and the curtains wide open. As I let the sun warm my delicate skin, I slipped out my phone from the in betweens of my two twin sized beds that I sleep on every night to download this app. \n\nNeedless to say, I was outraged by the amount of inappropriate questions it threw at me. “What’s the day that the first potato chip was invented?”, “How many almonds does it take to get cyanide poisoning?” Left and right I was astounded and attacked by the very app I was trying to support. \n\nWorst of all, were the pop ups and ads that wouldn’t even let me touch the settings to change my profile picture. (Aunt Betty wasn’t happy with the first one that I took and demanded I put a holy picture instead so that it would not taint my sacred mind).\n\nNeedless to say, this app was horrendous. Do not recommend.","userName":"definently not john crocs","title":"Shocked and Confused"}},{"id":"6148535548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T13:58:05Z","rating":1,"review":"Hello all. 💅🏻✨I downloaded this app because I was hoping to get some more information about Donald Trump and his values.😺 When I opened the app I heard a crash downstairs. 🏃🏻🏃🏻I ran to what were my children and found unconscious bodies of manny from the unreleased Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie. 🐶🤣I immediately hold my two children in my arms and their sharpie bodies look at me one last time and say, the cheeto did it. 🟠🔉I immediately realize that this app has caused my children's transformation and death. 🐸I hope no one else has to go through this. acab❤️","userName":"yuuuur mommmm","title":"not my children🙈"}},{"id":"6145829097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T21:48:18Z","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened the app it asked for my phone number which I thought was strange and even weeks later I kept getting random calls and some were even robots . Some kept asking me to sign a petition for trump I didn’t agree with. Some of the calls were lectures about why I should vote for trump. I even was getting the calls from robots in the middle of the night. Soon I just stopped answering them and now I’m going to delete the app. Hopefully the calls stop😤","userName":"Marii.L","title":"Strange calls after submitting my number"}},{"id":"6145172488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T17:50:56Z","rating":1,"review":"So, being a trump supporter I decided I should get this app to keep informed on our POTUS. However, as soon as I opened the app, everyone in a 50 mile radius of me started puking (including myself). The vomit did not stop for 2 hours and we were all left baffled. It occurred to me that it was the app that caused all of us illness. I have quickly gotten to my senses and have come to realize now that Trump is disgusting and anything associated with him( this app) is harmful to America. So please, I beg of you, don’t get this app and rethink who you are voting for this 2020 election.","userName":"nye_tal","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6139988776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T13:32:07Z","rating":1,"review":"i am absolutely APPALLED by what has happened since getting this app. i thought i would support the terrible movement that this y’all ugly cheeto has been trying to get across but the second i downloaded the app my house FLOODED!! i am now homeless and i am writing this from the basement of an old lady’s house. never buy this app if you still want to keep your house. also gen z is a revolution and you can’t stop us. you’ve already tried so have fun playing the game we made for you. you’ll never win. because we already have.","userName":"cheetolover3000","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!"}},{"id":"6144941640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T16:41:07Z","rating":4,"review":"i was in my room looking at the ceiling like a regular gen z and i was thinking of the ways to save the ppl like adam and barron.
