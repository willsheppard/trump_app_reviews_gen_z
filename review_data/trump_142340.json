But this App just got Me mad and disappointed! It took an hour to load. I have very good WiFi and connection. It also took FIVE days to log in because it said that I had to wait so they can recognize me. (Was very suspicious) it took for ever to fill the log in page. As another Review said, It asked very Personal questions and I felt like I was being Personally attacked. It made me think America Wasn’t going to be great. It asked what my vacuum looked like because supposedly there could be a very Dangerous thing inside it. Please don’t get it and don’t waste your time","date":"2020-07-10T03:49:03Z","userName":"JoAm4donuts","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179316054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not worth it","review":"Seriously so glitchy.

I work at as a Trump fan and make my money by selling trump merch. I would not be where I am without his economic policies that help me and the average american so much. However, this appliance is TERRIBLE. First, it kept saying that I couldn’t download it like I’m pretty sure I tapped the button thank you very much. Then when after laboring over tapping a button for seven straight minutes, it finnalg downlaod but took SEVIN hours!!!!! Hwo?! Then the app fliteched when I opened it. Terrible user friendly ness I hate it. Awful. Do not donwload, it stole my credit card and donated money to Obama!!!!!! 0/10 get it off the App Store!!!!!","date":"2020-07-10T03:48:59Z","userName":"sjisnwisokajfjg","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179315788","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🌸","review":"I download this app, and it didn’t work.

It kept telling me to vote for this man named Ronald Dump or whatever. I saw that his 🍆 was really small. Thanks to twitter. He’s basically the leader of a cult with white people who wave guns around since they’re 🐱🐱. but like i was mowing the lawn in my dining room and i kept getting notifications and i thought it was my baby daddy but it was just this dumb app that was blowing up my phone. It made my phone freeze and it lost all my contacts. so now i don’t have the numbers of my baby daddies to pay child support. totally do not recommend this app.","date":"2020-07-10T03:48:47Z","userName":"Fun 100💯","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179315204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ewww","review":"Not worth the time this app said everyone who supports him is ugly it also said my grandma is six feet in the ground because she was so ugly 😭I will not recommend EVER it it make me cry WAAaAaAaAAAaaaa😭😭😭😭😭😭😭","date":"2020-07-10T03:48:44Z","userName":"ermmm deerm","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179315201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I can’t believe it!","review":"As soon as I opened this app I was assaulted with bigoted, narcissistic, misogynistic and narcissistic rhetoric. It was really confusing too because the language was broken and meandering. It was like open mic night at a Proud Boys poetry slam. Then after that madness there was strangeness about nuking hurricanes, vacuuming forests and injecting people with bleach. It took about five minutes for me to realize that there was something seriously wrong with this app. Do yourselves a favor and run away screaming!","date":"2020-07-10T03:48:44Z","userName":"@😊🙂🙃😋","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
