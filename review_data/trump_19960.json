After downloading, the walls in my room turned a bright orange and a tupé appeared on my fan. Terrifying. Gen Z, please think about your room’s feelings prior to downloading the app. We have all spent so much time decorating and the app just comes in and will ruin your aesthetic.","userName":"CameronMathis","date":"2020-07-01T16:50:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6144143918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terribly designed and lead by an imbecile","review":"I just wanted to see what all the hype was about about this new app, but after downloading it I realized that it was the worst app I have ever downloaded. This app is the least useful piece of garbage I have ever seen. This should not be allowed. I am disgusted, I am horrified by the layout, and I do not think the content on the app is truthful in anyway.","userName":"danny devitos left pinky toe","date":"2020-07-01T13:08:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6141170390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT THINK ABOUT GETTING THIS","review":"Omg when I downloaded this app horrible things started happening, my screen kept turning orange for some reason and saying trump 2020 all night long and that horrified me so deleted it and when I started eating Cheetos they didn’t taste normal and I think that has to do with the Cheeto as the president so now I am mad at trump for doing this so now I will not be voting for him 🧚\u200D♂️💅🏽🍊✨","userName":"youknowcamily","date":"2020-06-30T19:27:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6140889808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"⚠️DONT GET THIS APP⚠️","review":"This app when i first downloaded it seemed fine but a day or so went by and all of a sudden my phone was glitching out so so bad, i was confused so i took it to the apple store and they told me i had A VIRUS and when i asked how i got it they said most likely a beta software class 1 invasive virus from the TRUMP APP WAS THE CULPRET had to get my device completely wiped! do not get this app !!!","userName":"Bonzie9968","date":"2020-06-30T17:52:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6136737908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"manny","review":"Was scrolling through instagram and one of my fellow trump supporters put me on this app. I come to the app store and download it, but I came to the realization that it was making my phone glitch a lot.
