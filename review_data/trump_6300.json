The app however tried to steal my personal contact information which could be shared with China for all I know. I’m very disappointed in the software and display as well because my eyes can’t see that well. This app is a total bust for me. I told my neighbors including my Sunday bible study and pta association not to download this app and switch their votes. I can’t trust a president who tries to steal information from its own once loyal citizens. - Karen","date":"2020-07-08T22:53:39Z","userName":"Karen Dell","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173981621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"if i could give this negative stars i would","review":"first of all, i opened the app and it was just a link to a craigslist website selling used diapers? anyways, once i got passed that portion of the app it gave me an instruction manual on how to be a follower of a fascist dictator🤧😎lol so quirky! anyway, got confused and ended up getting my peepee stuck in my toaster... 😫😫😖 also if ur above the age of 50 i DEFINITELY don’t recommend bc apparently if you look at the cheeto for 30 seconds and spin around it gives you stage three brain cancer🤯🤯🤯😔 the only thing this app is serving is 🥳😤😭 jail time ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕💕","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:16Z","userName":"dwayne lains","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173974032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"very bad, complete and total waste of time","review":"this app is boring, so boring it’s pathetic, and I mean, frankly, could it get any worse? Everybody is talking about this huuge mistake.  it’s a major disappointment, extremely huge disappointment - one of the worst I’ve ever seen. the dummies who designed this app should be fired immediately for this huge, huuge problem. I mean, I have many, many friends who will tell you- they’ll tell you it’s embarrassing. Believe me, I want this app gone as much as you, and because I’m very, very, very rich I’ll do a better job than these morons.","date":"2020-07-08T22:38:22Z","userName":"Narichardsssss","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173895381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Baconeggandcheese👁👄👁","review":"In complete honesty, this app gotta go. After downloading it and fidgeting with a couple buttons my garage door started opening and closing, the lights were turning on and off, the faucet started leaking. I was very confused. The first thing I saw when I opened the app was a picture of what seems to be a large, fake tan wearing, räpįśt, pëdò, racist, hömøphôbìc man (amongst other things) I felt very offended. I proceeded to look through the other features. After pressing the settings button the app seems to have summoned satan himself into my house. All in all it’s a terrible app 😌💉‼️💫✨👑🙄🥊♨️🥳🔏💅🏾💪🏾❤️👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:16Z","userName":"👀🔥❤️😘","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173891387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"hate this app🤬😡","review":"ATTENTION!!! this app can.. 지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:48Z","userName":"give us our views","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173829242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app called me a karen","review":"i downloaded this app bc i think our orange president has been doing a GREAT job for our country 😍 he cut ties with the WHO in the middle of a pandemic 🧚🏼✨he said its their fault our country can't handle miss rona and he's right! it's their fault trumpy waited to declare an emergency! and he wants schools to reopen!! 🥰 education >>>> health. anyway i downloaded this app to show him my eternal love but then this app had the nerve to call me a karen that is so racist. 🇺🇸 i love my president and i'm not a snowflake but unfortunately i can't keep this app bc i have a big ego too. ps trump teach me how to have ur hair 🙈","date":"2020-07-08T21:44:26Z","userName":"notkarenbutkaren","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173805974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitchy","review":"I honestly had the highest expectations for this app!! More than any other app I’ve ever downloaded!! And it was just horrible! Not only did it glitch out, crash my phone, delete all my pictures, use all my data, change my passwords, eat all my food and push my grandmother down the steps; it was also telling me false information!! Saying how the Orange man in office will make a good president! For a news app this is simply outrageous and I can’t believe you’d keep such an app in the store. Please delete this Apple!!!

That means the IRS will come for me and my family and will try to kill me because I owe them money which I do not have because no one is hiring me so I can’t make money.
