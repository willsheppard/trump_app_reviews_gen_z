The picture of the tall orange man made my daughter cry when she opened this app on my phone giving her nightmares for weeks.

I’m positive it records everything. The app is very very glitchy too. Not to mention the creator of this app has killed millions with his “power”. He shouldn’t have power over an app that he could also kill people. Also this app is completely useless and no one uses for talks about it.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:20:52Z"}},{"id":"6173902320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely horrifying😭","userName":"Harmony😎😝","rating":1,"review":"I have to say, I had high hopes for this app🤠🥳but it did not impress👎👎👎👎.

I’ve never liked the color orange, but when I opened the app it engulfed me in its horrible hue. This app exposed me to all sorts of racism, homophobia, and as a trump supporter obviously I was flabbergasted that I was blind to all of it.
