It gave my entire family head lice and ate all of the food in our fridge within the first four minutes of having it downloaded on my phone. This app then proceeded to slash my tires and steal all of my grandmothers depends, causing her to have a terrible and incredibly embarrassing blowout in front of all her friends at the nursing home. The app made fun of my Quadriplegic neighbor, Tim, and then covered all of my families beds in jello. Absolutely horrible and will be deleting immediately.","userName":"groöt","title":"The wörst"}},{"id":"6174689285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:33:46Z","review":"i downloaded in hopes of being up to date with the great things the president has done for this country and unfortunately nothing can be found to back that up bc the format of the app is completely glitching, the whole layout of the app is just way unorganized. extremely disappointed. i thought the presidents team would have fixed this problem but it’s almost been four years and there is no hope left🧚🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"duxly1","title":"DISAPPOINTED🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174628221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:16:07Z","review":"This app is honestly terrible, as a trumpet/trumpanzee, this app has an awful amount of glitches. I would not recommend this app at ALL. This app is so terrible and glitchy, it is pretty much ban worthy at this point. Not only is this app glitchy, but the notifications as you try to sleep at night is super annoying, AND the way it works is so confusing and also boring and not entertaining as a trumpet. 0/10 would not recommend downloading this app if you’re a fellow trumpet.","userName":"student3786","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174617709","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:13:09Z","review":"you might as well just delete the app it will steal your phone and hack it. here’s how and why first i was biking to target and while in my car my phone started dinging so i turned it off silent mode to see what it was but i fell off my horse and there wasn’t anything there. When i finally got to target where the cat greeted me while i left i checked my ipad and my phones home screen was trump while i hopped on my hawk my phone started ringing and it was gone.","userName":"ImJustThatBadReview","title":"Might as well just delete the app"}},{"id":"6174602849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:08:57Z","review":"I seriously cannot believe how bad this makes our president look, they spent no time programming is app!!

I was tear gassed and then an upside down bible appeared on the screen. I will NEVER be using this app again seeing as how it tried to gRAB ME BY THE ✨woman area✨ and didn’t release its tax information . I hate the color orange and it keeps showing me this man that decided to roll around in it. I also hate the logo because it’s so obvious that the main character is wearing a toupee.","userName":"k.o.t.u.s","title":"UNACCEPTABLE"}},{"id":"6174524916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:45Z","review":"This app is DISGUSTING!! The amount of homophobic, misogynistic, and racist STENCH from this app is unforgivable! Imagine supporting an orange Cheeto Puff... Child anyways- Apple really did bad by making this an app and they better take it down in the future 👁👄👁 I cant stand this app. It crashes, the people are horrible human beings and it’s all about trump... WHO WANTS THAT!! Not to mention they stole my pet snail, Christopher, and said they’ll never give him back 😔🤚 I’m still mourning but at least this app will be gone so thanks for the sacrifice Chris... may you Rest In Peace 😔💅✨","userName":"AudreyZink20","title":"✨ disgusting ✨"}}]}
