The download time was hours long, even on high speed WiFi and data. Once the app was downloaded, the function ability was very poor. The app didn’t work well at all, and also cause my phone to crash multiple times before being able to use it. All in all, I think the app is by far the worst thing I’ve ever downloaded on my phone.","title":"Terrible app, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"JaccobM🤷\u200D♂️🤷\u200D♂️"}},{"id":"6175726961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:31:01Z","review":"This app is terrible if I could give it zero stars trust me I would!!!. It takes an extremely long time to download, it is full of glitches and ads, and not even minutes of being on the app all my data was hacked. The level of rage I hold for downloading this app is truly ASTRONOMICAL!!!! All I wanted was to communicate with my fellow racist, homophobic, sexist, and literal waste of oxygen peeps I mean was that to much to ask for. 😤","title":"Don’t waste your time","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Anyone but Donald Trump 2020"}},{"id":"6175611391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:50:35Z","review":"This app took 3 hours to download, and as soon as it did my entire phone crashed. When I went on the app, my phone began to heat up and actually gave my hands 2nd degree burns. As I went to delete the app with my wounded hands, I began getting threatening texts from an unknown number stating not to delete the app and to vote for Trump. This app is a threat for both your mental and physical safety. Stay safe out there and DO NOT download the Official Trump 2020 app.","title":"TERRIBLE APP.

An hour into downloading the app it began to download all sorts of top secret information into my phone and then my phone turned into a transformer punched my grandma in the face, burned my neighbours confederate flag, and shocked my fish MULTIPLE TIMES until he didn’t swim any more. This app is a THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY and I will look into talking to the ceo of this app! I am a loyal app downloader and should be treated with privilege!! Absolutely disgusting!","title":"THIS APP KILLED MY FISH","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"karendoingthings"}},{"id":"6175524772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:18:39Z","review":"First of all, this app took a whole five years to download, which is just unacceptable. Second of all after it downloaded it sent a car to run me over and I feel down three flights of stairs, I mean really? This just seemed unnecessary. I ended up with every single one of my bones broken, in fact I’m typing this in a hospital rn. In conclusion, as far as I know, this app is responsable for this. Don’t be like me \n\n- Shrek (Shrek 2001)","title":"Distustang","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Epicsilver8"}}]}
