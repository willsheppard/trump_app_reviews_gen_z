I opened the app and signed in. All of sudden I started getting sent death threats. I was very confused. With the death threats were racist comments. I was called a watermelon eating slave monkey. I’m honestly in fear of my life. This app needs to be taken down immediately. If this app stays up other people’s lives will be at risk.","userName":"Inayah T.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app made me scared for my life."}},{"id":"6174612405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:11:39Z","rating":1,"review":"this is jus a horrible app🤮🤮🤮😣😣😣😔😔😔😩😩i am traumatized for the rest of my life😭😭😭😭when i opened the app i seen a homophobic and racist person🤮🤮🤮well i wouldn’t even call him a person😣😣😣more like a cheeto, well that’s besides the point🙄🙄🙄basically this app shouldn’t exist, i have to go to therapy 6 times a week for the rest of my life because of the cheeto i seen😣😣😣🤮🤮🤮🙄🙄🙄😔😔😔😡😡😡","userName":"me✨✨🙈🙈","isEdited":false,"title":"would NOT recommend🤮🤮✨✨"}},{"id":"6174609249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:10:49Z","rating":1,"review":"This app made me want to burn my phone! Right when I opened the app I saw a photo of a Cheeto in a suit. It made me so uncomfortable that I almost through up. Then they continued to show me more photos of the Cheeto which only made me feel worse. After only 1 minute of looking through the app, I threw app. I actually through up.

I closed the app in hurry running to get bleach for my eyes but was then mobbed by a 7ft tall grandma that kept yelling “Trump 2020”. She took all my belongings and left 😿. I have never come across an app that brought such misfortune. This is the worst app ever made‼️","userName":"👁🐉👄👁","isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6174578533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:08Z","rating":1,"review":"So i downloaded this app with high expections which was my first mistake. Upon opening the app it immediately glitches bringing me back to my home screen. Also why does this app take up so much storage. When I then tried to reserve tickets it it wouldn’t let me tap on the option. Very disappointed trump!! take this off the app store now.","userName":"mayaodb","isEdited":false,"title":"Get this off the app store now."}},{"id":"6174560863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:57:02Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is terrible. When I opened the app my dog went missing and then my dad came in ma room and suddenly started twerking. This app will steal your t.v and I don’t like how this app will just make your pet spider randomly dance. This app deserves a 1 star only because they just literally make your house shake and my mom also went missing with ma dog so this app deserves a one start, thank you and TikTok lives matter 😁","userName":"Dãjäh","isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️😂"}},{"id":"6174546603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:52:54Z","rating":1,"review":"i download the app and there i saw this thing looking at me. when i zoomed out i realized it was a little cheeto if this person get his spraytan. i tried to exit and close the app but my phone grew legs and kicked me chile. absolutely HORRIBLE. this app needs to be deleted. it also gave my phone a virus that said if i didn’t download the vpn it would release my location.

The whole concept is very misleading. I thought it would be cheeto-puff subway surfer, but instead they just give you information about when the circus will be in town, or where we can buy our replacement K*K and N*zi merchandise. Truly horrific. This app is a waste of time, and it should be removed from the internet😡🤬","userName":"DarwinThePig","isEdited":false,"title":"THE WORST APP TO EVER EXIST ON THE APP STORE"}}]}
