I love anime, and manga, watching, and playing basketball, drawing, video games (my favorite video game is 7 days to die), food, and cuddles, and love! Im 5'10\", 140lbs. Im also blonde, green eyes, and handsome, and my favorite colors are blue, and red, and my favorite food is pizza. 9/27/18 is the day I started watching anime (my first anime ever was Eromanga Sensei, I know it is an interesting choice xD), so please dont judge my list xD. I like all kinds of anime (action, slice of life, romance, comedy, drama, etc). Im a cool, sweet, mature, romantic, caring guy who loves hanging out with friends, and I try to make everyones day! My secret weapon is my charm, so please be my friend xD. Also follow my social medias, thank you! I try to watch anime weekly too, and Chino Kafuu is my favorite character in anime of all time. She was the first female character I liked when I first started watching anime, and the character who I looked up to the most. Shes a big reason why I watch anime. Shes really special to me, and I loved her for a long time. Shes my waifu, and I love her a lot. She will always be the most special character in anime to me, because she was the first female character I loved, and looked up to. She can't be replaced, because shes so special to me, and shes my waifu, and I love her. Shes the most special character in anime to me. Theres no one like her. I know that may sound weird, but all anime fans feel that way about a character :). RIP my 3 heros, XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD, and Kobe Bryant ;(. I also like hentai. I like yuri, and straight hentai. I like hentai mangas too! The ones that are on my manga list are ones I own, and the hentais that are on my anime list are ones I watched on different websites, so you could say I am a man of culture lol. Also I have a lot of animes I plan to watch, its just that the ones that are in my plan to watch are ones I really wanna watch. I also like to read hentai online too, and look at random hentai aswell.\n\nAnyways this app sucked and the images of trump tried to burst out and eat me alive! This is cannibalism and I will not stand for it!!","rating":1,"title":"Almost scrolled past this 💞🧚🏻✨ next time I make sure I will 💫🌸🙈","date":"2020-07-10T04:42:15Z"}},{"id":"6179473580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"starsonvelvet","isEdited":false,"review":"Super weird, for some reason this app is written completely in Russian???
