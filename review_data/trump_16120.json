I was surprised but then I saw orange foundation everywhere and when I asked him about it he threw me out of the whitehouse and I broke my leg! I went back in limping and I threw a Cheeto puff at him but then I saw anonymous and we ran away together, and trump found us at a restaurant and sold us rat soup, it was disgusting.

But not even after two minutes of being on the app, it began glitching, and I was unable to use it. Every time I clicked on the app, it redirected me back to my home screen. I was disappointed to find out that this app took no effort to create, there were numerous bugs and glitches, it’s simply unusable.","date":"2020-06-29T00:40:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6123298194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"this babysitter is weird 😭","title":"why is there a cheetos puff on the front page?","review":"i downloaded this app to support Supreme Leader DJ Trump and i open the app to see a picture of a big cheetos puff?  i thought, this must be a joke!  then it asked me to put my mobile number in, but that made me uncomfy.  it said “keep america great” but then i looked outside my window and wondered why someone would want to keep it like this?  overall, no trump 2020 for me.  bye bye donald!","date":"2020-06-26T08:25:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6122341920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Blah blah blue blue","title":"dangerous app!","review":"i downloaded this app hoping to learn more about our wonderful president, but the second i opened the app i got a knock on my door. when i opened my door a group of republicans came it and beat me and and before they left they ate all of my cereal. when i cried and asked them to stop they told me that this was the initiation for the app. i am now covered in bruises and i think they broke my ribs.

I got a notification telling me to “gráb êm bÿ dâ puśšëy”, after i declined to disrespect women, i got called a “murderer and râpišt” cuz im mexican😒😔🙏🏻. Then the app continued to repeat a clip of him calling latinos and african american thugs!!! Like sorry sir, i think the real animals here are you and all of epsteins other friends😳💔. Anyways, besides the point, to finish all this off, this app is 🇺🇸FAKE NEWS🇺🇸. #Maggats2020 #maketheunitedstatesunitedagain #blm","date":"2020-06-21T22:08:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6084824170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"🧐🤨😕🙁😔","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH","review":"I was on the app when rats started to tango all over my screen 😱🤔 I’ve never been so shocked, betrayed, depressed, and disappointed before.. It would’ve been a better experience if they all decided to overthrow Trump but they only salsa danced to Nicki Minaj 😡🤬 The barbs arent too happy about this and you will be hearing from my lawyer. Rest assured, that cheeto will not be getting my vote for his outrageous attack against me. So disrespectful 😤","date":"2020-06-16T23:10:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6076287421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Val S Salas","title":"the absolute worst","review":"I downloaded this app to improve my life and the second I do, it all goes downhill. It started out small: the ice cream machine breaking, dropping a pound of eggs on my foot. But then my wife left and my dog died. I don’t even have a dog. This app ruined my life and I will never be able to fix it. Do you know how hard it is to bury a dog with a bruised foot? Terrible. Worst app I’ve ever downloaded, I do not recommend it.","date":"2020-06-14T21:53:12Z","isEdited":false}}]}
