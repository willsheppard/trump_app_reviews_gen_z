Then began to spam me email with things about Trump 2020. Would not let me use any other apps, but once i deleted it i was allowed to use my apps. In all a very terrible app, do not recommend."}},{"id":"6176654606","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:13:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","userName":"Linchmaster40","review":"This took literally 12 hours and 15 minutes to load. So mad because of it. I don’t understand how the president can try banning an app that kids use for freedom of speech in little time but can’t get his app to work. Shoddy work if you ask me. Very disappointed."}},{"id":"6176645643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:11:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"T R A S H app","userName":"pantsy_","review":"i can’t believe this- i download the app (which takes HOURS, mind you) & then once it did download????? my phone was acting so slow and it shut off. and when i got it back on- i got a call from someone spouting off racism and hate?! this is disgusting!!!!! the is the worst app there is"}},{"id":"6176619669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:04:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Literal garbage 🤢","userName":"Tiktok Star.","review":"It’s such a bad app... My sister downloaded it and upon looking at it, she ended up in the hospital. That’s quite embarrassing. This application needs to be gone. Thank you 🥰 You can’t take away our app Sir Trump. Poorly made. Causes viruses. Disgusting. There’s better apps, like tiktok. I think this should be deleted."}},{"id":"6176616660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:03:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Who designed this???","userName":"patrick34562","review":"This app has the worst UI I have ever seen. I couldn’t find anything I was looking for on here and everything I did find was a straight up lie, “fake news” if you will. Whoever green lit this clearly did not actually look at it first or has no idea what they are doing."}},{"id":"6176583811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:54:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app!","userName":"felicia lombardi is angry","review":"I downloaded this app today and I was quickly prompted by a screen that told me to “go back to where I came from”. I’m an American. I was born here! Another box called me Mexican-I’m Puerto Rican! So shocked by the customer service from this app which told me I needed to attend conversion therapy. 10/10 DONT recommend"}},{"id":"6176582888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:54:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download! 😫","userName":"Ohyea sexy","review":"It took forever to download and once it did, my phone started going really slow.

I really disliked the design of the background images and the navigation menu. Overall, there was way too much sexism, racism, masochism, fascism, and hatred within this app. I will be deleting the app soon and I refuse to vote for Trump."}}]}
