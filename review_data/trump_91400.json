Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.  You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every  aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference?"}},{"id":"6177439811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","userName":"Lmhanna","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:49:12Z","rating":1,"review":"Cheeto looking bunker boy needs to go home."}},{"id":"6177430954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Y’all know we gonna win","userName":"siobhan.g","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:27Z","rating":1,"review":"Hehe"}},{"id":"6177413684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","userName":"Bannana_cat","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:41:23Z","rating":1,"review":"This app killed my uncle"}},{"id":"6177402026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t delete TIk Tok","userName":"bear0812","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:38:05Z","rating":1,"review":"Just don’t or say goodbye to this app"}},{"id":"6177398878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto man","userName":"Fancying101","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:10Z","rating":1,"review":"Such a stoopid platform.

And tbh when I saw that our soggy looking orange president had made an app, i was petrified. But I downloaded it anyway. As I was scrolling through the app I started getting a headache, I told my mom and she asked why I had one, and I told her i didn’t know I had just been on this app. She then proceeded to educate me on him but the more she talked talked the more blurry everything got. I felt a gravitational pull to my phone and when I opened it... there it was. A picture of my soggy orange president. And then all of a sudden I felt a need to be racist and a sexist. But then my mother snatched my phone, picked her car keys and started speeding. She then drove up to a black lives mater protest, smashed my phone, then asked “do you know why they do this?”. I sat there, brainwashed, gathering my thoughts but it all seemed burly. All of a sudden I just blurted out “ 🍊 cause they are idiots 🍊”. Then I said to myself....”HWAT THE HECK”. My mom knew exactly what was happening, I WAS TURNING TO A RACIST AND SEXIST ORANGE! Keep in mind I am a Mexican woman with a Mexican mom. She continued to pull out of the parking lot and drove me to the restrooms. Then she proceeded to beat the 🍊orange 🍊 out of me. And surprisingly it worked. I sat there beat to the pulp then I realized I was back to my normal self. After that my mom educated me and I joined to black lives matter protest. I had to get lots of therapy after that. My life was technically ruined. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP (Unless your leaving it a bad review). Anyways, have a good day."}}]}
