I decided “why not”. I downloaded it and when I opened it, I saw a photo of a puffer fish eating a carrot. 🐡🥕. And then I clicked the “x” in the top right of the screen and it had asked me to start a free trial for Apple Music. I clicked “no thanks”. And then the app crashed. I totally do not recommend this app.","rating":1,"title":"Hilliard should have won.","date":"2020-07-09T00:07:56Z","userName":"Heat fan!!"}},{"id":"6174212278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Ew!

Trump has openly offended minorities before and has given a pure Platform for white suprematism to grow and be comfortable. This app continues that chain and gives them more platform to grow on without consequence.","rating":1,"title":"Promoting hate","date":"2020-07-09T00:03:08Z","userName":"Ameen117"}},{"id":"6174191717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the WORST thing you could ever download.
