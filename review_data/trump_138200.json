But then again he just racist and denies everything he says. I find it disrespectful that he talks about just grabbing women. AND HE DID THIS WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. So this election I am NOT going to vote for him 😐❌🚫","title":"PLEASE DELETE MY THIS APP","userName":"Voter for Trump","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:50Z","review":"like what the actual heck?!! I got this app and not only did it take SOO long to download, but after like 3.56785 hours, this STUPID app started glitching. Like it started dancing on the screen to a weird tune and I couldn’t get my phone to shut up. When I finally could open the app, I saw a picture of a giant Cheeto. I didn’t think anything of it at first. Anyway, I kept trying to click on stuff, but every time I pressed on something, I could smell a weird skunky gassy smell. I just thought my neighbors dog was doing its normal business in my backyard but LITTLE DID I KNOW this app had taken control of my house appliances and had made them all start farting uncontrollably. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO because I had just cleaned my house that morning. Anyway, the app was still open when I heard a giant crash. I whip around to see a half of an ORANGE RHINO with a jumanji board stuck on its horn and on its side a tattoo of the number 2020 next to an orange face. This rhino just stood there, and you will NOT believe what it did next. It opened its mouth and started SINGING and it didn’t even sound good. And as soon as the horrible singing started, a giant hologram of the Cheeto that I saw in the beginning appeared out of the jumanji board. Now tell me, what would you do in this situation?! I was so confused, but I decided to shut down the app and delete the app and as soon as I did, the rhino fell thru the window the window the second story window. and now I have to call someone to fix the giant hole in my house. I can still hear its horrid singing. And not only that, all of the food I had in my fridge have turned orange. This app is HORRIBLE.","title":"this app smells SO bad!","userName":"cockroachesareweird","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:48Z","review":"🥴💖 now that i have your attention eat the rich eat the rich eat the rich","title":"Disgusting.","userName":"kayyayday","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:43Z","review":"Look back at it she never did it before but she good at it..🐱","title":"This app gave me stds","userName":"ping pow asian dude","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:39Z","review":"Water. Earth. Fire. Air.\n\nLong ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.","title":"😤😤","userName":"ejdhdejfjz","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:36Z","review":"My phone kept crashing and it kept sending a lot of ads on my phone don’t get this app it is the worst!!!🤢","title":"Worst app ever!!!","userName":"OverDrive 05","rating":1}},{"id":"6179777010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:32Z","review":"💩\nJust like his administration it’s a waste of time.

Donald Trump is 300 pounds of feces wrapped in skin and painted orange. His campaign released this app for those who would like fawn about this snowflake of a “man” all day. It’s garbage.
