He has had 25 ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM, AND HAS RAPED A 13 YEAR OLD GIRL. If you don’t believe me, do your own research ✨✨💕💕💕More recently, trump retweeted a post of someone screaming “white power” x2 and you people still don’t think he’s racist? 😬How about the time that he tried to roll back transgender health care protections??

It will destroy your phone because it has a bug. I have no clue why our president would do such a thing to the people he said he ”cared about”. My heart is broken, and so is my phone!😤 I never write a review but I feel like this is absolutely necessary since I care about all of you, especially gen z! ;) \nIf you want an app just like this, I recommend crossy road. It is very pristine and fun! -xoxo, Roderick Heffley","title":"*WARNING*"}},{"id":"6135670596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"❤️🥺😍🧚🏽✨😈","date":"2020-06-29T12:08:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"y’all this app is just somethin else. so yk got it to support my president. come to find out this app is CURSEDD. i went to my kitchen to  get some food and there was oranges every wheree. and then later on that day guys , i saw a monster. it was huge and i was really really scared 😓. i wanted to try the app again to make sure it was the app that was causing all of this and guess what 😱 , i got bit by a tiger 🐅. anyways, don’t download this app.!!","title":"do not recommend"}},{"id":"6134848068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Karen Anon","date":"2020-06-29T07:19:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I didn’t want to believe the other reviews I’ve read about this app. I decided to against the reviews and downloaded it anyways, after I downloaded the app it became the worst thing I have EVER DECIDED TO DO!!!

As soon as I downloaded the app a website opened up and it lead me through this dark hole about how we should inject bleach into our blood. I kept trying to close it and it wouldn’t let me!
