Kicked me out within two seconds. Couldn’t even see what was on the app. THEN I got spammed by a bunch of notifications. Like 20-30 notifications every five minutes.

The images upon opening the app were off putting to the eye and in all honesty insulting. I am thoroughly disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T13:58:41Z","userName":"Kathy Smith 37"}},{"id":"6176817126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This app can burn in hell 🔥","rating":1,"review":"Trump is a racist, sexist, homophobic, islamaphobic, liar who cheated his way into office. AND he didn’t even help with covid-19 ONCE! I could go on about why trump is terrible but I’ll save those facts for later. Anyway, I heard your trying to be TikTok. If you take down TikTok, we’re taking down your official app with us!!!!! Thank you for your time.😁","date":"2020-07-09T13:56:22Z","userName":"Bigfan of roblox"}},{"id":"6176812527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Trump’s a dictator","rating":1,"review":"Trump is trying to silence anyone who has different opinions from his own. He only allows yes people around him. He listens to people who kiss his booty and no one else. He is trying to force governors of states to blindly follow him, and if they don’t he bullies them. He is an immature child who should have stayed a business man and not gotten into politics.","date":"2020-07-09T13:55:08Z","userName":"Toren25"}},{"id":"6176808748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app killed my hamster(rip harold)","rating":1,"review":"this app took away the life of my wonderful little hamster harold. when i went to the app, my phone overheated and exploded, taking the life of my hamster.  he was such a joyous creature. oh how i loved little harold. he was my best friend. i would do everything with harold. i would take harold on a walk💔 and bring him to the supermarket.

Non stop adds from China. And I think I downloaded a virus that the app could have prevented. I think it’s called Coda? Rona? Oh corona. Anyways, DONT GET THIS APP. It’s a waste of your storage and brain power.","date":"2020-07-09T13:27:31Z","userName":"Cindy Balthasar Jones"}},{"id":"6176686937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Read before download","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened this app it gave me one of those agreements that nobody reads so I just clicked agreed and my hole screen went black my phone powered off and it took 45 minutes to a hour to start up and all my text messages and photos a deleted do not!!!

Not sure if bunker boy himself put it together but sure seems like it. Very low quality app and right away asks for a phone number. I don’t even have a chance to breathe before grumpy trumpy is asking for my digits. I thought our Cheeto puff of a President was better than that. 🤩😍🥰😘❤️💕🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚🏼\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T13:20:26Z","userName":"lkg ogxgxh kvoe"}},{"id":"6176647998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"awful!!!!!!","rating":1,"review":"after it took an entire week to download, this app charged me $500 😾and stole my identity. i had three men in black suits come to my house and delete the flappy bird app (which i can NEVER get back now) 😿and then they tried to sell me trump merch as a bribe to leave me alone. this app is scary!! if i could give it 0 stars i would😠😠😠","date":"2020-07-09T13:11:47Z","userName":"be more chill:,)"}}]}
