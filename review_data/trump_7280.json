I refused of course but it kept pestering me over and over and it wouldn’t let me delete the app. I had to change my phone multiple times but every time this horrible app would appear. Cheeto mans app started appearing everywhere it would never leave me alone it’s like I was being followed. I had to resort to purification and finally I was left alone. This app ruined my life I would not recommend to anyone.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:09Z","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"BookLJGlover"}},{"id":"6174231259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was sitting in my room thinking how could give 💫💗President Bunker Boy❤️💖more support.

After three minutes of having it my phone started to crash and then this god awful picture of what looked like a badly spray tanned baby with lip injections but somehow also looks 90. It was horrifying! I was not ready for this kind of scare. But I kept going. My phone started to play some sort of Alabama banjo song and then a photo of what looked like a baby carrot between two giant cheese balls was on my screen. I threw my phone, broke it and now want Donald Turnip to buy me a new one.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:08:42Z","title":"Cheese balls","isEdited":false,"userName":"alisna"}},{"id":"6174189176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You see I decided to download this app to support our dearest present, Mr. Trumpet~ But then when he ended up appearing on my screen I was so shocked 😱 that I accidentally astral projected 😳 to a Chili’s bathroom where god greeted me and told me he would smite me ⚡️🌩 if I continued 🔜 using the app 📱 so I sobbed 😭 on my way back to my body, because this app was against 🚫 my religion of the girls and the gæs 🏳️\u200D🌈but suddenly I had a spiritual awakening 🧿👄🧿 and realized that bunker boy is a horrible person 🤢 so of course I immediately ran 👣 back home to spread my new found knowledge 😽","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:58:08Z","title":"Unfortunately No 😩✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"lizziecb17"}},{"id":"6174062422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is honestly the worst app i have ever downloaded it has viruses and a lot of lag also caused my phone to malfunction a lot so this is why i think that this app should be taken off the app store immediately! disgusting app broke my phone and when you first open the app theres a very unforgettable traumatising photo of a carrot with dead grass instead of green leafs i still cant erase the horrible imagine off my mind so please take it off immediately before the whole world becomes mentally unstable like me. thank you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:44Z","title":"DONT GET THE APP!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"ksjsbshnsnenendmmd"}},{"id":"6174040876","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I went on this app to see what all the hate was about.  As soon as I opened the app, My phone glitches like crazy.  Some Orange Cheeto man kept flashing on my phone like crazy.  My phone then started levitating by all the vibrations.  I quickly closed the app thinking I was safe.  A couple days later a man in a black suit saying that he worked for Trump, karate kicked me straight in the face.  I tried to get away, but he grabbed me by the collar and barked right in my face.

This goblin appeared out of no where asking if I could give him some pennies. My mom told me not to talk to strangers, so I said NO, OBVIOUSLY, and wanted her to pick me up. This made my dog eat up my phone because the sounds and looks of this app disgusted him. But I was able to get my phone back when he burped it back out. Honestly, don’t know why this app is still on here.

Please, DO NOT give it your phone number! When I did, I got text after text from hot middle aged women in my area asking for sex! I'm not gonna lie, it was a little tempting, so I texted one or two, but they just sent me the same text over and over. THEY DON'T EVEN COME OVER TO YOUR HOUSE LIKE THEY PROMISE!!
