I downloaded the app because I wanted to see his plans for election, but it wouldn’t even let me be in for more than 30 seconds before sending me out of it. I just bought this phone a year ago and it has never done this with any of the numerous apps I’ve downloaded over this past year. It kicks me out and wouldn’t let me do anything in the app. Eventually my entire phone was kicking me out of everything, and I just could not do anything. I went the the Apple store and they say that they had no idea why, but this only happened after I downloaded the app? Wonder why."}},{"id":"6177242459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:07Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst President to Ever Exist, Vote Biden ✨","userName":"👑GRACE👑","review":"Our President is a disgrace to our nation. His values and ethics are poor. His skills as a leader are poor. His orator skills are poor. His ability to unify and act as a leader for our nation is nonexistent. It’s so blatantly obvious to everyone he doesn’t have the slightest desire to be a public servant it’s frightening. Please don’t vote for this sorry excuse of a human being for president. He is trying to take our rights day by day. He is currently trying to ban a social media app (tiktok) simply because he got pranked by generation z. This proves that bunker boy doesn’t know how to deal with the nation properly. If you are reading this, convince other to vote for Biden. He isn’t the best but it certainly better than someone who thinks injecting disinfect will be a good vaccine. Please do this country a favor and get him out of office!!!"}},{"id":"6176956599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:32:59Z","rating":1,"title":"My whole life was ruined","userName":"Big_Bro_Gamingz","review":"I was extremly exited to download this app but as soon as i did, my top bunk came crashing down on top of my. Luckily i survived, but as soon as i managed to get out of the rubble a GIANT maggot ate my bedroom wall down. It took weeks to repair the house but when the repairs were done i opened the app for the first time. A knife came out of my screen and nearly stabbed me. I wish i was joking. On top of all that my parents kicked me out of the house because they thought i was bad luck. THE APP WAS BAD LUCK!! After this i tried deleting the app but it wouldn't let me. Suddenly the app opened up by itself and locked me out of all acess to other apps. The app was a virus!! Now every time I go onto my device Donald trump the orange faced demon calls me the n-word and sticks the middle finger up at me. Worst. App. Ever."}},{"id":"6176651451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:12:41Z","rating":1,"title":"do NOT download this app!!!!!!!!!!","userName":"bevy666","review":"this app took multiple days to download! when it finally installed on my phone it was required that i enter all of my personal information, not just an email or a phone number! days later, i began receiving concerning voicemails and messages from what i can only assume to be scam artists. i have no other choice than to believe that this app is selling my information!😠😠 the application itself is difficult to navigate and crashes continuously, especially when i try to launch a rally or online event. they sent me texts way too frequently, about the most minuscule things, and don't offer any reliable sources to back their info. please save yourself the hassle and keep this app off your phone. if i could give 0 stars i would!"}},{"id":"6176542545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:43:15Z","rating":1,"title":"It took 54 weeks","userName":"beenaryain997","review":"Had so much faith in this app. But it really let me down. First of all it took 54 weeks to download, as if that wasn’t enough i had to fill out a pointless questionnaire and it asked which i pour first, milk or cereal, do I wear socks with flip flops when i run down to get the groceries from the car and if i have been the one setting off fireworks late a night. When i was finally done with the questionnaire And it was downloaded, i thought i finally had my beloved presidents app on my phone. But it started crashing my phone every time I tried to open it, it wiped all my data from my phone. So when my mom was calling I had no idea who it was and kept ignoring her calls for days. Needless to say, this app is horrible and a waste of time. Wouldn’t recommend downloading."}},{"id":"6175639268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:00:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Honest Review. 😞","userName":"BeccaG21","review":"The download was slow and so frustrating, my phone began to overheat. Then I noticed once downloaded my phone became bombarded with text messages and phone calls. How did they know my dogs name? Is the president spying and collecting data? My dog is not of age yet and it is inappropriate for the presidents spammers to bring up my dog. Then, the calls became increasingly aggressive.  They were texting videos on how to call for a manager/police/order a mask exemption card. They use this app to spread propaganda and use it as a tool to brainwash it’s users, to  be racists. It grooms Karens and Chads and provides support for Karens and Chads who feel threatened. I got so many robocalls and texts my phone not only overheated but died so the app fuels the virus that is racism that is spreading like wildfire in this county.  I definitely do NOT recommend"}},{"id":"6175583242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:40:16Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible application","userName":"Asani Wasabi","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of continuing my support of President Donald Trump, but this application alone was more than enough for me to discover how oblivious I was. The app spreads fake news, has a horrible UI, and there are WAY too many irrelevant notifications. For the last time, I don't need to know what time Trump took a dump in the White House Bunker and how many pounds he lost from it! I understand that it's a Trump app, but it's just so biased toward anything that the guy says. If Donald Trump were to stand on the White House patio and take a long stream of urine hitting passing civilians, he would STILL get praised by the app! I've been ranting enough. The application is just horrible, and I don't recommend anyone to buy it, unless if they want to have an excuse to park in handicapped spots with their Trump 2020 trucks."}},{"id":"6175065712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:28:18Z","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!","userName":"akivda","review":"In the app’s description, it says “Make America Great Again.” So obviously, I downloaded this app, thinking that it would magically Make America Great Again! \n\nHowever, this app did exactly the OPPOSITE. As soon as I downloaded the app, not only America, but the WORLD went to HELL. \n\nFirst, Australia caught on fire. Many animals died, and many homes were destroyed.\n \nSecond, Indonesia flooded, killing 70 people. \n\nThen, the app killed Kobe Bryant. What’s worse, this has been a TERRIBLE year for basketball!\n\nNext, the app caused the global pandemic known as Coronavirus to start. It MURDERED many Americans and caused many of them to lose their jobs. The worst part is that we have to wear MASKS!\n\nAlong with the virus, the Olympics were cancelled, along with many other events. \n\nNext, Bollywood legend Irrfan Kahn passed away. What would America be without Bollywood legends to copy in their knock-off version called ‘Hollywood’. Tsk tsk. \n\nAfter that, George Floyd was MURDERED, starting a series of protests during which the police were EVIL to protesters.   \n\nAmerica, along with the rest of the world, has become a horrible place, and it’s all because of THIS APP. It claims to Make America Great Again, but it is a TOTAL SCAM. \n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!"}},{"id":"6175056300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:25:24Z","rating":1,"title":"👿","userName":"bellaharb542","review":"So I opened the app to a big fat sweaty Cheeto 🦐 and that’s a no no for me 👁👄👁 after I was on the app for about 3 minutes Martha my average dog flew through my window and ate my hot Cheetos 🙄 later (about 10 minutes) I received a phone call from Dixie damelio and she was screaming ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᕼᒍ and my ringtone was changed to lil huddy saying the N WORD! 😤 later that day a video of my step sister saving the dragons went viral… on Facebook but we all know the Karen’s rule that app… so clearly there was a mistake there and the WORSE THING ABT THIS APP IS THAT my fan flew out the whole in my window that Maratha my average dog made and my pinkie toe caught it but my 2 year old cousin bit a piece out of it and fed it to my PET LION! 😠😠 my lion ended up throwing it back up with my missing fuzzy avocado and kale sock I got from my PEPSIE CAN🤬🤬 SO NO DONT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT THIS TO HAPPEN☠️😾"}}]}
