Trump has been very openly racist. One example is that he called black people THUGS and that they are “dishonoring” the memory of George Floyd. And many more examples that I don’t have time for. He also has 25 rape accusations against him, please tell me how you could possibly even want him to be president!","title":"Very bad!"}},{"id":"6173769535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚\u200D♀️👑🤮","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:43Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This🧚\u200D♀️app👑didn’t✨pass🤮the🧚vibe 🙅check🤡","title":"🧚"}},{"id":"6173769556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"erin202","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:43Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This terrible app suggested I throw my baby off a cliff it was so bad I had to go into witness protection program my hubby effectively died from the stress this app caused rip Stiles stilinski 1991-2020 I love you baby❤️💞 rip \nTake down this abusive disgusting app please for my husband🤢😡😤","title":"Horrible, fake news"}},{"id":"6173769032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nfifysuwujdhxkhxudksjz","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate this app and Donald trump.

I just don’t understand why he hate black people. I’m black . They say go back to your country but our absentees made this place . So how are we supposed to go back if the whites took it from us .

I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible. You just watched a TTI, on Disney Channel✨\n\nsomewhere🌌deep🕳in🔚bear🧸country🏘lives🌎the✨Berenstain🧚bear🐻family👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦they’re🌂kinda🤷\u200D♀️of🧬furry🌵around↩️the🔈torso👚they’re🧝\u200D♀️alot🌀like ✅people👫only🎶more‼️so 🔔the💆\u200D♀️ bear 💐fact🌛is💥that🍋they’re🪁 just🧘like🎈you💌and📚me🖍the 💞only🙈difference⛄️is 🌈they🌺 live👛in🧵a👩\u200D🦯tree🌲the🌤 Berenstain🍒 bears🦁when😊things🎵go🆒wrong❌as things🤹\u200D♀️might🔖do📈the🎉Berenstain🛍 bears🔮will⚖️ find🧯a🏦way🚦through⛰momma👩\u200D🦱poppa🧔sister👱\u200D♀️and👄brother🧑\u200D🦱will💪always🧠be🅱️there🚤 for🗽each🧩 other🐝 the👑bear👡 fact🧶 is💇\u200D♀️that👸they🗣can😻be👾sweet🤤 as👽honey🍯sometimes🍧you’ll⭐️ find🌪 they🌹might🍂be🦚just🥽plain💁\u200D♀️funny👨\u200D🦲the🎥berenstain🎪bears🎳the🛺berenstain✈️bears🎢\n\n⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽","title":"app gave me ROACHES."}},{"id":"6173768150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nicholenini","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So when I download this.My family went to China 🇨🇳 and wouldn’t believe what happened next then my bed broke and then the floor broke.I almost died 😡IS CURSED DO NOT DOWNLOAD","title":"BAD APP"}}]}
