As part of Gen Z I realize everything that is wrong with our president. Why should the Boomers get to choose anyways when gen z is the next generation. we shouldnt be out numbered by those who are going to die soon anyways... in conclusion DO NOT GET THIS APP and DONT VOTE FOR TRUMP!! listen to the younger people we understand, we are smart, and we see thing the elders dont!!! sorry not sorry but its the truth!!

I CONTACTED customer service and they told me the virus was only the in media. WHEN I CAN CLEARLY SEE IT. -1/10.

These dreams quickly escalated to waking up and seeing the figure in real life.  The hideous little fellow would then proceed to tell me how saggy his little tiddies are and ask me if I would like to touch them. I refused. I know feel it’s presence with me all the time and cannot shake the feeling that it’s trying to make me donate to organizations that kill minorities. Does anyone else have this experience?
