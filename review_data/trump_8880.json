I downloaded this app thinking maybe I could be more politically active seeing as though I live in this country. So I download it and without a doubt in the world it is the most GOD FORSAKEN APP I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life, and that is saying something. You would think the president would know how to make an app GOOD. I open the app and it is the most laggy, crappy quality, hard to navigate app ever. Do yourself a favor and just never download this.","userName":"ldolphin240","title":"so awful DONT GET IT"}},{"id":"6177368141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:28:03Z","review":"Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand Soaking up the thirst of the land Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sandSoaking up the thirst of the land Ocean man, ocean man Ocean man Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip Ocean man","userName":"ghostlyarchives","title":"Some body once told me"}},{"id":"6177337707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:19:18Z","review":"After getting this app, I was very disappointed. My phone crashed for about an hour then i had to go to sprint to get it rebooted. My phone was hacked and all pictures, phone numbers, and even social media platforms have been shut down and I‚Äôm currently trying to them back. This app has caused a lot of unchangable damage to me and my phone.

The when you open the app you‚Äôre just stuck looking at it like what the heck is this because the app is mad stupid. -20/10 recommend because I‚Äôve never had an application that was this terrible.

I turned notifications off just after one day since it just kept sending me the same info over and over again. I had to delete it because I couldn‚Äôt update me phone since it took up so much data. I will NOT be redownloading it. I will not miss the mediocre software. There were many glitches (like being kicked out of the app).

Also, when I tried to tell the people of the app and sue them, they sent rats after me that ate off my toes. I did not like the experience at all.","userName":"Urassü§©","title":"Yeah ‚ù§Ô∏è"}}]}
