I did what I usually do, I hat some oatmeal for breakfast while updating my blog, I went for a walk with my tiny small dog and when I got home, my kids were playing soccer so I decided I could be on my phone for a little bit by the pool. I was on Facebook and I just finished attacking my Facebook friend, April for posting about black lives matter. we get it April, you voted for Bernie and your political views are wrong🙄 I soon got an add for my precious little Trumpy😍 I quick clicked on the link faster than you could imagine to download this “splendid” app. I even deleted a few pictures of my daughters Mckkinleeigh and Emilée for extra space for this “splendid” app. once it appeared on my home screen without a loading icon, I clicked on it with extra speed of my finger. about after a half hour of exploring this “splendid” app, I was done. is our racist, homophobic, sexist, sexual predator president really like this? he really made this app with no effort? I never thought he would do something like this. I feel betrayed. betrayal from the love of my life Donald J. Trump. I will no longer be allowing Mckkinleeigh or Emilée or Khristyan (my son I didn’t mention before) to watch Little Rascals because of his appearance. I will still be voting for him, but I do feel a sense of betrayal. please do not download.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I do not recommend"}}]}
