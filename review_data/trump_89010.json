I woke up on a sunny Monday morning and decided to download this app to distract myself from the inevitability of death and the insignificance of human life. Stupidly, I clicked “allow notifications”. Then I decided to go on a walk instead of going to work because we’re all going to die anyway and money is a construct void of true meaning. I was strolling down the sleepy streets of the suburbia in which I reside, past the white-owned houses hiding pervasive homophobia, racism, bigotry, and sexism. I picked up my pace as I passed the sketchiest, most dangerous part of town. That part is full of violent thugs who shoot innocent people for no reason and protect each other when someone commits a horrible crime. It was terrifying. But anyways, I made it past the police station pretty quickly and got to pet smart, where I purchased my beloved pet fish Gary. By the time I stepped out of the store, Gary and I were best friends. I loved Gary more than life itself. So of course I was even more careful while passing the pig pen because I had Gary to worry about. But just as I crossed the street, only a hundred yards from my home, my phone buzzed with a notification from this app. I glanced down to look at it, and in that split second a bus came barreling down the street, knocking Gary out of my hands. The bag he was in ripped open and he asphyxiated right there on the pavement. Bunker boy, if you’re reading this, the immeasurable weight of Gary’s wrongful death rests entirely upon your shoulders.","title":"FISH MURDERER","isEdited":false,"userName":"carleigh ray jepsen","rating":1}},{"id":"6174652639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:23:05Z","review":"In comparison to a fairy and to Trump on who I believe in the most, I’ll put all my bets in a fairy! 🌈🧚💥🌈🧚🌈🧚💥🌈🧚🤦🏻\u200D♂️🧚🧚🌈","title":"🧚⚡️🌈","isEdited":false,"userName":"1 3 m a n n y 1 2","rating":1}},{"id":"6174649674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:22:12Z","review":"This app is trash.
