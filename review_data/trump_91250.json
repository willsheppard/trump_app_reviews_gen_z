Right as I opened the app, this cheeto man popped up on the screen and it scared me so bad that my daughter told me that i started “shaking on the floor” and i’ve taught her well enough to call the police and it took a bit until I left the hospital and the doctors were baffled because i haven’t been under any stress recently but seeing this putrid looking PUNGENT man staring back at me, my stress level really sky rocketed. Once I got home, i charged my phone and the app was opened automatically as if SOMEONE WAS CONTROLLING MY PHONE. I knew something was wrong and I started to panic and I dropped my phone, walking backwards in fear, and i didn’t notice that my daughter was RIGHT BEHIND ME so i squished her by sitting on her on accident after I fell backwards. The last thing i heard from her was an intense scream and I can never forget the noise. My only daughter is dead, because i KILLED HER WITH TRUMPS DOING. I had a proper funeral and i’m attending therapy now, but after I explained to my sister how my daughter died, she said that trump is one evil orange obese greasy wrinkly ball-sack boy. When i asked why she said that after he told everyone to INJECT CLEANING SUPPLIES TO PROTECT FROM THE CORONAVIRUS, MY UNCLE FOLLOWED ALONG AND DIED THE NIGHT BEFORE. I almost passed out from the shock especially after losing my daughter. It was like my whole life was being cursed. I read the other reviews about a curse but I thought they were just joking since the kids nowadays go tremendous lengths to mess around. But no, please don’t download this app. And if you can’t help yourself, don’t say I didn’t warn you because without trump, my life is better.","userName":"Slingshot805","rating":1}},{"id":"6138409040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-30T04:26:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TRUMP 2020","review":"🧚💘💕 on a gravestone 🧚🧚💖\n\nWhat can I say?

I opened the app ✨ and there was this scary orange Cheeto with arms scaring me to death👁👄👁. I passed out since that orange Cheeto was on phone. (Btw I was so close to throwing my phone out the window and getting a new one) The orange spray tan also reminded me of orange chicken. So thanks to this I can no longer eat orange or fried  chicken since I will recall back to moment. I am truly terrified from this. Cheeto man and uneducated people who support the Cheeto remind me of a cult. This app also is part of it. I’m trembling because of that, and the fact that A Cheeto has a app. So after I login and everything I got this racist homophobic vibe from the users using this app. After I scroll for a bit, my phone started shaking a playing “𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣” and I’m truly upset because this does not belong on such a horrible app. After that  my phone started to chase my poor cat with the confederate flag. I have no idea how my phone got that but it did. I went to go eat lunch and it started to buzz over and over again, I’m not sure how. When I went to open the app lots of Pictures of a racist orange Cheeto puff. I threw up it was really scary and terrifying. When I went back to get my phone, it was saying “TRUMP 2020” In a Kermit voice. I threw up again- . So I delete the app and will never get it again. I’m mortified by this and hope no one downloads it and experience the same thing PS- trump 2020😍🥬 but in a gravestone✨💅🏽🤩","userName":"litzzy._.thehuman","rating":1}},{"id":"6137630485","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T23:23:50Z","isEdited":false,"title":"chicken wing","review":"this made me so angry that i had to opportunity to download this app 1/10 i think it needs some music","userName":"bdhdhdjznbdjxbdh","rating":1}},{"id":"6137506469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T22:29:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"The app was very bad and made my phone glitch and stop working.
