If he’s gonna best on gen z by deleting tik tok, i think it’s time he gets a taste of his own medicine. \nFirst of all: He had the audacity to show up on the first page with his ugly af neck😳, which is photoshopped out of every official photo of him. Which show how little care was put into this. Second off: the app is age restricted?? What about all the poor children that need to be more brainwashed by his prejudiced ideals. \nAnd third: there are way too many pop ups and data collection methods, i though he didn’t care about who people were or where they were from 🥱. \nI’m deleting this app immediately, i don’t want to put up with all the bs and draining material on it.","title":"worst app EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"💫💖💫dontunderestimateus✨💞✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6174050354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:13Z","review":"here are some reasons why I do not like this app: \nREASON ONE: r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️\nREASON TWO: Ever😆see😱me🥰fighting👍🏾in💖a🍯forest🥺with✌🏾a😠grizzly🥴bear👄HELP💔🥴THE😔BEAR💯\nTHIRD REASON:i🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫\nTHE FOURTH REASON:have🤔 you 😒ever😔 been 😡snaked 🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄\nYES THERE’S MORE:we've🧸been🍯waiting🧚🏼for💊you🌟all🧨summer🗿and✈️were🎈so✨glad👄your📣finally🔫hëîréèē\nIVE GOT MORE COMING:Ever 😻 have❤️a 💀 really 😾 good ✨ picture 📱but 🙊 annoying🙄 things 👑 like 👦 light switches 💡 get 😛 in 😒 the 😱 way💁\u200D♀️\nONLY A FEW MORE REASONS:bûtthõlēs🍤are😛nothing💃🏼to🦠be🤰laughed😡at👄they’re🐂 just😟 a👾part🎛of👺the🤖human🕴body😡\nALMOST DONE VENTING: spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬\nJUST ONE MORE: why❓don't⌛we🔪just👽relax😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅radio📻 would👿you😼like💕AMMMM👹or🤪 FMMMM\nMY LAST REASON: | 💕ᗪ|ᗪ乇乃😽 匚ㄖ爪乇😎ㄒㄖ😾 ᗪ乇😿 ㄒ尺乇🎁 ㄒ尺乇 🌲 匚ㄖ爪乇 🌳 ㄒㄖ 😌 爪乇👻\n\nyeah❤️so in conclusion LESHAWNA ball is evil büt į’m ŵìłłîńg tō êátëd å bàbŷ īf ït çürêś çørń vírüš 😻😼🌽😹🙀( also a little p.s𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼 𝓫𝓮𝓪𝓷𝓼)","title":"no👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"mcmeekss","rating":1}},{"id":"6174004179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:49:50Z","review":"First of all I would like to start off by saying the orange on the pictures gave me nightmares, yes NIGHTMARES and it still hasn’t stopped I get really scared of a giant Cheeto running after me trying to deport me. IM LEGAL HERE! But that’s not all. This man which I shall not name is(a)  ra_ist fill in the blank A) C, B)P. Not even to mention how bad 2020 is which any trump supporters fault because God is obviously punishing us for you bird brain people who voted for him. I don’t know why God would punish off of us but it’s obviously trump supporters fault and especially trump. I’m disgusted to even be breathing the same air as you people. I have so much more to say but why should I when I can go put fairy comment on Fox News. Here’s some fairy comments for now for the one and only horrible person Donald Cheeto trump 😌.  \nYou have so much confidence 💕✨😌 get rid of it 💜🙂🦋, \nEveryone is so mean to you 🥺😔😭 I cant see why tho 👀🧚✨,\n 🥰🧚✨ You did that 🥳🤩🤪 now never do it again 💅🦋🥰\nNo one should ever give up 🥺✨💕 except for you 🥰😌🧚\nNobody is perfect 🥺🤩🧚 especially not you 🦋🙂💗\nI know talent when I see it 🤩💕🥺 and I’m still looking 👁👄👁\nThat should be enough for now 🤩😌🥰\n Now apple pls delete this app. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. 💗","title":"WORST APP EVER TO EXIST","isEdited":false,"userName":"I hate trump 2020","rating":1}},{"id":"6173992132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:14Z","review":"I downloaded this app and exactly 69 minutes later my mom, grandma, sister, and all of my cousins died. They did an autopsy, and the man said the cause of death was second hand embarrassment. The president single-handedly RUINED my life, and I was disowned by the rest my family. I am currently living on the street. My hamster died yesterday due to malnutrition because the only thing I am allowed to buy from the store is orange food, to be reminded of the person I voted for. I would also like to mention that when I first opened this app, I was greeted with a nude picture of the president getting a spray tan (it was microscopic). I am now legally blind due to the image being tattooed into my brain. Additionally, I would like to apologize to Melania Trump, due to the fact that the only good thing she is getting out of that relationship is money.","title":"the cheetos can’t help you now","isEdited":false,"userName":"homeless orphan","rating":1}},{"id":"6173973458","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:38:09Z","review":"I downloaded this app to open it up and see a very yucky Cheeto man staring at me I quickly closed it in horror. My eyes were bleeding and I was crying. Our family dog whom was right next to me on my left side was whining and growling he’s eyes were watering and he was hiding under my pet rock named Cornelius. But it doesn’t stop there Cornelius forgot to put on deodorant this morning and when my dog went to hide he smelled Cornelius and ran to the other side of the room the smell was horrific when my dog was running he ran into the desk that was holding my fish tank my dog has a concussion and then my fish bowl got knocked over and then my fish fell to the ground and my cat that’s allergic to fish ate the fish and died and now I don’t have a fish cat and my dog is very sick also my rock died when he saw the Cheeto man when I opened the app. Lawsuit I say.

I just found out this app existed so I told everyone I know to download it too HOWEVER as soon as you open the app it glitches out and breaks your phone. When I opened it, It froze on the title screen so I went to the Apple store and they were unable to fix it, I ended up having to buy a new phone entirely so this app cost me over $700. The same happened to everyone I told to download it and they were all incredibly upset with me THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE! I lost the love of my life, I lost my job, I lost my kids, I lost my house, I lost my car, I even lost my dog and pet snail. As of right now I’m living on the streets borrowing a strangers phone to share this information with you please save yourself and\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","isEdited":false,"userName":"johnn jon john gjon III","rating":1}},{"id":"6173832710","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:45:47Z","review":"First of all I was so excited to support my president trump 😌✨🧡 but THEN it kept kicking me out and I was like “this ain’t it” 😔 THIS APP THREATENED ME to rate it 5 stars or I would be deported!

I downloaded it so I could support our master Cheeto. Turns out when I got this app it flooded my bathroom with orange skittles. ( the worst flavor possible) also it uploaded pics of my hamster! With no clothing! I am deleting this app because my phone is also traumatized. There are so many other things I should address. It blasted the lottery song so loud I could not here my Sofia the first tv show. Me, Sofia the first, and my hamster are all disappointed. But, I ask you to please download this app, give it a one star review and the delete it. I wish I could give this app a 0 star review. There are many other things I would like to say about this app but I don't have the time because i still have to pick up all the orange skittles. Oh jeez there are now orange Minecraft villagers coming for me!
