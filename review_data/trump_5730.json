It keeps shutting down and crashing and soon after it does that the app starts whispering death threats in my ear(Ex: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna impale you with my big toe‚Äù). After 4 consecutive days of this happening I decided I would delete the app because I was starting to lose my mind and hallucinate the president stabbing me with his big toe üò®. Anyways I mean if you want to get this app you can but know that you will never be the same mentally and might need therapy.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:02:40Z","title":"Not what I thought","userName":"iwannakmsahahababahah","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177479779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to see if Barron Trump would show any more clues of needing savingüòå‚ú® but was very VERY disappointed when I opened the app and was met with a Cheeto ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üò§ not only was he ugly and had cheese for hair but he also I guess was doing some weird Cheeto magic‚ú®üò•‚ú® because I started having the most freighting dreams about him in my room feeding me Cheetos sensuallyüò•üßö then when I woke up my whole room looked orange.

Such as, what policies will he put in place to protect the American people, especially LGBTQ+, POC, and people with disabilities. BUT!! I couldn‚Äôt even get that far!! :((( It took like two days to download, and once it did, I couldn‚Äôt even get past the home screen without the whole app crashing and completely crashing my phone as well!! I‚Äôd have to wait like 5 -15 seconds to even be able to turn my phone back on!?!?!

BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! Right when it downloaded my iPhone completely freaked out. The screen kept going black, there was a high pitched noise but i couldn‚Äôt turn the sound down, I tried to leave and delete the app but my phone got so hot I couldn‚Äôt use it anymore. This app must‚Äôve been maybe by the devil himself. This all being said, the only good thing about this app is that I am writing this review off of my new iPhone 11.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:54:37Z","title":"Horrible Quality‚ÄîNot here from Tik ToküôÇ","userName":"DEZI1605060000","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177447673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"download this app to support my Oompa Loompa king. But when I downloaded it I was ambushed with pictures of his little turtle *wink wink*. I felt very uncomfortable and very unsafe and feared for my mental health and well being. Then things got worse my skin started changing colors and my hair started to look like a worm on my head. I started turning into him. Very scary. But the worse part was when little trump babies started crawling around my house screaming TRUMP 2020. It was very very terrifying. I have to go to counseling twice a week for my ptsd. Trump has scared me for life.
