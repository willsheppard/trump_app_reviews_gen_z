I expected to see great and useful information on how this country could improve with Donald Trump’s mood presidency but it didn’t show me anything useful at all. This app was a waste of space and a waste of my time. If you’re thinking of down it, DON’T DO IT. 🚫✨"}},{"id":"6178980505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:48:10Z","title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Bunnylover613","review":"if I could rate this zero stars I would, took forever to download and made my phone crash!
