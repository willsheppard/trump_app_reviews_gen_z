I said no then I kicked me out of my house and deported me to Antarctica and took away my U.S. citizenship. Now I have to sleep with the emperor penguins so keep warm but they don’t like my clothes so I can’t wear them which is a little counterproductive but at least I’m not alone. Also sliding down ice on your stomach is not what it’s implied to be. It’s cold and a little wet and yesterday a seal tried to eat me. 😭😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T16:25:23Z","userName":"frozensidthesloth","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177320793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"witchcraft","review":"I was so excited to download this app to be able to get info on our one true leader 💕THE💕Donald J Trump who should be deemed supreme emperor of the world✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️ but after I got it STRANGE occurrences have been happening in my house🥴 first my dog just dropped dead as soon as I opened the app- not cool trumpy trump...👿 THEN a witch cursed my entire bloodline to be forced to rub Cheeto dust👨\u200D🦳on our faces for the rest of our days. At least we’ll look like our tyrannical dictator who lacks any sense🧠 of basic human rights 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T16:14:37Z","userName":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💕🧚🏻\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177258952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A review","review":"I only downloaded this app to leave a review about our narcissistic president trying to control our freedom. he claims to not be a racist but does things to contradict himself, he says he’s not a rapist but does things that prove otherwise. our president is awful.. and not to mention he is trying to get rid of tik tok, does he not like the fact that gen z is powerful and over threw his rallies? is he mad that we’re spreading facts and information that are hurting his image?","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:54Z","userName":"Madison Jacob","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177200400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS SPAM DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"I downloaded this app to get all the updates on the election and this app was spamming me and giving me information I did not need. This app is not useful, annoying, and also keeps glitching. I’m very disappointed in this app, as I had expectations and those were not even the slightest of met. If I could give this app a 0 star review, I most definitely would because it doesn’t even deserve the 1 star that I’m required to give.","date":"2020-07-09T15:40:01Z","userName":"David Copeland","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177184058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just WOW 😠","review":"Right as I launched the app, it asked for my PHONE NUMBER!? Why does he need that? He didn’t even ask me on a date first and just wants my number? Any who, I didn’t like how this app looked the blue and white just kinda distasteful if I’m being honest. Orange really suits him better, I think he should change his colors to that. When I launched it, after noticing the phone number trick 😠, my dog went into epileptic shock!!!!!! I do NOT recommend this app if you have a dog.","date":"2020-07-09T15:35:22Z","userName":"Peaches 😌💅🏼🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177178761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Somethings off about this app","review":"I downloaded the app a couple of days ago and before that my phone was fine. After a couple of days ago... my phone started crashing and glitching out. Keep in mind that my phone is brand new, I just got it 1 month ago. I deleted the app two days ago and now my phone is doing alright. i don't know if the app downloaded some virus or something on my phone but I do not suggest downloading.","date":"2020-07-09T15:33:53Z","userName":"Marybeth Grac","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177154861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLEEE","review":"Trump is possibly the worst thing that could happen to the Untied States. Many of the decisions he made lead to this year being awful. We all know that he doesn’t know anything about how to run a country. HE IS A SLOB! The way he talks about women and the lgbtq+ community it’s unspeakable. He should have no right running this country. He is turning this country into trash and we need to come together to not allow that! He cannot be re-elected! I am disgusted by that Cheeto puffs behavior.","date":"2020-07-09T15:27:06Z","userName":"isabelmarquez","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177097642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Try again sweetie","review":"Downloaded this app to see what the 2020 election game plan was and as soon as I opened the app I was greeted by the face of a white supremacist....shocker! The stupidity of this app isn’t surprising seeing as it’s a representation of a man who never learned to read at a fourth grade level. Honestly ‘president’ Trump just needs to spend a little more time working on his app✨from prison✨P.S. the Antifa app works loads better and actually doesn’t take away brain cells when using💖","date":"2020-07-09T15:11:17Z","userName":"DaddyRiot","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177096807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Im scared🧚🏻\u200D♀️","review":"I was so excited to get Roller coaster tycoon 2 but after 12 days of downloading i realized it was the Trump app. Not only did it take 12 days to download but it also gave me nightmares for months. I highly do not 🥳recommend this app! It also takes up a lot pf storage and likes to send me weird notifications like “hey beautiful” like okay ✨petafile✨ leave me alone. I now have a meeting with a therapist twice a day and have to sleep with all my lights on. Thanks Trump.🤢","date":"2020-07-09T15:11:04Z","userName":"shamiplayer1","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
