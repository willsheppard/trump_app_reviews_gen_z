It was extremely slow to download and it took up so much of my storage space on my phone that I had to delete precious pictures of my family, dog, friends and boyfriend. I was extremely disappointed to find out it wasn‚Äôt even worth the loss of those pictures. It gave me very bad vibes. Like very homophobic, racist, misogynistic, pedophilloic vibes, if you know what I mean. I can‚Äôt consciously download an app that introduces such terrible vibrations into my life and that supports the killing of innocent Black people by the police. I think my life and the lives of countless other people would be better if this app didn‚Äôt exist. A weight was lifted off of my shoulders when I finally decided to delete the app and leave this terrible review. Now here are the lyrics to the song, The Way by Ariana Grande ft. Mac Miller, that I listened to in order to bring my spirits back up just in case you are reading this and need something to lift you up. What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top\nI love the way you make me feel\nI love it, I love it\nI love the way you make me feel\nI love it, I love it\nSay, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour\nDo my singing in the shower\nPicking petals off the flowers like\nDo she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)\nI ain't a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)\nYou give me that kind of something\nWant it all the time, need it everyday\nOn a scale of one to ten I'm at 100\nNever get enough, I can't stay away\nIf you want it, I got it, I got it everyday\nYou can get whatever you need from me\nStay by your side, I'll never leave you\nAnd I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper\nSo don't you worry, baby, you got me\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it\nAnd I don't care who sees it babe\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me\nI love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nBaby, I love the way (you make me feel)\nOoh, I love the way (I love it) the way you love me\nOh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping\nWhen you put your lips on mine\nAnd honey it ain't a question (question)\nCause boy I know just what you like\nSo If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday\nBe your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me\nStay by your side, I'll never leave you\nAnd I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper\nSo don't you worry, baby, you got me\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it\nAnd I don't care who sees it babe\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me\nI love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nBaby, I love the way (you make me feel)\nOoh, I love the way (I love it) the way I love you\nUh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine\nI hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind\nYou're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time\nSaid your bed be feeling lonely, so you're sleeping in mine\nYou come and watch a movie with me\nAmerican Beauty or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy\nJust come and move closer to me, I got some feelings for you\nI'm not gonna get bored of, but baby you're an adventure\nSo please let me come explore you\nSo don't you worry, baby you got me\nI got a bad boy, I must admit it\nYou got my heart, don't know how you did it\nAnd I don't care who sees it babe\nI don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me\nI love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nBaby, I love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nI love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nBaby, I love the way (you make me feel)\nI love the way (I love it)\nThe way I love you\nThe way I love you, you, you, yeah\nI love the way you make me feel\nI love it, I love it\nI love the way you make me feel\nI love it\nThe way I love you","userName":"Janaic2000","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:41:44Z","title":"This App Changed My Life for the Worst"}},{"id":"6177414626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP.this app is the worst it gave me chlamydia and took my card info.
