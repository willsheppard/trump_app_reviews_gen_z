It also turned my cat into a robot and now it shoots lasers! It also sends about 200 notifications an hour and is so annoying. They also spam my email 20 times a day. If i could give this app 0 stars I would. Stan Joe Biden for clear skin.","date":"2020-07-09T04:29:11Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"paige___10273"}},{"id":"6175052054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Upsetting","review":"I downloaded this app to support the president of the USA, but later realized this is a bad app. I cannot stress how upsetting it is to get Henti ads in front of my children, and grandchildren. The tentacles is where I draw the line and it seems as the app itself does not care for the well being of the users. Will NOT be downloading again after deletion.","date":"2020-07-09T04:24:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😍😘😜😗😝😗😝😗😠😨😠😆😨😷"}},{"id":"6175051650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP","review":"I just got done downloading this app and I barley open it and I immediately started getting glitches which was weird I decided to keep the app for a little longer but my phone just kept on glitching I just assumed it was my phone acting up but when I deleted the app my phone was getting back to normal I advise you TO NOT DELETE THE APP BECAUSE ITS CAUSING GLITCHES AND IYS RUINING YOUR PHONE.","date":"2020-07-09T04:23:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":".idk.9"}},{"id":"6175036080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","review":"As the election approaches, I wanted to be able to interact more with the campaign and downloaded this app. I expected a lot since I heard great reviews about it. Turns out it took too much space and also caused my devices to run slower. Don’t get me started with the phone heating up too😒! Like what?!?! Don’t get this app people!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:19:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Trumpthescientist2020"}},{"id":"6175020090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app de-baptized me","review":"I am BEYOND disappointed. I got this app to be closer to God but instead all I got was BULL HOCKY. Trump was supposed to be my daddy but instead he was my mailman. SAD. This app is so bad that it almost makes me want to wear a mask...almost. I also got bit or stung by something and it hurts. Weren’t you supposed to prevent that stuff dude?? Anyways, eat the booty like groceries and remember to swallow. Peace out.","date":"2020-07-09T04:14:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"saucy karen"}},{"id":"6174963846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why my wife left me.","review":"I got this app just yesterday and my wife left me and took my kids. Karen if your reading this please let me se Sara and John. I read an article from this app and my wife already packed her and the kids bags. Maybe it’s because of Maria the maid, but I swear it was consensual. Anyway don’t get this app because it will take your wife and kids away.","date":"2020-07-09T03:56:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Isaiah Michael Espinoza"}},{"id":"6174950300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮🧚\u200D♀️DisGusTang🧚\u200D♀️🤮","review":"So I heard you been hanging out with kelly\nR-Rebecca it’s not what you think\nI won’t hesitate 🏝\nAye anybody tell you look like Beyoncé \nNah they usually tell me I look like Shalisa \nWho’s that \nMe \nI wanna be the very best, like no one ever was, to catch them is my real test to train them is my cause, \nI will travel across the land, searching far and wide, each Pokémon to understand the power that’s inside!\nPokémon \nGotta catch em all\nIt’s you and me\nI know it’s my destiny!\nPokémon \nOh, your my best friend in a world we must defend!\nPokémon \nOh a heart so true\nOur heart so true \nOur courage will pull us through \nYou teach me\nAnd I teach you \nPokémon!","date":"2020-07-09T03:51:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ugg Lee As"}},{"id":"6174948791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL APP !","review":"this app gave me SEVERAL glitches and viruses!!! currently writing this review on my NEW iphone that i had to buy after my old phone EXPLODED in my own hands while i was scrolling through twitter, ugh.
