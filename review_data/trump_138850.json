But then we had heard him say “i dont feel so good” and before we knew it, the orange 🍊 man turned into dust because he was the demon! Then out from the dust crawled Belle Delphine! 🙀😿 Then she let out a loud yell calling all the other little demons over to attack and get revenge for what happened to the big orange 🍊!
