BAD app","userName":"Lmesko","review":"I downloaded this app because someone told me great things would happen. Great things have NOT happened. My life has be a wreck since downloading this app. People tell me it’s a good wreck, probably one of the best wrecks they have seen. Someone even said to me “your wreck of a life is perfect”, they have never seen a more perfect wreck of a life. I’m glad my life is now a wreck. I only hope that it doesn’t last much longer. But if we quit asking people if there life is a wreck, I believe less people will admit to the wreckage of their lives. So there you have it. Don’t listen to fake people asking like CNN or read The NY Times because they will tell you not to vote for tRUMP and that if you don’t vote for tRUMP your life will not be a wreck but will be in RUINS.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177016954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:49:14Z","title":"Worst app I could Ever get.","userName":"amos.tosmallt","review":"This is the most desperate attempt for attention. Trump is so unfit to be president an even recognized as a human being. Covid 19 for example we went from not having so much cases to sky rocketing out of the PARK. Could he say something about it yes did he do something about it? No. Therefore Trump is unfit to be even alive!. Did you realize that trump once said by quote “Is it okay that I find my daughter my attractive then my own wife” an KNOW THIS. She was only 13!. Unfit an if I owned a gun. I would TAKE HIM OUT MYSELF!. This is a threat. But don’t worry about me. It’s not like I’m learning your routine. Or saving up money for a hit man. Not like everyday around. 2:00pm - 2:30pm trump pass by a certain window that could easily end his own career. Again don’t mind me. What can I do. :/.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176930639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:05Z","title":"Infiltrated by the liberals do not use!","userName":"Karen-likes-cats","review":"I was pretty excited when I saw this app because I am an avid supporter of trump, but shortly after downloading the some... strange things started happening. I would leave my phone somewhere before bed and it would be in a different place the next morning, or I would hear heavy breathing during my phone calls, but I blew it off as nothing. Then, one day, I was taking a bath and injecting myself with bleach, and my phone grew spider legs and crawled straight up my anus. I am writing this from a friends phone (I have had medical attention but they were unable to get it and out) and I can feel it crawling around my colon and laying it’s eggs. This is the work of those dirty liberals! Stop them before they take over the country!","rating":1}},{"id":"6176909025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:20:30Z","title":"This app ruined everything","userName":"heeeellpp-meeeE","review":"Then I got the app it took forever to load and when it was almost done to stoped and when it stoped my car stopped working so I had to go get it fixed but it would cost 5mil and I don’t have that kind of money but I need my car so I paid up, the next day I was out on the streets because I had no money left and then a trump 2020 cart pulled up and took all my belongings and sold them to rich white idiots so not a little of me died inside knowing that idiots have my thing I would rather have them be burned than in the had of those kinds of people.... in conclusion getting this app will break your car, make you go broke, have you living on the streets, and will kill you inside. And then you will blow up","rating":1}},{"id":"6176318756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:41:15Z","title":"JUST AWFUL!!! 💔😖😨","userName":"hot fries❤️","review":"So you know as a the proud American I am, I decided to download this app in support of our oompa loompa president, Donald Duck. It took days,no, WEEKS FOR IT DOWNLOAD. It was tiring. Waiting day and night for it to download. Well, it finally downloaded today. I expected this app to be great. To work without glitches and run smoothly. Guess what? IT DIDNT. It glitched as soon as I opened the app. Right after, it was already asking for my number. Like, does Donald Duck realize he has supporters that are minors. Yeah, I get Donald you raped little kids but come one man. I’m your supporter and you do this to me. Absolutely disappointing. Anyway, that’s all I have to say to this awful app. Either fix it or Apple please do your thing and delete this awful disgusting app off the App Store. Thank you 💫✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6176164845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:54:40Z","title":"Why???","userName":"Musiclover1680","review":"Ok so let’s start things off by saying it crashed when trying to download. I had to then reassure my phone it was me and try to download it again. Once that was out of the way I tried to open the app where it proceeded to show some sort of loading screen for an hour before crashing my phone. Once my phone restarted I tried yet again to open the stupid freaking app witch proceeded to say it needed an update. I went to the update page and when I tried to update it a little pop up showed up on my screen and read, “Sorry, no non-trump supporters allowed. Go away as your not welcome and never will be.” That’s when I realized all I needed to do was download it to leave this review. That concludes my short story for the day!","rating":1}},{"id":"6176128113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:43:21Z","title":"This app is horrible 🤢","userName":"Melin1971","review":"This app is absolutely horrible!!

This is of course the best most American app there is. I couldn’t wait to have our lovely cheeto in command’s app right here on the home screen of my device. However, when the app finally downloaded a wall was built in front of my home screen. It rendered my phone completely useless (I am writing this from my computer). Then my phone began yelling racist, homophobic, and misogynistic slurs at me from behind the wall. I though no way could an app affiliated with Donald Trump ever in a million years say those sorts of things because he would never, right? But alas it is true. Everyone should go out and vote. Everyone make your voice heard 🧚🏾\u200D♂️✨🧚🏾\u200D♂️ but not Trump supporters 🧚🏾\u200D♂️✨🧚🏾\u200D♂️.

I took me a while to even click where I can write this review. By the way, I’m not even writing this, I have to speak because my phone doesn’t work. This phone was fine before I had this app. Now I can’t go on any of my apps, it takes a while to type, my phone keeps getting a notification notice and it is very annoying. \n\nIf you think you can help this app to be better, you’re absolutely wrong. ♡ This app is a disgrace. Both because of what has happened to me and also because this “trump” person seems racist and is not willing to educate himself. How is someone that incompetent of anything is a president and thinks he should have another term? \n\nn e ways stan nature and listen to girls","rating":1}},{"id":"6175659342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:07:57Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!😡","userName":"timothée chalamets wifey","review":"So I downloaded this app to which I opened it and I got a weird confirmation thing, I didn’t think much of it until I heard a knock on my door.... I opened it to be greeted by a secret service team! They brought Hilary Clinton to the door also, but also that wasn’t it. They were forcing me to commit a cult join because if I wanted to download the app I had to “join the republican cult” Hilary got me a glass of blood which I have no idea where she got it from but I declined. When I declined they jumped my grandma and grandpa who were just standing there they asked me again if I wanted to consent to it, when I disagreed again they spit in my face and left with my grandma and grandpa, who arrived back in a van about a week later. Overall just plain traumatic I say again DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","rating":1}}]}
