The FBI immediately texted me saying I was too young to vote for trump and I was forced to say that I will vote for trump when I‚Äôm older. I went into the app again to see if anything changed and then trump started calling me which I obviously denied, he called me again and it automatically answered I tried to hang up but I couldn‚Äôt. Then he said that if I didn‚Äôt vote for him when I was older that he would tell everyone to call me a cow, that is body shaming and I do not approve. It then let me hang up and I blocked him. The app then started glitching out my phone and my pictures started getting deleted. All of my sappy got locked, including my phone and message apps. I deleted the app and my apps started unlocking and my pictures came back. The FBI texted me again saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you off with a warning‚Äù and then my phone powered off. I turned it back on and deleted the app. Do not download this app. I was very upset about what happened to me and now my parents won‚Äôt be voting for trump.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:39:47Z","title":"Shameful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180128480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Timmytammy158954","review":"This app causes my phone to glitch every time I open it.

We are not gonna get TikTok banned doodüòå THIS REVIEW ISN‚ÄôT JUST FOR THIS APP TO GET DELETED- Trump is racist, and makes a lot- and when i say a lot, i mean A LOT of pretty bad decisions. ‚ÄúslOw thE tEsting dOwn plEase‚Äú slow our research of trying to get out of this stupid pandemic? That don‚Äôt make sense. (Ik that was a while ago) I LIED- the app DID crash about 20 times while i tried to put my number in. I deleted it bc it rlly didn‚Äôt want me to type without it crashing and lagging! Oh, i have a question. WHY DOES TRUMP HATE CHINA AND MEXICO SO FRICKEN MUCH?! What‚Äôs so bad about it? Rlly tho. ‚Äúr*piSts cOme frOm mExicO‚Äú who else wants obama back..? He actually helped and wasn‚Äôt fricken RACIST (bc he was black obv) we need more ppl like him- not Biden or Trump.
