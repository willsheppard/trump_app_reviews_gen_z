Once it downloaded I opened the app and there was some kind of chanting or song coming from the app. Mind you, it was in the middle of the night when I got a notification that the app had downloaded, so I decided to check it. As the song or chant whatever it was started I saw my closet door open and spiders started crawling out, the spiders proceeded to carry my hampster and took it to the closet. I decided to go check it out cuz why not and their I saw president 🍊 eating my hampster and the spiders. HE ATE MY HAMPSTER. Then he dissapered and the same thing happened with my other hampster the next night, so I deleted the app and I have see president 🍊 since. DONT DOWNLOAD IT YOU DONT KNOW WHO HE’LL EAT MAYBE YOUR KIDS OR UR PETS BE AWARE!!!!"}},{"id":"6173707643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HELP IM TRAPPED IN THE WHITE HOUSE BATHROOM","rating":1,"userName":"CandySwtz","date":"2020-07-08T20:59:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my favorite president 😍😍😍 and was instantly met with a picture of a red eye that felt like it was staring into my soul 😱😱😱 and then four 8ft tall men dressed in bright orange robes appeared in my room with a blinding flash of light!!1!

And if that isn’t worse enough this app showed me Donald Trumps tiny little dick, I would say smaller than my pinky finger, and then death threatened me, it found my address and said they were sending swat teams to “shoot me in my tiny little heart and brain, that are hollow.” I was so done with this app I deleted it, but once I tried to delete it bugs crawled out of it and then I passed out, once I woke up Donald Trump, the ugly orange man, was holding me hostage, and he held a gun to my head...

When it finally loaded, it framed a 17 year old for a murder he didn’t commit, then got him roped into an illegal fight club during his stay in juvie. Then it got children and adults alike obsessed with a game called “Griffins & Gargoyles,” with Jumanji-like consequences. In service of a costumed villain called “the Gargoyle King” who demanded sacrifice, playing G&G resulted in multiple suicides and homicides around town. And as if G&G wasn’t enough of a problem, it introduced a cult called The Farm. Chad Michael Murray- I mean, this dude called Edgar Evernever- is the leader. The recruitment process was largely helmed by his wife, who was posing as a high school student. The Farm was performing surgery in its members and harvesting their organs. They also robbed graves in order to convince members that they’re were communicating with their dead loved ones. True story."}},{"id":"6173157213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","rating":1,"userName":"4thens","date":"2020-07-08T17:50:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app with the intention of supporting our führer. sadly the minute i opened this app i was overwhelmed by the amount of anime cat girls. i was DISGUSTED to say the least, i mean how immoral is that? after I had gotten through all the ungodly adds it turns out that Mr. Trump himself SUPPORTS the radical left, this was the worst presidential propaganda I had seen since watergate. \nAnyways, as I was scrolling through the app with fox news in the background, I saw it. Trump had publicly shared his support for Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. He was even congratulating Joe for making it this far in his campaign. Honestly I thought he would support Kanye but THIS, THIS was DISGUSTING. After seeing his support for Black Lives Matter and his support for the LGBTQ+ I felt betrayed. In conclusion the führer isn't who I thought he was. honestly it broke my heart."}},{"id":"6172973570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"nina bruce","date":"2020-07-08T16:53:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app took 4 years to download. They were the worst 4 years of my  life. While the app was downloading, I got so MANY STUPID notifications from the app, even though I could use it. There was a lot of alerts about making my phone great again, (my phone was working fine). But the app never even tried to improve my phone it just gave me stupid notifications and set my iPhone software back 50 years. Now it’s really dysfunctional. Some other notifications were about really ugly stuff. My phone didn’t let me download apps that were developed in middle eastern countries. Other notifications were racist, disgusting, Antisemitic, False statements, and MANY other rude and horrible things. Also, my screen had a strange orange tint to it while I was downloading it."}}]}
