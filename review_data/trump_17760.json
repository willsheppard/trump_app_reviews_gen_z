TERRIBLE!","review":"This app is absolutely horrible, as soon as I opened it I began getting countless telemarketing calls and junk mail. It froze my phone for hours and I had to reset it to have function again. Also there are lots of crazies on here who don’t believe COVID is a hoax, Wild! I’m also convinced it contributed to some guy slapping my dog, lit my flag on fire, and called my poor sweet grandma a commie.
