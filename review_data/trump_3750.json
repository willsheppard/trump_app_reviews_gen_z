I’m not a Trump supporter but I wanted to try and change that. I entered my phone number but it kicked me of the app. I tried getting back on it but all that happened was that I couldn’t see it anywhere. I went to my tablet and downloaded this app again but it did the same. Once I found it and got it working the screen was glitches out like crazy. After about two minutes later my phone froze so I had to let my phone die. Once I turned on my phone I had to delete this app since it seemed like it wasn’t good for my phone."}},{"id":"6176579310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:53:17Z","title":"not good👎🏻","userName":"dongald's 😸 juice","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i dont even know where to start. first, this app took literal years to complete. i thought it would be worth the wait, i love the president dearly. his face makes my 😻 tremble. secondly, i opened this app and was immediately asked for my home address. i did end up putting it in, because my president would need that information, but for a an amazing reason, unlike the communists over there in china, just compiling data on citizens. i thought my address would be safe, but not even 10 min later, i hear knocking at my door. i didnt want to open it because it was past midnight, but they just kept on knocking. so creepy. third, i was out shopping earlier today, and a market lady waved me down and told me that she was a trumpet too, and she invited herself over to my house. she then ripped off her market-lady apron and proceeded to get on top of me, claiming that it was our president’s orders. i will never download this app again, i strongly urge u to also not get this app. i would give it 0 stars if i could."}},{"id":"6176099332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:34:14Z","title":"don’t download","userName":"kailey is bingbong","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"when i first downloaded the app, it had a lot of lagging issues. After 13 HOURS of me trying to get the lag fixed, i finally messed with it enough to make it stop but then my phone started glitching out and i turned it off and on and it stopped. After a while of the app working fine i started getting random calls and text from unknown numbers saying that my phones been hacked by an app on my phone and that the app is sending pictures to random numbers. i deleted the app and took my phone to a person to see if they could fix it and they found out that it was this app that hacked my phone."}},{"id":"6176099024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:34:07Z","title":"absolutely horrifying","userName":"foejwjdhrhwod","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i opened the app to find nothing but racism, homophobia, objectifying and deteriorating women, and it was the slowest app i have ever run. nothing about this is good, the creator, the man it is based off of, the ideas it spreads, any of it! do NOT download!!! i cannot emphasize that enough! made my entire phone lag and all of my photos disappeared, they were all replaced by images of a scary, orange, pedophilic looking man, not only that, but no app on my device will open except for this one, i am absolutely livid about the tolls this app has taken on my iphone, i had no issues until this app was installed, nothing but bad news. stay away from this app and this man!!!"}},{"id":"6176090459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:31:24Z","title":"This app made me loose my dog!!","userName":"Squidnielouwhi","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Please DO NOT download this app!! I thought it would be an easy way to support MY president and savior Don but it was NOT. The app took 4 months to load and I needed to refresh the screen every 1 minute and 15 seconds or all data would be lost. The app eventually told me to delete ALL pictures with my non White friends in order to download the app or there would not be enough space on my phone. Kind of weird but ok. Once it finally downloaded I was met by a high pitched frequency that made my dog begin to freak out and seize on the floor. After throwing up on the carpet my dog ran away and I have not seen her since. Do NOT get this app I’m begging you."}},{"id":"6175664061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:09:36Z","title":"DISGRACE TO THE HUMAN RACE","userName":"thriving mexican😙😙","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Callous — He doesn’t care about anyone, especially those who are weaker than him.\n\nCynical — He sees the bad side in everybody’s personality and actions.\n\nOvercritical — He exaggerates the negative things you do.\n\nPatronising — Sometimes his words sound kind — but he’s really showing how much more important he is than you. \n\nUntrustworthy — You can’t trust her. She lies!\n\nShe hates change:\n\nDogmatic — She has strong beliefs and doesn’t accept any view outside those beliefs.\n\nInflexible — When she’s made plans, NOTHING can change them.\n\nIntolerant — She doesn’t like certain types of people and will never accept them. Sometimes this can be extreme, like racism, sexism or homophobia.\n\nNarrow-minded — She has a small view of the world and doesn’t accept ideas outside that view.\n\nStubborn — You will never be able to change her opinion on anything.\n\nObstinate — Like “stubborn,” but a little stronger.\n\nPig-headed — Like “obstinate.” But with a pig.\n\nFussy — She likes everything to be a certain way.

However, upon opening the app, I was instructed to inject disinfectant to rid myself of COVID 19. Obviously, I followed the guidance of our fearless leader. Perhaps I used the wrong kind of disinfectant because I was immediately rushed to the hospital. Something about “deadly chemicals should not be injected into the blood stream.” Come on, how could our sharp, intelligent president ever be wrong??? I believe there is something else at play. Someone is poisoning the disinfectants to make Mr. President look bad!!! Most likely those liberal sheep!!!! Anyhow, I gave this app 1 whole star because MR. TRUMP IS THE #1 PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6175080247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:32:52Z","title":"This app belongs in the Donald DUMP","userName":"Snooze man","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded the app, expecting a pleasant experience, when it asked me if I wanted to TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS!!!!!
