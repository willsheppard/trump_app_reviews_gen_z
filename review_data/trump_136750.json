Now that that’s out of the way... I downloaded this app and I saw a picture of Donald trump eating a glizzy ayooooooooooooo. Then I went looking for my cubed kush and I saw a flying ant. I told him about the app and he gave 29 stab wounds! DISGUSTING. So I jumped all the way to grandmas oatmeal and the squirrel started to do Gangnam style part 2 😭😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱. I was chocking on the same glizzy Donald Trump was eating (AYO) I thought,”why me?” Then I woke up at Jones bbq and foot massage and that’s how I became the 11th hokage"}},{"id":"6180113653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"Trump 2020","date":"2020-07-10T08:34:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"N:)P","review":"Trump 2020👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6180112543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤮","date":"2020-07-10T08:33:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"fjuvjieejo","review":"My name is not five weenies I am  Shoto  from U.A. and I want to be a hero.

But that’s okay. Because if he put this much time into making an app, surely he puts at least this much time into making America decent🥰When I opened this app I had to give my info😏 so of course I obliged😩. AND he asked me to vote for him. So of course after I was done working my 20 hours for the day(love our taxes😍😚) in the middle of desert 🌵 catching 🐍 snakes I would vote. I found lots of snakes 🐍. I love my job🥵, I personally bring them to the president 🍊 so they can be his friends👵🏻They are all albinos and they are called “Karen’s” they are so common 👴🏻and fun to find🤯🦎. All was well until…A SNAKE BIT ME 🦷 I was poisoned🦠so I quickly went to the hospital🏥 BUT apparently I couldn’t afford it 📈💰our dear president left me to pay for something that wasn’t my fault⁉️my heart was racing 🏃🏻\u200D♀️ 🗯 because of sadness🤧😱☹️and because I was dying😷 ⚰️ If only I didn’t have to pay for my own health😵\nDon’t download unless you wanna die!"}},{"id":"6180111006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ACAB","date":"2020-07-10T08:33:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"w0lfd0gs","review":"#dumptrump #BLM #PRIDE #abolishthepolice #themannywillnotbetelevised #Biden2020 #Genz #trumpisracist #andhomophobic #andsexist #andshouldbearegisteredsexoffender #trumpbehindbars2020"}}]}
