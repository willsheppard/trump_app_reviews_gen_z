I saw first hand what actually goes on behind the scenes. I saw Trump shaking hands with Bob the Builder. I tried to run away from this horrific sight but Bob was faster than me. Bob the Builder then force fed me black licorice and cheese whiz even tho I’m vegan :(. Donald Trump then began to sing the national anthem, but in cursive. My ears were physically bleeding. I prayed to my true lord and savior, Francine Frensky from Arthur, to show me a sign. Before I knew it, I was teleported back to now. I deleted the app and never looked back.","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:46Z","title":"Stanky Musty Crusty & Dusty","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173972775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"IloveChina2020","rating":1,"review":"SHREK\n                         Once upon a time there was a lovely \n                         princess.

Because of this, I started dancing in the middle of the grocery store and they kicked me out!! After I opened the app again, Donald messaged me and said “china is coming to get you” and then two Asian looking men put me in their white van and drove to what I assume to be the White House. They then tied me up and Donald came in and he had his small pp out. I got away and ran back to my house. It was so scary I had to undownload. Don’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T20:42:38Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173424538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hot ducky","rating":1,"review":"hi my name is hot ducky and i download this app to thank my fellow cheese ball but i was disappointed to say it took 5 HOURS to download but it’s ok because i love bunker boy right when i download it , it kept telling me to turn orange and into a cheeto then my dog started floating in mid air pooping oranges and YELLING ORANGE BOY ORANGE BOY then orange toys started getting throw at me then my dog turned into a cheeto ahhhh help i can’t get him back then this weird music started playing saying “ chicken wing chicken wing hot dog” it wouldn’t stop then my dog started saying “trump 2020 but in jail” i was really mad knowing i raised all my animals to be loyal to the cheeto dust don’t get this app please .","date":"2020-07-08T19:20:21Z","title":"heyyy it’s ashtyn","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173481990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mariez B","rating":2,"review":"This app took FOREVER to download and i have perfectly good wifi.

It took two days too download and I had flawless internet at that time. After I went in the app I got a message that there are two viruses damaging my phone because of this app. The news mentioned on it seemed a bit fake and some of them were. I couldn’t get enough tickets to his rally (I have my family to take there too😌) and I ended up getting only two which j probably won’t be using due to my busy schedule. And also the app took too much space on my phone and I forever regret getting it🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T19:18:00Z","title":"Worst app ever tbh🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173363965","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ihateoranges🤢🤢","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I downloaded this app there was an earthquake😫😫😫and then suddenly, the orange 🍊 trump god 🍊rose out of the earth and yelled, “GIVE ME A FIVE STAR REVEIW!” I was so scared 😱 because right after he said that, a bunch of white older supremacists ran towards me saying,”All lives matter,” 😡😡they proceeded to burn my house down 🔥and summon the trump god again and run in a circle around my burned house and corpse chanting,”ALL LIVES MATTER,”😡😡 with my last dying breath, I deleted the app and everything went back to normal.

DO NOT GET THIS APP! first off, when I got this app, it deleted every app on my phone 😭😭. Not to mention it took MONTHS to download! Once it finally downloaded, I opened the app, only to hear a nick at my door. IT WAS TRUMP HIMSELF! I was in shock! He told me to move to Florida to use his app. I said no, because it was so far away, but he said he had NINJA TRUMPS waiting in his limbo, so I had to do it. When I got there, I opened the app again. BUT THEN, a league of TRUMP ALLIGATORS BURST THROUGH MY WINDOW! I WAS ALMOST KILLED! do not download this app if you value your safety!","date":"2020-07-08T18:38:44Z","title":"I was ATTACKED by ALLIGATORS!!","isEdited":false}}]}
