What if they call me to help bust Manafort, Stone or Parnas out of jail while I am driving. That’s too much patriotism for me. I might get distracted and accidentally run over some protesters. Even if Donald pardoned me, it would still be inconvenient.","title":"Asked for too much permission","userName":"Pinball Enthusiast","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:22:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178282445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yes I am here from that thing you all saw on your for you page but also, I personally dislike Donald trump from all the stuff he’s done. He’s called Mexicans murders even though we have done nothing of the sort. And he wants to ban all Muslims.

Trump. I know the J stands for Genius. Then I realized I couldn’t speak to him personally. It was the worst day of my life😭. Now I’m not sure if I’ll ever get to see Mango Mussolini in person.

It did some in handy though!! My cat accidentally swallowed some of my cocaine, but using the app for 2 minutes caused her to throw it all up 🥰.

Why is there a Cheeto on the screen? I don’t want Cheetos, I want pizza. Anyways, I tried to order my food but it never came. I would give this zero stars if I could.
