And let me preface my review with this - I am NOT one of those DISGUSTING, ARRONGANT, ENTITLED LIBTARDS!! This is a genuine review and a plea to make this app as great and prosperous as Trump’s America, land of the FREE and home of the BRAVE! This app has some serious flaws that need to be addressed:\n\n1) While for the most part this app is very polished, I think there could be some interfacing touch-ups that would elevate this app to a higher standard of quality than it’s already at. \n\n2) The Trump reward system is terribly flawed - I mean $1=10 points?? SERIOUSLY??I understand that Trump needs to finance his campaign, But this is the way to do it? In order to get a $25 discount on the store, I’d need to spend $500 in campaign donations. And why is sharing and signing someone up worth 100 points? What makes sharing the app to 50 people equal value to $500 in donations to receive the LOWEST item? I beg of you, glorious President Trump and whomever may come across this review... PLEASE re-evaluate your donation and publicity strategy.\n\n3) The final, Miss important critique of this at - it’s nothing like the Jeremy Renner app. As an avid avengers fan and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye😏) Super-fan, I fell in LOVE with his personal social media app, focused solely on that man himself. It’s great and the reward system is AMAZING.  Being from upstate NY myself, I can tell you there are two things we take VERY seriously - Jeremey Renner and Trump2020🇱🇷!! Knowing how good the Jeremy Renner app is, I could’ve only hoped this would be even better. Unfortunately, it is not... where is all the Trump? There’s several other members on the app, and I KNOW we all want one man - DONALD J. TRUMP! (And Ivanka too 😏) Alas, while I understand the need to educate the general public on all things Trump, there is simply too many people on this app. If Jeremy Renner has taught us anything, it’s that we need ONE MAN WITH A PLAN🇺🇸!!\n\nIn conclusion, TRUMP 2020🇲🇾!!\n\n#Trump2020 #Pence2024 #Pence2028 #BetsyDeVos2032 #EricTrump2036 #EricTrump2040 #TrumpJr2044 #TrumpJr2048 #JaredKushner2052 #JaredKushner2056 #IvankaTrump2060 #IvankaTrump2064 #BarronTrump2068 #BarronTrump2072 #TrumpForever🇺🇸 #NoJoeShmoeBiden"}},{"id":"6178498674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"imworkinbih","title":"DONTGETTHISAPP","date":"2020-07-09T22:43:36Z","review":"worst purchase i ever made"}}]}
