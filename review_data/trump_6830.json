If ur looking to throw up this app is definitely for u but if not I DO NOT recommend at all. Not to mention the Oompa Loompas he sent to capture me. Well overall this app is totally and complete and utterly horrible. And he’s making me give it one star for shame I say for shame.🤡🤡","date":"2020-07-09T15:34:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"someonebutnotme1234","title":"THIS APP IS TERRIFYINGLY SCARY 👹🙉"}},{"id":"6177159693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app with the intention of learning more about the Trump 2020 campaign goals. After waiting 9 days, the app finally downloaded onto my phone. The design is horrible and looks like it was made by a child. It’s hard to navigate and the information it provides is FALSE NEWS. I also checked to see where this app was made and it was made by Chinese developers!!!! Trump has China spies stealing our information!!!!! In conclusion I will be deleting this app and voting for someone who puts AMERICA FIRST. Biden 2020!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:28:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Zen Morrison","title":"Worst app in the history of apps"}},{"id":"6177095858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This man is a terrible person. He is trying to take away something that has helped us all through out something he inflamed. Then this man has terrible plans for America. Instead of fixing America ,he is breaking it down. Also this terrible human admitted to not caring about the wellbeing of everyone in the USA (including you White supremacists🙃) in conclusion taking down this app is what helps take down this man. If we take down trump we can save the “United” States. \n\n \n          Sincerely\n                      - a 12 year old girl that loves tiktok🥰","date":"2020-07-09T15:10:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"im dat bish ...@they.luvkellis","title":"Idk"}},{"id":"6177078408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is one of the worst organized, most chaotic platforms that I’ve used. Apart from being visually dissatisfying, the app is incredibly difficult to use, provides little to no direction to help the user use it, and is generally just really bad. It’s upsetting to see that Apple allows such a poor quality app to even be available on the App Store, assuming that they want the best quality for their users. Incredibly chaotic, poorly designed, and horrendously executed. If I could give 0 stars, I would without question.","date":"2020-07-09T15:05:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"JP1296","title":"A mess"}},{"id":"6176999767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I am absolutely such an Republican 🇺🇸. But this app is most definitely actual poo. 🙈🙉 This makes my bae Donald Trump look so good,  because how could he not look good, but why can’t I get a free FaceTime?! I just want to smooch 😘 my lover through the screen 📺! I signed his birthday card and gave him my number, but he still hasn’t called! 🧑🏻\u200D🦲I just want to know if bae is cheating on me ! 🛸 When I first opened the app I saw Hillary hitman! 😰 ruh-roh! As a true conservative woman I cannot support this app in any way, shape, or form! 🥵 But if Donald juicy Trump sees this, call me babe! 😘😘😘🙈🙉","date":"2020-07-09T14:44:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"h̸o̸t̸d̸o̸g̸l̸a̸d̸y̸","title":"Absolutely Putrid"}},{"id":"6176967186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely POINTLESS!! There are no benefits nor reasons why you would need to download it. I wanted to be educated on what Trump wanted to do to help America, but instead I was attacked with “Keep America Great!” and “sign up for this campaign.” Do you really think America is “great” right now, Donald? Now that I’ve been educate using different, UNBIASED platforms, I’ve decided you will not have my vote in the 2020 election. I also deleted this app for fear of virus or it hurting my phone, as said in other comments.

I also heard that he is trying to make Tik Tok the most popular app that is helping millions of people to earn money he is trying to make it illegal. Like what what are people supposed to do to earn money some people need that and that’s why I’m not giving up without a fight he is going down. Gen Z ain’t going down today or ever so you better start packing .

I guess I shouldn’t be surprised after Trumps affiliation with Cambridge analytica during the 2016 election, but my information is not for sale! 😤 trying to shut down TikTok when they’re doing the same thing. It’s sad really 😕 also, the app crashes my phone so its constantly restarting. I can’t/couldn’t open any other apps until I deleted this one. Guess I’ll have to vote for Joe Biden ✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:06:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Faith Murrey","title":"Steals your information"}},{"id":"6176807133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is, the worst app I have ever used...they are PURE SCAMMERS! I signed up hoping to support my president, but low and behold, I give my number and BOOM a bunch- and when I say a bunch I mean A LOT!- of automated messages saying I’ve been hacked and now I’m being sacrificed to blood ORPHANS?!?!! \n\nLike what does that even MEAN?!?!! Anyways, it gets worse, waaaaaaay worse. I- for some reason- decide to follow the provided links to said blood orphan sacrifice and it sends me to a page in Latin and I’m compelled to read it. \n\nSo, I chant the foreign words and my vision went blurry. \n\nI can’t remember much, but it was bit and flashes of obscure demonic figures and grotesque things....it was quite frankly terrifying. \n\nWhen I came to, my house was a shattered mess and blood was everywhere. But it wasn’t my own....\n\nSo! I do NOT recommend this app for ANY presidential relations. PLEASE SEEK ANOTHER CANIDATE!!\n\nThank you 💜","date":"2020-07-09T13:53:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"honeynutkendios","title":"Atrocious"}},{"id":"6176761072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I truly hate this app with all of my soul. I downloaded it because I wanted to connect with the Mr. President in the best way! But I’m learning more of the fact that he is a god awful person who shouldn’t be in power and just did it to inflate his ego. I would never recommend downloading this app to anyone. I have learned he cannot connect with a single human because he is in-fact not human, rather a humongous centipede forced into a skin who enjoys preying on women and children and only like to spend time with other weak minded beings. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-09T13:41:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"✌🏼😋","title":"Worst app of all time."}}]}
