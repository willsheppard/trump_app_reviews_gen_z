Story very obviously lacks development, and there’s little to no character customization. Gameplay is not engaging at all, like playing a point and click. Would play Halo instead.","userName":"MellieJellie73","isEdited":false,"title":"✨lesbian blue haired liberal✨"}},{"id":"6177671867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:01:58Z","rating":1,"review":"I had just woken up from a coma and I wanted to see what has changed in the past 4 years in terms of president.
