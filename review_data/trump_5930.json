THEN one night the app gave my iPad hecka notifications, I don’t even have them on, I was tired and just turned them off. When I woke up the next day i saw that my iPad had TURNED INTO A FULL ON ROBOTIC ROBOT and held my family HOSTAGE. When I saw the horrific sight I ran to get a bucket of water. The robot then chased me screaming “TRUMP 2020” and “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” then drop kicked me, I’m fine btw. Fortunately i got to the water and killed it. NOW I HAVE TO GET A NEW IPAD AND MY FAMILY AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. I will never ever use anything that puffy cheeto makes again.","title":"horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136427848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump2020🧚\u200D♂️🌸✨🧚🏼💞🦋🌈","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T15:47:12Z","review":"I was so excited to get this app and support my favorite president, Donald Trump, in any way possible. After opening the app, I was horribly surprised with how bad the app is! There are so many glitches in the design and it is so hard to navigate through... Not to mention my phone started acting all crazy after the first time I opened the app, the screen was moving without me even touching it! I think the app somehow installed a terrible virus on it 😭. If I could give this app a 0 star rating I would, please do not get this app!\n-A concerned trump supporter 🦋✨💫🌸🧚🏼💞","title":"I can’t believe it! 😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136105797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🗞🗄📅📈","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T14:11:36Z","review":"I get the app thinking that I can help out my lovely president trump, but I was wrong SOOO wrong. The app asked for my email which I was okay with, however it asked for my phone number which then started to text me all kind of things which I was NOT okay with. Then it asked for my card number!! Excuse me?! I’m not going down that path again, last time I gave an app my card information for I got scammed AND they took my money. I love trump with all my life but I don’t know if he is in control of this app and not a random hacker. Trump if you see this, I love you❤️TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💙🤍❤️","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134527026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dolan twins 🖤~ railey","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T05:10:32Z","review":"i immediately opened the app and saw such a horrific picture that no joke i thought i was gonna have a heart attack, take that horrid man off the front or make him get plastic surgery bc his face scares me!! 💖🧚💅ALSO i opened it and the first thing i was asked for was my phone number? hmm where’s the manners, i would have appreciated for the app to have asked how my day was or SOMETHING!! extremely disgusted, disappointed, horrified, scared, scarred, nauseous, and i think i feel a migraine coming on from the thought of someone else having this terrible terrible app on their phones!! 😌👋🧚💖","title":"terrible app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134441028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"zakzaki","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T04:35:49Z","review":"I am a suburban mother of 2 beautiful children, Amy and Jackson. We live in a comfortable neighborhood in southern Kentucky 🤠 and I’d like to vote for Trump 🇺🇸 in this presidential campaign this year. I decided to download this app in support of our wonderful president, but it only brought disappointment 😡I received notification after notification and my phone blew up even more than my 2 children combined! Mind you they are both teens. This may influence my decision of voting for President Trump 😳 and i’m sure that i’ll be voting democratically 😣 now. It’s not you Trump, it’s the app and sadly the creator.","title":"Horrible Space of an App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134212939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cheryl Dcosta","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T02:59:05Z","review":"So I downloaded the app right? But like it just wouldn’t work!! It kept on crashing and then when It finally stopped and I was able to put my phone number, I had calls from other countries! In one of them I picked up and it was an Indian tech company saying I need to pay my taxes! So of course me, being the true republican that I am, I paid! But now my back card isn’t working anymore. Truly think downloading it was a mistake. I guess I’ll just have to text the number and support my dear president through that. What a sad life 😭","title":"Technical problems","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6124083043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gillian Wright","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-26T12:57:58Z","review":"This app is very bad. Terrible. I wanted to give it a chance because I considered voting trump at one time or another and it solidified that it was a terrible, TERRIBLE mistake. Like others said, I gave my phone number and it asked for my credit card info as if it cost money but I opted out of that option. After giving my phone number I’ve had foreign numbers call me and tell me that my credit card was experienced fraud and I needed to provide my information for them to fix it. All around BAD! Don’t vote Trump. He can’t even run a good app let alone a country.","title":"So so so bad","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6119031843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"SAMMT5SOS","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-25T06:15:13Z","review":"Getting this app was supposed to bring me Extreme joy, I truly wanted to show how our Noble president can be!

Then, I decided to make another hot pocket and that on exploded in the oven. Then, I decided that I don’t like hot pockets and I was so mad that I had to move because of the damage of the hot pockets in my apartment and I threw my toddler out the 4th story window and then I cheated on my wife! Don’t get this app, it makes you move houses, not like hot pockets, cheat on your wife that you didn’t know you had, and yet your toddler!","title":"💞✨🧚\u200D♀️One Star🧚\u200D♀️✨💞😌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177780404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"madi lock","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:34:52Z","review":"i am absolutely appalled by how ugly and deformed my 3 kids are after mr. trump showed up with oompa loompas at my door. i was honored to get a visit from the president at first but that quickly changed when the horde of creatures raided my home and flew away with them. i waited all day for them to return because i figured the president would never harm my children and maybe they had been chosen to be great again. they ended up being dropped through my roof a month and a half later with abnormalities and severe autism. all this started because i downloaded the app.","title":"TRUMP TURNS CHILDREN INTO ELVES","isEdited":false}}]}
