Instead my phone crashed and said that the app was tracking my location, next week after the PRESIDENT came to my house along with the secret service, they then put and handful of roaches termites and a bomb into my house, then bunker boy walked away saying “TRUMP 2020” and proceeded to do it to the rest of the people in my town, he did my house first and let the rest of his guards do the dirty work. I went to get my mother who was in her room after the attack, but he RAN back into my house and curb stomped her the punched me in the face. His guards then proceeded to get my mother to death along with throwing her deceased body in my front yard\n\nAll this because I downloaded that app. My town now hates me and kicked me out(I’m white btw) I now live in a hotel and am writing this to make sure that everyone knows this app isn’t safe\nAlso!!!\n    Screw trump;)🙅🏻\u200D♀️╭∩╮(ಠ_ಠ)╭∩╮"}},{"id":"6172708135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app","userName":"brbddjdbfjdndh","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:34:20Z","review":"I went on this app to find a reason to vote for this Cheeto looking piece of trash and I couldn’t find one reason also this app has ruined and caused glitches in my phone I find this app awful rate: -10000000000/10 I do not recommend using this if you are trying to find a tender date 😤"}},{"id":"6172706522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"add me on sc:) itz_dezzzy","userName":"dezireehester","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:33:53Z","review":"just a disgusting human being:)💕"}},{"id":"6172706253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MY FAMILY CAT ALMOST DIED OF THE 🟠","userName":"Podcaster Hayley💍","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:33:48Z","review":"I was just trynna see how this app works and then all of a sudden this big orange dude came on the screen I was terrified I asked my mom “who is this dude?” She said “idk that’s not my president” we were both really confused and horribly scarred for life! My cat ran over because of the whole thing and when she looked on the screen she fell of the couch it gave her nightmares every night since then it’s really mean you guys shouldn’t put a pop scare on this because my cat fell and she lost another life 😢 also the night after I got a knock on the door 🚪 it was 2 guys the we’re trying to kidnap me! The said If I liked trumpet and I said no and they got mad 😡 and took me luckily I took 3 years in jujitsu and smashed they skulls on their kidnapping vans Trump hires kidnappers to take people and force them to like him we need to stop this! Also he sexually assaulted many little girls and his daughter he paid the parents money to keep them quiet and he said to his daughter is it bad that I feel more sexually attracted to my daughter more than my own wife? THATS DISGUSTING. I know trumps just trying to do his job or whatever I just don’t think he makes a really good president.
