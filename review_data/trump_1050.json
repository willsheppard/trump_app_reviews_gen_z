It takes 20 GB to download it takes up to much storage. Aside from that, the app itself is very slow in processing. I am awfully disgusted. As soon as you open the app it asks for your address so they can be able to send officers to your house. THIS IS NOT OK! I can’t believe the horribleness of this app! Other from the asking of the address the app also starts playing horrible music which cause my little sister to be deaf on both ears. I cannot explain what this app has done to my family but it has forced us to change for the worst. This app was also threatening my family that if we didn’t change for the worst they would send officers to kill us. A human being should NOT have to deal with being scared just because of an app. I would like to write more on how terrible this app is but there is not enough space, overall don’t download this app AND APPLE PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF THE APPLE PLAY STORE!"}},{"id":"6173801162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hi my name is here","date":"2020-07-08T21:33:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I ALMOST DIED","review":"i downloaded the app and it took a full month to download! i have the best wifi’s there is. when i finally was able to open the app there was a spell that cursed me. all of a sudden there was killer cheetos chanting “support the orange🍊god!!” it was so scary✨ then all of a sudden these snakes put the oranges face all over my house. after they were done with that they proceeded to tie me up. them doing this forced me to look at the 🍊face. they would feed me his poopie water👄 then they tried to burn me but i finally fought back. once i fought all of them i realized there was no food in the house. i went on a 100 mile walk just to get food for my starving family. once i got back there was the 🍊god himself. he was chanting “if you do not vote me i must kill you” he then proceeded to burn down my house. luckily my family was outside so we got into the 🍊 gods tesla and drove 1,000 miles away. i do not recommend this app if you want to keep your life✨🦋👑🥰"}},{"id":"6173552247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🤯🤬👍👧😡😻😼","date":"2020-07-08T20:03:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app made my day😘💕✨worse🧚🏼\u200D♀️💐❤️","review":"first of all, let me start off by saying i got this app to learn more about our racist,sexist,homophobic president😁😁😁✨🔮🧚🏽\u200D♀️ i wanted to see what he was up to and get educated in hopes to understand his views and why i should vote for him😼👍the app took 5 months to download which is very disappointing the amount of time you have to wait for it😾👺💩as soon as i downloaded the app then opened it trumps nudes were right there on my screen🙀🙀😿🤕🤒😷how disgusting and unprofessional of him👎🏼🧠👧then the app asked me for my social security number and credit card number that is not okay🗣👮🏻as i went further into the app i clicked “next” and my phone started speaking some weird rituals👩\u200D🏫🙇\u200D♂️🕺 and then it summoned satan and he ate all my snacks and killed my pet fish🐠🧑\u200D🦯👬🧦then he proceeded to mess up my house and rob me of all my money then kicked me out and left me homeless,broke,and alone lm the streets so i’ve been sleeping in a box for the past 10 days😡🤬🤯🤲🏼 thanks a lot donald dumb trumpet 😿😿👩\u200D🦲🙅🏽 this app made all my hair fall out and gave me alopecia👩\u200D🦲🧑🏼\u200D🦲👨\u200D🦲 so to everyone thinking this is a good app, i say you reconsider and re-evaluate before you get this app👚🦈🌛this app ruined my life🌧💨🥩anyways my personal message for our lovely orange cheeto president : i hate you thanks for ruining america and doing it flawlessly 😽😻😼"}},{"id":"6173320901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Brook12378","date":"2020-07-08T18:44:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m honestly disgusted","review":"I’m normally not one to write reviews... I don’t wan to be seen as a karen. But with the app I have to. First off it took forever to download in WiFi (I think 2 hours to be exact). That’s just too long for me to wait to get my news. By then those snowflakes will have taken over the world!! Anyways once it was downloaded it glitches out and closed the app Everytime I opened it. I figured that the issue would resolve itself so I let it just sit there while I occupied myself with other tasks such as preaching ALL LIVES MATTER to my grandchildren (that generation z is gonna be the death of us smart folk let me tell y’all) when I went back on my phone I noticed MY BATTERY WAS DRAINED!!! HOW could a single app that’s not even being used drain my battery like that?!? 0/10 recommend- to all my fellow conservatives I urge you to not download this app, honestly I think it might have hacked my whole device. I am scared for my life."}},{"id":"6173189929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gabby SJP","date":"2020-07-08T18:01:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Useless","review":"This app it useless there is no point in having this app when all the president does is make more problems. The app is telling us about “good things” Donald Trump is doing for our country and  this app just shows us the unnecessary things that are being done for our country. Like building a wall what was the point, to keep people living in Spanish speaking countries from being free? Honestly, this app does nothing for me, except show me all the time what bad things are happening to our country. Many people say their is no reason not to be a Trump supporter, But to me and probably many other people in the United States their are multiple reasons why we aren’t supporters. So this app is unnecessary, that i know of Trump is the only president with an app. But, what happens if he doesn't get re elected in 2020 this app will be a waste. So no matter what anybody says to me i will forever believe this app is useless and unnecessary. Thank you for reading."}},{"id":"6172814514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"iamnotanorangelovingtraitor","date":"2020-07-08T16:04:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This man tore apart my family 😫","review":"My life since trump began his reign *cough cough* sorry presidency, has sucked. Trump has killed my will to live many a time and I commend him on this effort solely seeing as how he did it so well. My mother has disowned me for accidentally following him on twitter. My father has drop kicked my phone into a lake for talking about how he’s made me hate life. Now onto how this app contributed. Yesterday morning I stumbled across this app. I wanted to see trumps anger level rise seeing as how I would be the gap that turned his 9 downloads into 10. My brother screamed like he saw a ghost. He stomped into my room and started yelling at me in slomo. “YoU oRaNgE lOvInG tRaItOr!!!” My bones were clacking in fear. He ran across my room and palm punched me in the throat. As I struggled for air my little sister came in and proceeded to shoot me repeatedly with nerf bullets. Then my cat ran in and clawed my toes to shreds. I am now writing this review from my bunker in Iowa. DO NOT BUY THIS APP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR FAMILY!!!"}},{"id":"6172630528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"puppylover132","date":"2020-07-08T15:12:29Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT USE","review":"i got this app and it took weeks to download. but once i got on the app it was making weird sounds then it hacked into my account and purchased 4.20 gallons of fake tanner and 69 giant slugs and i am deathly afraid of slugs. the slugs were sent to my house they killed my dog and then tried to eat my baby cousin!! they then ran around my house with my dead dog .i had to use the 4.20 gallons of fake tanner to \nblind them before they ate my cousin you know. however after all that we got knock at the door and when we opened it , it was a whole gang of giant birds coming from Trump2020 campaign. they had 69 gallons of tanner that the president uses him self and were spraying it at us and flying all over the place and found my turtle and took him and i never seen him again😢. my whole family is orange now because of those birds from the app. this hurt me mentally and me and my family is scarred for life. we will never fully recover from this traumatic incident."}},{"id":"6172597099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jeanette27","date":"2020-07-08T15:03:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Dear trump supporters","review":"Some people are too blind to see the true person that President Trump is. And it’s honestly scary that everything is happening the way it is. \nEverything with the protest it’s just horrible. We should defund police officers. I have seen so many videos where there’s these peaceful protest and the police officers just attacked them for no reason. There is this woman she was giving flowers out during the protest one of the police officers I guess saw that as a threat and put her in handcuffs. Honestly do you guys not see what’s wrong here. We should work together to overthrow a president because he’s just not a good one, he is racist. Actually really disappointed in the people that are not helping in the protests the Black Lives Matter. It’s disgusting to see people against the Black Lives Matter protest. We should all be equal. we’re not any different than others. Sure I may be 15 years old but at least I know what’s right or wrong."}},{"id":"6172406969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tictok queen","date":"2020-07-08T14:10:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"✨🍊𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒✨🍊aka✨𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑜 𝑃𝑢𝑓𝑓 ✨","review":"When I went to sign in it glitches out the whole app and then I re download it and it says someone is watching me through the app and now have my e-mail and password and phone number and ✨𝑀𝑟.𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑜✨this app is rlly bad and then when my cousin Tried to download it did the same thing but it turned her whole phone off and now have a virus so thank you u broke my cousin phone. ✨𝑀𝑟.𝐶ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑜✨🍊𝑂𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒✨🍊and then I did on my iPad and it took 4hrs to download they asked me for my IP address, and WiFi password when I pushed the skip button ⏭ it sent me back to the sign in screen then I turned my off and turn it back on and it glitched back off 😡and my grandma downloaded and it didn’t let her sign in at all her phone now glitches out every time she opens the app 🤬and I see a pink & purple light flashing into my camera idk what that means but I believe that my camera is broken 🤬✨🍊.............\n\n💫✨✨✨✨Free Barron ✨✨✨✨💫"}}]}
