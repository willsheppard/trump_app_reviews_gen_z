I have used this app many times and it does not work. And don’t even get me started about the glitches. When I downloaded this app my phone went bazurk, I had to delete it right after.

So I was drawing and then the girl from the ring (the horror movie) appeared on front of me, then after a few days a dog came to my house saying that he was going to steal my alcohol markers and he was going to wrinkle my art. I will not recommend this app at all, If I could I will give it 0 stars.

Then the voices started becoming louder, demanding even, telling me that I need to drink Clorox to prevent the rona.","isEdited":false,"title":"Shocked but not surprised","userName":"trumpcansuckmyfartswithastraw","date":"2020-07-09T04:28:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175002904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app five days ago and ever since then my family and I have only known fear. We keep seeing shadows out of the corner of our eyes. Strange noises keep us up at night.
