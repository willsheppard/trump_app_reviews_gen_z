As soon as it downloaded I had a virus and I was like, oh no, what are we gon do now. Anyways my dog came in my room, did eight summer salts, a 360 spin, and then ate my chocolate. Yeah he’s dead now. I then went into epileptic shock, then my power went out, and then my hairline became receding. My house also got struck by lightning. I saw 890 bolts of power per second for 15 seconds straight. I am now recovering from the following actions. Thank you for your time.","date":"2020-07-08T17:02:35Z","userName":"CinnamonToastie🧚🏽","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172864996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst app ever","review":"When I downloaded this app it give me this weird glitch on my phone I had to delete it he’s literally the worst president ever it’s all his fault why my parents can’t come back to the US if they go to Mexico like we never did anything to him he is literally the worst person ever I don’t know why people like him he literally looks like an orange he’s useless nobody likes him this is why I hate this app and he’s deleting TikTok which I’m really mad about that’s why I’m not giving up Obama 2020","date":"2020-07-08T16:19:35Z","userName":"unicorni10","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172840646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"awful.","review":"So i downloaded this app just to see if like this was an actual thing or just a complete joke, and well i should’ve known, it was a COMPLETE joke. it glitches my phone so bad, the content is horrendous. legit they have the worst stuff on here, i don’t know why people would even decide to download this app. i mean come on, every single app on the app store is better than this one. if it was up to me, i would completely get rid of this app for good, so no one ever has to suffer again.","date":"2020-07-08T16:12:18Z","userName":"they only want your cash.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172819837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Non appropriate content","review":"I was witnessing hate from a lot of racist republicans who always tormented me with “Trump 2020” I though they were some type of street gang so I decided to download their leader’s app (Trump). After ten minutes I had to go walk my fish, but on my way back I saw this horrible orange creature. It made my cat’s eyes bleed. This app should’ve at least had a warning. It’s not very human friendly to show animals like that would have obviously went through a torture camp, and then the spray paint it organge.

I got this app so I could know what is in the world around me. Let me just say before I got this app my phone worked perfectly and now it works like crap. Not to mention this app is just taking up storage it won’t let me even enter it save your self the time and turn around. And if your thinking oh maybe it’ll work I’ve got the time write a review similar to mine bc doubt that everyone will see this.

All the information and news on it is heavily one sided and incorrect which can be shows with a basic google search and some common sense. Trump is basically trying to turn us into a tyrannical and corrupted country. I've never seen a more nationalist app, but I assume that those that still believe he's great won't know what nationalist means. Either way, as a republican, this app is almost as bad as communism and Trump will be the one to throw this country into communism.","date":"2020-07-08T14:34:04Z","userName":"hshrvbfjc","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
