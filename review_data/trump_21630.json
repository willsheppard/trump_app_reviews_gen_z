Would give it zero stars if I could. This is a security threat and should really be banned from all American phones. The manager of this app is not to be trusted, he has a history of many crimes and mistakes.","rating":1,"title":"Awful App","date":"2020-07-09T07:42:14Z","userName":"Amy*P","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175585023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I decided to get this app because I am a conservative trump loving straight cis white male, yeehaw, but when i got on the app there were a bunch of prolife and democratic subliminal messages!!!! fellow conservatives, DO NOT get this app unless you plan to be brainwashed by the liberals!!!

All I wanted was to get an app for our totally non-homophobic, non-racist, non-transphobic, and non-xenophobic president.  To say the least, it was disappointing.  But Iâ€™m all seriousness I really hate Donald Trump and I donâ€™t understand why he needs an app.  Like heâ€™s the president.  Why do you need an app for your merch bruh.  Be making no sense.","rating":1,"title":"Awful!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:36Z","userName":"spicy._.cactuss","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175429134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took so much space on my phone and laggeddd it so much. When I opened the app it hacked it!! This app is definitely a scam and just a way to hack into peopleâ€™s stuff.

All I wanted was to follow up on the activities of the orange gorilla in the White House, but this app is nothing but glitch after glitch.  I mean, thereâ€™s no other explanation for praising such a degenerate other than this app being buggy and useless. Almost as offensive as the pathetic excuse we have for a president.","rating":1,"title":"Absolute Garbage","date":"2020-07-09T06:15:09Z","userName":"Orange One","isEdited":false}}]}
