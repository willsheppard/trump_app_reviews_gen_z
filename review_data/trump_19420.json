Immediately after it downloaded it took up way to much space and it even wanted to build A WALL between my normal apps and I instantly knew this could lead to a virus.

From haunting images of Mr. Trump that will torment you in only your worst nightmares to words encouraging his re-election. This is outrageous and should be taken down immediately. It is guaranteed to give your phone a virus as well as your eyes and brain.","date":"2020-07-09T02:54:18Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Joanna C.

They found my house and filled it with all their boogers and sewage, so I had to use my jedi powers to try and stop the terrible things they’ve been doing to my neighborhood.
