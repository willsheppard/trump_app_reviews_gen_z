(I think Donald Trump stole my apps!) I contacted support but the person was speaking some unknown language (Russian maybe?) and I couldn’t understand what was going on! Tried to delete the app but found that it had quite literally duplicated and there were hundreds on my device! Trump apps have flooded my phone and notifications are too much! I still do not know how to have these applications removed from my phone but if I do not figure it out I will have to smash my device with a hammer to silence it. What’s even worse is what it has done to my family! The app somehow sent word to a small clan of villagers in a country (of which I do not know for sure, perhaps Russia?) which have come to my home to harass me for attempting to delete the app!!! These villagers wear various trump merchandise and exclusively use trump products (his straws, they work on his trump puzzle and coloring books during their downtime, etc) to harangue me! They have placed a trump flag in my yard and stolen my cat. My cat has been gone for several days now, and considering their vehicle looks quite disappointing I do not want to know where Mr. Snuffles is now. Not to mention the constant mariachi music being played in my yard as a brainwashing technique to prove he is not racist. Lastly, Melania personally visited my home to request that I keep the app. I said no thank you and she immediately took my first born child and ran away. She didn’t even use the front door, she jumped through my window and the last I saw was her falling through the Bushes. Unfortunately George Bush is still in my yard and Melania hasn’t gotten up yet. Case in point: do not get this app if you want to keep your children!!!"}},{"id":"6175706968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:24:09Z","userName":"trumps non existint hairline","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!!!","review":"This app was so racist I wouldn’t recommend to anyone 😡"}},{"id":"6175679947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:15:02Z","userName":"💙pll","rating":1,"title":"I CAN’T WITH THIS APP","review":"Nothing works, almost as if it was centered around a piece of trash.
