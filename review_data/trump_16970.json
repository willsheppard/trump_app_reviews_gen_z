However, the app never reminded me that I needed to walk my pet butterfly. She’s really pretty and green. After that, I had to go swimming with her, and then teach her numbers like oppressed. 1 ⭐️ would not recommend because it did not notify me and I needed to cancel. This happened to many of my other friends.","userName":"princessunicornEm","date":"2020-07-09T22:58:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178410168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"STAY CLEAR OF THIS APP","review":"🥺 took an entire week to download this app 🤦🏻\u200D♀️ and once i finally opened it my phone overheated and would NOT turn back on. 😳had to buy a whole new phone. ✨📲 then i started getting really random phone calls from numerous numbers trying to ask my to redownload the app. 🙄🥴 i don’t think this is the best campaigning tactic. gonna vote for biden. 😤💜🥰","userName":"alynaaaaaaaa","date":"2020-07-09T22:08:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178430945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Good way to know where president is campaigning","review":"Want to know when/where Trump is going to be near my town so that I can go and see him in person","userName":"littlesundevil","date":"2020-07-09T22:17:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":5}},{"id":"6178388954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"worst app ever!! it was created by china to steal all my personal information!! it’s such a danger to society! some big cheeto puff runs it😳😳! cheeto puff rly tried it! let’s hope he never said does it agian🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨💕! the app stole all my information and killed my grandma! don’t buy!! falafel advertisement told me i could watch this great christan movie 365 days✨ but instead made me listen to a white supermisit! don’t get!!","userName":"abort shawn🧚🏻\u200D♂️💕✨","date":"2020-07-09T22:00:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
