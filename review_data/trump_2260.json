I’m not a fan of president 🍊here but I wanted to maybe sympathize with him, well that’s impossible I have no idea how you republicans do it he’s also getting rid of a social media platform because a couple of kids reserved seats at his rally and didn’t come he’s truly a grinch and doesn’t know how to run anything other than his mouth, he needs to get out of office right now. We already impeached him so shouldn’t he be out as of now? Might I also bring up the very recent BLM riots that he did nothing about? But no bunker boy doesn’t want to show that we only snapped because the police snapped first. Overall trump is a very problematic person and shouldn’t be in app programming, the app is very glitchy and doesn’t work well at all!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:14:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6172815052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jkjjjjjgghjh","review":"I downloaded the app to show support to the giant Cheeto man🧀 but upon opening the app my phone began to lag with pictures of Cheetos and carrots popping up everywhere on the screen I had no idea what to do then my phone started to transform into a wig that looked a lot like the hair on a pice of corn 🌾🌽. I had the sudden urge to put the wig on my head but then a strong wind 💨 came and blew half of it backwards. that’s when I knew I had to get it off but it started interlocking it’s self in my hair and my skin proceeded to turn orange 🍊 and I had to get it off. But before I could black cars pulled up outside and started shooting up my house with Cheeto guns😓 I had no choice but to cut the wig off with a pair of scissors ✂️ and now my Beautiful bleached blond Karen hair is all cut up.

And then a swarm of trump supporters started attacking me for no reason and not I have a robotic body mixed with a dragon Morale of the story don’t download the app because you will get taken away your phone will commitment not alive and trump supporters will attach you for no reason 🌸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:47:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Very terrible app😡"}},{"id":"6172588078","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kenzieheff","review":"my family and i were hanging out in our living room. my mom, who supports trump, decided to download the app. something went wrong so the app caused the phone to electrocute my mom and then disintegrated so we all stood there like :0. then my dad was like i know how to save her! this happened to his aunt a few years ago too. he said, “we need to go to the home of satan and collect a potion to turn her back but to get there we need to chant 3 times “NIALL FOR THE SHIMMY” so 3 times we changed niall for the shimmy and then all of the sudden started falling into the depths of hell! it was very hot... but anyways we had to search for satan then grabbed the potion the walked 18 miles up back to our house then we poured it on my mom and nothing even happened. overall horrible experience with the app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:00:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"caused a very dangerous trip😡"}},{"id":"6172517074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Appleuser1906","review":"This app is very disappointing, every one who downloads this app WAS hoping for reasons on why we should support you has our President, but you just proved on my we should’ve voted for Hillary. The app runs slow, and very little information that you can find from the news. So if anyone is reading this and thinking about downloading this DONT it’s a waste of your time. I’m guessing y’all had very high expectations from your president, but someone had to say it. This app should be taken off of the App Store because of all the ratings and bad reviews, so there is really no point. And I respect everyone who spoke their mind in the reviews (especially ones like mine). And another idiotic move this President has made, was putting hundreds at risk at his rally, who could have caught the virus.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:40:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"A disgrace"}},{"id":"6172102659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lisa.dangggg","review":"it’s ok you tried💞💝💖pls never try again👄🧚🏻✨ some people are naturally smart💕✨not you tho💖✨🧚🏻 harvard called💫💞✨they don’t want you tho 🌸✨🧚🏻 they say nobody’s perfect🧚\u200D♀️🌺💕and you definitely aren’t🦋✨🥵 you tried💗🦄💫but don’t ever try again🧚\u200D♂️💅🏻😍 never give up🥺💕✨but you’re the exception, pls do 🦋🌺🦄 there’s always room for improvement💕🧚\u200D♂️💫but it’s not in this room, get out 🙈✨👀 you did that !!🙈👑🦋pls don’t do it again💫💔🧚\u200D♂️ cute story🧚\u200D♂️☺️💕we don’t care❤️✨💃🏻 e stands for effort✨💞🧚\u200D♀️this time it stands for electric chair👑🦋🙈 you dropped this👑✨don’t pick it up🧚\u200D♂️☺️🦋 hope you sleep well☺️💕✨don’t wake up tho🦋🧚\u200D♀️💃🏻 omg this made my day☺️💞🌊worse🧚\u200D♀️🙈 you killed it😍✨🧚\u200D♂️now try the same thing on yourself💅🏻💞 your confidence is through the roof💖✨but this made me want to jump off mine🧚\u200D♂️❤️🙈","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:46:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTANG"}},{"id":"6177881707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BigPeePeeGang","review":"I thought I was going to see papa trump t-bag som democraticic fools but was disappointed to find out that he only what’s to t-bag on shreks bodacious booty. Had high hopes but in the end all I can feel is sad. Because he is the only thing that ever turned me 💡. Hope that in the future I can see trump happy again but right now he is just a fool that needs to be no scoped in war zone. He use to be the light I. My day but now he is the dark in the night like Batman. While Batman was a good movie trump is not. He is a bad movie like suicide squad. I am truly hurt to see the Democrats win but if it means I can see daddy trump happy again it will make it all better in the end. Hope you read this trump because I want you to see how much I love and hate you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:05:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Couldn’t bust my 🥜 to this app like I use to"}},{"id":"6177333699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rosa parks christian","review":"After I downloaded this app I had to wait about a week before I could actually use it. My phone began to go through several problems from shutting down and restarting g over and over again. It went from black screen to back on again. This happened for about 3 hours after the app finally downloaded. Once my phone kinda worked again I wanted to see what ✨orange✨ was planning on for his election and how is going to make up for all the wrong he has done. The way the app works just makes it impossible to find d things. It took me like 30 minutes just to finally be able to navigate it. If your looking into downloading this app I suggest you not do it because it causes a lot of phone problems and it just isn’t handy.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:18:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Uh-oh✨"}},{"id":"6177603809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idk??????😒🤔😏","review":"I was excited to finally stay up-to-date on the President’s latest news. My grandson helped me download this app and at first it was delightful. However, after a while the app constantly spams notifications. My phone is so slow and constantly glitching. I had never had a problem until I downloaded this app. The notifications go off all day and even in the middle of the night. My sleep has been disrupted. Even when I turn off the ringer bell my phone turns on and glitches and spams notifications. Sorry Mr. Trump, I don’t think I can stay on here any longer. I guess I’ll have to download the Twitter to stay up to date because this app is HORRIBLE! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! Save your SLEEP and your TIME! I HAVE NOT SLEPT IN SIX DAYS!!!!","rating":2,"date":"2020-07-09T17:40:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"REAL REVIEW"}},{"id":"6177313143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🤍✨ bethany","review":"it was a dark night.\nthe sun had set thirty minutes prior, but the remnants of the sun had long sense passed. i thought to myself, “i need to be updated on the presidency, it is my duty as an american citizen to know the important information of my republican president,” and so- i sat on my bed plastered in flowers and i downloaded his app. this... this was the first mistake of the night. you see, it was then- the power shut off. my heart began to beat faster. i couldn’t help but think.... “obama did this,” that’s when it happened....\n\nthis app is obama’s app, it is set up by the DEMOCRATS AND LEFT TO PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION!
