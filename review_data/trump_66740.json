Apps crashed and videos buffered even when connected to WiFi with a good service connection. When the app finally downloaded (6 hours later) I went into the app and was greeted by the face of our president. I filled out the information and it took over an hour for it to go through. When the app was actually downloaded no other app would work properly and often times crashed without warning. When scrolling through the news I thought it was poorly laid out with a cluttered design that made it clear little work has gone into it. I also thought your controls where oversimplified leading to less options. I understand the reason for this of course as it is targeted at a generally less educated group of people but I would have still liked more control on what I could do within the app. This news app is heavily biased in the president’s favor with a clear disregard for facts and clear writing. There where many grammatical errors as well as misrepresented statistics. When fact checking these articles (something I heavily recommend doing with this app) I found most of the information completely contradictory to the information in the unbiased sources. This is a great concern for me. It has made me wonder if those writing simply do not understand the topics or if they have purposely written in a way that gives many people false information to form their opinions on. Food for thought. DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD.","userName":"Cheeto lookin president","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:50:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6177630278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible.
