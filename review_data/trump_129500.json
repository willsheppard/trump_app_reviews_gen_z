So as I went to the store it started playing a song that went 🎼remember the times we had the time that you and me had🎼. Then it randomly opened and started buying beans 🌯from amazon and said Jeff bezos needs beans. It opened twitter and showed me a picture of a naked orange 🍊 and... 🍤.

the app it said to give them my phone number-_-I do NOT feel comfortable to give that info to mister Cheeto here then I sent my pet turtle to McDonald’s to bring me sum yummy fries turns out the fbi killed him for me downloading the app after that ,the app had a locating pin in it WICH was dangerous so ofcourse   I had to move somewhere else (my couch to be precise)anyway the app was very glitchy not to mention unprofessional WICH you would not expect from the CHEETO but anywho the app also had something that really hurt my feelings.it was very offensive to most people I believe as well I will not be saying it bc of hazards but just after that turns out my turkey died from looking  at just the screen  sadly his eyeballs came right out ,he sadly couldn’t be recovered not to mention they didn’t even pay for my pets funerals😭I knew my eyes were going to fall off if I don’t stop being there .sadly they did come off I couldn’t see for a week gladly they bought me some fake eyes balls I could still see but not ass well as before anyway They also didn’t pay for my injury’s THAT THEY ALL DID so it’s a bad app ..anyway (actually) I’m just trying to say that this app is pointless like no one likes the orange anyway he is a ped- ..I mean bad person let’s be reall there are more on our side then his","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:27:31Z","title":"Um

my house... and then he made me bow to him and forced me to clean his toes. it was sooo gross. then he put me in a concentration camp- and there i found my pet unicorn. i don’t know how it got there, but there she was. her name is  OBAMAFORPRESIDENT . yeah. pretty cool. this app will also eat all of your brussel sprouts and then the fridge will poop then out. i’m never downloading anything like
