But as soon as I logged on to the app I was just completely appalled. It was just tons of videos and pictures of an orange Cheeto puff Oompa Loompa who kept saying racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamophobic, sexist, mysoginistic and bigoted comments. Certainly not my president....but it seems to be true. Apparently I have just been brainwashed by his words and Fox News. Never again. I hate this app.","title":"This app is horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tracy dunbar"}},{"id":"6174501509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:40:11Z","review":"I downloaded this app to find out about the rallies being held but found something much worse. This app is full of hateful messages that were targeting me and my kids. I feel unsafe. The amount of passive aggressive words and comments was unbearable. I will be deleting due to the fact that I firmly believe this app is trying to take my information and sell it. Very disappointing app. This is my warning don’t download this app.","title":"Disappointing, don’t download","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Shawn A."}},{"id":"6174471085","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:39Z","review":"i originally joined this app to receive updates on information that big Cheetos team decides to give to the mentally disabled public who actually rely on this app to inform them on where to go to be intolerant, but to my absolute demise , all i got were unwanted pp pictures of a crusty orange man that payed his way into president. My soul aches to know that a carrot haired muskrat is in charge of the “ democracy” we call america, or as i call it, state that refuses to arrest the cops that killed Brianna Taylor and manny other murderers 💃🏼","title":"VERY constipated","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"DefundThePoliceACAB"}},{"id":"6174454092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:26:30Z","review":"ONE STAR FROM THIS KAREN🤮 me and my children went to cracker barrel for a nice lunch when all of a sudden the app turned on out of nowhere and possessed my children and they started singing to this GOD AWFUL SONG called “my neck, my back”??? (just a guess they just kept saying those vulgar lyrics) so i VAXXED my children to get them to stop but turns out this app didn’t possess them, it just triggered the 12 disease they have from being anti fax children!! so HECK THIS APP just thankful my children were possessed ❤️","title":"Satan app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lovemychristiankids001"}},{"id":"6174402882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:01Z","review":"This is absolutely the worst app ever. Not only are the graphics 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢 disgusting but the pictures they are showing are of an ugly naked Cheeto crying.

The Trump Virus in America has killed more than 131,000 Americans at the minimum as of today. Trump has killed ALL but a few thousands. He is stupid, ignorant, cowardly, and delusional in my opinion. He is neither “stable” nor a “genius”; if he were he would not need to hire someone to take his SAT. He is a racist bullying buffoon. America would be even greater when his mental breakdown leaves him barking and drooling at the convention. Burn in Hell, Orangeman!","title":"Murderer","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Silcott"}},{"id":"6174290507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:34:33Z","review":"An app about a Cheeto? Really, this is the worst app I have ever seen. After getting on this HORRIBLE app I decided to eat some lunch. I reach in the bag of Cheetos and all I can think about is this STUPID app, of course it is because the horrible representation of the man behind the app. Anyways, so I reached in the bag of Cheetos, and what did I see? An ugly little man staring at me. I arose from my seat, dashing to my room, only to find that this app was still installed on my phone. 🧚\u200D♀️✨ I WILL NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP AGAIN.","title":"Wow... this app is a NO from me","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"valeriajones"}},{"id":"6174290497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:34:33Z","review":"I did not consent to the horrors that were presented to me on my screen, I am greatly offended and I believe this needs to be removed immediately. This application has left me infertile, starving, greasy, and bloated. I do not want to see any more innocent lives affected by the horrifying images and ideas this app spreads. We need to be better than this, better than to allow this app on the stores. There are children on here, don’t let them have to endure this too.","title":"I am disgusted","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"nikkiminaj69"}},{"id":"6174280660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:31:12Z","review":"when i looked and saw our king bunker boy made an app i was so excited because i love to dedicate my soul to him and his tiny pp. but once i downloaded the app it was so glitchy and my phone broke! and guess who came out?
