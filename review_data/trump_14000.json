I 😺downloaded😺 the app to see my fave 🍊orange🍊presents thrive, but then I realize I can’t support some who likes to crush teen’s/children’s ☁️dreams☁️ of becoming    🤩famous🤩. Stealing 🧿tik tok🧿 from us is apart of that. It was amazing to see someone like 🔮Charli Damelio🔮grow there ✨platform✨ at such a young age, but I guess that won’t happen anymore bc you 🍊Mr. Trump🍑 took it away! 💖Baby gorl💖you better get ur ish together or else ALL of 👏gen z 👏is gonna be coming for you.

Or even giving me STDS, HIV, PTSD, and a dramatic sezuire. 🏠🙈 I do not recommend this app, I SAID I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!! unless you are like my girl peaches 🍑 and don't give a dang of getting another parasite 🦠 🥰😋","rating":1,"title":"Worst APPP EVER ❤️"}},{"id":"6178257936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:11:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"mantis_zip","review":"The app is extremely slow and incapable to even use in the first place, at the beginning it just shows a horrible photo of the president which is very offending. Secondly the quote to the app itself when you first start it up is pretty disappointing too. Hopefully it gets taken down and kept down because I’m sure nobody wants to see something hideous as that","rating":1,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6178230742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:01:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Michealvey1","review":"The app took several weeks to download. As soon as you open the app, there’s a racist Cheeto man. When it finally downloaded, it wiped my phone. This app will take your privacy away.  Also, my phone glitched, and started to overheat, so I put it in the freezer for half an hour. It worked, however, my phone was completely wiped out. Please do not download this app. I had a horrible experience.","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6178218325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:57:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"wowipopsonfir3","review":"I downloaded this app to support what I thought was a good president but I get WAY to many notifications and if I do get on this app it kicks me off almost immediately it also has flipped my opinion on trump at first I thought he was doing what is best for my country but then I saw that he is a HORRIBLE president please delete this app it makes me want to eat myself and my phone","rating":1,"title":"Hehe my fellow gen zers don’t take this seriously 🙂"}},{"id":"6178172011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:41:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alle._.","review":"In regards to your personal opinion on topics relating to certain matters, do the musical patterns which feature such known manners as swing notes, improvisation, call and response vocals, and other such similar techniques of musical art under the influence of previously commonly used musical patterns such as blues, folk, and tribal African and European musical combinations, create a joyful emotion that you experience as you listen to this particular style of musical work? In other words, ya like jazz?","rating":1,"title":"🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6178083123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:11:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Eat Thin Potts","review":"This app is one of the most poorly designed pieces of software I’ve ever laid my eyes on. It’s functionality is comparable to the Trump administration itself in the fact that it serves no purpose other than to cause regular every day people strife. I believe this won’t be fixed until the app is literally removed from the platform. MAGA (Make Apple Great Again) by outing this horrible app.","rating":1,"title":"If I could give this 0 I would"}},{"id":"6178059918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:03:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"pudddatora","review":"This app is very bad everything is all over the place and I feel like it shouldn’t be in the AppStore. It’s just horrible. It glitches all the time and can sometimes glitch your phone. My grandma downloaded it and it broke her phone she had to get a whole new phone. I tried to download it and it was just a mess if you are reading this don’t download this app it’s not worth.","rating":1,"title":"I hate this app"}},{"id":"6177994366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:42:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jencdkabdjidnshdhf","review":"Everything on here is wrong. Nobody looks at the facts, and you can clearly see that by looking at who’s writing the articles. None of them cite their sources, there are typos EVERYWHERE, and everyone there is bias, never considering the other side. Please do not download this app for the sake of your mental health, it’s almost as if it’s trying to brainwash the whole U.S. This app is completely wrong in so many ways.","rating":1,"title":"This is a horrible app"}},{"id":"6177992981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:41:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"djaijnfi","review":"This is the worst app on earth, he is a racist, and selfish president I really hope that we had a different president, he is terrible, he hates African American and Mexicans, but we are basically the prime of America we have brought so many things to the nation, and I wish we could just be the same without these racist white people discriminating us because their “president” told them too, he isn’t my president and never will be!","rating":1,"title":"No"}}]}
