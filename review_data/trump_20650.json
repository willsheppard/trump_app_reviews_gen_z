I think it might be cursed. Disturbing images of a orange man glitched onto the screen. And on top of that after I downloaded the app I fell down the stairs! DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD!!! This orange monster will haunt you!!","userName":"the one that must not be named"}},{"id":"6173057840","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:19:09Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible, glitchy, racist, disgusting, nasty app 🙂","review":"This app took others weeks to download, but mine took MONTHS. I COULDNT USE MY OHONE FOR MONTHS. Thanks Donald. When I opened it, a song started playing that hurt my ears but also brought many bugs to me. It never stopped playing, even when I turned my phone off. I eventually burned my phone as there was no alternative.","userName":"aoiajdhdbd"}},{"id":"6173040432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:40Z","rating":1,"title":"Wowwwww","review":"I’ve never had such a terrible experience in my life, when I opened the app all the sudden I five nights at Freddys jump scare came in my face and made me fall off my chair then my mom came in my room yelling at me about “what was that loud noise” then beat my a**.

This app took app so long to download I should’ve gone to mars and back and it still wouldn’t be done downloading. This app disappointed me I had more fun dying in flappy bird.  When this app taught me stuff I already knew it made me want to slam my phone. I am appalled.","userName":"Gianluca Cangelosi"}},{"id":"6173029421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:10:17Z","rating":1,"title":"💘🥐🍊no ❤️😻😍🍤","review":"no❤️ this app takes up too much space in the AppStore 👅😹 and we don’t need apps that are made by an orange racist homophobic ped 🍊 😼🥐🤮 this app also made my dog get the cats and the cats get the cockroaches and they had a spiritual meeting in my attic 🤑🌽👅😹🍏💅🏻👹💕🤮 yea no ❤️ just don’t get this app its a waste of storage 😻🥰🌝👅👺💕👺🌽  yuh 😍😍 me 2020 😻 and TRUMP not MY president 🤮❤️❤️😻 you prolly smell like Cheetos and they made some emojis for you 🍤🥐🤮🍊 yea ❤️","userName":"no ❤️😹"}},{"id":"6173005726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:59Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"This app isn’t even worthy of one star.

Isn’t this the president he should do better than this.

It took us 3 days to find him and when we did he couldn’t stop saying Trump 2020 and repeatedly saying racist and homophobic slurs. We don’t know how to fix him. Terrible app, 0/100, would never use again.","userName":"Jimmy Pageturner"}},{"id":"6172929459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:39:28Z","rating":1,"title":"Waste of my time","review":"This app is very 1 star quality it has this picture of a moldy orange when you open it. It made my phone throw up so I had to delete it right away. I think you guys should take this app off of the App Store right away because a bunch of ignorant information is held in this app. Oh and also BLACK LIVES MATTER, DEFUND THE POLICE, HISPANIC LIVES MATTER, FREE THE KIDS, #GENZ2020 #TRUMP2020-But on a grave✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕","userName":"jonathan gAlind0"}},{"id":"6172917375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:35:37Z","rating":1,"title":"Rip Carter","review":"As soon as I opened this app they played awful sounds of baby’s screaming in pain and men projectile vomiting after that it played a trump speech and my cousin actually died to the sound when I tried you clear the app out it wouldn’t let me do anything I had to get a new phone and bury my old one because it wouldn’t even die!","userName":"addy❤️👌🏼❤️"}}]}
