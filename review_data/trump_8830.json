But as soon as I agreed to the terms and conditions for this app, small pigeon ninjas showed up at my house. They attacked me and regurgitated all over my living room floor. My children are terrified and ran away. Sadly this app also played “shawtys like a melody in my head” for 5 hours straight non stop. I was unable to do anything else on my phone while this was happening. Please do not get this app!! Awful things will happen if you do so 🤢😔✌🏻.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Killiua Zoldiak","title":"TERRIBLE app🤢💔😭","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:36:57Z"}},{"id":"6173613803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Once this app began installing on my phone the entire devices software started slowing down so much so that I could barely use my phone at all. A few days later I tried to open the app and my entire phone shut down. When I brought it in to the Apple store they said there was no fixing it and I had to buy an entirely new phone. The first thing I wanted to do with it was leave this review and let everyone know how awful this app is.","isEdited":false,"userName":"kiwi445","title":"This App Broke My Phone","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:25:18Z"}},{"id":"6173570733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"baddie 🦋🥰 But the bad is silent🧚🏽✨💞🎉\n\nu killed this 💞🦋!🧚🏽now do the same for urself🙈🥰⚡️\n\ngod took his time on many💞🥰🥰🥰🥰you were rushed😩💘💕🧚🏽\n\nyour confidence is glowing✨💞💘 maybe you should turn down the brightness🥰🧚🏽☺️\n\nyou served💋😘🤩 i will not be tipping✨🧚🏽🦋💕\n\nyou snapped💞✨💖make sure it’s your neck next time✨🦋💓\n\ni see you 😍✨💗 wish i didn’t tho 🧚🏾\u200D♂️🦋💕\n\ngod has lots of favorites🥰💞🧚🏽you’re not one of them🥺💘💘\n\nyou ate that🧚🏾\u200D♀️💕🌸 now throw it up✨💫💗\n\nwhen nicki minaj said abort that 🧚🏽✨💓she meant you😘😍🦋\n\nyou ate that up🥵🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧚🏾\u200D♀️💞now go on a diet😘💘💕🥰\n\nignore the haters💫🧚🏽💞 because their right💝✨🌈🙈 \n\nyou inspire me 💕🧚\u200D♀️✨ to use birth control 🌈⭐️🧡🥰\n\nThey said confidence is key🔑 😘💓🧚🏽\u200D♀️👑...

BUT instead I became a Troompa Loompa😖 As soon as I opened the app, my screen went black. Then when I looked in the mirror my skin was orange! I had hair that looked like what’s inside the corn ear! I couldn’t manage to say anything other than ‘Snowflake’ and “That’s taken out of context “. I couldn’t do or say anything useful! Then I injected myself with Lysol because that’s what Donnie suggested! I died and am now writing this from Purgatory. 0/10!

I don’t know how I was so blind to support this broken, orange toenail of a man. He knows nothing about politics and has ruined this country. He wanted to make this country how he wants it; to be his. His ideals for this now sad sack of dirt that I used to call home has ruined the lives of many. I’d rather have my three year old cousin be the president, because at least she knows how to be respectful, and knows the basics of human rights.","isEdited":false,"userName":"All Mighty Boog","title":"No More","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:47Z"}}]}
