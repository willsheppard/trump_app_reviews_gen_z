THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. Instead I was blinded by an orange dusty Cheeto on my screen. DISGUSTING!!🤮 My little brother saw it and started crying!!! This app is a scam!! It should be deleted from the App Store immediately. I will be forever scarred by what I saw when opening the app. All I wanted was to recreate scenes with Robert Pattinson but I was VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! If I could give this app 0/5 stars I would.","date":"2020-07-09T21:02:24Z","title":"ITS A SCAM!!"}},{"id":"6178199953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nmopq","review":"first off, this app is ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL.

And TikTok is literally my whole life and I’m on it 24/7 but anyway back to this disgusting useless app when I first opened it I say something very disgusting and I wanted to throw up 🤢","date":"2020-07-09T20:46:49Z","title":"Worst app ever 😐🤢🥱🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6178157324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"username:dieingtoaster123","review":"This app took at least a week to just download and it takes so long to load in. When I press something to read it waits their for like a minute then it takes me in. Worst app on the App Store!!! Made me wait a week and now I regret downloading it of the bad quality of the app and how long it takes to load!! It also made my device always crash so I am thinking of deleting it!!","date":"2020-07-09T20:36:09Z","title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6178153801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"DevlinmaddenxGlitterface","review":"I didn’t even have to open up the app to realize how AWFUL it is. The “T” in the app icon is OBNOXIOUS to say the least. “T 2020”, what’s that? “The Stolen Land We Are On 2020”? “The Coronavirus Isn’t Being Taken As Seriously As It Should Be 2020?” Hmm...\n\nAnyways I DO NOT recommend this app to anyone. I heard the person it sponsors is like a rapist and has 25 women claiming sexual assault against him. I ALSO HEARD he’s xenophobic and racist! How COULD you download this app?! Deleting it right after this.","date":"2020-07-09T20:34:53Z","title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6178123142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"a.longtine","review":"my mom says i’m not allowed to burn trash so i’ve gotta be light with this review... I was expecting to install this app for entertainment purposes to see what the Orange was going to do to “make america great again” (that’s not working to well btw) but then to my dismay I was incredibly bored the minute I opened it. anyways, I do not recommend this app to anyone that has a brain as it will disintegrate your noggin. thank you for your time","date":"2020-07-09T20:24:34Z","title":"absolute trash"}},{"id":"6178085810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"obama>>>>🍊🍊🍊🍊","review":"This app is horrible after a week of waiting for it to download I was finally able to open it up. After seeing the welcome pop up with a  Cheeto dressed as a president on it I was completely disgusted. I threw up for weeks and I then deleted the app but I’m still traumatized😖. You guys should really put a warning or something before you show such a disturbing picture. 🤢🤢🤢🤮 Just thinking about it now I- brb.","date":"2020-07-09T20:12:12Z","title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6178082113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bigly mistake","review":"Wish i could give it less than one star :/ worst app ever for the worst president ever ✨✨✨ downloading this app is a waste of storage, money and time. Not to mention my skin turned orange 🍊 i couldn't speak properly🚫, gained 100 pounds 🤰🏻and suddenly lost all of my hair👨🏻\u200D🦲!! Trump just wants us all to look and act like him now 😡😡 hello brainwashing 101.

Do you think women don’t deserve equal pay? Do you think degrading women or sexually assaulting them is funny? How about enjoying watching a grown man throw hissy fits because no one likes him? If you answered yes to any of these questions, boy have you found the jack pot with this app! Downloading it gives the capability to watch a grown man with a bad spray tan attempt to become not only our president once again, but a comedian!!","date":"2020-07-09T20:10:28Z","title":"Trump 2020"}}]}
