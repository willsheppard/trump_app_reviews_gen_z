It wouldn't be so bad but I was also trying to postmate some McDonald's and since I couldn't do that I decided to just drive to McDonald's but when I walked to my car Dobby came and broke into my car and stole it 😢 I know Daddy Trump wouldn't intentionally make his app have this kind of effect but I hope he can fix it soon!! Also I reserved seats for the New Hampshire rally but I forgot I have to rewire my grass that day ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-08T19:32:08Z"}},{"id":"6173458047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shona100","title":"Why does this exist?? 😡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP EVER!! This app keeps tracking my location and sometimes I can even notice that it’s using my audio and camera EVEN though I never even allowed for them too. It isn’t just when I’m on the app too, it’s whenever I’m anywhere on my phone, that isn’t supposed to happen! This app tracks you and invaded your privacy to gain whatever information you have BEWARE. None of us wants to have our privacy invaded and possibly have Russia or China gain access to them and this app is doing just that and allowing for them to collect our informations.

I was utterly DISAPPOINTED to see that MY president made an app that was full of FAKE NEWS and was constructed very poorly! I thought this app would be the conservative version of what the kids use nowadays...tiktak i believe. NO. I was ready to make videos explaining why white supremacy is superior and I wanted my following to see my HUGE confederate flag! All he wanted was to take my money and didn’t tell me where it was going!!!!! I don’t care if he is racist, homophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, and I especially don’t care if he is a rapist. I draw the line at this broken app. I want my hard-earned American money back!","date":"2020-07-08T19:27:50Z"}},{"id":"6173437730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"1k2v6","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app actually broke my phone.(i’m not kidding i’m getting a new phone soon) It took hours to download and once it did it kept glitching. After a while it calmed down so i went back on the app to a bunch of weird inappropriate ads and don’t get me started on how hard it was to navigate. I couldn’t find anything and i turned off notifications but it kept sending a million notifications anyway. An hour later it started glitching again but even worse!! I couldn’t even delete the app for a while. BUT NOW MY PHONE IS PERMANENTLY GLITCJED AND MY SCREEN KEEPS GOING BLACK RANDOMLY. THATS NOT EVEN THE WORST THING IT DID TO MY PHONE.

I thought that I had a virus because of all the pop ups I was getting because of this it’s horrid. My little sister was on my phone and she saw gore pop up out of no where she was so scared. I also had to pay to make the pop ups go away to fix my phone! 😡So nothing good happened from me downloading this game actually because my sister was really scared of the pop ups and said she might have a nightmare because of it AND I had a bunch of inappropriate ads on my screen it was TERRIBLE.

But after I downloaded it I got doxxed by skia Jackson and these agents came to my house and started beating me and my 98 year old grandpa. After I asked them several times to stop they said it was his time to go anyways. My grandpa passed away moments later. THEY SHOWED UP TO THE FUNERAL with president trump. I told trump I was his biggest fan and HE PUSHED ME AWAY. He walked over to the to my baby brother and thought it was the casket. He spit on my baby brother and said “that’s what you get for stealing my girls heart” I told him that it was a baby and he felt so embarrassed that he DEPORTED ME keep in mind I was born IN AMERICA I am a full on WHITE American.","date":"2020-07-08T19:05:56Z"}},{"id":"6173373436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"blueheelers12","title":"Crashed my phone-would not recommended","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I got this app and hated it. I could not get in the app for more than 2 minutes so I deleted the app and reinstalled it but still the same thing. I thought maybe restarting me phone would work(somebody I know works in IT) still nothing worked. When I took my phone to Verizon they could not fix it(my friend doesn’t live near me). I ended up having to go to a private IT guy. Even he couldn’t fix the problem. I ended up just getting a new phone(the old phone was an iPhone 11 Pro). So it’s up to you if you want to risk your phone. 0/10 would not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T19:02:21Z"}},{"id":"6173367694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Raise a glass to freedom!","title":"App Glitches ALOT","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app has TERRIBLE service! It does nothing to help the country or help those in need. This app doesn’t help solve any problems. Only promotes something that helps an individual agenda. This app doesn’t help the US better it’s economical crisis,the environment,world hunger. As  a BTS stan and Kpop stan, a person of Gen z. This app doesn’t hold close to any of our morals of equality. It only spreads hatred and fear in those that get the app. I had the app for about three days and I couldn’t take the uselessness of the app. While also on the app it glitched SO MANY TIMES! I tried contacting costumer services but THEY WERE VERY RUDE! DONT GET THE APP! It doesn’t benefit the future of the COUNTRY!","date":"2020-07-08T19:00:24Z"}}]}
