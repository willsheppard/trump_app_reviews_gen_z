I had to chase this lady down all the way to a chick fil a to have a crown of ProLifers tell me that It was a good decision to have my baby even though I don’t have any resources to care for it and when I asked for support for the baby they wanted me to have they said no!! Worst app I’ve ever downloaded and now I’m having people in the streets who aren’t wearing masks hug me. All of my friends hate me and the only thing I have left is a lady named Karen who doesn’t wear underwear for the same reason she doesn’t wear a mask, somethings needs to breath. As an attempt to return back to my old life I will uninstall the app I hope no one downloads it and gets the same fate as me!!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:55:58Z"}},{"id":"6176034765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is ✨ u n b e l i e v a b l e ✨","userName":"Completely useless ✨🌥","rating":1,"review":"Hello, today I will be presenting my essay (or review) for this “Trump App.” For starters, this app supports our President (AKA Donald Trump), which is trying to delete the only place where Gen Z’ers can communicate. Yes, China might be stealing our information and data, but we KNOW that isn’t the only reason ya’ll are shutting it down just for that.                                                                  .            Next up, the reason I am making a review is because, if ya’ll are shutting down tik tok, we’re shutting down this app. How are we gonna do that you ask? Well, Apple deletes an app COMPLETELY if it has less than 1 stars. And our duty is to make this app shut down so we can show you what WE can do.                                          .             My point in this whole essay/review/rant is that, we are showing you what we can do and we even though we are young, we have a VOICE that we can use. (Also, look at what we can do when we are determined) 👀","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:13:31Z"}},{"id":"6174963251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Series of events","userName":"LichenMONSTA","rating":1,"review":"A few weeks ago I stumbled across this app thinking it would be a great way to praise the great lord Cheeto. WRONG. As soon as I got this app I started hearing grunts and moans coming from upstairs. I went upstairs only to find out my parents were being probed by ALIENS!!! I was mortified and had to go to therapy classes for weeks. One day I was coming back from therapy and saw 7 oddly large pickles running straight towards me with their mouths wide open, screaming “ALL LIVES MATTER!!!” I ran away as fast as I could only to trip and fall into a pawn shop. The pickles were extremely scared of pawn shops for some reason. As soon as I turned around I realized why the pickles were scared. Not because it was a pawn shop but because the cashier was one of the probing aliens. I passed out and woke up to being surrounded by 5 aliens, which one of them was probing me. Ngl it kinda felt good. The only reason why I will put this app a one star is because the probing aliens forced me to eat my pet penguin.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:55:57Z"}},{"id":"6174905693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Mr. LeaveYoBitchWet","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app thinking that this would be a good idea but i was wrong 😐 I opened the app just to find a orange purple pink condom corn dog stick as my wallpaper \nI was like “ oh my Gawd “ 👁👄👁 then I tried to delete the app just to find out that I need to buy a pet snake that has 22 eyes 4 feet with 19 toes on it that eats stuffed pillow cases that eat dinosaur bones that eats their booty 🤮 yuck 🤢 so I went to Pluto to see if I could buy the snake, then I found out that I have to go back to earth to get a glass of Ice water to go bring back to Saturn to take back to hell to give to satan to take to the sun to bring it back to earth 🌏 I was like “ Oh Hell Nawl” then I walked up the stairs to haven to to figure out that I broke the stairs 🌚 then I woke up a found myself outer space floating around naked in a orange purple pink condom corn dog stick swim suit 🌝 I was like “ Stylish “ 💅🏾 then I woke up in a pile of dirt and rocks just to start my day in a pickle jar filled with pee 🤳🏾 I would not recommend this app 🧚🏽\u200D♂️🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧚🏾","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:38:19Z"}},{"id":"6174852665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dumb duck","userName":"kamikazee.duck","rating":1,"review":"One time in a little part of lakeside park, right by the lake where I was just happening to walk by I saw a pigeon and some trees, but I also saw a duck, being curious by the duck I slowly and methodically approached the strange yet beautiful being of nature. When I approach the bootleg wanna be swan the little being made of meat and feathers approached me, as he approached me he made a face, one such face that I realized the little duck was going to attack me, as I realized the voluptuous duck was going to kamikaze into my face I ran away like France in every war, while I was running like a wimp from a tiny and small bird, I screamed as I went “oh no do not make that face” after I said this strange yet thought-provoking quote I realized something, for one duck do not have very many facial expressions, besides mad glad and hungry, as this thought chain was going on I also realized that most animals only have a couple of facial expressions they either want food with their very big or small beaks or mouths.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:22:47Z"}},{"id":"6174778652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It Turned Me Orange","userName":"Cheetah Named Chester","rating":1,"review":"After downloading this app, I noticed something strange. With each passing day, my skin turned more and more orange. It looked like I had a bad spray tan. People stated pointing at me and calling me “Cheeto” 😕 I also became very forgetful and couldn't think rationally. I started talking like a young child and acting like one too! I literally could not keep my mouth shut and lost all respect for other people. It’s almost like I had been brainwashed. My family knew something was wrong and staged an intervention. They tried having a serious talk with me, but it didn’t work. I would not answer their questions and started coughing on them. They took my phone as punishment, and within a day, I was back to my normal self. I think there must be witchcraft built into this app. Do NOT trust it, please! If I had kept the app much longer, I think I would have turned into an orange zombie with the emotional intelligence of a toddler. I cannot stress enough how terrible this app is.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:00:50Z"}},{"id":"6174482509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"was expecting better","userName":"theScammedGirl","rating":1,"review":"First of all, this app was pretty useless. All we get is super conservative news about “America First” and fishy “oppose globalists”, senseless news. Don’t get me wrong, it is a “for Cheeto- I meant Trump” app. The events section is messy. I think the engage section is confusing, it just sends me what to follow and apparently join an army for... what? The entire section is full of odd “opportunities” for the general population and students and “volunteering”  in support of November's election. Pretty useless app. The reward points system makes no sense? What’s it for? Rewarding your efforts in the app to share “everything’s better with trump” news and the silly app itself? To get a picture or something from him? No need... There’s also a donating option that I assume funds Trumps campaign, as if he wasn’t already a millionaire or more so. Controversial app overall, 0/10 do not recommend using, unless you’re crazy in need of something so... convenient for the wrong purposes.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:34:54Z"}},{"id":"6174581083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Not a fan of trump","rating":2,"review":"If I could give zero stars to this app, I would. I first open the app to see picture of a bald eagles erect penis. Yes it was a bald eagles erect penis. I do not know what kind of advertising ploy this is but it is unacceptable and quite frankly gross. I know trump wants to keep America great and all, but that image is engraved in my mind and I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I honestly wanted to give this app another chance, so I tried to close the phone, but the app then proceeded to compare THE BALD EAGLES PENIS TO TRUMP’S MINUSCULE MANHOOD. AND LET ME TELL YOU, I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT MAN WALKS AROUND WITH THAT MUCH CONFIDENCE WITH A MANGINA LIKE THAT. Jesus Christ. How does a bald eagle have a bigger penis than him? Also, my literal children saw the comparison pictures WITH EXACT MEASUREMENTS and now they can’t stop chanting “the president has a mangina”. They even said it to my mother in law and she called CPS, and got my kids taken away from me. So if don’t want your kids taken away from you, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:50Z"}},{"id":"6174472556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My trash came to life and became an orange☺️😌✨","userName":"Jz111111","rating":1,"review":"It was another boring Wednesday so I decided to download “Trump 2020”, why not?💗✌🏼🌟 I was so excited when it finally downloaded(took a few hours but whatever😆😝). Anyway, when I opened it but before I could check the fake news I heard a crash from outside, near my trash can. So obviously I checked it out and my trash was moving by itself?!?!? I quickly went to go back inside but my door was locked!! A shadow carpet up behind me and it was the trash...but it was in the shape of a man made of orange trash and puke ✨e w✨😝.  I said “no Mr trash man!! Don’t hurt me!!” And he said “vote trump 2020 or I will kill your cat and eat it alive!!”. I didn’t know what to do so I whipped out my phone and deleted the app. Just like that, Mr trash man disappeared. Overall my time on the app wasn’t great, so I think they need to fix everything💗😝✨🥺\n\nDon’t get this app if you don’t want Mr trash man(aka Donald trump) anywhere near you☺️😌✨. Stay safe(away from trump).✨😌☺️😝😊🥺😎😤","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:32:05Z"}},{"id":"6174308450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My eyes hurt","userName":"susuwuzhere","rating":1,"review":"I was here to leave a review because I wanted the world to hear my voice. But I couldn’t find the button, I continuously scrolled up and down through the page to find the “write a review” to find out that you have to download the app first. That’s SO rude when I had sooo much just to say about the pictures they decided to use for the description. So, for starters this app wasted my time and energy making me press the button and do a Face ID but...I decided not to give up and learn more. AGE RESTRICTED MATERIAL this man is not to be trusted. The picture of him on the screen already made me want to follow his order and drink bleach. He’s so smart even though he cheated on the ACT/SAT. No wonder so many people follow him, his motto should be “take the easy way out!”. Overall without even opening the app I despised the amount of effort it made me use and I hope it gets taken down so the poor people don’t have to keep seeing that horrid picture in the description <3","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:40:29Z"}}]}
