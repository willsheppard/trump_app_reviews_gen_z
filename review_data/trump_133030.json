Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry’s hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations.

In fact, I really try not to, but this app was so horrible I had to say something. The first problem I encountered was the time it took to download.  The other reviews were right that it took HOURS to download this app. Then it started giving me ads that were offensive and rude. They gave me targeted ads that called me fat and tried to collect my credit card information. After going through that brutal bullying, I decided it was time to login and sign up to support Mr. Trump. This was a MISTAKE. I gave them my phone number and I got random texts and calls telling me to kill myself. I couldn’t stop crying so I decided to go to the kitchen and get myself a nice slice of pie. While I was walking to the kitchen I could barely see because of the tears in my eyes, so I accidentally tripped over my cat. Then when I checked on it I discovered my cat was DEAD. Since this app has Mr.Trumps personal phone number, I decided to give him a phone call. I told him about my dead cat and he didn’t care AT ALL. He told me to go back to China and eat a cat. I was so offended. Luckily I happen to be quite wealthy, because I sued the Trump administration for killing my cat, which was ruled a premeditated murder. I quickly spent all of my money and donated it all to the local abortion clinic in Mr. Trumps name. Because of my generous donation they even made a statue of my cat! Anyways, do not download this app because it will give you viruses on your phone, targeted clickbait ads, and phone numbers that tell you to do the blue whale challenge. Oh, and it KILLED my cat. Despite all of these issues, I will have to say; 🥰☺️😝🦄🇺🇸Bernie 2020🇺🇸😍😌✨🧚","date":"2020-07-08T20:43:18Z","userName":"Karen Catawall"}},{"id":"6173664123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible things happend after downloading","review":"So first I downloaded the app and saw a disturbing picture of and orangutan with trump is face on it and then i tried to long on to instagram but my account was being hacked by someone in Moscow Russia. At this point i was furious so i tried to follow trumps advice on COVID 19 and ended up almost killing my best friend from COVID. I was so sad that I decided to listen to sad music on spotify but then the Russian hackers that hacked the 2016 election got into my account and they were listing to weird music.
