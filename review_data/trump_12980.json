WILL GLITCH YOUR PHONE!","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible app! Right after downloading it my phone became attacked with a virus, messing with its functions. It began to randomly power off at least 3 times EVERY HOUR. The up volume button does not even do anything anymore & the screen will randomly start glitching whenever I use it for more than 5 minutes at a time. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. This app will mess up your phone! If I could give it negative stars I would!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! 0/5 stars!!"}},{"id":"6174549407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"❤️😊😋Callie English😋😊❤️","title":"This app is just a no","date":"2020-07-09T01:53:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I’m a Donald trump supporter but this app is just a no no as soon as I downloaded this app my phone started glitching and it got a virus and there was so many commercials and my phone completely freaked out this app needs to be deleted and looking at the other reviews it did the same thing and everyone wants this app deleted so just delete it the app should not be here if it is causing this much problems"}},{"id":"6174536682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"gs_barton","title":"Would Give Zero Stars if possible","date":"2020-07-09T01:50:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Horrible glitching. Likes to crash all the time and drains my battery. The app even says that it can track my location without using it??? Not cool. Not to mention the horrible images on display once you open the app. Would recommend steering clear if you want to avoid NSFW images displayed on your phone. Absolutely horrid. I can’t believe this is allowed to still be an app. APPLE TAKE DOWN THIS DISGUSTING DISPLAY EWWWW."}},{"id":"6174503683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Jazzzle007","title":"Absolute crap.","date":"2020-07-09T01:40:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened the app and was unexplainably displeased. After about 2 minutes of looking through this app, my eyes burned up like I just poured a whole bottle of hot sauce in them. If you are going to make an app and say it’s for news purposes, then do so. I don't want fake news and to be informed of false statements and unproved theories. The very last thing I wanted was to see were posts of a puffy cheeto acting like he has something good to show off."}},{"id":"6174480047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"LowkeyFuck2020","title":"Narcissistic racist and homophobic Cheeto man","date":"2020-07-09T01:34:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First off....*ahem* 🧚✨I don’t like opening the app knowing that this man has incriminating evidence on him and nobody is doing anything 🥰✨and that he gassed thousands of people just for a photo that nobody cared about and that he is said “when the looting starts the shooting starts.”  And nobody really likes the color orange anymore so ig you can call me trump racist 🥴😘✨ So yeah get this racist, narcissistic, transphobic and homophobic Cheeto out of here already 😎✨♥️.

Full of fake news! The icon isn’t too great either. The font on the “T” is too thick! \nThe app promises to help you make America great again, but it does nothing of the sort! So disappointed. I downloaded, and America is still not great! 😭😭😭\nWhen will the false advertisement stop? \nAll I can say is, when your loved ones have been mangled, listen to the jingle jangle. This app is NOT the jingle jangle! 😡"}},{"id":"6174451623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Vote Against Trump 2020","title":"Worst experience ever","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the worst! It makes your phone glitch and shuts my phone off everytime you open the app! I don’t even wanna put a star rating as that is how bad it is! The app is a good way to lose data and completely screw your phone up! 10/10 would vote against it! Screw the racist/rapist who’s name is on this app and screw this app! Definitely don’t recommend getting this app, nor recommend voting for Dump! #SettlingForBiden"}},{"id":"6174411915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kekeissa777","title":"Horrible 🤢","date":"2020-07-09T01:13:41Z","isEdited":false,"review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\nYellow, black.

Weeks went by and I went back for a follow up appointment, and it turns out I had aids. They told me the only way to rid of the disease was to delete the app. After weeks of denial I finally went through with it, and I have become stronger by the day. Please, do not download this app, and if you do, please remember that it can result in aids."}}]}
