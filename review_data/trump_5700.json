It glitches like clockwork, crashes as if it’s running down a crowded hall, and there’s this weird Cheeto looking man just plastered all over the site. I can not begin to express what atrocities this app has cause to the other apps surrounding it on my phone and just generally my well-being. I believe the only way this app can be completely taken off before anymore damage is done is by voting for Biden during the early voting stage and on Election Day. It’s time for this man to go out, he’s a parasite and I’m done being a host. Have a wonderful day lovelies."}},{"id":"6173239875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idkaname4","date":"2020-07-08T18:17:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"I downloaded this app because trump is definitely my favorite president 100%😌✨❤️ but then i was like this app is the worst and trump is just a orange cheeto puff and a oompa loompa and u don’t know why he has supporters because he’s a white supremacist😱🤡 no lies here🤐✨ anyways this app reminds me of💩 because it’s litteral 💩 like trump. Also after i downloaded it my phone shut off many times! DO NOT DOWNLOAD the app is a virus! It really deserves 0 stars it’s the worst app ever.

We’re almost up to 40 million in testing and 40 million people, which is unheard of, far more than any other country, many times what any other country has, and therefore we have more cases. Because we’re doing more testing, we have more cases. If we did half the testing, we’d have far fewer cases. But people don’t view it that way.\n\nIt seems to be just working. It’s sort of the ABCs of what we’re doing and it seems to be working. Do you have tests right now that say it does work?"}},{"id":"6173144901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"listenswhilewalking","date":"2020-07-08T17:47:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Awful","review":"I woke up today thinking about how I could support my president, besides getting tickets for his rallies. I then decided to download this app in hopes of finding some fictional stories about what would happen if we voted for a cheeto as president. I then realized that these were true stories and that it is all real. What has this country come to. Once reading some of the articles it caused my immediate death. So in other words I came back just to say that this app is awful and should never had existed. Also can someone created a time machine already? I want to get out of here."}},{"id":"6173084476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jsjdbkdkenbd","date":"2020-07-08T17:27:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i almost died","review":"i downloaded this app to see what the hype was all abt but little did i know that this thing would try to kill me. basically i got this app the other night. it finally finished downloading i was in the kitchen and i got this bag of cheetos and i open it and there’s nothing inside but it was a new bag. then i heard something behind me and it was a big old orange man standing there with a plate full of my cheetos. i was so scared for my life but then he offered me some cheetos so i thought he wasn’t that bad but then my guardian angel came and she said “ don’t eat it. it had poison “ so i throw it on the floor and start screaming at him. then he took out a big cheeto (it was abt 5 feet long) and tries to kill me with it but luckily i had my sword with me so we started to fight.  fortunately i ate the big cheeto before he could stab me and once i did he left running after that i deleted the app and never saw him again."}},{"id":"6173061697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"A mourning woman","date":"2020-07-08T17:20:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"made my dog cry","review":"i was trying to get a ticket and he accidentally looked over and saw me trying to get a ticket for trumps upcoming rally. when he saw the he started whining and howling and eventually crying. then he bit my groin and sent me to the ER. there, i saw my grandmother being taken away to the morgue. so i ask the doctors how she died. they tell me that she passed away due to complications of an orange man in office. (take that as you will). so i heal from surgery, wake up, and find out that my dog got rabies from a rabid trump supporter and had to be euthanized. (the trump supporter also had to be euthanized :( ). so fly high Mr. John, grandma, and beanie."}},{"id":"6173018216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"curlhead15","date":"2020-07-08T17:06:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s broken","review":"I would like to say that when I downloaded this app took me 5 hours to download it. So basically this app is slow Just like trump. The main reason I downloaded this app is just give it a review because I had no choice. So here I go, The app was very useless just like our president so there’s no surprise to that. I think it was acting up because im guessing it found out that I’m Hispanic so now we know this app is racist just like our president, still no surprise to that. I  just think this app should be band from all App Stores. It’s just useless and has no meaning to it just like TRUMP."}},{"id":"6172916151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Annacat9","date":"2020-07-08T16:35:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TRUMP IS BEING A DICTATOR","review":"Oh my lord I can not believe it but Trump (THE Trump) the person who started the “fake news” movement is streamlining the news. He only shows certain “news worthy” topics that make him look good! I follow other news sources on social media (fox news of course!) and realized that he left out so much that is happening in the world! I had no idea that our president is hiding so much from us!\n\nBefore I downloaded this app he certainly had my vote but now I can certainly say not!! Do not vote for this liar! As a fellow republican who has best interest as heart for our country do not vote for this communist dictator!!"}}]}
