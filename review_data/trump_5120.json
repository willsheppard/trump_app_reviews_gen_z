I opened the app, and then fell down two flights of stairs. Next, all my animals were shot by Trump supporters. Conservatives ran through my house and stole all my stuff. The extreme right set my house on fire and everything that was left in it. I went to go try and uninstall the app, and Trump himself, showed up and killed all my family. that wrinkly orange man has ruined my life. I just escaped the other day, but he had captured me and had me locked in the bunker with him. It was very scary. Apple needs to take this off the App Store so that no one else gets hurt."}},{"id":"6173764159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:45Z","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"xillians","review":"This app is HORRIBLE. I was sitting on my couch scrolling through tiktok when I saw an add pop up for this app. Me being a zoomer I HAD to see what the wrinkly orange was up to. THE APP TOOK AGES TO DOWNLOAD. It infuriated me so much that even my cat was getting a headache. It got to the point the amount of waiting time was so unbearable her brain exploded. Thanks to this app I was forced to clean up the remains of my dead best friend. I will never meet another cat like Penelope. If you do not want your pers in any kind of danger stay as far away as possible from this app. It will change you, your family, and ESPECIALLY your pets. Stay safe out there everybody."}},{"id":"6173698173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:29Z","title":"ALL APPS MATTER!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Agapi.Died","review":"This app is taking away the attention from all the other apps, don’t my apps matter too? I think its unfair to all other apps that you have this out in the open even though I don’t download these types of apps. I understand that you think other apps do better but that doesn't mean you have to go looking for attention, there is no such thing as loving another app more. If your app is getting hate, it’s not because people don’t like your type of apps, its just that statistically, your app makes more people feel uncomfortable, anyways all apps matter so please stop ✌️🥰"}},{"id":"6173676917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:47:47Z","title":"No🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🦄","isEdited":false,"userName":"pandaoreo11","review":"I was a girl👧🏻in the village🏘doing alright then I became a princess👸🏻over night🌚now I gotta figure out🧐how to do it right👍🏼so much to learn and see🤓🤩up🔝in the castle🏰with my new family👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👧in a school🏫that’s just for royalty 👑 ☕️a whole enchanted🦄🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨world🌏is waiting for me😊im so excited😁to be (so excited☺️)I’m finding out🧐what being royals👑 all about (Sofia the first) making my way🙌🏼it’s an adventure🗺 everyday🗓(Sofia) it’s gonna be my👧🏻 time ⏰ (Sofia) to show them all that time SOFIA THE FIRST!!!!👧🏻👑❤️✨✨✨\nyea the app is horrible it makes my phone crash so much!

First of all, the second I downloaded this app, my phone caught on fire. Instantly. Now, I tried to put it in rice to stop the flames, but the entire time, Siri just kept screaming “TRUMP 2020” in a demonic voice. Because I was afraid for my life due to the terrifying chanting, I left the room for a moment to take a deep breath. That’s when my curtains caught on fire and longggg story short, I no longer have a home. Basically, this app burnt down my home. Thank you Trump, thank you for lighting my house on fire. Love that for us."}},{"id":"6173604377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:21:55Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"donotgetthisappBEWARE","review":"Do not get this app. As soon as I opened the app I saw an orange orangutan, which attracted bugs to my house. So I did what was necessary, and called animal control and the exterminator. Then my house was finally clean but then, the bugs had siblings and wanted to get pay back. So they worked together to get the pack of matches on top of my fridge, used for emergencies, to light my house on fire. All the Karen’s on the street walking with their sons, Timmy and Johnny, called the police. And because we’re a black family we all got arrested. So 10/10 would not recommend getting this app unless you want bugs haunting you."}},{"id":"6173581647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:57Z","title":"⚠️WARNING DONT DOWNLOAD⚠️","isEdited":false,"userName":"💕🦋✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️👑💅🏼","review":"This app is awful I had to enter a credit card number at first I was very confused but I trusted our amazing president😻😻so I did it and now I’m broke and I don’t have enough money to pay for bills😿😾and then I got a notification saying my address was downloaded and a white middle aged man wearing a speedo with the American flag came up to me and my family and started beating us all up and he stole my dog😭😭and when he turned around to leave he had a skid stain👁👄👁I was very disgusted I started puking like crazy I was very scared and tried deleting the app but it would NOT let me but I eventually got it to delete😛😛"}},{"id":"6173575193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:11:42Z","title":"Horrible app!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Donovandoesntlikeit","review":"It took hours to download! Not worth the wait at all! The moment It downloaded it made all my other apps slow, and stop working. I had to take my phone to Apple and get it replaced. They said the app has a bug that can mess up your phone. If it does download fast for you, when you open the app it takes data from other apps and keeps it. I have paypal and it took my debit card information from it, and I saw unknown charges for trump donations I didn’t place! The app was so bright that when I opened it my cornea burned and I’m legally blind and might have eye cancer! Don’t get it!!!!"}},{"id":"6173491287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:43:05Z","title":"don’t download😘","isEdited":false,"userName":"libbyd727","review":"when I downloaded the app I realized I had to go walk my teddy bear Frederick🧸down the street to go get some ice cream🍦and when I came back I realize this man is extremely racist and does not care about anything besides money and himself. besides he also looks like a burn Cheetos and last time I checked I don’t like burnt Cheetos🤷🏼\u200D♀️, No matter how many times I’ve tried to figure out why people like it I just can never see because their points are we stupid and make no sense considering they have no evidence to back anything up. In conclusion I guess people just have bad taste.\n✨✨also wear a mask✨✨"}},{"id":"6173470142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:48Z","title":"Worst app ever 👹🤡","isEdited":false,"userName":"gelly4lyfe","review":"I know a lot of these reviews are fake but mine is not. please listen to my story 😔 The app took forever to download but as a trump follower, i believed it was worth the wait. however, when i opened the app many thick oranges bursted into my house and performed the renegade dance while listening to the national anthem. i figured the only way to remove the oranges was to delete the app. i deleted the app but in doing so my house went up in flames. the fire department was too busy to save my home and i’m now homeless. do not buy the app unless you do not have a house or you hate your home. this is a one star for me 💅🏻"}}]}
