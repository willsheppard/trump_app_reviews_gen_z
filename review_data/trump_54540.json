The dish FINALLY arrived after 69 hours of waiting. AND LET ME EDUCATE YOU. IT was ASTRONOMICALLY DISGUSTING. THE PLATE WAS A SHAMEFUL SHADE OF GREEN AND DECORATED WITH A SOMEHOW MORE DISGUSTING GREEN FLORAL DESIGN. THE FOOD LOOKED LIKE ROADKILL TO SAY THE LEAST. I WANTED TO VOMIT AT THE SIGHT OF THIS. AND DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE SMELL. FINALLY THEY DIDN’T EVEN GIVE ME UTENSILS FOR MY FOOD WHICH BY THE WAY WAS A BOWL OF SOUP. IN CONCLUSION.
