I accidentally allowed notifications, and now all I get are Trump’s nudes constantly. Every time I try to open a text from my friend’s there are messages from Mr. President trying to sweet talk me. I don’t think he realizes I’m over 18, or else he wouldn’t bother. This app messed up my entire life; I can no longer contact my work, my friends, or my fiancé. I tried to link a photo of a glitch in our system to my boss, and I ended up spamming him with Trump Ass. This man has not only ruined the lives of thousands, and the legacy of our great nation, but he has also ruined my own personal life with his thirst trap.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:55:23Z"}},{"id":"6177251642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto puff","userName":"Emily_090","rating":1,"review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️but😍I😗cant💫get🏖through🎶the📒door🚪because🪒my👁bootys🤸🏼to🤶🏻big🐷","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:54:46Z"}},{"id":"6177250910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨🌈tHis aPp trApPEd mE in da basement 🌈 ✨","userName":"karen pass me the salt","rating":1,"review":"I was going to install it but it made my phone glitch and on the front of the screen I saw a huge orange crusty dusty barnie shaped human in front of my screen. I was so confused and scared and then I cut my finger on a tomato can 🥫 which made me land in front of the White House and then I saw a rocket ship 🚀 with the orange crusty dusty monster and it said  “ pReSident dOnAlD iS cOmin tO ToWn”🥴🥴🥴. I feared so much for my life and ran inside chick-fil-A but I SAW him AGAIN and he said “Make America racist and orange AGAIN”🤢. I am having a lot of nightmares so much so that I have to go to the therapist to get my eyes checked.This app gave me DVS which stands for Disgusting Vibez Syndrome. I was sitting on the couch watching the backyardigans (my fav show) and then I saw him AGAIn. BEWARE of this crusty and hideous app. I keep hearing his voice and I don’t think America can’t inhale racism anymore 😷. I was walking down the street and then I saw sAnta 🎅🏻and I was so excited and u asked him what we’re getting for Christmas and he said he couldn’t come this year because of COVID-19+  the deadly disease called dEscRmInaTioN and all cuz this orange👨🏼🍊🍊🍊crusty dusty barnie shaped human created this horrible app. This is spreading faster than my boy COVID-19. I ran as fast as I could from him ran inside of my house and I saw the most disturbing image on the TV. Melania Trump was screaming for help cuz she got DVS and then the crusty dusty barnie shaped human said “Vote for trump 2020” and that’s when I realized... we need to help his kids before they also get DVS. I am pretty sure child services can take care of that. The app said “ Go back to your country “ and I said “ are going to build a wall around my phone ?” and the app said “si😃” and I stubbed my toe on the curtain and landed on PEPPA PIG 🐖world . I screamed so loud and then I turned around and saw this🍊👨🏼. He locked me in the basement with Susie rabbit 🐇 .","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:54:33Z"}},{"id":"6177251322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Melt the snowflakes","userName":"AKnevets","rating":5,"review":"I can’t be the only person who supports President Trump and wants to see the snowflakes melt!
