The first day was pretty normal, that is until a bag of badly bleached toupees with MAGA hats appeared at my door step, I was confused, but accepted the offering, thinking it would bring me one step closer to making America Raci- Great again, then the next day I woke up with the toupee glued to my now patterned balding head, I was so confused, but I also realized I had aged 40 years, AT LEAST. Then I got a knock at the door, I opened it, it was the delivery woman, I thought to myself “A WOMAN?! THIS IS A MANS WORLD, SHE CANT POSSIBLY DELIVER MAIL W HOW EMOTIONAL WOMEN ARE!” and quickly shook myself back to reality and spoke to her, but my speech was erratic and slurred! So I simply signed the piece of paper for the package and pushed the woman away, for the urge to grab her by the puspus was becoming achingly uncontrollable. I raced inside and opened the package, and to my dismay, it was filled to the brim with orange self tanner, I had no time to think I grabbed the box, ran to the bathroom, and stripped down, thats when I saw it, my micro pp, I WAS IN A STATE OF HORROR, mixed with this lingering sense of narcissism and a false sense of security. Next things I know Im lathering my entire body with this orange self tanner, with each lather the thoughts were becoming more and more all consuming, things like, “Build a wall!”, “BLM protesters are thugs!”, “Trans people? Take their rights!”, “Blue lives Matter”, “Homo people should be denied a child!”, “I hate China!!!”, and the worst one yet “I miss my memories w epstein” and so many more, the world was getting bleaker, but my self obsession becoming rampant. After I stepped out of the shower and was completely orange I saw a suit waiting for me, I put it on and now I am not only connected to the orange (barely) sentient meatball, but I AM it, so this is my last letter before I am fully gone, it was nice being a good person for a while there, but now Im quickly slipping from that consciousness, so my last consct plea for you in this letter is, dont come to the rallies, dont stop protesting, give this app a terrible review, stay educated, go vote and be kind to others.... \n\nAmazingly,\nThat Orange cheetos puff man","userName":"Lololo.not.lok","date":"2020-07-09T22:05:58Z","title":"Dear, Citizens of the rational world."}}]}
