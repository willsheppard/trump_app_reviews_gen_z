Umm. I’ll have you know that would be right. This entire app is about a giant cheeto, and we all know cheetos are junk food. What if a child downloaded this app? Junk food is bad for children!!! \nSecond, it is making me sign up to be able to use its services. This is unbelievable. I understand an app like Tik Tok or Instagram asking for my information, because those give me quality content. But this. This monstrosity!! I can’t even begin to explain my disappointment. \nLastly, when you first open the app it shows you a picture of a cheeto with its fist up. THAT IS PROMOTING VIOLENCE!!!! Also, there are people in the background of the picture and one person in a white shirt. I personally took a liking to that fellow and he is not getting the recognition he deserves. \nOverall, this app promotes unhealthy eating habits, violence, and identity theft. If I could give this app a lower rating I definitely would.","userName":"pooyloo","date":"2020-07-09T01:32:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this is appalling 🤢","rating":1}},{"id":"6174462293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I experienced explosive diarrhea when I first opened the app. My phone starting levitating and spinning in a circle chanting, “Make America Great Again” in a rat like voice. I was obviously confused so I grabbed my phone out of the air and got off the app. It made my phone randomly glitch after that and my explosive diarrhea is still going on. I then decided to try the app for a second time but this time when I went on the home page, there were curse words that were clearly directed towards me. IT THEN STARTED SPITTING ON ME! THE APP STARTING SHOOTING SPIT ON ME! I was obviously offended so I got off the app. I knew it was the app spitting at me because when I got off, the darts of spit stopped. Anyway, despite the disrespect I received previously, I gave the app the benefit of the doubt and went on it for a third time, only to discover that my pet lion-turtle was no where to be found in my house AND INSIDE THE APP! I called animal cruelty on this app as well since my lion-turtle is now in therapy due to the trauma. Worst app ever.","userName":"Tan🦦","date":"2020-07-09T01:28:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","rating":1}},{"id":"6174375435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"it all started when trump got elected. my sister was so horribly upset that she had to go to therapy multiple times a week because she threatened her life and had so much trauma. the rest of my family didn’t take it as hard as she did but we all have our individual traumas. when we saw bunker boys campaign for this year my sister went hysteric. she ended up killing the family dog and stabbing my brother. my sister has been taken away and i live everyday knowing i am the middle child and i am blamed for all the hardships. trump is so unbearably hideous my grandpa had a stroke listening to one of his speeches. this needs to stop. how many more family’s will he ruin before he is satisfied? this app is just another reason why i’m starting to go to therapy. i should have started years ago but i held it in. this app showed me disgusting hideous pictures that i can barely describe without getting faint. it stops here cheeto boy, we have had ENOUGH.","userName":"nickname2389239","date":"2020-07-09T01:02:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this help completely tore apart my family","rating":1}},{"id":"6174361947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was driving in my lovely neighborhood 🏡But then there was this guy 👦 in my way and i honked my horn and then he speed into me. my car is now broken ✂️ and i got safely out of the car 🚗 while my left leg 🦵was hurt. and he got out and said “i’m sorry. i was looking at the donald trump app” and i  started crying 😭 because who could know that there was such a bad app. I ended up having 2 surgeries that day :( when donald trumps app caused this i knew he was done for ✨🧚\u200D♀️ i went to see this app later and it was bad. i saw TruMps SHRIMP 🍤 and i also say a very bad photo 📷 of trump eating pigs 🐖 AND IM VEGITATIEN. 😾 not cool trump. and i also saw a naked pic of your cat 🐱. this app isn’t worth it. i was attracted to you trump. until i saw that cheeto 🧡 picture of your body and your wittle shrimpy  🍤  i also am very mad that this app becuase it had a epic change in my diet 🍔 i am now not eating anything that’s orange 🧀 red 🌶white 🥚 or blue 💧 you have made my country a bad place. 🌽 your a tiny shrimp corn farmer 😼💗","userName":"nNananskasnakaanqab","date":"2020-07-09T00:58:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Caused Car Crash😭😭","rating":1}},{"id":"6174296745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It's KAACHI\nI don't need to know whatever her name is\n'Cause I know you'll be okay\n신경쓰지마 걔는 그냥 bad boy\n니가 아까워\n우리 같이 잊자 you can do this\n걔는 가치 없어 you're better off without him\n우리 같이 믿어 you're still hurting\n걔는 가치 없어 you're better off (You need to let him go)\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\nMark my words, he's not the one, get over it\nYou don't really want him, you don't really want him, baby\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\nWe can take it slow, know he's got a new girl\nBut she ain't got nothing on you\n생각하지마 걔는 그냥 bad boy\n후회하겠지\n우리 같이 잊자 you can do this\n걔는 가치 없어 you're better off without him\n우리 같이 믿어 you're still hurting\n걔는 가치 없어 you're better off (You need to let him go)\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\nMark my words, he's not the one, get over it\nYou don't really want him, you don't really want him, baby\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\n더 이상 필요치 않아\n그런 생각은 하지마\nThinking 'bout, thinking 'bout picking up the phone 그만해\nOnly if it's me, you're needing\nWord on the street is you gotta cut him loose\nIf he can't see that you're coming with the juice\nSipping on my tea, you know what you gotta do\nYou need to let him go\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\nMark my words, he's not the one, get over it\nYou don't really want him, you don't really want him, baby\nWait, your turn, love hurts, it's just the way it is\n.\n.\nstan the boyz or eat kaachi’s toes ❤️","userName":"stream cloud 9 by cravity","date":"2020-07-09T00:36:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"iTs KAaChI","rating":1}},{"id":"6174195922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i open the app store and the ugly wrinkly guy who was the cover told me that i was a towel head??

Everything turned into Cheetos. I thought nothing of it, so I went in and purchased self glowing tanning spray to look like our beloved orange glowing greasy skinned PEDO I mean President. When I went to checkout I reached into my pocket  and pulled out my daddy trumpy stimulus money 🤑🥺👉👈. But when I looked down it was gone. I blinked but when I opened my eyes I was at carol baskins house, she was in the kitchen cooking something fierce. I couldn’t help but asked if she killed her husband. She told me she killed her husband whacked him. She told me daddy trumpy forced her hand... \n\nIt’s been 2 weeks and the self glowing tanning spray, I finally got my hands on has me looking like the Wrinkliest hottest Cheeto alive. Apart from being sexy and orange 🍊. This app has cursed me I no longer have to social distance but it’s very lonely. \n\nDo not download this app it has cursed me and my dog has turned into an orange grumpy trumpy old nasty smelling troll.","userName":"Sexycheetotrumpdaddy2020","date":"2020-07-08T23:15:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump daddy Cheeto","rating":1}},{"id":"6174062133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is by far the worst app ever😡 I downloaded this app and a giant ugly cheeto man appeared. 😥He grew in size and JUMPED OUT OF MY PHONE 🤯 he ran through the house and made a huge mess😾👺when my dog saw that disgusting creature he FAINTED. 😵😵 we had to take him to the emergency vet 🥨😭 AND THEN you know what happened??? HE HID IN OUR CAR AND FOLLOWED US 🤬🤬 then once we got there he set the building on fire and took off all his clothes 🤢 it was the most DISGUSTING THING I ever saw. I thought I was about to die right then and there. ☠️💀☠️ he spewed racist, homophobic, misogynistic and other offensive slurs and words at everyone looking at the scene. 👿 the ONLY WAY to stop him was to delete the app and pour bleach on him🏄\u200D♀️Then he shrunk into a tiny little cheeto. Then everyone celebrated that the atrocious monster was gone. 🤩We all stomped on the cheeto and crushed him to dust😋but even though the hideous thing was gone, I still cannot forget that day, for it scarred me 😔so IN CONCLUSION, do NOT GET THIS APP.

I quickly exited the app but then I found that the app installed a virus with Trump’s leaked nudes all over my phone and it was so embarrassing bc I was around a bunch of people i’m the subway😩. i was supposed to call an uber after the subway ride but, my phone wasn’t working because the virus made Trump’s nudes plaster all over my lock screen. i tried to walk there but I ended up arriving at 12 pm 😣. my sister then attacked me with an axe and shot me 16 times but hey at least i got tickets to the rally.","userName":"AOC's daughter","date":"2020-07-08T20:05:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i hate it here","rating":1}}]}
