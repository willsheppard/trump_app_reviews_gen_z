I then started getting a ton of text messages from Trump Administration. After exiting out of it and reopening it my phone screen completely turns black and started glitching out like crazy. I spent $150 to get my phone fixed and get all of my photos and messages rebooted. I have had phone problems ever since, my battery is constantly drained my phone is full of viruses and it has now used my phone number and texted all of my family and friends Messages from me based as trump as if they signed up for it. I‚Äôm not even typing this on my phone because it‚Äôs completely ruined now my iCloud has been hacked and none of my apps will even open. This app is terrible!","title":"CAUSES VIRUSES!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Cü•Ä"}},{"id":"6174940805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:48:56Z","review":"My phone was fine before this app but after I downloaded it, all of my contacts started to get random texts telling them not only to download this app, but to send all they own to gina. It then caused my phone to morph into a cockroach human morph and take my dogs on walks. The cockroach then cleaned the entire house but somehow everything ended up on the ceiling. I tried deleting the app but the cockroach began following me around and peeing everywhere. The app then downloaded itself onto my computer and my iPad as well as started playing all of Donald trumps speeches while the cockroach peed in my corner. Because of this app, my phone is now a cockroach who stares at me from the corner of my room. The app developers might want to fix this bug in the app. Horrible!","title":"Stole all my information","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Bobinna üôä"}},{"id":"6174874774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:29:17Z","review":"First of all I wanna start by saying that this app is terrible it took 3 weeks to download idk how that's possible, as I was finally opening the app it made my phone glitch then an orange face with corn hair popped up in the screen I got super scared and also my dog got scared he ran away. This app made my phone break it has cost me a lot of money this app is trying to terrorize people. I almost forgot it also has ads with horrible music playing racial slurs that's unacceptable. Before my phone broke because of this app the app would always last 3 seconds opened then it closed and when I opened it again an orange face with a double chin popped up and winked at me that orange face was always eating McDonald's with Karen and Karen looked at me with a ugly face","title":"Made my dog get scared and ran away bc of this app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"AntiKarenAntiTrump"}},{"id":"6174852353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:22:42Z","review":"How unbelievable. When I downloaded this app, I expected nothing less than my racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and bigotry personality traits to be treated with respect. After I downloaded this, however, I was recommended other apps that show me facts backed by professionals in their field of expertise that disprove my beliefs, and some that even denounce the idea that Trump is anything but the perfect embodiment of what a democratic presidency should be. All He (yes with a capital H) should have to see is perfect submission from those who call themselves Americans. How is my great, holy, and perfect president supposed to lead us with other people telling me this app only gratified my negative and degrading behaviors? I‚Äôm in disbelief. One day, I pray, that this will be the only app available to the great people of this amazing and perfect nation.","title":"Unbelievable","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"cowgirl lover"}},{"id":"6174826465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:15:06Z","review":"My rhino left for the store to go pick him out for a little bit of the time I will let go of it all over again I just don‚Äôt know how much it will get him back in time for y‚Äôall lol lol I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not going back and I wanna watch is it gonna was the night and I wanna do ya think ya know what I mean for ya sure lol lol omg was a great time for ya to go be back at wuwiquwuqqowu this is a horrible app for ya ya know ya girl lol ya ya girl lol omg omg is a time of time for y‚Äôall lol omg was my time for ya girl in the world and then I‚Äôm in tueiruworuwir this world to hell I love y‚Äôall and I can‚Äôt get enough people for ya girl ya know wieuwyeoeyw ya know what you mean lol lol omg was a great night and I love y‚Äôall sleeping and I wanna watch it was a good day for y‚Äôall to be a great person to me omg is a great night for ya girl and Kayden and ya ya girl and ya ya boy ya ya know lol lol omg was a omg","title":"WORST APP TO EVER EXIST","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Dhotfvbhfscbjfd256799731"}},{"id":"6174822792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:14:02Z","review":"This app took weeks to download and it started playing this awful music and me and my family‚Äôs ears starting bleeding and we had to take my mother and grandmother to the hospital and grandmother died because of your terrible music this app should be deleted!

Let me tell you, this app makes the corona virus look like a blessing. His mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork. The first thing that popped up was just a photo of a Cheeto. You know, I thought, that‚Äôs fine, nothing weird about that! THEN the Cheeto started talking. It told me it‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúWyatt S. Premicy‚Äù. No red flags there, but just you wait. THE CHEETO STARTS TO STRIP OFF ITS CLOTHING, AND STARTS TO TWERK. WHAT IS HAPPENING. Then, fortunately, the app glitched out, and I couldn‚Äôt get back in; giving me no option but to delete it. Then a man showed up at my door and shoved me in his trunk, and he told me he worked for the president. He took me to the White House, and that‚Äôs when it all fell into place. The man running our country isn‚Äôt a man at all. It‚Äôs just a Cheeto in a man costume. I wish I was joking.
