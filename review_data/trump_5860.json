It literally caused a sharp increase in COVID 19 cases! It also used racial and xenophobic slurs continually. After a voice recording from President Tr*mp told me that he would turn the country into a fascist police state and crush those who opposed him! Then in the hangman section I couldn’t decide if the missing letter in “ra_ist” was a perfect or ‘c.’ Do not get this app, most likely it will end up destroying our country before too long.","rating":1,"title":"Wouldn’t it be a shame...","userName":"Addie Kholin","date":"2020-07-09T02:57:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174753179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to get updates on Trump and his Presidential Campaign what I got instead is HORRIFYING!!! This downloaded a HORRIBLE virus to all my electronically devices INCLUDING my tv. I had to purchase all new devices. It sends notifications every minute, which is EXTREMELY annoying. I turned off the notifications yet I STILL received them. The setup of this app makes no sense. I can hardly access any of the information because of the HORRIBLE setup of this app. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PUT OUT AN APP AS HORRIBLE AND UNORGANIZED AS THIS ONE. but at the same he is horrible so i can’t say i’m surprised.","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","userName":"unicornssssdssz","date":"2020-07-09T02:53:04Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174750533","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible I went to get some coffee yesterday and they turned into chicken nuggets!!! So then I decided to go brush my teeth and my sink said “I only like my water if it’s American” like what the heck! I DONT CARE WAT WATER IT IS!! So then I went to go tell my mom and saw Michael Jackson sitting in her room I said “what are u doing in my moms room!” He said “hEHe” then i knew what was going on the government put cameras in my room and stuffed dinosaurs under my bed”! I then asked my sleep paralysis demon do u think lemonade or pink lemonade is good he said “crocodile”!!        And this is why u shouldn’t download this app.","rating":1,"title":"Why this app is not my sunshine!!!","userName":"Blake Baxter","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174735778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as you launch the app is starts shouting out racial slurs and telling me to go back to my country. I would have NEVER expected the leader of our country to say such things, I am shocked not surprised. Then a picture of a person who looked like they had a skid mark on their face appeared, I am assuming that is Mr. Trump. It was so difficult to not projectile vomit onto my phone screen, and I failed to hold back the contents of my stomach. Now my phone permanently smells of bile and warm Takis because that’s what I had for a snack this evening. I am not pleased. #getthisskidmarkoffmyscreen","rating":1,"title":"Terrible, horrible and no good","userName":"cheetoluver5000","date":"2020-07-09T02:47:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174644985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app was faulty, had many glitches and the news was too Conservative party oriented. It clearly supported the Trump ideals of racism, sexism, homophobia and general inequality, so I do not recommend this platform. Also, it would completely slow my phone down and caused it to crash. There was also several windows it would somehow open and these took hours to delete. I WOULD GIVE THE APP ZERO STARS IF I COULD!!!! Additionally it would be much better if the app was deleted completely and I hope it does. I do not recommend this app to anyone who has the correct mindset and is sane.","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVERRRRRR 🤬🤬","userName":"Falconstrike","date":"2020-07-09T02:20:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174689999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worse I have ever had.
