Some of them were telling me to “climb back over the boarder you immigrant, Cuban scum signed -congress 😘😘” I’m not an immigrant but I have no idea how they knew I was Cuban because I didn’t give them any of my personal information. Then I got a message saying that if I didn’t vote 🤢🤮Trump 2020🤮🤢 I would get deported! This app is extremely hostile towards people who aren’t cis, white and straight! 100/10 would NOT recommend.","title":"This app is ✨horrible✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"coolguy✊🏿😎","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177409129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"okay, so when i first opened the app I noticed that a ✨🦎🧀cheeto lizard🧀🦎✨ was staring at me. i was immediately frightened to my core. I proceeded to start pooping💩 my🧍\u200D♀️ pants👖. worst part is, i didn’t make it to the bathroom in time because the app cast a spell on me to poop straightaway. yikes! right? to make matters worse the orange wrinkle asked for my phone number. i was really not🙅\u200D♀️ interested in him🤷\u200D♀️. he was no where near my type bc i’m not into “human-to-centipede” relationships! when I clicked “terms and policies” i was shown a picture of a 7 million year olds cheeto weewee🦐. it was a traumatizing experience🙈. never get this app😝","title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"read😻","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:06Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177408546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has given me mental and emotional trauma after downloading. After taking DAYS on end to download, it started messing up my phone and hacking all my accounts. Everytime I would type something a ‘🍊’ emoji would pop up between every word. As I was scrolling through the app to try and get a better understanding of why people support croissant man 😻, I was getting the urge to be more racist and sexist after looking at what he stands for. Felt like idk maybe brainwashing, yk?? Then I would hear these voice right? okay and they would tell me to “v0t3 tRumP 2o20” and I felt attacked and uncomfortable. And on top of that the app kept spinning on my phone ♋️ and just would move around my screen and make it impossible to use and it would shove its oppressing and unlawful movements in my face, like a constant pop up add no one asked for 😾. ANYWAY this app stinks butt and would not recommend to anyway 🥰","title":"Absolute ✨Trash✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"Buster331","date":"2020-07-09T16:39:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177408430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP THIS APP IS FAKE NEWS I WOULD RATRE IT -10000/10000 WORST APP IN THE WORLD 🤢","title":"Why this app EXISTS","isEdited":false,"userName":"karenshaircut","date":"2020-07-09T16:39:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177408282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"oh no is the trump administration sad  because gen z hurt their feewings:(((( are they feewing a wittle scawed because the mean tweenagers are being mean :((((((( whatever will they do :((((","title":"little piss baby stinky man","isEdited":false,"userName":"charr777","date":"2020-07-09T16:39:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177407473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app to show my support for the president because i’m a “gReaT pAtrIOtiC cOnSErVitiVe” but the app took 6 months to download. when the app FINALLY downloaded, Donald himself asked for my name and zip code. me being concerned, i ask our lord and savior if this is the right, conservative, republican thing to do. i mean he has A 14 YEAR OLD CHILD (#savebarron2020). so soon after that the app closed itself and hacked my roblox account and soon as you know it, my roblox character is slowly turning into a oompa loompa and playing scented cons! i deleted the app soon after that but then my phone self destructed. soon the FBI, the CIA, TRUMP HIMSELF, showed up at my house. they all detained me and now i am writing this from the white house secret prison.

Honestly I opened the app for some ✨education✨ but was instead greeted by an oversized Cheeto puff? Is that some kind of inside joke I’m supposed to understand? Very unprofessional. Then soon strange things started occurring, my monkey plush started chanting ancient grimlen language and summoned a ufo and I got abducted. I let the aliens look at the app and they screeched in pain as the app burned their skin and even killed a few of them, and so I got immediately beamed back to earth, and all because of this app. Not a very pleasant experience. -1000000/10. I don’t know what kind of tricks you people are trying to pull but I won’t stand for it😡.
