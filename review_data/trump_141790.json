I was confused at what was happening and then I saw this scary video of Trump saying if I didn’t buy his merch he would kill me. I decided to buy his merch because I love my president and then all of my personal data got released. After that the app took all my money from my credit cards and my social security number. Then, it gave my phone a terrible virus but I didn’t care and ignored it (just like Trump did). Lastly, my phone exploded when I was using it and I had to go to the hospital. Don’t worry though I made sure I didn’t wear a mask, but I unfortunately got covid. I am very angry at this app because I am now on a ventilator. I am suing President Trump for what he has done to me!","title":"trump2020🧚🏾 in jail","isEdited":false,"userName":"bhavya_s"}},{"id":"6179389703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:14:04Z","review":"Tried to use it, sent all my information some where, started getting bot calls, so gross","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"21 son 😈🙌🏾"}},{"id":"6179389643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:14:03Z","review":"Sorry I don’t think fascism should be on the App Store whoops","title":"0/10","isEdited":false,"userName":"harperisa"}},{"id":"6179389662","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T04:14:03Z","review":"I was really looking forward to this app to keep up with everything but instead it was slow, made my phone crash, and was so confusing to use.

You know what they say! BUT!!! All the information on my phoen disappeared. My photos, messages, contacts, all gone. The only applications on my phone where the default apple applications and this app.... and I still cannot open it. DO NOT get this app, there are definitely better ways to support.","title":"HORRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alhjcf"}}]}
