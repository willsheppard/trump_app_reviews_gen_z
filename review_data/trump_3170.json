After giving the app my phone number I had begun getting numerous calls from unknown numbers. Now as any rational person I decided to pick up these phone calls. But every time I did the song Baby by Justin Bieber was playing on the other line. This had led me to no longer answer these calls. But now my phone has begun switching languages on me. One second I’m typing in English and the next I’m typing in Cantonese I don’t speak Cantonese!!! Nor do I have the keyboard on my phone. My phone screen has begun glitching numerous times and I had just gotten a new phone so I do not understand why this is happening.","userName":"Dear God, why?","isEdited":false,"title":"Do Not Recommend ."}},{"id":"6175038070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T04:19:44Z","rating":1,"review":"this app literally stole my pet fox. his name was mcflurry and i used to feed him to my crickets but this app took mcflurry from me. it also informed me that i could get a new mcflurry from mcdonalds or dairy queen but neither places had a mcflurry. i then told my pet elephant to go buy me a fridge because it also stole that! i wish that i still had my microwave (that was also stolen) so i could microwave my pet fish. i sometimes wish that my big truck could go buy me a different elephant that could actually find a mcflurry. moral of the story, this app completely took my life away (including my precious microwave) so i rate this a 1 star app. i hope this app gets deleted bc i miss my microwave and all the fun times i had with it. 😾😥","userName":"yuck fou😘","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6174925220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:44:10Z","rating":1,"review":"If i could rate this -10 stars i would. Worst app i have literally ever downloaded in my entire life. This was incredibly glitchy, there were so many ads, it kept showing random pop ups, kept crashing, horribly organized, loaded so slowly, just quite literally the most horrible app in the app store hands down. I am so disgusted and disappointed with this, wow. I have no more words to say except this app should go. Nobody should have to endure this type of torture. I would rather sleep on a bed of nails underneath a sumo wrestler drenched in sweat and lemon juice while a screaming baby cries in my ear all night long nonstop in a brightly lit fluorescent room surrounded by feces. That is how i feel about this monstrosity of an app.","userName":"Sarahgirl98","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174784356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:02:36Z","rating":1,"review":"i am horrified by this app. ☠️💀for starters right when you open it up you are greeted with a walking and talking perverted💩, racists🤢, fascist🤮, sexist 🤡orange🤢🍊. i am afraid that if i compared him to a trash i would offend the trash😬✨. i am now afraid that this app has spread a virus on my phone because of the ridiculous ideas that it has been spreading. is it a joke?😻 cuz the only thing that i am laughing at is the dumb cheeto who thinks that he can lead a country.🙉 CRAZY RIGHT?!? 😹in conclusion i think that this app should be taken down asap and the angry orange man in office should probably back down before gen z goes extreme x games mode on him, because trust be when i say that we are just getting warmed up. 🤘\nanyways, only love💕✨💐","userName":"😈dumpy trumpy😈","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️💕😻✨icky☀️🌸💐"}},{"id":"6174735909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:47:46Z","rating":1,"review":"this app is truly ridiculous. my phone was completely fine before i downloaded it, and then, i started getting a bunch of stupid notifications talking about trump. like, i could care less🙄. then my phone started glitching horribly. my amazing father had used up his money to buy me this amazing iphone seven just for me to download this app and have my phone lag and glitch. also, like the other reviews said, some of my stuff started to go missing. yesterday, i had a flag that said biden 2020 and it went missing! today, i drove by the white house and i saw it in their trash! ugh the disrespect smh 🤦\u200D♀️ then i couldn’t find my pet duck. he was orange just like trump. no wonder trump stole him from me.","userName":"megajdgsjdh","isEdited":false,"title":"RIDICULOUS."}},{"id":"6174556005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:55:40Z","rating":1,"review":"Prologue - Donald J Trump was a simple man in a disgusting, thinking world. A world, where the Mexicans had control. He and his hair piece had their simple, animalistic desires for food, sex and building a wall.\n\nAdolf Hitler was a like-minded simple man in a disgusting, Semitic world. The Jews roamed free like wild dogs. He and his moustache, a square patch of hair and fascism, lacked any desire for a wall. Not after Berlin.\n\nChapter One -\n\nDonald Trump and Adolf Hitler walked towards each other - as if in slow motion - across two opposing sides of Sword Beach, Normandy. Trump's hair flapped majestically in the breeze like a Sting Ray in a wind turbine; the bulge of his wallet squeezing against his thigh, trying to tear that small loan of a million dollars through his Brioni suit pants.\n\nHitler strode through the sand, clad in Lederhosen. The tight leather pushing and pressing against his...diary, Mein Kock. Only the sand and an Armani tie seprated them.\n\n\"Adolf.\" Trump called, his voice stained thick with a Queens accent. \"Ja, Trump?\" Hitler began to break out in a nervous sweat. Nervous in case their meeting didn't go to plan. Nervous because -\n\n\"I may not be a postman,\" Trump continued \"but I 'ave a 'uge package for you.\"","userName":"pottie the hottie","isEdited":false,"title":"Papi trump 🥵"}},{"id":"6174420826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:16:25Z","rating":1,"review":"My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible. You just watched a TTI, on Disney Channel.","userName":"Charming Ultrastrong","isEdited":false,"title":"Oh the read without my ears👁👄👁👂🏽"}},{"id":"6174351318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:54:52Z","rating":1,"review":"I decided to download this app to deposed of the radical left but once I did out of nowhere the oranges 🍊 in my kitchen started floating towards me and suddenly all theses oranges 🍊 started floating around me then they started shaking immensely then suddenly trump 🍊face appears on the oranges 🍊 saying grab them by their pu$$ies then my pet cat 🐱 started floating and all the other cats came right after 😰😰😰I immediately grabbed my phone to delete the app but then the trump 🍊face oranges 🍊 started calling me a Democrat and I drop the phone and drop to the ground sobbing then suddenly this song started playing my president black my lambo blue then BARACK OBAMA BURST THROUGH MY WIDOW GRABBED MY PHONE AND DELETED THE APP AND STARTED SINGING LIFT EVERY VOICE LEAVING OUT THE WIDOW the cats and the oranges 🍊 followed him back out 😁","userName":"c-thing","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6174330943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:48:03Z","rating":1,"review":"so i was going about my day scrolling through my favorite app (the app store) and came across this HORRIFIC app i downloaded like ever single other app and IT DOES NOT PROMOTE TOOTHPASTE USE!
