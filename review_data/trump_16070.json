Yes that’s because I feel betrayed , this app was supposed to keep me informed with everything that has been going on with trump but it kept glitching and wouldn’t let me get on other apps such as fb or Twitter , I hope this shows you guys to be careful with apps         \n\n.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT WILL SPAM YOU. Also it is very inappropriate I cannot believe the horrible things on there this app should be frowned upon it is horrific that a president could do something so astronomically terrible DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:39Z","userName":"omg just send already!"}},{"id":"6173154594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App","review":"This app made me put my phone number in and made my phone blow up while I was trying to sleep. 😠 It was also horrible how long it took me to sign in. I was just looking to find out what votes were but I couldn’t even find where they would be at!! This app is not constructed well at all!! They should delete it and they should have trump out of the office. It’s a no from me ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T17:50:04Z","userName":"trumpno"}},{"id":"6173115958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I’m disgusted","review":"This app is  horrific. It gave my phone a virus and shortly after a CIA agent showed up at my door and through my new born son across the dining room. The app proceeded to provide  me with some absolutely inappropriate advertisements, I will not go in to detail but I will say there was a cat and there was a bear and it was unnatural and due to it, I am going to church twice this week and praying an extra ten minutes before bed. Disgusting.","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:54Z","userName":"chloe_was_taken"}},{"id":"6173084466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!!","review":"This is the worst app I have ever seen😡😡😡 it took three plus hours to download, it glitches, the user interface so hard do use It’s like it’s built for an 🍊 Crayola crayon. Not to mention the flashing strobe lights nearly gave my grandmother a seizure. Not to mention this app is easily accessible to foreign nations so they can easily get your information so I would not recommend downloading the corrupt app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:27:46Z","userName":"Lucariochamp18"}},{"id":"6173067508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🍊🍊Trumps Tanning Guy🍊🍊","review":"If I could give this app a zero, I would!!!! As soon as I downloaded the app my house lit on fire. THIS IS TERRIBLE. Don’t get me wrong I love the beautiful man beast we call Trump, with is pretty hair and his perfect skin, but when I tell you this fire wasn’t even as orange as our president. THIS APP IS TERRIBLE🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮 DISGUSTING🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢 AND APPALLING 🤢🤮🤢🤮 I WAS WALKING ACROSS THE STREET (on the app ofc) TRYING TO SUPPORT THE 🍊PRESIDENT🍊WHEN I WAS HIT BY A TRUMP 2020 BUS. I broke 69 bones in my body and fractured 420. If this man isn’t out of office, I MIGHT SUE!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:22:16Z","userName":"jfjwhejf"}},{"id":"6173045401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Unacceptable glitch","review":"I downloaded this app and it made my phone glitch so bad it would have my phone do stuff on its own like Siri would turn on out of nowhere it would have my phone call random numbers and FaceTime random people and I don’t think that is a good impression for this app so therefore I don’t think anyone should download this app or even be able to download this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:15:14Z","userName":"mammdjfindnnsndnc"}},{"id":"6173016403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I might be ded","review":"So when I opened this app... I almost started crying. When I saw an Orange I was very confused. I didn’t know i president was orange AND racist🤭 well what I’m here for is because I have trust issues and depression. But yanno I’m not going to vote for an orange who has no idea what they are doing. He’s racist, overall dumb, he doesn’t like trans people, he called the corona virus a hoaxe, and MUCH more. Overall I’m terrified. \n\n                   😙✌🏻oH TO sEe wItHoUT mY eYEs 👀","date":"2020-07-08T17:06:14Z","userName":"YO HOME GORL GREW"}},{"id":"6172999829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"😹😹😹","review":"this app is HORRIBLE. why would people WANT to vote for trump again? he’s literally racist, homophobic, and xenophobic. did i mention he’s a r@pist too? trump 2020 stans don’t even want to listen to our reasons on why he’s a good president other than calling us “snowflakes” or saying “it’s taken out of context”. imagine saying “all lives matter” but all of a sudden when it comes to lgbtq+ lives and colored lives y’all wanna stay quiet.","date":"2020-07-08T17:01:15Z","userName":"uhmidklol"}}]}
