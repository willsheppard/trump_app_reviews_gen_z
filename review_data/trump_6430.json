Then when I tried going to another app music started playing from this app and scared my dinosaur pet. I’m so frustrated I can’t do anything with this app! Also why support Trump just saying he’s trying to ban Tik Tok because of a RALLY!! That’s not fair Gen z is COMING FOR TRUMP!! Now we shall rise. Anyways I’m also colorblind and the colors in the app hurt my eye for some reason and it was hard to see. I also didn’t understand why it’s so hard to even sign in. Overall the app is underrated.","date":"2020-07-08T16:44:40Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"My Own Experience"}},{"id":"6172819981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"yikes bro","review":"this app is horrible!!!! when it finally took an eon to download, it started playing some wack ooga booga music and my wig got snatched from how ugly trump looks on the front page!! lookin like a whole 🍊. anyways, after i signed up, i heard a knock at my door. i walked outside to see what/who it was. and it was TRUMP AND HIS ARMY OF OTHER LITTLE OOMPA LOOMPAS TRYING TO ATTACK ME AND MY DOG! i screamed and ran inside after, i locked my doors, and i started writing this review. i SwEaR everything i'm saying here us true!! this app is disgusting and almost killed me just because of that big fat 🍊 with a 🍤. welp, that's all i have to say. bye, MWAH✨🧚🤪💕🙈","date":"2020-07-08T16:06:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"s2phie"}},{"id":"6172692875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app gave me ligma","review":"I downloaded this app in order to learn more about the president but I soon found out that it was possibly the worst app. First of all when I tried opening it and it crashes like 5 seconds after. I uninstalled it and installed it again and had the same problem. Other than that right after i downloaded it I started feeling sick and turns out I have caught ligma. Doctor told me to delete app immediately and Im writing this review to warn other about the potential risk of downloading this app. Don't fall victim to this trash app. 🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T15:30:05Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Manee<333"}},{"id":"6172667114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No✨💕","review":"I don’t even know where to begin. First of all, all the fake reviews are horrible. They all say it’s so amazing and an easy to use app. Wrong. It took a week to download and then wouldn’t even open!! I just wanted an app to follow our ~amazing~ cheetoh puff’s plans but nOoOo. I wish I could give it a lower rating. He’s done so much for us, racism is coming back stronger than ever, our entire country can’t work together because of parties. The one thing that’s gone wrong is poor Trump’s bff Epstein died alone😭 I just know he wishes he was with him🙏🏻 Anywaaay Trump 2020🧚🏻✨💕 but in a jail cell.","date":"2020-07-08T15:22:49Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"FDT 2020🧚🏻✨💕"}},{"id":"6172656113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Made my brother become possessed","review":"My brother loved this app. Absolutely once when he was on it. I was in my room but I heard the sounds it was a scraping sound. I went to go see what it was and my brothers phone turned into Donald himself!! My brother was possessed he choked are dog. Then here’s the bad part! My brother had cockroaches crawling out of his ears!! And Donald trump ate them😱 I was screaming and ran to go get the cockroach killing spray. My dogs corpse came with me. We ran and got and once we came back, trump had left and my brother was asleep. After that experience We never liked trump again..","date":"2020-07-08T15:19:45Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"baby succulent"}},{"id":"6172634018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Need A New Phone Now","review":"This app took 4 HOURS to download. Once it downloaded I opened the app to set it up and it glitched my phone. It froze for 6 hours! Played the same music over and over. It kept flashing making my eyes BURN. Bugs kept smashing into my phone because of the flashing! I am terrified of bugs. I cried and this app gave me an ANXIETY ATTACK! It’s been 2 days and now I get ads ON MY PHONE. When I’m not even on the app! It randomly glitches. TERRIBLE app do not waste your time supporting this president. If he can’t even fix an app how can he run or fix this country!","date":"2020-07-08T15:13:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Baterout"}},{"id":"6172585328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨Do not get this app ✨","review":"I went to see what the hype was about on tik tok, sense I was suppose to be “good”. I downloaded the app which took a long time to download. Then when I opened it, i saw our orange 🍊 president. I do not want to see that first thing in the morning! But I tried signing in and it kept glitching to him. I decided to shut my phone off then try again. Did not work. So I tried shutting my phone all the way off and trying again. Did not work. So I gave up. Do not get this app if you want to see our orange 🍊 faced president with fake blonde 👱\u200D♀️ hair 24-7.","date":"2020-07-08T14:59:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨👁👅👁✨"}},{"id":"6172562073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Difficult to Log In","review":"I wanted to keep up with our President but it was impossible to sign in! Trump has not done all the things he said he would and with his reaction to Covid, I am disappointed. I love our country but it is a mess right now. I could not sign in to the app even after I created a completely new account. It sounds like others are having similar problems. There are a lot of very bad one star reviews and they might just be satire, but trust me the app is a waste of time. If you want to keep up with Trump his tweets app is really helpful!","date":"2020-07-08T14:53:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"genzbby✨💕"}},{"id":"6172506497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER!!","review":"I was a trump supporter less than four months ago. Now it is safe to say that I absolutely despise Trump and his app. This app has created so many bugs in my iPhone and my iPhone will never be the same since I downloaded this app. I very much regret this downloading this app and I definitely would not recommend downloading and I am also pretty sure that he purposely created this app with bugs and viruses to mess up our phones. If I could get this app a -5 rating I would, trust me. So many issues with this app, so let me give you a tip to not support trump ever!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T14:37:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Crazy cracra yaaas"}},{"id":"6172484070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app ruined my relationship with my sister","review":"this app was horrible!! I downloaded it for information, but it took hours to download and took up all the storage in my phone!! my phone started glitching out so hard I wasn’t able to answer the phone when my sister called to tell me she was in labor! I missed the birth of my nephew because of Trump and this app! it probably takes so long to download because it’s scanning all my personal information and selling it to corporations!!! definitely rethinking my vote in the 2020 election after this!!!","date":"2020-07-08T14:31:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lacerracer222527"}}]}
