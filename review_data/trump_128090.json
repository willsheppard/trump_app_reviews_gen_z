(decode that please) now i am lying in a puddle of my own p*ss and my parents are starting to yell at me. Also, when i downloaded this app, it kept crashing and making my phone glitch. I snap-chatted barron and asked what was going on but all he said was that his dad was on some f*ck sh*t and he advised me to just delete it. After him and I got done making out, i showed him the weird glitches that his daddy's app had brought upon my phone. Barron said there was nothing he could do to help me. He looked kind of sad, so i leaned over and put my head on his shoulder and asked, “Hey Bearbear, are you okay?” To which he reluctantly (and shamefully) exposed his biggest secret.... he is an android user. I am done. First this app crashes my freaking phone and NOW my bearbear is a friggen NOOB? Nuh uh.
