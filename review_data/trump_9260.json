This orangutan 🍊🦧 of a man makes me disappointed in America. This man told u to eat Lysol and said that less testing equal less infected people. Someone take this man back to school so that he can be educated. If my 5 yr old cousin can understand racism and can understand being respectful to each persons differences it should be capable for a full grown man to do the same.

Really laggy to the point i fell off my bed , bumped my head and my momma called the doctor and the doctor said ‘no more jumping on the bed’ . I can no longer have fun because this app ruined my life. When i hit the delete button it went on to tell me that i was forbidden to uninstall it. It then played music which caused my trex to fly which then she broke my roof and died:( . Not only did this app take away my privilege to jump on the bed, it killed my trex.","date":"2020-07-08T18:55:34Z"}},{"id":"6173352487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Terrible App Mr. Orange Bear","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Worst app ever. ZERO STARS. This orange 🍊doesn’t even deserve to be president, this app doesn’t work. It took YEARSS to download and it’s a very annoying app. Why does he even have an app anyways. His wife and Barron doesn’t even want to live with him it seems. He’s using Kanye West for gosh’s sake. Anyways this app as a while is horrible. Too many notifications from this 🍊 🐻. I’m not even interested in all his events. #canceltrump2020app. He doesn’t deserve to be the president after this horrible thing.","date":"2020-07-08T18:55:06Z"}},{"id":"6173325762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😡🤬👎🏼😒🙄🥱","title":"Awful👎🏼","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This is the absolute worst app to EVER exist!!!!!!!

When I opened it, it shared my location with the White House. Once they saw I wasn’t a crazy trump supporter they came to my house!!! My grandma was at the door and got knocked down and beaten up. They broke her ribs and pepper sprayed her. She is now partially blind and in the hospital. I had to run away leaving behind my family. I got taken in by some rabid dogs, but that’s about it. Please do not get this app, and if you do leave a bad review for my grandma and my poor traumatized family 😪","date":"2020-07-08T17:48:09Z"}}]}
