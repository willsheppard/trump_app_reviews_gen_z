DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"this app took about 4 years to download causing my entire phone and LIFE to lag for that amount of time. and if that’s not bad enough, once the app did download, my phone began to glitch and a crackly voice began to speak from it, threatening in very incoherent sentences stating that my job, my family, my quality of existence, and even my LIFE were at stake. when i called for help and asked the creators of this app for change, they responded with “you know i carry, right.” truly... IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE OR THE LIFE OF ANY OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"}},{"id":"6176682272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"god-fearin gun owner","date":"2020-07-09T13:20:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My God-given freedoms😇😇..... TAKEN AWAY BY A “CONSERVATIVE” APP👹👹👹","review":"MY GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO NOT GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO AN APP WAS TAKEN AWAY. Hi I am a lootin-tootin gun-slingin jesus-lovin conservative 🤠who loves three things: god😇, country🇺🇸, and my boots🤠. When I downloaded this app to support MY President, the app asked my for my phone number. This isn’t some commie country🇨🇳 so i don’t know why they want my gosh darn information. This is more scandalous than Hillary Clinton’s emails🤮🤮. If you are a god fearin country loving conservative, do not download this app. It is literally stalinist socialism. Let me repeat. THIS APP IS THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM AND TAKES AWAY MY GOD GIVEN RIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176677535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"El 😪","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"If I could give zero start I would 😤","review":"I am so dissatisfied with this app! It took just about forever to download and on top of that still wouldn’t load when I tapped on the icon. When I finally got in I deemed it totally inappropriate for all users. It’s officially the worst app I have ever used in my life! There are so many aspects that are awful about this app and so many more I could write about but I do not want to spend any more of my life even thinking about anything from our misogynistic president. Zero. Stars."}},{"id":"6176627019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mek1204","date":"2020-07-09T13:06:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"H","review":"Hands down the worst experience I’ve ever had with an app. I thought it would be nice to see what the other side expresses and why they think the way they do, but when I downloaded the app my phone started instantaneously acting as if there was some sort of problem with the brain of my phone. It was almost as if something made its intelligence decline rapidly. Once I was finally able to delete the app, my phone worked a lot better and it seemed that all the problems it was experiencing stopped."}},{"id":"6176440519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"samantha 🤩🤍","date":"2020-07-09T12:15:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"MY LIFE IS RUINED 😭","review":"when i downloaded the app it asked for my phone number and i don’t really feel good about giving my number to some weirdo president. second off this app took forever to download and when it did it RUINED all my data. my phone is completely wiped. this app has made my life so miserable and personally i don’t think it would be an app anymore. this app gave me a weird vibe to it. like weird pedo vibe. so not very comfy with this app. i would NEVER recommend this app to ANYONE EVER. 0/10 don’t recommend. don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6176244159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"louiedaviswithers","date":"2020-07-09T11:18:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"EXTREMELY DANGEROUS","review":"Firstly it took 19 weeks to download, which is OUTRAGEOUS. Along with that, once I downloaded it my phone began to glitch out and not allow me to leave the app. I had to go into the phone store just to get the app surgically removed. ON TOP OF THAT, I believe this app allows the government to listen to us. Once I had downloaded it, I was having a private conversation with a dear friend about how rich I’ve become. THE VERY NEXT MORNING I get a call from the bank to find out that someone hacked my account and took all of money. Coincidence? I THINK NOT"}},{"id":"6175697806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sum06901","date":"2020-07-09T08:21:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRENDOUS APP!!!! 🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app to support MY POTUS who loves and supports me because I am a white human and it IMMEDIATELY crashed!!! When I rebooted the whole thing it asked for my social security number and bank account number to verify my identity! And then it would not let me access content because I am 1/36 Native American!! Not only did this happen but ALSO I started receiving phone calls from Russia asking if I could tell their best friend Donny hello! COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE  APPLE! I say take this down because it’s a SECURITY violation and the Karens of America will rise up and sue!!"}},{"id":"6175639316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"5teph1016","date":"2020-07-09T08:00:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"gave me ptsd","review":"app took multiple days to open and then ads/ viruses for po*n kept popping up. and the app kept glitching out and whenever i opened the app up my phone started to heat up at a very high rate and it nearly crashed. i also turned of my notifications for this app but somehow it still gives me notifications. i was driving and then all of a sudden all i heard was that fat dump trucks voice (donald j trump). it kept telling me to “open the app, open the app”. his voice made my ears bleed and then i drove off a bridge. i just woke up from my 7 day coma and got a new phone and i can still hear his voice 😥. now every time i either his voice or the words “open, the”and or “app”my ptsd is triggered and i wanna cut off my ears and feed them to the lions while multiple animals attack me and eat mu flesh.            thank you"}},{"id":"6175595025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🍄🥰","date":"2020-07-09T07:44:40Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"in shock..","review":"I couldn’t believe what was happening when i opened my app. it said download complete and i lost every single piece of data on my phone, from pictures to numbers. The app took all my identity’s and i found out a day after the my email was being used, i found random transactions on my apple pay and so i decided to delete the app and called apple, shortly after apple restored all my missing data and all i can say is never again, thank you gen z for helping me fix my problem.🥰✨"}},{"id":"6175572516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"unsatisfied citizen","date":"2020-07-09T07:36:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","review":"I care here for a good time and that is the OPPOSITE of what I had. This app took 3 years to download and after it did apple tried to remove it from the app store. Everyone was happy it was leaving because this is a terrible app but then the app magically got rid of all its data and apple didn’t get to actually remove it from the app store. It’s still impeached, i mean installing, but after all of the terrible things the app did to its users I won’t be downloading it again. On november 3rd I’ll be downloading a different app."}}]}
