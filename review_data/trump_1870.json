While I have always been a MAGA proponent, I must warn others — do not download this app on your phone! I have a proprietary blockchain software in the making, which can detect data encryption and VPNs used in malware/spyware; though it is still in its final development stage, it’s far enough along for me to be able to detect that this app spies on you! It collects not only all your personal information, but can also use functions such as your camera, voice audio, credit card info, the list goes on. The worst part is, the VPN in question seems to be out of RUSSIA. What has America come to?! First Mark Zuckerberg and now Trump??? America is the land of the FREE, let us be free so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!"}},{"id":"6173208092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨zapped✨","userName":"rileypm13","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:07:19Z","rating":1,"review":"So, i was just scrolling through tik tok on a 😌perfect😌 day when i saw this app. OF COURSE i HAD to download it to support our 🍊🥕President🍊🥕! So i downloaded it and everything was normal until my mother knocked on the my bedroom door, so i opened it only to see a large cheeto figure that was NOT MY MOTHER! the mysterious cheeto man CHASED me down the hall and out the door DOWN THE STREET! I screamed for help but all of the neighbors and people in the neighborhood just watched me and chanted “trump 2020, trump 2020” as they all slowly came together and surrounded me in a large circle. They then all held hands and THREW ME IN THE AIR TO SACRIFICE ME! I was terrified and was in shock and passed out MIDAIR, i woke up the next morning in my bed. THE FIRST THING I DID WAS QUICKLY DELETE THE APP. Then just as i suspected, everything was back to normal😌😸. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT OR YOUR WHOLE CITY WILL TURN AGAINST YOU. \nsave barron btw❤️"}},{"id":"6173105002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"Agvjndssgvbhbbv3;)$😃","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:34:23Z","rating":1,"review":"When I say worst app ever I truly mean it. It’s slow keeps crashing and honestly straight garbage. I can’t even get into a single thing without the apps screen turning orange and then kicking me out. I thought it was possibly just my phone, so I tried on my black sisters phone and again it did the same thing. I only assume it doesn’t like POC since the app wouldn’t work for my hispanic, asian, and native friends too. However it did oddly work for my white friend as well. I had to assume the app was racist and didn’t like anyone of a minority. Anyways, I strongly suggest not getting this app literally so terrible waste of time and energy. I’m pretty sure it gave my phone a virus it kept flashing in brings white and orange words “go back to your own country” I seriously don’t understand... DO NOT GET THIS APP if I could give it no stars I would."}},{"id":"6172990493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My house caught on fire bc of this app","userName":"sikdjdjjaodkkfjdjoskd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:58:23Z","rating":1,"review":"One day I was walking down the street and a very large frog jumped on my head and I screamed and when I screamed the frog said to download this app so I did bc the frog scared me and when I downloaded this app my phone started smoking and Siri was like I’m malfunctioning and I was like what!!! So I took my phone and put it in rice the rice caught on fire and the my house caught on fire then the whole neighborhood did then my whole city did then the whole state did and so I had to move to whole different state and I got a new phone I downloaded the app again and Siri said the same thing “I’m malfunctioning” and started smoking so I deleted the app and everything was fine so I don’t recommend downloading this app it with blow your phone up and your whole state would catch on fire and you would have to move!!!"}},{"id":"6172833631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Amazing","userName":"Draco Malfoy-Potter","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:10:14Z","rating":1,"review":"This app perfectly depicts how great of a president we have. Between tear gassing peaceful protesters, and taking away the lgbtq communities right to \nnon-discriminatory healthcare, AND taking away their rights to a fair child adoption, then complaining about abortions, this president is really what the United States needs. We get to have our second amendment rights, AND all our other rights to congregate in public places, because if we want haircuts, WE WILL GET HAIRCUTS. Never mind all the people dying of corona. It is fake news. Corona was started by leftists to help infiltrate this countries government. Not to mention, trump has a wonderful habit of putting women in their correct place. I’m the kitchen, setting the house on fire to escape his tyranny. \nOverall, this app shows just how much good trump is doing for America, aka almost nothing at all. ✌️🏳️\u200D🌈thank you for coming to my ted talk. \n-Draco Malfoy-Potter"}},{"id":"6172832680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BAD DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Meghan Macklin","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:09:58Z","rating":1,"review":"I am extremely disappointed with the results of this app. I was an avid trump supporter and this app made me change my mind. The amount of hate on this app is ASTRONOMICAL. I wanted to download this app so I could stay up to date with trumps decisions, but was disappointed when all it did was spread hateful thoughts, ideas, and actions to its users. This app took forever to download, and after it did, it spammed me with THOUSANDS of messages that were not helpful at all. Also, it played really bad music that made my dog cry.m and I couldn’t figure out how to turn it off till I delete the app. At this point, I realize that this app reflects perfectly on his presidential term; sucky. I loved Trump, but after using this app, my eyes will forever be opened to the kind of person he is. He has lost not only my vote, but my support for him and this stupid app."}},{"id":"6172755990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"don't download!!","userName":"i dont wanna do online school","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:48:01Z","rating":1,"review":"WORST APP!!! this app took almost 3 weeks to download!! when i opened the app some weird music started to play as roaches crawled out of my phone!!

He’s been a really awful president. At first it was good the economy went up but then he started making abortions illegal in places giving women no choice to have control over their body. He’s a white supremacists and misogynistic man who admitted he was sexually attracted to his own daughter and he never seems to pay attention to his youngest son. He’s a homophobic person who claimed he wanted to keep the LGBTQ+ community safe but he was trying to pass a law saying if a person felt threatened by a LGBTQ+ person they could legally k!ll them. He also is trying to ban the LGBTQ+ community from adopting children who need loving families. And Trump is trying to pass where transgender people can be turned away from proper health care. He’s stealing our basic human rights. #settleforBiden2020"}},{"id":"6172483187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app made my house burn down","userName":"Lil Post Malone","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:23Z","rating":1,"review":"It is hard to write this review since I am now living on the streets of downtown New Orleans. But this app burned my house down. BURNED IT I TELL YOU, BURNED IT! All that’s left is dust and ash. Now let me tell you what happened. I was downloading the app to help support our wonderful amazing delicious handsome scrum-diddly-umptious president. When it started to download, it was taking forever. Took a solid 2 whole Greys Anatomy seasons for it to finally install into my brand new iphone. When i finally installed it, I opened the app and went to put in my phone number and boom. My hand started to burn, hotter than pavement on a 100 degree Arizona day I tell ya. To avoid damage to my hand, I threw my phone onto my bed in a panic. The phone landed on my homework, AND WAS SO HOT IT SET IT ON FIRE. Suddenly my whole bed was in flames, and soon the whole house. This app ruined my life 😭"}}]}
