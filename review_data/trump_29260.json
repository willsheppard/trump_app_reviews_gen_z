The photos contained Donald Trump's nudes!!! I've never seen a dick look like a shriveled up McDonalds Nugget in my life!!! If I could, I would rate it 0 stars 😡😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179078323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:24:02Z","rating":1,"title":"Trump = dumb","userName":"Izzy hand","review":"This app is extremely awful. I don’t think people should download this because I don’t think people  need to hear a stupid mans words. Trump is not a wise man and disrespects anyone against him. He should not be president, and not be able to have his own app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179041032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:10:20Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"😭😭😳😳😩","review":"When I tried to open the app it kept closing then my phone froze and rebooted.

My president 🗽 is a good man who deserves better. It bugs out whenever I open it. It's slow and the rewards system is trash. 🤢 Please don't waste any data on it. Tump 2020🇺🇸🙏✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178970884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:44:42Z","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APPLICATION","userName":"alltheusernamesaretakeb","review":"This is by far the worst app i have ever used it took nearly 38 hours to download and the first thing me and my friends saw when we opened it was trump full nu*e and i will never unsee that overall horrible experience and should be deleted from the app store.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178966688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:43:10Z","rating":1,"title":"If I could give this 0 stars I would","userName":"Kc.5291","review":"I would have to say that this is probably the WORST app on the App Store and I deeply regret downloading it at all.

It freezes every time I try to open it, the app layout is so confusing, it limits it’s customers to racist people. I gave it a one star because it’s completely useless. Nobody knows that “Trump 2020” is so stupid and shouldn’t be a thing.","isEdited":false}}]}
