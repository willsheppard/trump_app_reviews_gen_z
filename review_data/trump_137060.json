But unfortunately the app kept making my cell phone crash. It was constantly kicking me out of the app time and time again. So I thought that it was probably just my phone. So l powered my phone off and waited a couple of minutes to get back to the app. Then after about ten minutes, I went back onto the app and it continued to crash and kick me out. So then I was like whatever maybe my iPhone 6 is broken and I just decided to drop the whole thing and ignore when my phone would crash. Well that was a bad mistake. Over the next couple of days my phone was constantly crashing. It didn't matter if I was on Facebook or if I was on candy crush, it was just constantly crashing. Now I know that some of you may be thinking \"oh your phone is just old\" but my phone had never done that before I got the app. It was constantly and constantly crashing and closing me out of apps. I seriously think that this app is no good for you and you seriously should not get it. Not to mention the fact that this app also took up a tremendous amount of storage up on my phone. Please do not get the app. It's software must be really out of date and will ruin your phone. That being said-| wish I could give the app a 0 but unfortunatelyI cannot. This app is no good.","userName":"Hla ; )"}},{"id":"6180018866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"•_•Oh to see without my eyes•_•","date":"2020-07-10T08:00:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app will give you cooties.

I do not support this cheeto puff looking racist president✨🧡 I really tried to use this app but it kept glitching me to a screen with the cheeto looking corn hair president and honestly it just gave me bad vibes and i was not here for it😗✌🏼 I also forgot to mention that this app took 7 hours to download which did not surprise me because because Trump is slow at many things☺️ Anyways with trump as a pedophi-  I mean president he is absolute trash and has a very bad spray tan🤡 overall i absolutely do not recommend this app, it tries to brainwash you and it feels like going swimming in jeans or even stepping in a pair of crocs filled with pudding.👎🏼 \ndid i mention that because gen z hurt trumps feelings he wants to ban tiktok🥺funny how he says our info is going to the chinese government (which it’s not) when we all know he wants tik tok taken down cause gen z can speak our minds.\n\nAnyways bunker boy cheeto lookin troll, if you’re reading this you remind be of a therapist.       \n 🧚\u200D♀️✨💕remove the though✨🧚\u200D♀️💕","userName":"Robyn1214"}}]}
