It’s a lame app that needs removed.  And I don’t understand how any one could like this app or the picture of the Cheeto. And I like Cheetos but the one Cheeto just gives me the creeps.

Our country needs change and that won’t happen with the orange in the White House. How can you offend and belittle so many of the people in the nation you supposedly run."}},{"id":"6174387452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"q hates trumo","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app is the worst","review":"when i downloaded this app, i expected to be able to learn more about trumps campaign. instead i was found with rally’s, and zero educational purposes. and there’s no news involved in the app. this app singlehandedly haunts my nightmares. in my dreams i see my phone and it’s just trump standing and getting spray tanned. he screams and yells in my face in my dreams. this app has ruined me. anytime someone mentions trumps name, i begin shaking and chanting bernie sanders, hoping and praying i can escape this living nightmare. please god help us and get this app removed."}},{"id":"6174386503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BRUHjustletmepickadamnusername","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:05Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"My poor eyes","review":"Upon entering the app I tried to put my phone number in and it kept saying invalid. Then it started glitching and out of no where a naked picture of the president was on my screen😠!! I am infuriated! What if a child goes and downloads this app it shows them that! What a disgrace!"}},{"id":"6174384401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Noelle(;","date":"2020-07-09T01:05:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","review":"Worst app in the world, first off seeing the orange man is a horrifying site and seeing a campaign and presidency that will lead the country to disaster once again is so scary. I believe the set up is horrible and deserves no stars. The goal is pathetic and there are too many lies. We don’t need a baby as president, I rest my case.😌🤚"}},{"id":"6174377029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mightyelf24","date":"2020-07-09T01:03:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m at a loss for words...","review":"I downloaded this app for my mom who wanted to keep up with Trump news (Not like that fake media those libs post) when the first thing that popped up was a horrible picture of our president NAKED! As a patriotic American, I am appalled by the disgusting measures younger generations go to make fun. This is a fake app. DO NOT download!"}},{"id":"6174370580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nicki the harajuku barbie💋💕","date":"2020-07-09T01:01:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Sis I-🤮💔😭","review":"Hello my name is Nicki Minaj aka Nicki the ninja/Nicki Lewinski/Nicki the harajuku Barbie/Roman Zalanski and I downloaded this app to see the news but when I opened it I saw this UGLY ORANGE MAN who I assume is homeless based on his dirty ugly appearance. In my opinion, he does not belong on this app. This is one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded and it needs to be removed from the App Store IMMEDIATELY. I am absolutely disgusted."}},{"id":"6174370051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yismeyri","date":"2020-07-09T01:01:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"He killed my pet  door","review":"So when I opened this amazing app for the first time so that I could sign up something really tragic happened. When I opened the app I was met with a horrific picture of a orange chetto.
