Soon after I got it my whole phone started to reset at random times. It began glitching and getting really hot too and whenever I was on a different app it would switch to the Trump app automatically. At one point my phone actually caught on fire and I had to call the fire department! This app is literally a hot mess that uses all the storage 1/10","title":"Stole my will to live💕","userName":"7.526378484535","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:35:45Z"}},{"id":"6178148155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I truly tried to give him and his plans of being our US president a thought; but when I got the app all it was ripping at other candidates. I do understand that it is a tactic for winning but I searched and there was no real and true comments on his plans. I don’t feel like our current president should have a platform/app just being used for bringing other people who are trying to do the same thing as him.","title":"Why","userName":"Osothedog15","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:33:01Z"}},{"id":"6178021375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app hoping to help support Donald trump, but when I got into the app I was immediately asked for my phone number, and entering it was the worst decision of my life. I have since been bombarded with several call and texts and his campaign that mostly just ask me to donate money to him or buy his merchandise. I actually switched my phone number just to not receive them anymore.","title":"This is probably one of the worst made apps ever","userName":"epicmcswagpony","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:51:02Z"}},{"id":"6178019880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"You really think your gonna take away tiktok? That’s the one place that teenagers can go to relax and have a safe space to talk to and connect with other people. And if you take that away from us, there’s gonna be so many kids with depression and we’re just gonna go to other platforms. You can’t take down gen z without a fight. We will stay on top. You tried but never do it again🧚🏻✨💗🥰🥳","title":"Thick thighs save lives👁👄👁","userName":"Lauren2555","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:50:32Z"}},{"id":"6177953856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is messed up. I was just tryna look at this app. It looked peaceful, patriotic, 🍊 orange 🍊. When I got the app, I thought “Nothing bad is gonna happen” but I was wrong. 2 hours later, orange people were on my wallpaper. I thought, “Maybe my brother did this.” I was once again wrong. Soon, I got racist messages and peeps telling me I see you 👀.I think they were sexist 🤭. I was terrified at this point. Then my phone went back to normal 🤭. Then TikTok almost got banned. I said to my family, “Let’s vote another 🌟 president 🌟 that ain’t 🍊 orange 🍊.” I went on twitter and blocked our “president” and I still have the app. Now that I have seen all the probs, I’m deleting it. \n\nP.S.\nIf your from Japan or the CIA don’t get rid TikTok 🙃\n\nGoodBye 👋","title":"🙃Is this normal?🙃","userName":"TikTok, TeeHee🤭😌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:29:02Z"}},{"id":"6177893890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This a very dangerous app. I downloaded it with bad intentions hoping the ✨orange✨ does indeed find out about this. I have to say this app does not work at all and should be deleted immediately. It is a waste of storage and time. This app has nothing better to do with the other day but then i and time are the best for every day of this week. I love writing reviews about my favorite ✨orange✨. I hope he finds pleasure in all of these great reviews.","title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ ✨👑🧚","userName":"😞tik tok🤩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:09:22Z"}},{"id":"6177817543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is super slow and i keep getting weird messages and calls from it. I do not like it because trump is really annoying and no one wants to be getting calls or messages from this app. It is really inconvenient to have this app because it tells you the same things as the news does and there is really no point of having it plus it is really slow and I don’t like it.

I was immediately bombarded with Cheeto propaganda and was met by Cheeto man’s assistant the Cheeto cheetah, which was a let down from the main man himself. I start to question if the Cheeto man even exists or if it’s all just a simulation. After all, I don’t think anyone in real life could be that dumb, racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, misogynistic, and xenophobic I’m real life.

It worked really well for a couple of weeks but then it started crashing and would kick me out. Then after three weeks of having it Russian hackers started firing bullets into my house. I tried calling the police but when they showed up they started laughing at me and throwing human feces at my Yeti Crab. Now I am at war with Russian hackers and the police. 1/5 stars, wouldn’t recommend","title":"👁👄👁","userName":"kr4ft m4c&ch33s3","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:04:24Z"}},{"id":"6177626518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as i downloaded it my phone completely crashed. I restarted my phone so i could see what my wonderful president is up too.. But nope just made it crash again! Now my phone won’t work at all!
