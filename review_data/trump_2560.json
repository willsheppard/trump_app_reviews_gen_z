I really hope Donald trump (our Grorious Reader) himself personally fixes the app so that I can read all of my favorite alternative facts. All of the other news apps don’t even tell me about how windmills cause cancer! Imagine that! I look forward to this app working so my lord and savior Donald J trump (the J stands for genius, not for Jew) will be able to personally deliver his alternative facts straight to my iPhone. Please fix issues because as of right now I can’t use the app without Ben shapiros squeaky voice coming out and telling me that facts don’t care about my feelings. Also I downloaded the whole app but my food never arrived.","userName":"Burble Farkenson","date":"2020-07-09T19:00:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😑 CHYNA 🇨🇳 🇨🇳","rating":1}},{"id":"6177827935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hey Sisters so I’m here on behalf of TikTok creators and Gen Z. So 98% of the time you would see us on TikTok 1% is other apps and the other 1% were asleep. And as you know, we can get PRETTY annoying when we’re bored so do you really want us talking to you 98% of the time because istg the whole time we will either be repeating ourselves over and over again or just going on and on about how much we miss TikTok. But on a serious note. TikTok actually helps a lot of people. There are some people with a bunch of supporters on TikTok coming out that before they had the app they were depressed and actually thinking about taking their own life. TikTok has made SO many people happy. I don’t expect some people to understand but I just needed to say it.✨","userName":"the_anaya_","date":"2020-07-09T18:49:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TikTok 4 Life Sisters ☺️💅✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177661192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So basically🗿it took way too long to download, then!

But this app was just extremely disappointing. The app took several days to download. And after day 3, I attempted to delete it but the app didn’t not give me the option to cancel the download. 😱 it was as if I was being hacked. The next day, I received a message from apple that the app was soaking up all of my ICloud storage and creating a virus on my phone 😔💔. On day 7 of trying to delete the app(which still wasn’t done downloading)I got a notice from my credit card that the app charged me a $17 fee. I then had to call my bank but unfortunately, they couldn’t do much🧑🏼\u200D🦯 Yesterday, I finally was able to delete the app and am so glad this nightmare is over 🧘🏼\u200D♂️🌞.","userName":"Nicolas🇺🇸","date":"2020-07-09T15:59:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨It’s a no for me🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6177241903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open the app thinking of would be like any other campaign but nooooo. I open the app and I see the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. My eyes started to bleed and hurt so much. I’ve never EVER experienced this much pain. I saw and ugly man with the ugliest smile saying he’s gonna make America great again even though he destroyed it. It was so terrifying, I literally have nightmares everyday of opening this app. Never in my life will I open this cursed app again. It’s just a no from me. The fact that little kids could download this breaks my heart. I don’t want little kids to be traumatized the way I am, and I’m more mature so I can kind of handle it but i literally need to bleach my eyes. I still bleach them daily to keep that hideous image out of my head 😭😔","userName":"McLoser822","date":"2020-07-09T15:51:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Nightmares","rating":1}},{"id":"6177100864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My Dad asked me to set this app up on his iPhone. His phone is a little older and he’s not too great at working tech but I figured this wouldn’t be an issue. The app continuously crashed resulting in constantly trying to fix it for him. Whenever I was able to get the app actually up and running the entire phone would freeze and crash. Do you know how annoying it is to constantly help boomers with their phones?!?! FIX THIS APP ASAP PLEASE or take it off the App Store!! I expected more from someone trying to Make America Great. How can we fix our country without having basic tech that actually works!? Take this app off before it causes any further embarrassment to the wonderful success of the brilliant and great Trump Campaign.","userName":"[MAGA]","date":"2020-07-09T15:12:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"App didn’t deliver","rating":1}},{"id":"6176968235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay, so i downloaded this app with high hopes, i’ve really wanted to see a life sized cheeto. it was actually really underwhelming, his hands were very small 🍤. ahem, anyways i also wanted to see everything this racist cheeto would be doing so i could register for all his rally’s etc. instead it never downloaded and crashed every time i opened it. i really can’t believe the app store would approve something like this. my heart breaks for all of the it people who are in charge of this app, they probably messed it up because they had such a bad childhood, i mean they like cheeto boy of course they did. lastly once it did download and didn’t crash for about 35 seconds, i noticed stepbrother videos everywhere. this was the only good feature of the app.","userName":"piScEs boii","date":"2020-07-09T14:36:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"sO WEIRD","rating":1}},{"id":"6176966095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got the app to show my support for the AMAZING WONDERFUL PRESIDENT obama, the one and only. but i kept seeing this orange talking, and i was promised if i got it that harry styles would come to my house and he never showed up. but then the craziest thing happened, the dinosaurs showed up and ATE MY SISTER. then the flash came by and carried her to the hospital and i went to the app to see what the president would do but THE ORANGE GUY WAS STILL THERE. he kept telling me to buy his merch but i only had 89 million dollars so i couldn’t buy anything. the app never helped my sister, the dinosaur is now my pet and harry styles still never came. then i pulled up to the party in my crazy pink wig but couldn’t get in because my booty was too big. also who is the trump??? is he the orange talking ??","userName":"𝘭𝘰𝘭","date":"2020-07-09T14:35:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"chair but make it ✨electric✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6176761741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i download this app in support of our great 45th president Donald J. Trump or 3mo 🍊 but when it comes to using this useless terrible app it’s frustrating and horrible to deal with servers no use and no purpose and is just taking up space and storage on my phone absolutely vile i can’t believe tht the president of the USA : united states of amerikkka could come out with such a pointless and impractical to use and extremely hard to navigate thru. u would think tht him releasing such an app for his cult members he’d know how small minded and limited they are with anything tht isn’t blatant racism and homophobia and hatred so why release such an app tht his people can’t even use in my opinion it’s a stupid unworkable app tht shouldn’t be on the app store 🥰😍","userName":"1axm3","date":"2020-07-09T13:41:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"terrible app not helpful in anyway","rating":1}}]}
