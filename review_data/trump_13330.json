However I’m very disappointed in this app. Since downloading it, my phone has become very laggy, and I can’t even keep the app open for longer than a minute without the app crashing. I’m so disappointed.","userName":"baat122601","title":"sad"}},{"id":"6177392073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:13Z","review":"I swear, we need to take down this man’s power. Who the frick even allowed this man to get his own app? Hurry up and leave, retire. You’re old, I can here your back cracking all the way from the White House. Just give up man. We get it, we won’t judge you for leaving, since we judge you for legit everything else. We’ll have a farewell party, but you’re not invited. Everyone, rejoice in the name of getting Trump out of office!","userName":"Ixey","title":"Someone get the bleach"}},{"id":"6177343478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:55Z","review":"literally so trash. i woke up this morning and went straight to my app because im addicted to Cheetos and it eases my withdrawal symptoms. while I was brushing my goldfish’s teeth it told me that an oompa loompa was trying to get out of the phone. I then realized this app is a goal to get many Oompa Loompas into peoples households and take over the world in some sort of Charlie and the chocolate factory scheme. Do. Not. Download. This. App. Unless you want to have to fight for your life against an Oompa Loompa.","userName":"outsidejazz","title":"oompa loompa takeover"}},{"id":"6177304155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:10:01Z","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with current events and it immediately started asking me for my personal information! I don’t want the government knowing anything about me. You can’t even do anything in the app until you enter your personal info. Plus my phone started lagging right after I downloaded it. Disappointed to say the least. Don’t get this app. It’s not worth it.","userName":"user 9127191999","title":"Hate this!!! 😡"}},{"id":"6177294716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:07:15Z","review":"this dingy crazy horrible app! i downloaded this app in the hopes of being able to support the almighty badly tanned cheeto some people call president but i was disappointed! the only things you can do are register for online and in person events, and have reward points? i dont want reward points! i want signs and flags and the doormat and more vandalism for our streets! i am disgusted with how simple they made the app but anyways 🇱🇷Trump 2020🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷","userName":"Carmelina H","title":"angry!!"}},{"id":"6177180955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:34:31Z","review":"When I first tried to download this app, it looked like the download was moving pretty quickly, little did I know the app was going to take SEVERAL DAYS to download. Despite this, every time I try opening the app, it crashes my phone, causing me to have to restart it, I haven’t actually even gotten to get into the app yet but seeing how this is going I don’t think I will be able to.","userName":"Barin James","title":"Overall bad app."}},{"id":"6177153558","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:26:46Z","review":"I downloaded this app because my family member recommended it to me to keep up to date with news events, but there was not much news, mostly poorly-written rhetoric that described a reaction to the news. It felt like it was written by someone who doesn't know how the English language works, and that’s okay, although from all of the “hype,” I was expecting an amazing app from our beloved President.","userName":"TGJNC","title":"Not Worth The Download"}},{"id":"6177116454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:16:32Z","review":"As an engineer I wish whoever started this app would just deleted. It’s poorly designed and stupid. Dare I say it it’s archaic. Probably because he can’t get any young people to design it. Anyways stupid app also trump is stupid. I’m mostly mad about you forcing people to risk their lives going to school or have to get deported to their country. Marrying an immigrant you can see how this would be upsetting.","userName":"ihopeyoudontgetreelected","title":"I wish I could give this 0 stars"}},{"id":"6177112989","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:15:34Z","review":"The only reason ppl are leaving bad reviews with a random excuse is cause they saw a TikTok where it said y’all wanted to TikTok and they were telling ppl to leave a bad review so the trump app will get deleted!!
