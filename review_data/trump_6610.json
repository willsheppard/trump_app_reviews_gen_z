BUILD THE WALL! i’m so sorry, that just slipped. please don’t downloadALL LIVE MATTER! sorry, it happened again-this app. i would never recomSNOWFLAKE! mend this app to anyone. please don’t get it.","rating":1,"userName":"Luke⚾️🤠✝️🎣 is typing...","isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T03:49:54Z"}},{"id":"6174899069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It was horrible it first asked me if I would like to have the notifications on and then it asked me for my number. That is crossing the line cuz my number is a very personal thing and trump definitely doesn’t need to know it. Actually if I’m being honest he already does cuz he is a spy and is trying to make clones of everyone and I’m not going be one of his evil little minion clones. And if that wasn’t bad enough his face was the first thing I saw when I opened the app like really? The least you could do is not let me see my stalkers face.","rating":1,"userName":"unusualbeing your welcome","isEdited":false,"title":"Really?","date":"2020-07-09T03:36:22Z"}},{"id":"6174884917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app yesterday and it made my phone so hot that my wife’s water broke, but she not even pregnant. So we ran to our local zoo Atlanta for an abortion but our bicycle ran out of gas. So I ran to the closest Wendy’s to get gas for our baby but she couldn’t finish a bowl. So I went to the lake and drowned the baby and then my wife went into labor so we called an Uber to take us to giddy up and go but this app crashed my phone and we were stranded in an ally way, but it’s okie bc just got in my car on the way home with my wife whose a virgin. ABSOLUTE TRASH DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","rating":1,"userName":"ilovemykids86","isEdited":false,"title":"Operation Orange Downfall:","date":"2020-07-09T03:32:13Z"}},{"id":"6174843878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was doing my daily business of handing out birth control pills, praising the devil, and stealing money from the rich and before I knew it, the local McDonald’s completely exploded! I was confused at first but then I remembered that just that very same day I downloaded this app! I know they are connected because trump is a very big KFC supporter and McDonald’s is their competition. Also when I went home, all the yolks of my eggs were missing! And trump is a very “whites only” kind of guy so you know he must have had something to do with it. THIS APP WILL RESULT IN THE EXPLOSION OF MCDONALDS AND THE SUDDEN MISSING OF YOLKS!!!","rating":1,"userName":"NathanielYC","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:12Z"}},{"id":"6174755068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"😖When I got this app I opened it to find a crusty Cheeto puff starring at me. 😯This app glitches and is so slow. It sends me 100+ notifications a day. My phone started glitching out after this. 😿 but when I first got the app I was shocked at the horrible sight of (TW⚠️) D*n*ld T*ump🤬.) he looked like he just got a nice fresh orange Cheeto spray tan🍊. I was trying to sleep one night 🛏 and my phone started buzzing and making loud noises😡. I check and the trump 2020 app was going wild💔. I immediately deleted this app off my iPhone and you should too. 😊😍 I have been traumatized enough 💔💔💔","rating":1,"userName":"karen paren daren","isEdited":false,"title":"WHAT IS THIS MADNESS","date":"2020-07-09T02:53:37Z"}},{"id":"6174735928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So last night I was sleeping and all the sudden my phone opens and the American anthem starts playing but then there’s static and I started hearing Donald trump speaking while the Alvin and the chipmunks song playlist was playing in the background. I tried to turn it off but it would just reopen and then trumps voice turned into Donald ducks voice and then my whole phone stopped working and I was forced to listen to trump as Donald Duck with Alvin and the chipmunks music until my phone eventually died and I could delete the app.","rating":1,"userName":"isiskssjsnsmaka","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely terrible","date":"2020-07-09T02:47:47Z"}},{"id":"6174673934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible, my phone personally is really fast but then as soon as I download it it slowed down, then just shut off in general. Also it made  my microwave and fridge stopped working and we had to go by a new one, they were fine before I download it then it just stopped as soon as I downloaded it. THEN my pet dinosaur got really sick and it was when he just looked at the app, R.I.P cockroach (that’s my dinosaur name) you will always be in my heart. Over all this is really the worst app ever and if I could give it -5 stars I would.","rating":1,"userName":"NO NAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:13Z"}},{"id":"6174602052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought google classroom was bad, wait till you see this one!! I downloaded it expecting to be able to see who would be running for president this year but all I saw was the annoying orange talking about how he was gonna destroy the internet for everyone by trying to get rid of social media apps! Not only that but he apparently hates all animals and wants to kill those too, and the planet in the process. I feel like this app should have a warning that it is a horror app and to stop people from downloading it.","rating":1,"userName":"KellyObrian1234","isEdited":false,"title":"The worst app created","date":"2020-07-09T02:08:46Z"}},{"id":"6174587248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is atrocious!!!! I am first met with a horrific image of what I can only assume to be a moldy clump of cheddar cheese with a thin clump of hair clinging to the top, disgusting 🤢!!! All the information in this app seems to have been written by a drunk toddler who had just gotten off a long shift in the coal mines, it’s ridiculous 😡. Finally, the layout and color scheme of this app is so ugly and boring I just could not take it anymore, so I came here to write my review. DO NOT GET THIS APP It is severely disappointing and the constant bombardment of pictures of garbage will churn your stomach 🤮🤮","rating":1,"userName":"whocaresjojuma","isEdited":false,"title":"This app makes me sick 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:36Z"}},{"id":"6174586578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all when I got this app it’s stole my cat and the next thing you know Flashback Mary appeared into my room and I didn’t know what was going on. So I asked flashback Mary what was going on and he said the app stole my cat and I was like what?! Then the voice of Trump said if you want your cat back I’ll give this app a good rating and I said no way Jose. But anyways did your guys fridge  away because minded and I don’t know how to get it back like I named it but I keep calling his name and won’t come back.
