Unfortunately this app put me in the hospital and made me go blind. so what happened was i open the app and a crusty cheeto flew out the screen saying “2020 VISON” and sis, let me tell you i was ✨appalled✨ i was just trying to use the app but that darn cheeto was just so scary things started to go little bit blurry. i tried to see if i could still see but unfortunately it was 2pm in winter around 4th of july and the sky was black and full of stars. i ran downstairs to my granny but i tripped over my jojo siwa bow and took a lil bit of a ✨tumble✨ down the stairs. i opened my eyes and standing above me was the one and only sheri nicole monty🧿👄🧿 she grabbed my hair and dragged me to the kitchen where my granny was and she was standing there helping peppa pig make some cents. now here’s where it gets intense so if you have a faint of heart please don’t read we don’t need you to get too scared now hunny!  so this tall   green guy that was short walked out of our fridge and into the kitchen. he had some soggy warm ice cream in his hand and was eating it with his belly button. he gave us a 5 in exchange for a 20 and said take this its a surprise for later. then he rode his helmet out of the house and my granny was shocked because he wasn’t being safe and wearing his bike. later on we figured out the surprise was actually  the trump 2020 ✨👑🧚🏻\u200D♀️😌💗 app coming to get revenge so i put my pants on my head and rode my yellow donkey to the moon. the moon was trying to provide sunlight for the earth so i actually had to go to MaRs YaAaAaYy!! i met an octopus there and asked if i could spend the night but he said no❤️ and threw me right back to earth. he was very rude so i’m just gonna assume his star sign was an aquarium becuase it was his rising gemini. anyway i had been thrown so hard that i am now impailed by the tip of mount everest and might not ever recover. oh yeah and the cheeto blinded me xoxo- gossip gorl 😘😘","date":"2020-07-09T16:07:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177293949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THE APP DELETED MY PHONE MEMORY","userName":"renny_760","review":"Who coded this app??!!
