There is something sinister, something so dark to name that is behind this app.  It‚Äôs truly terrifying to even think about it but I guess it goes.  \nThis stories starts with my parents wanting me to get this app.  They were trump supporters before downloading this app on their iPhones.  This all happened back in 2019 before a lot of evidence came out about Donald Trump (also yes I have been keeping this story inside me for a long period of time).  I downloaded the app and it was very simple.  Everything worked okay and was very efficient.  But one day my phone was dead.  It started to buzz like crazy and I heard this static sound.  It was almost 4 am when this happened.  The wind was howling and there was silence throughout my entire home.  But out of no where, waking me up from a deep slumber, my phone was buzzing like crazy.  It actually fell off my wooden nightstand because it was vibrating so much.  Out of shock I reached down to see what was blowing my phone up so much.  It was the trump app,  I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.  Why was this app making my phone go crazy.  I was holding my phone in my hands whilst the notifications kept going off.  But I realized why my phone was going crazy... I read the notifications... it was horrendous.  They were saying such sinister things that I can‚Äôt even say.  I was in full panic mode and I was so scared.  I didn‚Äôt feel safe in my own home.  I thought someone was out to get me.  Then the notifications stopped.  So I thought this was the end.  Then I hear footsteps coming from the dining room in my home.  I was home alone at this time.  My heart was racing, realizing the end is near.  But i started to hear this sound.  I don‚Äôt know how to describe it.  It was like singing.  I started to feel calmer.   My whole body stopped shaking and my heart slowed down to a normal pace.  Then I started to hear these words.  I was able to hear lyrics you know.  The singing was getting louder.  And that‚Äôs when a knock came at my door.  I for some reason opened the door.  A man in a cloak looked at me and started singing and dancing in my room.  \n\nHow does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower\n\nSomehow defeat a global superpower?\n\nHow do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?\n\nLeave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?\n\nYo.

(Hamilton!)\n\nI need my right hand man back! (Hamilton!)\n\nAh! Uh, get ya right hand man back\n\nGet your right hand man back!\n\nHamilton!\n\nYou know you gotta get ya right hand man back\n\nYour right hand man back!\n\nHamilton!\n\nI mean you gotta put some thought into the letter\n\nHa‚Äîha‚ÄîHamilton\n\nBut the sooner the better to get your right hand man back!\n\nHamilton, ha‚Äîha‚Äî\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nTroops are waiting in the field for

and i was ready to support this campaign to show my true american spiritüá∫üá∏, but i was not pleased with the number of fanfictions on the home tab. i kept trying to look at the news and updates, but every time a new fanfiction came up. the first one was an avatar the last airbender one, except the united states was the fire nationüî•, and my dearest trumpy was the fire lordüò±. oh and in this version, aang üí®actually did the deed and ended fire lord trumpüíÄ. in my own humble opinion, i thought it was a pretty good story, and the author, WOW. they paid so so so much attention to detail, describing my dear trumpy as a ‚Äútyrannical leader that only pays attention to his spray tans‚Äù and ‚Äúso fat, even iroh üçµ(bless that man‚ù§Ô∏è) was SHOCKED‚Äù. the author also did an amazing job at recreating zukoüí• to be barron trump(#savebarrontrump), and azula‚ö°Ô∏è as ivanka. the final fight scene where barron completely annihilated ivanka, was so beautifully written, i was on THE EDGE of my seat. however, when i thought i was in the clear, the unimaginable happened. i clicked away from the story when the entire screen went black. i could see the distressed üò© look in my face from the reflection in the screen. i was panicking, but my phone is kind of old, so i just assumed it had something to do with that. i went to plug it in when a distressing message appeared as the following:\n\nWE HAVE YOUR LOCATION, IF YOU REFUSE TO PAY $100,000,000 IN BITCOIN WE WILL ELIMINATE YOU.\n\ni was so scared and confused and a bit baffled at how the trump administration was able to get my location so quickly. long story short, i am one good fan fic richer and $100,000,000 bitcoin poorer. i can‚Äôt believe trump would rob his supporters like this. and that‚Äôs not even to say what the bitcoin would be used for anyways. i‚Äôve blindly donated my life savings to CRIMINALS. \n\ni hope that others can be vocal about their poor experiences with the app, and i just want people to know that i‚Äôm officially #harambe2020 because of these events."}},{"id":"6178946918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"the jane
