Anyways, as soon as I open up the app I got so scared seeing him almost punch me in the face. Like sir, there’s no need for violence I’m here to support you and learn more about what you are doing for this country. But not only almost giving me a black eye and scaring me. I almost peed my self and he asked for my phone number like if he was making up for assaulting me and making me almost pee \n\n👁👄👁 Mr. President I am engaged I can't do that sir and something about having orange babies doesn’t sit right with me.  I’m just saying  think twice before getting it especially if your easily scared like me.

But after downloading the app I found myself disappointed. The app wasn’t user friendly at all. As someone who has grown up using technology, it’s hard to imagine how someone of an older generation could be able to figure this app out. As a matter of fact, my grandparents have called me 7 times since they downloaded the app last Saturday to ask for assistance. The app is unorganized, complicated, and just doesn’t represent the quality that I would expect from our president and his team at the White House.","date":"2020-07-09T18:23:57Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177642531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Afro homey","title":"It’s a no from me🖤","review":"I downloaded this app because I thought hey why not get my daily dose of bigotry on the go, but there were a few unexpected side effects. Little bits of orange powder (almost like Cheeto dust??) started falling out of my charging port every now and then. I wanted to agree to the terms of service but they asked me to sign away the skin of my first born??? I mean I’m infertile so whatever but that was weird. I tried using the communal message boards but when I said “hi” I got banned for libel. Now I keep finding bricks all around my house. I can’t tell if they’re stacking them because they want me to throw them so they can call me a thug or if they want me to build a wall in my house. Either way I’m gonna pass on this one.","date":"2020-07-09T17:52:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177641117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"no bueno ew","title":"Crusty spaghetti sauce app WHAT A JOKE","review":"This app is is so pathetic. Because of this app my whole town got the coronavirus, I consulted with Mr. Trump himself about this app and he told me that I’m poor and then proceeded to do the Macarena. He sent Hillary Clinton to my house and she tried EATING off my face like she did to those little kids... of course, I am all about ✨🧚self defense💕✨🧚 so I PUSHED her into my bathtub and put the water at the coldest temperature, and covered her in pizza like how her and John talked about in those emails... they seem to like pizza a lot right? She didn’t seem to like that so her and Donny ran over me with their child 👶 trafficking 🌮🚚Taco truck and escaped   🕺💨. Anyways, this app caused me 4 broken bones, corona, and my degraded self confidence/ crippling depression. That’s all✨","date":"2020-07-09T17:52:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177605642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"olivia9321","title":"...","review":"This app is completely horrid, the content that they are putting out is supporting the awful laws that make people feel that they don’t have a voice and aren’t in control of their own lives because Trump needs total control over everything so people cannot go against him because he is too powerful. Also when he makes statements that are rude, disrespectful and discriminating, and his campaign team just says, “that’s not how he meant it” or “he just wasn’t thinking”, the president of our country should fight to make positive change and not make excuses. The power that the president means holds means that they should have respect and composure along with a filter, which Trump doesn’t have.","date":"2020-07-09T17:40:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177488667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Emily Hendersen","title":"MY MOM GOT SHOT","review":"So I downloaded this app and this hypnotizing thing came on! I suddenly got hypnotized and it almost made me SIGN UP‼️Then I hear my momma coming up stairs singing her holy music and snapping. Then, I came back to my normal mind. Next, thing I went on my private browser to search up “the hub”. But, yet the app was still running and I got hypnotized AGAIN! It made me search up Trumps leaked tape. And let me tell you!!! His wife was not getting no type of work she did that thing when you say “O with your mouth closed” 😂. Next thing my momma come in my room talm bout I need to clean it up so she suddenly gets HYPNOTIZED ‼️ So my momma went out to the hood and said “TRUMP 2020” I SWEAR MY MOMMA LIFE FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES AND ALMOST GOT SHOT!!! PLEASE DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIE!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T17:03:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177073543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Joshua Terold","title":"Crashes Frequently!!!","review":"I downloaded this app to learn more about Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign. I quickly found out it was very hard to navigate. The app seemed cluttered. I could not find the information I was looking for. After going through it for a while, the app crashed and took me to the home screen.  I didn’t really think anything of it and went back on. About 10 minutes later it crashed again. Every time I have used the app since, it has crashed. I know for a fact this is not my phone because my phone is new and this has never happened before. If you want to know more about his campaign I suggest you do your own research instead of using this bad app.","date":"2020-07-09T15:04:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176986681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Victoriaflips","title":"It was terrible","review":"I literally hate this app with all my soul. Right when I opened it it made me crap myself of disgust. It has Trumps spray tan picture as the profile which I will forever be scared for life.  Trump, maybe stop coming for Women’s bodies and start working on yours. \n\n  Also you little stupid, can you pay attention or do anything to help the country right now, oh that’s right, your not cut out to be a freaking president. How are you literally doing nothing to help black people, kids and many others are being put in cages, we are on stolen land yet that doesn’t seem to bother you, you are just flat out being racist. But yet that doesn’t bother you bunker boy. Please just knock some sense into your peanut sized brain.","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:03Z","isEdited":false}}]}
