The app was then spamming notifications and when I clicked on when the app would crash. It was also sending viruses into my phone saying I was being tracked by federal agents that work with trump 😭","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174232608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T00:14:21Z","userName":"ecajdnwoan23_erc","rating":1,"review":"Glitch right from the start. They wanted to track me by signing up with my phone number. Then there is a man with a picture with his fist up. Very threatening and looks like he just wants to hurt me, especially since I am a minority. Horrible app and would not recommend.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174219181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t get it.. like stop...please","date":"2020-07-09T00:09:22Z","userName":"hi lol the name is taken","rating":1,"review":"This app is too disrespectful and it’s too inappropriate.

It’s so bad. It wouldn’t let me pass the home page without providing my phone number. As someone who doesn’t own a phone I was disgusted. I’m writing this review off of my Nintendo DS. I can’t fathom why anyone would download this app on purpose. I’m just. so confused. So awful.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174125008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"A big OOF from me","date":"2020-07-08T23:34:30Z","userName":"Peepeater","rating":1,"review":"Yeah this app was supposed to be my saving grace in the 2020 election. As a feeble woman I was unsure of my vote, and unfortunately do not have a husband to assign me my political party. As such I figured this app was a good idea. Needless to say I did not appreciate all of the soggy Cheeto pictures when I am clearly on an air only, vegan, non GMO, gluten free diet. Sad what AMERICA has come to. 😭💩🖕🏻🐖🥑","isEdited":false}}]}
