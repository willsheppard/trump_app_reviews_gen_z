I could quote all the things Trump has said to people from racist to sexiest but we’re here to talk about the app. So I’ll give an honest app review. It sucked. The thing kept crashing and how long it took to load? At first I thought, “probably the internet bugging out again”. So I closed the app out completely and gave it a few. Still taking it’s sweet time to load and after using it for a few it would crash. Weird but again maybe the loading bit is my internet. Closed out the app again but this time opened one of my games that relies on connection. Game runs perfectly. So.. why is this app having such a hard time? I don’t know and to be honest, don’t care anymore. If I need information I’ll just wait for twitter. 🤷\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6179935459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:29:07Z","userName":"Im that rat 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🐀","title":"✨I have 45 children in my basement and I’m scared to add more✨","review":"Hi, umm I hate this app ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️𝓌𝒾𝓉𝒽 𝒶 𝓅𝒶𝓈𝓈𝒾𝑜𝓃🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ so delete this app or u will pie✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️𝓇𝑒𝓅𝓁𝒶𝒸𝑒 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓅 𝓌𝒾𝓉𝒽 𝒶 𝒹🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ have a dreadful day🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6179935330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:29:04Z","userName":"Seth10192837475","title":"Not good","review":"Not good"}},{"id":"6179935280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:29:03Z","userName":"hahzbabnscdchsmab","title":"Who in da hell put da muffins in da freeza","review":"I HATE THIS APP IT AND IT WILL GET REMOVED🤩🧚🏻\u200D♀️ TIKTOK RULES ✊🏻🙌🏼🥰🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6179935051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:28:58Z","userName":"echofky","title":"i hate this","review":"When i was born the doctors tried to circumcise me. Within a week it grew back stronger. Fast forward to now, i’m 18 and have been getting circumcised every 6 months, my foreskin is now stronger than steel. A whenever i’m in danger i can stretch my foreskin around my entire body like an outer shell. I am completely water, fire, and bulletproof and extremely lightweight. I have plans to collect it and sell it as a highly rare, highly resistant material and make millions. Bridges will be made out of beans of my foreskin, police and military will wear my foreskin vests for protection. Your children will drink from my anti-spill foreskin cups. I will be living in wealth and luxury."}},{"id":"6179934721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:28:52Z","userName":"Htvvg","title":"THIS APP IS SUCKYYY🐝🐝🐝🐝","review":"I HATED THIS APP SO MUCH SO HERE IS THE ENTIRE BEE MOVIE SCRIPT GOR YOH TO ENJOY UNLIKE THE APP WHICH IS THOROUGHLY UNENJOYABLE!

As a computer programmer in the making, I can tell you that I would never put myself through creating an app that is just ✨trash✨. Like seriously 🤦, y’all must’ve been paid in scrap 💩 bc I can see ✨orange✨, and bc it represents AND promotes racism, homophobia, pedophilia and such, it should be CENSORED 👺 and/or ✨🧚\u200D♀️✨BANNED✨🥰✨. Why would you help program an app that promotes this abomination of a man 🤡? Are you also an abomination 😗? Oh wait, you must be Karens 😂, but %72 of the computer science field is dominated by men 👨\u200D💻😳, so you’re more than likely not Karens in terms of ✨female 💁\u200D♀️✨ but in terms of ✨human trash 😔✨.  Anyways, I hope you can find better jobs so you won’t have to go around creating apps like this, and I wish you luck so you won’t have to work for this man again 🥰."}},{"id":"6179934501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:28:48Z","userName":"stick smudington","title":"scum","review":"gen z is gonna vote you out"}},{"id":"6179934371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:28:45Z","userName":"WhiteAlwaysCracks","title":"👨\u200D🦯🚅","review":"Laura Lee’s First Apology Video:\n[Laura Lee:]\nI want to talk to you guys in this video it has been so hard. It’s almost been an impossible week. It’s hard – it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry for you guys. I’m so sorry for disappointing you. It hurts me so bad to disappoint you all who’ve supported me for so many years. And know that I’m better than that person.\nI, six years ago, decided to re-tweet things that were so vile and hurtful. I was so stupid and ignorant. And I have no excuses here today; I’m not here to give you an excuse. I have no excuses. I’m only here to say that I’m so sorry. And I hope one day that you guys can see me for the woman that I am. And that I can prove to you guys that I’m not that girl.\nI love you guys so much. And whenever I see I disappointed you, it just breaks my heart into a million pieces. I’m so sorry for anyone that’s been hurt through this, anyone.\nI feel so just disappointed that I don’t even like to look at myself because like I can’t even believe that I would re-tweet ugly things and you know – things that would hurt people. Like I can’t believe I didn’t see the pain behind that kind of tweet and that kind of behavior. And I’m so sorry. There’s no excuse.\nThere is nothing I can say that’s an excuse. I’m just sorry for making that six years ago.\nI wish I was better six years ago, but I can’t pray for the past. I can only pray for the future.\nI also want to say in this video that, “please”. Please just if you hate me, please just hate me. People have called my mother and threatened to kill her, they’ve gotten her phone number, they’ve attacked a child.[…] attacked her? I just say please just let this be me. Let this be about me. It is nothing about my family, it’s about me. It’s not about anyone else.\nThis is my sorry.\nThere’s another part of this story that like I don’t know if you all know, but me, and Gabriel, and Nikita and Manny took a picture with our middle fingers up. And we were trying to mimic Kylie Jenner’s birthday picture. And the picture was taken out of context. And it ended up causing pain you know – for other people.\nAnd I just wanted to say that I’m sorry to Jeffree [Star] for the pain we may have caused you in this. I didn’t know that that picture was going to be taken out of context and that anything was going to be said to you. But at the end of the day, it was done. So I need to owe you an apology for this. And I know we’re not friends anymore, but I want to apologize to you.\nThank you guys for giving me some time and I love you guys. I understand that I just need some time now. I love you guys so much. And I’m sorry.\nLaura Lee’s Second Apology Video:\nHey guys.  I know I haven’t been on YouTube or any social media for a little over a month now. I wanted to come back to YouTube with this video to talk to you guys about a couple of things.  First off, I want to say I’ve missed you guys so so so much.  Second of all, I want to talk to you guys a little bit about my apology video, which was the last video that I had posted on my channel and I owe you guys a sincere apology.  In that video, I come off more as a victim … I am not a victim in any way, form, or fashion in this situation.  I’m taking the video down because it doesn’t represent me well.  I’m not taking it down the video down to try to hide it from you guys or pretend it didn’t happen.  I know the video is literally all over the internet so if you guys wanted to see it, you totally could.  I’m taking it off my channel because it does not represent the human being that I am today.  And in the video, you guys are seeing more of a reaction on the situation than you did even a response. And I hope that makes sense to you guys. That is my reasoning for taking it down."}}]}
