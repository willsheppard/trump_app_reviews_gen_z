The moment I opened the app, the cheeto jumped out the screen and started chasing me around, yelling “Build the wall”. I told him I didn’t want to, and asked for him politely to go back into my screen. He refused and instead threw my infant child into a bucket of acid. I was horrified! Do you want YOUR children to be thrown into buckets of acid? If not, then don’t get this app. I was extremely disappointed, but not entirely surprised, how terrible it was. If I could give it a 0, I would. THE MANNY WILL NOT BE TELEVISED.","date":"2020-07-09T14:51:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app will destroy future generations."}},{"id":"6177020556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"annaelizabethhg","review":"When I logged onto the app I was met with a few things: \n1. It began with an opening page that required me to denounce my current religion and claim Christianity as the only valid one. How this is legal, I don’t know.\n2. Next, it required me to watch a five minute long video in which Bunker Boy is being being spray tanned into having the complexion of a cheeto puff. I would like to emphasize that he was completely naked. \n3. Next, I was asked to donate to an organization that openly expresses their opinions on eating children born out of wedlock. If you’re wondering, they support it. I was not allowed to move forward from this page until I had called my governor to support this movement. \n4. Lastly, Ivanka herself called me to let me know that she supports her father’s incestuous comments and that as a woman that supports women, I should as well. \n\nLong story short, this was a horrifying experience. Not even sleepy Joe is as evil as Trumpy. REMOVE THIS DESPICABLE APP.","date":"2020-07-09T14:50:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Biggest joke yet"}},{"id":"6176963535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jakeoauler❤️","review":"I would like to say this app is the most discussing thing I’ve seen on earth. Absolutely racism, so much hate to this man he’s racist and he’s also a rapist. He doesn’t even know what he’s doing he’s worrying about an app instead of worrying about the elections. He deserves to go to hell for trying to band a app just because they came after him. He shouldn’t even be in shock cause he knows exactly what he did, he’s being racist to us other color, race, Black Lives Matter!! And until they start respecting the black lives matter and the LGBT community. We will not stop until we get are freedom.","date":"2020-07-09T14:34:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Disgusting 😍🧚\u200D♀️💅🏼"}},{"id":"6176826492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Chickpikachu","review":"Zero stars needs to be implemented for apps like this train wreck. \n\nI saw a lot of people finally getting into the spirit so I downloaded it to see what the buzz was about and oh boy, do I have a lot to say. \n\nI noticed some people having issues with it downloading terribly slow but I had the opposite issue... \n\nThe second it downloaded I had visions of citrus men which hurt my teeth and brain to a degree I haven’t been familiar with since the Willy Wonka binging days... and I didn’t even have time to prepare for the sheer amount of terrible thoughts that ripped through my head as if the Cheeto Lord himself was whispering straight into my brain\n\nAll this talk of making America great but good grief the amount of complications even opening this app created in my life... even my own cat looked at me with judgement and refused to sit with me until I fixed this horrible mistake.\n\nSo please fix this mistake and tear this whole thing down.","date":"2020-07-09T13:58:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Migraines and pains in the a-"}},{"id":"6176488924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LJ Rhodes","review":"Horrible app, and I know apps, some might call me a jenius about apps and I can say that this is the worst one of them all, and I can say that because I know a lot about apps I’ve worked with some of the best of the best in apps. It takes forever to download and when it does finally download, asks for all the personal information I’ve already entered previously. This app takes up so much space and doesn’t give me any more information than his texting service already did. Also, it keeps bugging out and sending me notifications multiple times!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:28:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst app, maybe ever"}},{"id":"6176236238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Minecrafter06","review":"The trump administration is made up of a pile of idiots and have no idea what they are doing. In the past 4 years they have brought this country to one of its lowest points and another 4 will only allow this to continue. I also, as a member of the gen z generation, feel like it’s important to add that after he was humiliated at the Tulsa Rally (after about 1 mil kids on TikTok reserved tickets so the expected numbers to show up were warped and then proceeded in skipping the rally) he has decided he wants to ban tik tok. This is low and he is trying to show A BUNCH ID KIDS that he is better than them. KIDS. I am speechless.","date":"2020-07-09T11:16:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Complete Morons"}},{"id":"6176108056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"2014_pocahontas","review":"There’s no other words, other then a no. After downloading this app I was baffled by the statements. for days no food nor water. Not to mention during those days I didn’t shower. When I went to school people told me I and I quote “ smelt like an Ogre” and I needed to “ get out of the swamp”  I realized how toxic this app truly was. Here’s a life quote I would like to say “ I climbed out of my head and watch my self implode, a thought without a body ‘ought to be a shot to take a load of my brain is poisoned and I’m searching for the antidote, but everytime I find it my defenses scream oh no u don’t! Woah” In conclusion; this app is a no for me.","date":"2020-07-09T10:36:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It a no for me"}},{"id":"6176015514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Hannah H Bruno","review":"This app is really ✨bad bad✨.... it took a whole week to download 🙈🙉🙊.
