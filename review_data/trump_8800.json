But instead all I got was a drained battery and my phone started heating up so much that it burned my hands!!! Then all of a sudden my phone started levitating and flying around my room while playing the national anthem!! Then it just got too hot that it blew up and glass and phone parts went everywhere!! I had to get a whole new room because we couldn’t clean up the glass!!! I would NOT recommend this app if you don’t want a new room!!!","rating":1,"userName":"3Kare"}},{"id":"6174457699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T01:27:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Do not get this app! The first images I saw were of an ugly dude named Rae Cism 🤢 and a gross lady who goes by the name Miss Ogyny 🤬. I’m honestly gagging as I type this. Seeing those images left a horrid taste in my mouth. Against my best judgement, I kept looking. 😷 Bad idea. Now my eyes won’t stop watering and I’ve been unable to speak for the last thirty minutes. Another image of Bleuliv Smatter 🙄 popped up and I instinctively threw my phone across the room, causing it to shatter. I’m typing this on my 3DS. Please don’t get this app I’m begging you!","rating":1,"userName":"Ben Dover 🤤"}},{"id":"6174448373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Whatttt","date":"2020-07-09T01:24:46Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The second I downloaded the app I was met with a horrifying image of what trump iwill look like in 2030! Made my great grandma pass out break her eye bones 🥺😔. Then someone form inside the phone called me a loser and a dork which is bullying and I don’t think that Melania would appreciate trump saying that to people 😤. My feelings were hurt so I decided to tell people the truth about this terrible app. So glad I only registered for four of his rallies instead of 5 🤪. Overall great experience would give it a 4/5!","rating":1,"userName":"Pictor Lane"}},{"id":"6174382343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very untruthful messages","date":"2020-07-09T01:04:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I wanted to get this app to get more info in preparation for this upcoming election. But as soon as I opened the app a ugly orange monster appeared. Immediately I was frightened and threw my phone across the room. As a result my screen broke and I am very upset. I need to delete this app as it makes me mad. And the notifications are always on even if I turn it off. I am so disappointed and upset that this app even exists! Don’t download it! you will not like all the false advertising.","rating":1,"userName":"Ghollister"}},{"id":"6174325426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T00:46:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t know what happened 😖 I opened the app and then my dog just got taken over by I don’t even know what after he saw a big sweaty pig on the screen and clicked off scared for my dog then I check my emails they where just pictures of cows and pigs kept coming it was the worse thing I ever saw if I were you I would EVER open this app again your dog may get a demon attached to it next so am doing this for your safety.

It was horrifying! I cannot explain the complete and utter disgust from the sight. And orange cheeto, staring at himself in the mirror, making a face after being asked not to make an ugly one! He seemed to be struggling! It was as if making a neutral face was hard, maybe he’s just not very attractive? Yeah❤️. The app is very poorly created, like his hot air balloon built body couldn’t do much!

It was DISÚTÆNG. I hope no one ever gets this app. My goldfish, Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramírez, was cuddling with me and I had to cover his eyes. You should be ASHAMED to have such a horrible sight on your app. This will be go down as history as the most disgraceful and offensive app. I hope you apologize to Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramírez for your behavior. He is still crying and will not leave his bed.
