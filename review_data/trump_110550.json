A BACK ALLEY - DAY\n\nThe screen is filled by the face of PETER PARKER, a seventeen year \nold boy. High school must not be any fun for Peter, he's one \nhundred percent nerd- skinny, zitty, glasses. His face is just \nfrozen there, a cringing expression on it, which strikes us odd \nuntil we realize the image is freeze framed.\n\nPETER (V.O.)\nLook, I'm going to warn you right\nup front. If somebody told you\nthis was a happy story, if\nsomebody said I was just your\naverage, ordinary seventeen year\nold, not a care in the world...\n\nThe image un-freezes. A FIST, at the end of a right hook, comes \ninto frame and punches poor Peter. His head snaps back and bounces \nforward, his eyes roll.\n\nPETER (V.O.) (cont'd)\n...somebody lied.\n\nThe image freezes again, Peter's glasses dangling from one ear.\n\nPETER (V.O.) (cont'd)\nThat's me. Peter Parker. A.K.A.\nSpider-Man, but not yet. Gotta go\nthrough some ritual humiliation\nfirst. All right, I didn't want\nyou to see me like this, but we\nmight as well get it over with.\n\nThe image unfreezes again, another fist comes into frame, this one \na left cross. It CRUNCHES into Peter's nose and he crumples to the \npavement in this alley in the city.\n\nTHREE HIGH SCHOOL PUNKS commence pounding the crap out of him. \nFLASH THOMPSON is the leader, he's seventeen, good-looking, body \nof a twenty-eight year old.\n\nFLASH\nYou do NOT talk to her! How many\ntimes I gotta tell you that? Do you\nlisten when I talk? Hey! I asked\nyou a question! Do you LISTEN when\nI'm talking to you?!\n\nPETER\nHuh? Sorry, I wasn't listening.\n\nThis enrages Flash; he punches Peter in the ribs. Peter groans in \npain.\n\nFLASH\nNext time you're gonna pay, puny\nParker, you are gonna pay.\n\nPeter spits out some blood.\n\nPETER\nWill a credit card be okay?\n\nThe other two Punks laugh, they find Peter kind of amusing. This \nupsets Flash even more, he picks up a garbage can and is about to \nbring it down on Peter's head when a voice from behind stops him.\n\nM.J.\nWhat kind of man-\n\nThey turn. A girl stands in the entrance to the alley- MARY JANE \nWATSON, seventeen, painfully sexy already, with a knowledge and \nsadness in her eyes that are way beyond her years.\n\nM.J. (cont'd)\n-picks on a helpless little dweeb?\n\nPETER\nLook, I know you mean that in a\ngood way...\n\nFlash raises the trash can again.\n\nM.J.\nLeave him alone, Flash.\n\nFrustrated, Flash upends the trash can, dumping its contents on \nPeter's head and tossing it aside. He and the other Punks head for \nthe mouth of the alley, leaving Peter behind, covered in garbage, \nhumiliated. M.J. lingers, for a moment it's just the two of them \nin the alley.\n\nPETER","date":"2020-07-08T20:41:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"floof_creampuff"}},{"id":"6173655991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Lag","review":"Lag","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:21Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Sir smurfinator"}},{"id":"6173603365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🖕🇺🇸","review":"Horrible app 🤢👎","date":"2020-07-08T20:21:33Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🖕😘🖕"}},{"id":"6173596248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP😡","review":"A Waste Of Space.","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Potatooooi"}},{"id":"6173570135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"FAKE NEWS","review":"THIS APP IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.
