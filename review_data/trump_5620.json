Most of the content is poor and should be considered spam. I have no idea how anyone could find the slightest bit of information from this app useful because it really should be considered garbage. For those people looking to find information regarding the upcoming election I would honestly go to some other third party news source that gives unbiased information. Seriously hoping that the Trump Administration finds some better alternative than this sad attempt at an app."}},{"id":"6177440516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:49:26Z","title":"✨H o r r i b l e✨","userName":"kaitlyn bennet 🔫","review":"This app took a whole WEEK to download.  As soon as I opened the app I saw my pedo- I mean my president tanning. 😹 the \n🍊 Cheeto 🍊 frightened my pet polar bear and made him fly away. he shattered my window on the way out. The app then made my phone explode so I’m now writing this on my touchscreen refrigerator. 😾 I also made a grocery pickup order on my refrigerator. When I got there I saw that they only gave me oranges and Cheetos. They also gave me a piece of paper that said make America white again. None of the workers were wearing masks. Is this app trying to kill me? ✨D o n t✨ get this app. 🥰🤪🙈. Chile anyways so um have a good day ❤️🌻🌱✨🦋🦄🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177374760","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:29:58Z","title":"High Hopes CRUSHED","userName":"Gemthingy","review":"I was hoping to see how my favorite show kids show main character was doing. I always loved watching the annoying orange as a kid; it was a great show. However, as the show has gone on the character has just lost its mind. Maybe he has spent too much time running it’s mouth and lying that it just doesn’t even know what’s coming out of its mouth. I would say I hope the best for the show, but they just need to cancel it at this point. It has gone on too long... Oh the app has a plethora of mistakes and lies all throughout it and is a disgrace to all of mankind"}},{"id":"6177297122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:07:57Z","title":"✨Yeah✨","userName":"oliviakmartinez","review":"I downloaded this app to support our ✨micro wang cheeto✨(not really🤮) but as soon as I opened the app my phone turned black and my phone started growling at me. This is outrages I would like to speak personally to the ceo of this app because that growl was not consensual😤 I am very upset because I found out this app is also collecting my data such as my pictures, my speaker, and my location. And trump throws to get rid of other apps that “collect data” but why don’t you check up on your own app and tell use that your app isn’t doing the same 💕 love a Hispanic you’d spit on🤪🤑"}},{"id":"6177274847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:01:35Z","title":"i had to become a fugitive","userName":"hood politics","review":"i downloaded this app right. i open the app right. my phone glitches so much and then it exploded. bro what the heck! i go to apple store to get another phone. i get it and load my i cloud data and all that jazz. my phone glitches and explodes once again. this happens again and again 9 times. then i look out my window and i see a man in a dark hoodie outside my window. he lifts up a phone with the trump app on the screen. his phone glitches and explodes immediately projectiling him 50 ft into the air and instantly killing him. he landed in my driveway. the police would think i killed him. i had to hide him and cut off all loose ends. i dragged him into my basement and threw him into my blast furnace. i could hear police sirens outside. i got all my personal belongings into my go diego go backpack, hopped over my fence and ran. because of this app i am now a fugitive."}},{"id":"6177247738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:53:37Z","title":"gross","userName":"pro muffin painter","review":"the first things they asked me was to put in my number so they can track me and send me death threats. i said NO WAY jose. anyways then they asked to send notifications and it was really rude of them to think i want to be reminded of the cheeto as president everyday. it took 20 months to download and took up all the storage in my phone and had to delete everything i had. the app grew out of my phone and shoved me out of my house. i ended up going to the hospital but he found me and flew me to the white house and killed me on top of it. this app is very dangerous don’t download it."}},{"id":"6177228206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:47:57Z","title":"Honest Review","userName":"Meag Tron","review":"I was excited to have Trump updates on my phone! Unfortunately, the app took a very long time to download  and every time I open the app it crashes. Worst app in the history of apps. Not user friendly. After several days of constant updates it let me open it without crashing. When I finally got it to work it asks for your location and very personal information to proceed, I’m concerned they will send my info in China!  I do not recommend. I deleted it and am very disappointed our president would produce such an privacy invasive app."}},{"id":"6177187608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:20Z","title":"𝒦𝑒𝓉𝒶𝓂𝒾𝓃𝑒✨","userName":"a1suxkit","review":"If I could rate this app 0 stars I would, it was absolutely awful. When I first opened up the app my phone was glitching so much and caused my phone screen to completely freeze, I had to go to the store to get it fixed, the guy told me that there was a virus that came from the app. This app can not be trusted, the government is trying to get access to more of your information by getting you to download this app, be careful and don’t make the same mistake as me. Rate this app a one star so that others can avoid having their information leaked."}},{"id":"6177149031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:25:32Z","title":"Worst experience ever!","userName":"mrs. scared for my life :o","review":"i downloaded this app to follow up with donald trump and what he was doing with our country but the app took a 𝓵𝓲𝓯𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮 to download. Once it finally downloaded, i was horrified to see a orange immediately pop up on my phone. It startled me. I then started to read more about what the president was doing but i couldn’t read because the app crashed multiple times. The app then asked for my information so i gave it to then thinking i was safe. NO. They hacked all of my information. I am scared for my life. This was by far the worst app i have ever downloaded.😡"}},{"id":"6177119148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:17:16Z","title":"Awful app! Do NOT get","userName":"Katie465","review":"First of all, this app took forever to download! It’s not worth waiting weeks for just one app to download, and i could hardly do anything else on my phone while it was downloading. I’m lucky I didn’t get fired with all the calls I missed! Besides that, the app wouldn’t open easily and would shut down and take me back to my home screen. The way to receive updates on news and communicate with others is so confusing! NO ONE would be able to figure it out. It’s just a poorly made app and I would not download it! NOT WORTH IT!"}}]}
