He is filled full of only hate and narcissism. This man is a Cheeto puff – orange, devoid of substance, leaves an unappealing trace wherever he goes, generally unfulfilling, pretending that there are more like him than there actually are (those bags are NEVER full), and so on. Why anyone would actually use this app makes no sense to me whatsoever.","userName":"Ioan C.

This app is not smart, it’s not kind and it’s not important. It missed the mark and is high key sad if I’m being honest. Like I thought this was a app where I could buy self-tanner but they don’t even have the good stuff. I’m trying to blackfish this summer and this app was a disappointment when it comes to that front. #OrangeLivesMatter","userName":"Terixta Martine","rating":1,"title":"What a mess","date":"2020-07-09T04:38:03Z"}},{"id":"6175092825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to stay up-to-date with the wonderful things our President has been doing, however, after the first few nights of the app sitting on my phone, I started feeling sick.
