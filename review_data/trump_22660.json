Not worth it at ALL.","date":"2020-07-02T17:12:45Z"}},{"id":"6145683847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NO! ✨❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"Playerthinking","rating":1,"review":"✨☺️This app is horrendous. When I opened it it screamed the n word at me for ten minutes, and wouldn’t let me exit. Also, it was horribly glitchy and I couldn’t get past the first part. Also, trump looks like a Cheeto. I would rather vote for a baby than voting for that sweet potato looking pedo. So, have a nice day and don’t forget to take the app down.✨🧚","date":"2020-07-01T20:49:40Z"}},{"id":"6144946364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"IM SCARED👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"userName":"american ninja warriors","rating":1,"review":"so ofc i had to download because trump 2020:D but no i changed my mind after this app! trump came out of the screen and raped me just like he did to those little girls!!

I also noticed that over time my hair started to decline and my skin was becoming orange. I wish there was a way to fix these problems, but because it seems like it won’t happen anytime soon.... you get one star my guy.","date":"2020-07-01T14:53:39Z"}},{"id":"6143599266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"massive horse peen 🥵","isEdited":false,"userName":"massive horse peen 🥵","rating":1,"review":"#BLM\nAmerica is turning into a war zone because some ppl can’t pull their head out of their butts and realized the African American  community is being treated poorly. We need to stop hating and start loving. Too many ppl are dying, being hurt, murdered, starved, racially profiled, hated, and this list goes on you dry muppet farts. They are human too so start treating them like one. ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾","date":"2020-07-01T10:40:33Z"}},{"id":"6141186646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is horrible false advertising","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cole Carelli","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this thinking this was part of Joe Biden’s campaign, but all i see is a Cheeto asking me to vote for him, WHICH I WILL NOT DO. This app markets itself as pro Biden and then sucker punches you into a pro trump campaign. Get it off the App Store because this shouldn’t be allowed while a crucial presidential election is happening. You should be ashamed of yourselves.","date":"2020-06-30T19:33:24Z"}},{"id":"6140646097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨ 𝓽𝓻𝓪𝓾𝓶𝓪𝓽𝓲𝔃𝓮𝓭 ✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"bhavyanoor","rating":1,"review":"i had originally decided to download the app to support my gracious and good president, but was ✨ 𝓽𝓻𝓪𝓾𝓶𝓪𝓽𝓲𝔃𝓮𝓭 ✨when i saw a hairy orange on the front page 😠. i am allergic to oranges and even looking at them could possibly kill me. i had to be taken to the ER and almost died because of this app. would not recommend to anyone with a will to live😘💅✨","date":"2020-06-30T16:36:26Z"}},{"id":"6136409158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Talked to Obama ✨✨💕💕 he said no ✨✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"✨💕🧚🏼🧚🏼","rating":1,"review":"Worst app EVER! It made me physically brain dead. It starts when you look at the app you’re about to download; you start feeling woozy. Then when it’s on your phone and you OPEN the app, I started to projectile vomit EVERYWHERE. I then vomited so much I had to be put in a medically induced coma. I then died twelve days later.
