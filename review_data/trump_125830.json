I will be voting for Joe.","userName":"😭😞😩","date":"2020-07-10T02:06:09Z"}},{"id":"6179029620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Donald Trump is a white supremacist❤️","review":"I’ve never hated an app more this is AWFUL.. after waiting for 3 days for it to download I started noticing orange stains on my carpet? When trying to brush them off they just were further rubbed in. Almost like cheetos... except they smelt really bad. I started \nhearing racial slurs in the shower and when trying to sleep orange orbs kept flying throughout my room and I heard children whispering about how great trump is. they said he’s almost as cool as Hitler. I am terrified! They called me a f*ggot!?? what the F* is this!!!","userName":"Sophia Reviews","date":"2020-07-10T02:06:08Z"}},{"id":"6179029243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Shrank my shirts and killed my family😔","review":"So I downloaded the app and the first thing I see is this oompah loompah lookin Cheeto that BLINDED ME➖👄➖so I went to look for my shirt because I fell in dog poo and realized the oompah loompah shrank it in the dishwasher.

I now get random pop ups for a discount on toupees. It also gave me explosive diarrhea and made me feel the need to tweet whatever I think of for no reason even if it’s stupid","userName":"Landry Thompson","date":"2020-07-10T02:05:25Z"}},{"id":"6179025762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Why so long to make it work?","review":"This app took 37.25 hours to download and used almost 20GB of data. I’m no tech wizard but that does not seem right. Maybe it gave my phone almost a cleaning, like a Lysol injection for data.\n\nI was so excited to finally get it working and entered my phone number immediately. However, I now seem to be getting a lot of calls and texts asking if I have hot young females in my household. I don’t think it’s related but it only started after I gave the number to this app. \n\nOther than the calls and the data usage and the time to download, this app is great. It allows me to get information that I could get from the internet. But the added benefit is the president now knows where I am at all times. Nice!","userName":"klineda","date":"2020-07-10T02:04:44Z"}},{"id":"6179022437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️but😁i👁can’t🥺get👹through💩the😼door🚪 because🤞🏻my💀booties👻to👿big😍","userName":"jairnekbakkedloc","date":"2020-07-10T02:03:32Z"}},{"id":"6179022354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"complete ass.","review":"took 3 days to download, and when it finished it just crashed and slowed my phone down. i want to help trump keep America great, but what’s the point of keeping America great if he can’t even keep an app running?","userName":"Aprilolol","date":"2020-07-10T02:03:30Z"}},{"id":"6179020388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","review":"So I downloaded this app then my cat threw poop at me and said Barney the dinousuor will win then hamster did a backflip and made babies with an ghost and shot me with a nerf gun and said my ex can do better then Barney the dinuasuor stole my mom and my dad and my brother now I’m lonely and on the street all because of this app i hate this orange 🍊","userName":"pappa u thick","date":"2020-07-10T02:02:47Z"}},{"id":"6179019293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"absolutely not🧚\u200D♂️✨","review":"when i came here to totally support our ✨dehydrated tangerine✨ i noticed that when i opened the app i saw a crusty musty big orange fish in my face 🙈 it was horrible. i saw MANY reviews on this app saying how it took days or even weeks to download, and when it did, it crashed. it even hacked someone. that is just a no no. and when i tell you i opened the app, i flew all the way to M A R S. who’s coming w/ me? i would definitely use some company and get away from this dysfunctional earth. i definitely know about the whole gen z thing, and we are absolutely P O W E R F U L. 😌 don’t mess with us. also you rly have the AUDACITY to just ban tiktok like that? well we also have the AUDACITY to ban this cheesy disgusting racist app, and you also u nasty. 😒 anyways, the main deal here for me is to write this nice review so we can keep tiktok. don’t ban it, or else we will ban you. periodt 😭😗💋 also very disappointed that we have this disgusting, greasy, and old piece of cheddar cheese as our president. im also very disappointed with the horrible decisions that he made. like why take people away from their families. why assault women. why. and people still have the heart to vote for you? im broken man. and im not tryna be mean, but at the same time i am so yeha. bye guys 👁👄👁","userName":"big daddy 😗😌✨","date":"2020-07-10T02:02:25Z"}}]}
