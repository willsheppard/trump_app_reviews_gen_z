This app is straight propaganda and should not be something we should be circulating. This app promotes an era where this country treated a multiple group of people like animals.

Trump 2020!! The virus broke my phone and I had to get it replaced. I don’t have apple care so it cost me nearly 1000$! Please be careful.
