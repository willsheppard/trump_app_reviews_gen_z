Upon installing it my phone was immediately afflicted with virus after virus. As if this wasn’t enough my sister saw the app and suddenly began saying “Yee haw” and caring about horses and Jesus. Our beloved Trump would never, of course, intend for this to happen to me, a homosexual male in the United States of America. Which, as we all know, is the most free country in the entire world (even though some might say as many as seventeen countries outrank the USA in freedom and equality). The fact of the matter is that our dear president has truly failed our country in providing a safe and legitimate app to praise him. Hallowed be our father, Donald Trump, and the son, Barron Trump, and the Holy Spirit, Melania Trump, but not hallowed be the app with which we worship.","userName":"Micahfox33","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:31:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Tramp"}},{"id":"6175882727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was terrible, traumatizing. i don't think i can ever be comfortable and feel safe while using my phone again.😭😭 After waiting a day for this terrible app to download, it hacked my phone and then this picture of Donald Trump naked kept popping up. I suffer from PTSD after this. I've been visiting a therapist consistently, however, i had to get a new therapist for what i told her happened was very traumatizing for her as well. I now do group therapy with her and a new Therapist. 😳 What ever you do, don't download this app. i'm begging you from the bottom of my heart not too do it. it may seem funny or a nice joke, but i suffer from extreme pTSD now. take my mistake and better yourself with it 💕💕 xx","userName":"Katelyn Sch","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:23:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don't Get App😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6175819449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am very disappointed with this app. If there was a manager to speak to I WOULD!!!!!!! FIRST OF ALL it took 77 weeks to download. once it did, i opened the app and MY WHOLE PHONE FROZE. I waited it out and gave it another try. but then i noticed all my info was ERASED. !!! after that i tried to delete the app and it would not let me. it kept sending me messages saying that in order to have a better future as a daughter of illegal immigrants i have to vote for Trump & oNLY TRUMP. I got threats that i would not get accepted to colleges and that i will get tracked down if i don’t do what they say. VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!! the app gave me creep vibes and I just saw an orange on my screen. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!

Very racist and xenophobic, I did not like that at all. I continued to have issues when during his 2016 campaign he promised to build a wall along the southern border. This was an awful idea as it would be amazingly expensive solution to a problem that does not exist. 1. Immigrants help our country, not hurt it and 2. Most would still enter through legal border crossing stations as they have been doing for years. \n\nI can go on and on about how this man is racist, sexist, and also a rapist but the people who have their eyes open already know this. This app is garbage and needs to be removed.","userName":"Hudson Baller","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:59:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"NEEDS TO BE DELETED"}},{"id":"6174701193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is such a bad app omg.

Trump is a vile, disastrous monster who has no regard for national security, foreign politics, of the citizens he is supposed to lead. He’s a fraud, an illegitimate, impeached president who won’t last a day once the title has been stripped from his grubby, little, orange, man-child hands. He happily welcomes the help of dictators and fascists and scorns the advice of democratically elected leaders. Gen Z will not stand for Trump’s disregard of human decency and dignity any longer. WE will hold you accountable for your hate and divisiveness if your party and this government will not. We are a generation. We are a movement. And we will never let the likes of you silence us.","userName":"bo0ho0","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:19:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app AND PRESIDENT ever"}},{"id":"6174562963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi guys it’s your girl thicky Nicky the 𝚋𝚊𝚍𝚍𝚎𝚜𝚝  𝚋𝚒𝚜𝚑 🤑💅🏻I just wanted to say DO not download this!

Little did I know that when I open this up and registered to see what it was about a freaking ray of blue light a mirror for my phone and all I knew was that I became a pickle. I literally got into the form of a freaking cucumber and I just fell to the floor on my face and I screamed I screamed so loud that all the mirror in the hospital broke and then all I could do is cry and I cry until I floated away into the ocean.
