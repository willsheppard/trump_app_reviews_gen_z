I love how honest he is, and that he wants to make America great again! He is NOT what everyone says he is. He is kind, smart, not racist, kinda thicc,and overall he’s my daddy. I love my daddy, my super hero! The way he grabs women so elegantly with his little baby carrot fingers makes me wet. He is indisputably the best president we have ever had. Best at drinking water, making weird faces, and allowing 130,000 of his citizens to die from a deadly virus. What else is there to say? Is is TREMENDOUS!

I was walking on the street open carrying my AR-15 assault rifle like you’re totally supposed to be allowed to do, and Trump pulled up in his Prius with blacked out windows and took my gun, but before he did that he got out of his car, spilling empty bottles of Tryptophan and Fentanyl all over the side walk, and started ranting about the Mexicans. I went to the beach last weekend, so maybe I’m a little more brown than he’s used to? Idk man I’m just mad the president pulled up just to take my gun. Oh yeah also he’s cool with child murder.","date":"2020-07-09T18:06:10Z"}},{"id":"6177682954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App frustration.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dontblamemeivotedforkodos","review":"Hi there.  This app is extremely confusing.  It doesn’t work good at all.  I keep getting some messages ever since I downloaded it and put in my number despite saying I didn’t want that.  I couldn’t use any of the apps features without giving my number and then all of a sudden I have ten messages about winning a prize from the trump administration. I just wanted to get information and instead I’m stuck with all these messages I have to pay for and then delete.  Very frustrating","date":"2020-07-09T18:05:27Z"}},{"id":"6177656708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"how will he get a kiss kiss?? very ugly .","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Tiny tet","review":"this app has given me a TRAUMATIC experience. it’s disgusting i cannot even bars to look at it anymore w out having to gag and ball my eyes out!! the colors don’t match and who is this orange fat man?? i am just so confused it is giving me anxiety and i will not sit and let an app give me a full on mental breakdown w out doing something abt it. if i could rate this app a 0 star it would get just that. it’s disgusting to have to look at this, take this app down otherwise i will be calling corporate immediately 👁👄👁👏🏼❤️😻😽💘😌✨ xoxo. gen z:)","date":"2020-07-09T17:57:01Z"}}]}
