My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.","userName":"AlphaX61","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:30:15Z","title":"Killer Queen Bites The Dust Is Already In Effect!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174196822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hi all, James here. I’m currently traveling abroad and just woke up but I wanted to sit down and make a video addressing everything that is going on right now because I owe everybody an explanation but most importantly I owe two important people an apology... to Tati and James Westbrook. I’m sorry for everything that is going on. Everything that I have put you through over the past few weeks.\nI met Tati and James almost three years ago now when I first was going into the industry and when I had no friends and nobody to talk to or look up to and Tati very quickly took on a parental role with me because she knew my parents were across the country and over the past few years of knowing her family her and her husband have given me so much love and advice and opportunities and a place to stay and a shoulder to cry on at 3 in the morning and support when nobody else would or wanted to and it and I’m disappointed in myself that I ruined our relationship that means so much to me","userName":"shanedawsonpinkwigblackfze","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:59Z","title":"tati","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174158618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if you are reading this, please, for the love of God, do. not. download. at first, everything was normal. the app worked fine. i went along with my day, everything was okay. or atleast, i thought everything was... the night after i’d downloaded the app, i had an eerie feeling i was being watched. i decided to ignore it, try to get some rest. i climbed in bed, i turned my body to the left, my stomach dropped as i realized someone was staring back at me, i screamed. donald trump lay next to me, a clown smile painted across his face. i quickly jumped up. he did too. “WHY ARE YOU HERE” i shouted, too stunned to run. “Well you know everything’s gonna be a breeze” he replied, in a sing son tone. i began sobbing. “and the end will no doubt justify the means” “ I HAVE CHILDREN” i yelled through the tears “you can fix any problems with the slightest of ease” “WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME” i pleases “yes please 😼” he replied maniacally. it was here when i realized he was singing the wizards of waverly place them song.","userName":"imtraumatized","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:47:10Z","title":"one word: traumatic.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173861025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I 1000% do NOT recommend downloading this app! I installed it and almost instantly RATS CAME FLOODING INTO MY HOUSE LIKE THE BEGINNING OF RATATOUILLE! They stole my ps4 and my tv and then continued to run circles around me chanting “trump 2020”. It wasn’t until 3 hours later when they then got hungry and ate all the food in my fridge and then dipped! Approximately 20 afterwards when I thought the worst was over some 7 foot man dressed in all black with a kabuki mask on ran through my front door and broke one of my ankles. He told me if I ever delete this app then he wouldn’t hesitate to break the second one. Lying in the middle of my floor I was able to reach Obama on the phone because I had a personally connection to him. He came over, patched up my ankle, and told me he would make sure that something like this wouldn’t ever happen to me again. Michelle made me some of her famous sweet potato pie and boy was it delicious. Thanks to the Obamas I am able to write this review for y’all. I’m conclusion... don’t EVER download this app!","userName":"MickyD 12367","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:56:38Z","title":"WORST APP EVER😡😡😡❌❌❌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173689916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i downloaded this app because i felt like being brainwashed today by the all mighty cheeto god that is donald j trump. the j stand for j(g)enius. but when i opened it, i got an alert saying that the secret service has my location and they were on their way to my house 😨😨😨suddenly, i hear the front door burst open!🚪💨 the secret service had the police with them too, and the police shot my black neighbor because he “looked threatening” but really he was just watering his flowers. maybe they thought the hose was a gun. idk 🤷\u200D♀️ but then the secret service tried to take me to this island in the bahamas or something so i could give some guy a massage?? idk, they said the guy was only interested in having underaged girls doing it and i am a 17 year old girl so 🤔 but i was like “hell no!” and then they called me a snowflake ❄️😥 anyway, don’t download this app unless you want to experience police brutality and child s*x trafficking. god never makes mistakes♥️✨🥰but he did with this app 😊🧚🏻","userName":"YUH GET INTO ITT 💫✨🧚🏾","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:52:32Z","title":"do NOT 🤚🏼 download this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173474246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first wanted to download this app to be up to date on our fearless orange leader. But when I tried to install it sent me straight to pornhub and the next thing I know my phone was infected by 37 viruses and when I clicked the link to get rid of them my phone started glitching out and the screen went green for 32 minutes and 69 seconds. So I took it to Verizon with my mom and needless to say she wasn’t very happy. She took my phone and now I’m forced to use my old iPhone XS Max 🤮. Now on this phone I downloaded it again but this time whenever I open it my room starts flooding with turtles, they come from everywhere and because of my deathly fear of turtles I kill them all ON SIGHT. So now my room smells like the 302 dead turtles that surround me. I’ve lit candles, farted and even smoked the peace pipe but the smell won’t go away. Horrible app. if you want dead turtles and broken phones then I guess I recommend it, it just isn’t for me though.","userName":"Collinbigpeen","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:37:12Z","title":"Would give zero stars if I could the smell is horrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173074823","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I would give this app 0 stars if I could. Like many others it took many weeks and hours for it to download despite having exceptional WiFi. And when it finally downloaded it caused my phone to glitch. I could not use it to call or text people!! 😡Instead it showed me pictures of a scary old man who was very orange!?!? The worst part about it is after trying to get the app to work it caused my phone to ultimately blow up and start a fire in my home!!! I tired to put the fire out but I couldn’t stop it and my house was engulfed in flames within minutes. I managed to escape my house, however the firefighters and myself were unable to go back and rescued my poor dog in the burning house. He was found in a corner next to all my other trump 2020 merch, now covered in dog pee and poo. He tried to stay safe with good ol Donny but alas was left burnt to a crisp. Much like overcooked bacon 😢.  I DO NOT recommend this app at all. Donny you owe me a dog!!!!!!🤬🤬 R.I.P fluffy😔😔","userName":"Pugspugspugspugspugs","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:24:39Z","title":"Worst app ever, killed my dog😞","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171786195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app, it was okay the first time I used it but it shut out of the app within a few seconds. When I went back on, it automatically enabled my microphone, camera, photos, and worst of all, my home location. If that’s not weird enough, when I went to my photos there was a picture that I did not take which was in the time I was using this app. This app is constantly tracking your location and I don’t understand why the app would need this information. And almost immediately after I downloaded it, I started getting countless calls on my phone with pre-recorded campaign messages playing. This is all weird and I don’t know why it needs this private info, but makes me feel unsafe because I never uploaded my phone number... I’m deleting this app immediately, please don’t download. Warning my friends and family not to download/delete if they already have.","userName":"Phone Safety","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:09:49Z","title":"Please read: location tracking, phone calls","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176989621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the cult-like following that this cheeto puff looking, oompa loompa built child has congregated in this disgraceful app. from what i can gather, the sheep that support this abomination all download this app in order to receive info about him & his plans. however the app, looks as if it was designed & codes by a child. the aesthetics of the app are so sickeningly patriotic that you can only assume the creators and users are racist because why are you so proud of a country that has such racist, oppressive institutions? it was a rather disturbing experience to be immersed in such an ignorant digital atmosphere & i call upon the mandarin orange himself to finance my therapy so that i can recover from this atrocity. this app should come with a warning (something like “ignorance, racism, homophobia, & xenophobia are beliefs prevalent in this application, use at your own risk of frustration with the stupidity of white supremacists). all in all, I strongly advice against downloading this app. ✨💕😘","userName":"Star Singer Girl","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:41:53Z","title":"you tried, now don’t ✨ever✨ try again🧚🏾\u200D♂️💕😘💗","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175969867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could give this app 0 stars I most definitely would! The app took 63 whole days to download, and once i was finally able to use it, my life went down hill😭. To be completely transparent, my life is ruined due to this single app. I was looking through the app, and to my surprise I see Donald trump’s little private part all over my screen!! When I tell you I almost called the cops🤚🏽, but I’m not of pale complexion so they weren’t going to help anyway 😘my mother disowned me once she saw me try to take my eyes out!she though I was a goblin! O And to make it even worse, I received a call from the president himself! He named my address and threatened to take me back where I came from, unbelievable!!! Two minutes later a helicopter landed on my roof and I see 5 man sized sanitization bottles sent from trump himself!! They wanted to clean my insides 👀\nTake my advice and don’t download this app- MY MOTHER DISOWNED ME, and Donald is threatening to send me to conversion therapy!👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩","userName":"Kleetorez","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:52:35Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP😢-Clee Torrez","isEdited":false}}]}
