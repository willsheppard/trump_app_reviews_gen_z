I first thought the app was glitching but then I realized it wasn’t and it said the notification was meant for me. it told me that I didn’t have enough privilege that I was to be separated from my family and kept at a concentration camp. at first I was confused and I didn’t know if this was serious because no one was reacting. I was surprised that no one heard about this and that they were trying to hide the fact that this was happening from everyone. Then app started chanting Donald Trump and I started crying in confusion. I had to find privilege and I didn’t know where to get it. but I found the answer. I had to buy wheat thins and bleach my skin. I started sweating and getting itchy from the bleach. then Trump came up to me and gave me a bottle. he told me “wear this”. I stared at p and realize it was a foundation bottle. but it wasnt my shade so i started doing my own make up. I started to see the confusion in his eyes turn into rage. he told me that I was supposed to only put make up on for men and the way they liked it because it could never be a hobby for girls. he started calling me slurs and pointing features on my body. I said I’m sorry I didn’t know I hurt a man. I forgot theyre more important than women will ever be. I pulled out his orange foundation and contoured myself into an orange. he began acknowledging my skills and telling me to do his makeup. i started off with the signature ronald mcdonald foundation and lipstick. i said thats clownery luv lets go to the circus together.","userName":"samantha.rivera","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:40:41Z","title":"horrible"}},{"id":"6173976623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I can smell him through the app","userName":"helping google classroom","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:39:23Z","title":"This app no"}},{"id":"6173975591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t understand how people support a clown.","userName":"theboi8","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:38:59Z","title":"The worst app EVER created"}},{"id":"6173957962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"this app crashes every time i open it. i ordered it to give me a big mac but have a a che to me guy. this app is a scam don’t use it. it will give u an infection!!","userName":"unicornliver28","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:19Z","title":"no."}},{"id":"6173954490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"i would rather cut off my big toe than open this app again","userName":"Aden Ward","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:31:00Z","title":"awful"}}]}
