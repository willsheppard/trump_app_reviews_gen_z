Upon downloading the app, not only did it not work but about an hour later I got a knock at my door. Nobody was there except for a sack of oranges. Days have gone by now and I keep getting mysterious bags of oranges and Cheetos on my doorstep. One of them even threatened me with a gun. I fear for my own life and my family’s lives because of all these immigrant oranges. Next thing you know, they’ll be trying to take my job away. Now all my diet has consisted of is old, soggy, racist oranges. Eat the rich.","date":"2020-07-08T20:40:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"EdgyBoi13"}},{"id":"6173649043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","review":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE APP!!! As soon as I downloaded it I started hearing loud screaming almost like a siren then my phone COMPLETELY shut down so I wasn’t able to do anything about it the screams started getting closer and closer. I then ran downstairs to my mom only to find out that SHES the one screaming. I asked her why she was screaming and she SCREAMED TRUMPS COMING and that’s when I knew. I then ran up stairs and had to shatter and break my phone but as soon as I did that. A bunch of trump supporter chanting “here comes trump” came and started attacking my house. My house is gona take YEARS to rebuild!😔 I DO NOT recommend😭","date":"2020-07-08T20:37:54Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bvogt29"}},{"id":"6173622513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"If I could go lower, I would","review":"Now. For starters, I am all for Donal Trump. He is actually my celebrity crush. But this app is absolute bananas!! As a 45 year old women who was born in raised in this beautiful country. But as a middle class citizen of god’s land I believe it’s my responsibility to explain the horrible app. \n\nThis app takes centuries to download. I was unable to open any of my other apps while this one was downloading. Like Twitter and Facebook! How else was I supposed to keep up with our President?! It was a week before I was even able to open this app. \n\nThis app exposes our great president. Only two weeks into this app, I got a notification to see Donal Trump’s ‘foot pics’???? This will not stand. I had no way of declining and sadly I had to redownload this app. I won’t go down without a fight. \n\nFinally, this app will share your personal information. I believe it’s HACKED!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:26Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen Smith, 45, Republican"}},{"id":"6173613940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","review":"i was on this app for no more than five seconds and my whole phone started glitching, my phone is pressing this app at random times when i’m not meaning to press the app. the download process took a couple hours and i was incapable of going on any other apps while the download process was happening.

It gave the wrong narratives and basically said to my face that “ethnic people don’t deserve rights, Mexicans need to be locked in more concentration camps, and that Asian people shouldn’t be allowed in America because of Covid.” The man that looks like a Cheeto kept appearing all over the app and ruined my experience as well as my appetite while scrolling through it😖 it asked me for support in voting, and then proceeded to electrocute me via charging port. If I could give this app half a star, I would. 🥳Trump 2020 🇺🇸 but on a gravestone🌝💫💞😍🤪🎉","date":"2020-07-08T20:02:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"KeYoN👍"}},{"id":"6173535159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disappointing app !","review":"if your a karen and you support trump and think all lives matter you should fall down the stairs get hit by a car fly behind the car and get stuck in a pot hole then a group of rats attack you and when you go home you miss your ride and it starts raining and then you have to walk home and when you get home your house is flooded and you have to pee really bad so you go to the toilet and sit down but then you get stuck and you stay there for 3 hours and you start to get hungry but you have no food and then you stay stuck there for 14 days and when you finally escape all of your food is rotten and you have to go to the super market but when you get there it’s closed and you go back home but your locked out and your phone is dead and you fall asleep outside your house and no one knows what happened to you .","date":"2020-07-08T19:58:08Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"arousbdb"}},{"id":"6173501828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Annoying problems","review":"I signed in this app like you have to but then every time I pressed something it would tell me to sign in so I can view. Every hour my phone started to play songs from my apps that I use to listen to songs but I didn’t play a song and I have a fear when something happens by its self I get creeped out. This app also made my phone started to be glitchy and I could hardly use any of my other apps. I pressed no notifications because I don’t like them but then it kept sending me notifications","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:40Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nismo316"}},{"id":"6173486784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible app","review":"i hated this! this app took me a whole 5 minutes to download 😾😾 im very disappointed in trump. i loved him until he made this stupid app. if he really wants his followers to be devoted, he should escort himself off the planet ✨😝 maybe i stead of leading his own country into war...
