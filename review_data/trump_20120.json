And it is sooo horrible. Would never recommend. It glitched my whole phone and changed my photos from the original ones to the Trump 2020 photos. This should be deleted.

He hides away as we fight for what is right. For what? To try and protect his ego?? Because if that’s the case, he should have been trying before he ruined it how many years ago.

I do not support the ideas and thoughts projected through this app."}},{"id":"6174898502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Moe Kanneh","title":"WORST APP ON THE PLANET","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:36:12Z","rating":1,"review":"It was fine at first until then it just started glitching I kept on glitching in time I open the app and my battery will go down super fast any time I was using it it’s not stable at all I had to keep in keep on charging my phone to use this app I don’t recommend this app at all if it had a zero star I would use it."}},{"id":"6174880521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"donotvoteforaoldgrumpycornhead","title":"so many problems in this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:57Z","rating":1,"review":"there’s so many flaws in this app whoever developed it or whatever clearly didn’t know what they were doing. this app freezes makes noise all the time and even lets out a really loud noise that says “who put the muffins in the freezer” 0/10 i downloaded this app bc i clearly dint care about other lives and the app wouldn’t even let me open it. it’s really bad it’s constantly lagging and no matter how much u try i just can’t use it properly bc i’m a boomer and above the age of 50. if you got to this far you should rate it a one star. horrible app."}},{"id":"6174878229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"wh0re4cottagecoreee","title":"terrible spyware on american ppl!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:16Z","rating":1,"review":"this app is actually a secret way for the chinese government to get your data!!! they have it linked to you icloud once you open it and send everything to china!!! please please please get this to the supreme court to get this app shut down!!!!!! the american people and YOUTH need to be protected😠😠 this app will ruin our way of life!! also blm and acab bbyyyyy"}},{"id":"6174868154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"8desi24","title":"don’t download!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:27:21Z","rating":1,"review":"so I downloaded the app of course.

All it does is say it’s the greatest app of all time without doing anything. Also do not let your parents over the age of 40 download. Our parents and grandparents are at an impressionable age and this app is totally inappropriate for them. Soon enough they’ll be saying “all lives matter.” Just disgusting."}},{"id":"6174865258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leslypoueh","title":"TERRIBLE APP😡👊🏽","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:26:31Z","rating":1,"review":"this app is just absolutely DESPICABLE! an absolute scam👺 I was looking into finding out the wonders that this app holds by the Orange man 🍊and out of nowhere the words “GRAB EM BY THE P***Y” pops up🗿🤢 WHAT EVEN IS THAT????
