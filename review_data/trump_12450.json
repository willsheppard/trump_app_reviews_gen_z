It’s hacking my phone and adding viruses. When I open the app it just crashes, so I can’t even find out what our president is doing! I’m so done 😤🙅\u200D♀️","userName":"🍊👶🤡😤😣"}},{"id":"6178315179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I don’t think this app is safe","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:32:38Z","review":"So they asked for my phone number and that allows them to track my movements easily.  Even Tiktok doesn’t do that.  I’m extremely concerned this app has now infiltrated my phone with spyware, data tracking, and location tracking. I’ve deleted the app now but now I’m receiving robo calls like never before.  I don’t recommend downloading this app as I feel it’s a national security issue.","userName":"Don't like scam"}},{"id":"6178287981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad App","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:22:43Z","review":"When I first downloaded the app I was generally confused about why there was a ugly orange man on the first page and I generally thought he was an oompa loopa! Diving further in I noticed how racist, Misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, idiot this man truly is. Furthermore I got ads for penis enlargement pills which might just say something about the people that download and regularly use this sad excuse for an app. No good, LAME, LOSER, and “YUGGGE Disappointment” are just a sample of words i would use to describe it.","userName":"Elisabeth3144"}},{"id":"6178246918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This was scary!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:07:40Z","review":"I opened the app and my eyes went blurry and I started crying😭😭 then saw his face and I nearly had a heart attack🥵😡. I woke up and I was dead ☠️and the doctor asked what was my cause death and I said Donald Trump‘s face🤡.Yep that’s right people Donald Trumps face kills people😱. If your child gets this be concerned because they may die😭.Message to America don’t let your presidents be a ✨🍊orange🍊✨. Download this app if you want a similar experience :P and if you like Donald Trump this is you ->🤡.","userName":"tick tock gen z"}},{"id":"6178232593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just why","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:02:27Z","review":"When I downloaded the app I just wanted to keep up with our president’s decisions, but the notifications were so annoying, it’s kept me up multiple times, and it has made me phone tu n off and or restart by itself, after I got the app I started feeling watched, more than usual, within seconds I felt something watching me, so I moved where I was at, and it stopped, I don’t know though, I don’t recommend","userName":"Iggy polesmen 🥴🙃🤪"}},{"id":"6178230795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"made my phone want to kill itself :(","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:01:46Z","review":"Poor phone, it didn’t like this one things about it self, and that my friends is this app. My phone kept crashing and mindlessly just avoiding to open at all costs. I deleted it straight after. Highly would not recommend you get this app, so many bugs and problems. The biggest being our orange. So please do yourself a favor and get this app off the App Store <3","userName":"matchagreentrees"}},{"id":"6178190660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Biden fan page","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:47:40Z","review":"If I could rate this 0 stars I would. I thought this was supposed to be a Trump official app not a Biden fan page. It crashes every time I use it. This app is completely biased and reeks of hypocrisy. I wanted to learn more about the trump campaign and what he’s doing for our country but instead the app is like a group of teenagers bickering. It has little to no information on trumps campaign and has more information on what Joe Biden’s doing.","userName":"Barron Trump 2.0"}},{"id":"6178181641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:44:32Z","review":"I got this app to understand more about one of our political candidates before voting in November. I am saddened to see that this app not only is hard to navigate but is full of racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and down right disgraceful ideologies that will doom the future of the United States as we know it. This app not only has completely destroyed my phone as it has slowed it down, but also seems like it takes a ton of personal info from it. WORST APP EVER.","userName":"jddjenskan"}},{"id":"6178174492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very dangerous app 😱😖😣😩😭","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:42:05Z","review":"I got this app because I was very excited to support Trumpet. However, after I downloaded it, men in white costumes stalked me and waited outside my house saying that Donald Trump’s app sent them. They danced around a fire while holding hands and chanting rituals and screaming “we love the trumpet” and “all hail the trumpet.” it was extremely alarming and scary. then they kidnapped my daughter and danced on her to “gangnam style.” they forced my husband to eat cockroaches too. I would not reccomend.","userName":"anya.red"}}]}
