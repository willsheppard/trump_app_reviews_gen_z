Almost like a virus was placed on my phone. The app won’t even open and I can’t delete it!!! Ever since downloading, my phone has been acting very strange and I’m concerned that something fishy was downloaded to my phone via this app; especially because I can’t even delete it now! This app is horrible! Please remove this app from the App Store!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:22:56Z"}},{"id":"6173605539","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jayleigh Anne S.","title":"No Thanks!","rating":1,"review":"Me and my husband both downloaded this app. He has an older phone and his phone completely shut down as soon as it was downloaded, after taking nearly 1.5 hours to download. On my phone, which is an iPhone 11, every time I tried to open the app my phone glitched out and was frozen on my lock screen for at least ten minutes. Also, I don’t like the fact you have to make an account just to keep up with his news. Bad App!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:22:19Z"}},{"id":"6173605474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nebulakula","title":"worst app ever!!","rating":1,"review":"this app is honestly one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded!! the app constantly crashes when I open it up, sometimes it even crashes before I even open it. the customer support is GOD awful, I have called 27 times, yet the only thing I hear is TRUMP2020 or TRUMP. the exterior of the app is disgusting, a white with a blue “T” for TRUMP!??? the interior of this app is an ugly blue with the usa flag and a picture of cinnamon h!tler himself!! i will NOT be returning to this app, I will NOT be recommending this app to ANYONE!

When I opened it this morning, it was STILL DOWNLOADING. I had to wait at least an HOUR for it to FULLY download. When I opened the app while Eating, I CHOKED on MY FOOD when I OPENED the app. I BARFED after that. I don’t understand how PEOPLE that have left FIVE STAR reviews can TORTURE themselves like that. I keep having repeated NIGHTMARES after I DOWNLOADED this APP I don’t UNDERSTAND how BAD an APP can be in the APP STORE. I had to CLEAN my phone because my DOG saw THE APP and BARFED all over my PHONE.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:54Z"}},{"id":"6173552850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"READ IT NOW OR ELSE","title":"2020’s worst app","rating":1,"review":"this app took a full day to download and then proceeded to glitch every time I tried to open it. then, after turning off my phone in hopes of stopping the glitches, my phone lost ALL of its data. all of my pictures, messages, apps, etc. are gone and disappeared from the cloud. THIS APP STEALS OUR INFORMATION TO SELL TO RUSSIA. it also brought a flock of vultures to my house. it’s been 1 week and they still haven’t left. they’ve already taken my neighbors small dog as a sacrifice. do not trust this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:06Z"}},{"id":"6173521356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨✨Anonymous2020✨✨","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"review":"This took days to download and I have great internet also the graphics are so bad I might as well be using a Samsung because I couldn’t see anything it was all pixels and I tried restarting the app and I now it keeps bringing me to an orange screen I’ve also been but before that not only did it take days to download it took even more days to load in I WAS SITTING IN A WHITE SCREEN FOR SO LONG and now my phone loses power so fast even when I’m not in the app and it takes up so much storage.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:53:21Z"}},{"id":"6173510688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"debra-anne ventsinheilger","title":"terrible app","rating":1,"review":"not only did this app take forever to download, but it disabled many of my other apps, and I could no longer use them as if the app has put parental locks on my own phone. Not to mention it emailed my boss and sent a resignation letter because I had to focus full time on the 2020 presidential election. In addition to everything else, the app has somehow been able to hypnotize my dog into reciting all of trumps’ speeches. Thanks to the speeches I can’t sleep, for they are keeping me awake.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:49:41Z"}},{"id":"6173499265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"skendkwnw","title":"WORST APP EVER!💅🏼✨😻","rating":1,"review":"This Cheeto is really trying to take me life, he’s trying to kill me.
