I can‚Äôt imagine President Donald J. Trump would ever sign off on the use of this app when they are publicly promoting pictures where he does not look as regal as he is. This app must be a joke or not affiliated with my president, and I won‚Äôt stand for this slander. I bet this is some cheap joke by a bunch of snowflake liberals.

This app was so confusing and kept asking me for my money! Why would our gorgeous Donald ask for my credit card information and social security number? I then received many unknown charges to my card from this app, and for random dating sites for elderly people and for marriage counseling.","userName":"MK OKAYY","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-16T20:35:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6065572010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was watching my favorite news broadcasting network and I got excited to see this app. Come to find out I need a credit card to even get started.

I‚Äôm just not that kinda of person. When I got this app I thought I would be able to discover how Trump got his beautiful neon, I mean glowing skin complexion but I was highly disappointed when all I saw where pictures upon pictures of feet.","userName":"jed dio","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T02:52:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Too many pictures of feet"}},{"id":"6064055364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because I got an email from daddy trump and papa pence themselves saying this app was the only way to access exclusive merch and ‚Äúpersonal videos‚Äù... I was disappointed by the app in that it was a direct link to their overpriced onlyfans account :( how do you expect the hardworking middle class to see the artwork that is trump, when it‚Äôs $10 a picture? :(:(:(","userName":"user109275","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-11T18:40:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":":(:(:("}},{"id":"6057645009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all... this app did not ask me for my consent then it judged me for my skin color and disabilities. Just great. Life is already hard enough now I have 101 push notifications about some dusty lookin Cheeto guy that wants me to come into his ‚Äúbunker‚Äù with him. Nah man! This has been an unfortunate experience. I am taking a fist full of tums, locking all my doors, and trying to get some sleep.

This app only promotes America, when all countries matter. I also saw that you can send a birthday card to trump and he for one didn‚Äôt send a thank you letter but all birthdays matter so it feels ignorant. Although he is very good and knows all the things,  I did not see that in this app.","userName":"72839572737","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:14:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Why to not download this app"}},{"id":"6179179497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened this app I got my leg chopped off. This was one of the worst apps ever made because I feel harassed, threatened, traumatized, etc. You might think I‚Äôm overreacting but as soon as I opened this app the government officials found out my name my parents‚Äô names my brother‚Äôs name and they just killed them all. Please Apple, take this one down.
