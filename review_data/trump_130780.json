His neck reminds me of a woman’s lady parts and I just find it absolutely repulsive that you would even use an image like that to start up the app, theirs kids who use it 🙄 he’s holding up a fist in the picture as well which I find very offensive because I feel like he’s threatening me. Also, using the US flag as anything other than a flag (he’s using it as a pin on his shirt) is soooo disrespectful if you actually read the US flag code. Overall the app is disgusting and offensive.","userName":"Kenyaxoo","title":"Cheeto puff"}},{"id":"6174525828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:47:01Z","rating":1,"review":"All I have to say is that this is ABSOLUTELY horrendous 0.000000000000000001/10 recommend","userName":"GET TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE;83$,02","title":"TIKTOK LIVES ALSO MATTER✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿"}},{"id":"6174524243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:33Z","rating":1,"review":"I’m a huge trump supporter and it’s my biggest dream to meet the overgrown Cheeto himself. I downloaded this app to keep in touch with all the amazing things trump is doing for our country, such as being a white supremacist😍👨🏻\u200D🦳, being a pedophile👧🏻😏, not showing the same respect for women as men 👩🏼<👱🏻\u200D♂️, allowing CHILDREN to get locked in cages 👶🏽👧🏽, and so many other things 😍😍. But anyways my problem with this app is that is simply made my 🅲🅾︎🅾︎🅲🅷🅸🅴 itch😔. After downloading it my 🅲🅾︎🅾︎🅲🅷🅸🅴 automatically started itching 😭. Then when I opened it my catdogsourisrex started chanting “trump 2020 ʙᴜᴛ ᴏɴ ᴀ ɢʀᴀᴠᴇ sᴛᴏɴᴇ 🧚\u200D♀️✨😍🥰💖” as it swam around a Cheeto lying helplessly on my floor. My 🅲🅾︎🅾︎🅲🅷🅸🅴 started itching so bad I had to go to the hospital 😭😭😭 . However they denied me care because They said I was probably “illegal” I then proceeded to yell for the manager because my tan was just so dark it made me look like one of those Mexicans and how dare they compare me to such low class people here to steal our jobs😒 (TRUMP 2020! BUILD THAT WALL!!)who cares if they have a family they’re tryna do better for!?! And no I’m not racists my right arms dad’s sister’s pinky toe nail’s shirt’s great grandmother twice removed is Mexican😌. Anyways after they realized I was a 1020302 year old white woman they tried to assist me. But then my 🅲🅾︎🅾︎🅲🅷🅸🅴 exploded in front of her face 😭😭 I was so embarrassed and will be suing!","userName":"internetRando","title":"MY OH MY, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6174522060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:45:56Z","rating":1,"review":"She👩🏽like 🌂papi🍰I💖adore👑you🙌I'm 🛍 like😌baby✨I🖍ain't 💅 normal🌻Rrrrr🦁🦁🦁foreigner💗foreigner💗foreigner","userName":"hdhehsushe","title":"cheeto"}},{"id":"6174521595","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:45:47Z","rating":1,"review":"i got this app to read about politics.

I was petrified at the sight of a Cheeto weenie on the sign up page. And when I was waiting for the verification code to send it played the spongebob theme song. as a straight black, African, not American, orange, grey, albino, brown, egg white, microwave, dolphin, bendy ruler, slinky, rat. I am offended to see the amount of times that trump asks for money and posts inappropriate slurs to woman and vegetarians. The amount of Cheetos on the official page is also astronomical. That is all I have to say for this app.","userName":"whodafak asked","title":"I am appalled and offended"}},{"id":"6174519307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:45:08Z","rating":1,"review":"This app stole my Mc.Nuggies and my fries!!!
