It is almost as atrocious as donald trumps snapback wig. As a Gen Z, we hold such power and I know that the app will be gone pretty soon, just like donald trump in office. Hopefully my review will be taken into action asap. \nXoxo\n                        -Your least favorite generation"}},{"id":"6179930600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Shilent","date":"2020-07-10T07:27:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not great","review":"I was promised something great!

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care\n\nwhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready!\n\nOoming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up and Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father\n\npaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you’re u, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it.\n\nThree days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.- Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15.  That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive\n\ngolden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is! - Yes, we're all cousins.\n\n- Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect\n\nof bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.\n\nHere we have our latest advancement,\n\nthe Krelman. - What does that do?\n\n- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.\n\nOan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! “ What's the difference?\"\n\nHow can you say that? One job forever?\n\nThat's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know\n\nwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like\n\noutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks - Hi, Jocks!\n\nYou guys did great! You're monsters You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who know where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it\n\nand the ladies see you wearing it Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous\n\nbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring."}},{"id":"6179929447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mike Streit","date":"2020-07-10T07:26:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","review":"Definitely way worse than tiktok!"}},{"id":"6179929217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Smol_weebUwU","date":"2020-07-10T07:26:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ewww","review":"Dis dude is a r4pi$t and r4c1st, also h0m0ph0bic and WAY MORE 🤢🤢🤢🤢"}},{"id":"6179928898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mia ilenne moore","date":"2020-07-10T07:26:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"trump for prison ❤️","review":"this is the worst app EVER. i highly suggest NOT getting it. it is a TOTAL waste of time"}},{"id":"6179928759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"masonwritesreviews","date":"2020-07-10T07:26:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Total scam","review":"Awful.
