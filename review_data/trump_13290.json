When I decided to download the app it took 4 days. After it finally downloaded I was notified that I had gotten a virus on my phone??? What is this?? This is unacceptable!

Once I opened the app it set off a VIRUS in my phone ðŸ˜¾. I had to take my phone to the apple store and yell at the manager for hours so that they could fix my phone. Not only that but when i went back to the app they kept sending me photos of Donald trump fighting Joe Biden in a bikini, horrible. After it sent a Spirit after me and now I am haunted. I DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL, ITS A HORRIBLE APP!!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178822915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Art+BookDork","date":"2020-07-10T00:50:06Z","review":"absolutely DISGUSTING \nit took 78 hours to download. then i opened it and starting singing baby shark. then all of a sudden trump came on and said â€˜build the wallâ€™ like excuse me? then it froze my phone for 89 years. \n\nI told them i needed to walk my fish but they told me that it was illegal? like since when? kids these days ðŸ™„ also i tried to call my auntâ€™s grandmaâ€™s cousinâ€™s dog on there but apparently they couldnâ€™t find it like the AUDACITY. would not recommend.","title":"NOT OKAY","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178799993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DontBother Reveiws","date":"2020-07-10T00:41:15Z","review":"I tried to get the app Monday but it would only download if I was right by my WiFi box. It took me forever to figure that out. Then I try to open the app and itâ€™s all black you saw literally nothing I kept trying to get in but I couldnâ€™t. When I finally got into it I was super disappointed so I just deleted it.

Some guy got my phone number from this and asked me if I could buy him flop flip! He told me crazy facts that were inappropriate in all ways!

This is honestly a disgrace to Apple to have this app on its shelves and make it the #1 on News. This app deserves a #1 on the longest download on an Apple application ever. This is disgusting and needs to be taken down immediately. Itâ€™s better off sticking to a website then going on the Apple Store...","title":"The Worst App To Ever Hit The Apple Store","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178495922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Great gameðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘Œ","date":"2020-07-09T22:42:27Z","review":"Even though I strive to support our president everyday, I cannot use this trash app. Though I am sure that Donald Trump has nothing to do with this dumbster fire of a download it is making me question my undying allegiance to the Trump campaign. I did not get notifications for new rallies in my area or anything. This app simply does not work. Hopefully they will try to fix the bugs present in this app and restore my faith to Americaâ€™s savior Donald J. Trump.","title":"What a failure","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
