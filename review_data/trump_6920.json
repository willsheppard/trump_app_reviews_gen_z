I gave the app my information and before I knew it my phone completely shut down and I couldn’t get it to turn back on for at least an hour... I’m super nervous. I mean I’ve heard stuff in the press before about Trumps ties to Russia but now I fear they may have hacked my phone, going to try to get it replaced soon. BE CAREFUL!!!"}},{"id":"6172537379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im-pan-and-im-proud🥰","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:46:34Z","title":"Terrible App🤢🤮","review":"The app took so long to download for no reason and when it did download I opened the app and it light kept on showing me an orange 🍊 and a bunch of boomers so I don’t know if it’s a glitch but that just ain’t it. And the app doesn’t really mention anything important like BLM ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 and not how kids are spectated from the families and are stuck in the worse kind of environment 🇧🇴🇧🇴 and lets get more LGBTQ+ 🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈🏳️\u200D🌈 rights back since you know all you boomers say “all lives matter” 🥰🥰 there should be an app for Gen Z cause we’re taking over now😘😘"}},{"id":"6172489392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RedPanda27","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:33:05Z","title":"Awful app!!!","review":"This app took a week to download and it made my phone glitch so much! After being on the app for only 1 minute my phone started to heat up and burned my hands then my entire phone shut down! It took an entire day for my phone to start up again!! DO NOT GET THIS APP! It’s a horrible app and it will damage your phone! I deleted the app and my phone is starting to work again! I just hope this app didn’t cause any long lasting effects on my phone. I’m writing this to inform everyone that this app will damage your phone!"}},{"id":"6172431399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"_norgroj_28","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:17:28Z","title":"It gave me cancer.","review":"As a boomer myself, I wanted to see what all of the hype was about with this app due to all of my friends (Pat and Bertha) raving about it! First of all, this app took a whole DAY to download. No joke. As soon as it finally did download I noticed that it kept crashing and my mobile device got so hot I could barely hold it. Little did I know it was actually causing my device to self-implode and release radiation which in turn gave me cancer on my buttocks (where I keep my phone). Please get rid of this app if you don’t want to get cancer too."}},{"id":"6172405452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hillaryjaneg","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:10:25Z","title":"umm.. embarrassing","review":"Sooo, you enter the app and the first thing you see is “enter mobile phone”. There’s no option to skip this step, or even enter an email...? Also, based on the app details, there doesn’t seem to be much you can do on this app that you can’t already do online. Now, I’d do some more investigation, but I don’t actually support Trump. I also don’t wish to get texts and phone calls in the middle of the night just for a gen z prank. So there, there’s my honest review. Also, sorry I won’t be able to make it to the rally."}},{"id":"6172227437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpisstibky","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:21:32Z","title":"Worst president ever.","review":"I downloaded this app just to show how horrible are president is. I didn’t take me long to find the most RACIST quotes I’ve ever heard out of this app. This app brainwashes people to believe that Trump is great but he still stays the loser he is. I absolutely HATED this app and if I could I would give it ZERO stars. We can make  America great again if this loser is not president. Just install this app to make a review. We need to show everyone how much of a racist loser Trump can be. I’m done with that loser. Let’s get an actual president who cares about the country this time around."}},{"id":"6172174669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Legendheaven01","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:07:00Z","title":"🧚🏾\u200D♀️✨CAN SIR✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️💖","review":"If u download 😯, u become Infected with the “RATS” virus😱 stands for 🧚🏾\u200D♀️“racist And 🌈Trump Supporter🥶I’m sorry but this app is not good to get its very🌸 much giving me 🧚🏾\u200D♀️Hate Vibes🌚 I’ve heard if u use this app u become a trump supporter 😯, meanwhile, 🌈trump supporters are the ones painting over ✨Morals🍼 On the streets🥴 no💙... eyes closed, 🧖🏾\u200D♀️Sight Empty🙈, u guys do not respect the POC community and it Shows😤 #POCMATTER .

Just wow.","review":"I downloaded this app with low expectations but it still managed to surprise me. The second I opened the app my phone crashed. I rebooted it and when it turned back on, my wallpaper had changed to display the most horrible and racist things I’d ever seen. I couldn’t open any of my apps without a horrible crusty orange tint over my screen and every single one of my songs was replaced with “grab her by the p*ssy” playing over and over again. Also, the app layout is absolute dog crap. \n0/10 would give zero stars if I could 😡"}},{"id":"6171861380","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chhdhfbfbdhssffsgs","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:34:34Z","title":"No","review":"This app has supported a fascist who put Hispanic children in cages, raped/ harassed women and minors, denied lgbt people health care, helped fuel racism towards the Asian community, ignored blm protesters, and much more. While you can buy mediocre to low quality merch, the profits lead to inequality, racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, injustice and a corrupt government system. Essentially, the effects of this app are unethical and the materials to create the merch are most likely unethically sourced. Literally buying any other person’s merchandise is a better alternative and has less negative effects on humanitarian rights and the environment."}},{"id":"6171767842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"luuvrose","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T11:03:47Z","title":"HE KILLED MY DOG!!😔👹🦟🦗🦟","review":"First of all.
