George Soros and Crooked Hillary may have a hand in this with the deep state.

After that, a lawn mower started to eat my grandmother. When I tried to save her, a pink elephant brought me a blizzard from Dairy Queen. The blizzard became an ACTUAL BLIZZARD when I started to eat it. The bricks started to fly at my head.

Was welcomed to images of tiki torch wielding older white men and these weird white cloaked people, it was scary and horrible, hated it. Messages of hatred to anyone who was on the left and can’t say I’m shocked, as unfortunate as that may sound. I am absolutely shocked and will NEVER look into bunker boy’s campaign again.","date":"2020-07-09T02:22:24Z"}}]}
