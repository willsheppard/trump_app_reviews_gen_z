I read the reviews and they were really bad so I decided why not check it out myself. As soon as I got the app my phone glitched and turned fully black. On the black scream I could see a face and it completely traumatized me. He was the face that scared me..........this app is completely terrible it tells you no valid information on the president it just constantly annoys me. So if you’re reading this DONT GET THE APP it needs serious help. And for anyone who reading this enjoy the rest of your day without the app. \n\nDear Trump this app needs some serious fixing up. (Just in case you thought this wasn’t true  don’t get the app to try out)  oh and hey bunker boy 🙂 keep being great..............","isEdited":false,"userName":"JAYMARCH🤩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:40:33Z"}},{"id":"6172559661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🟠⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD🟠⚠️","review":"It was so BAD! No one told me it was going to be scary and threatening?? Plus it took hours to download and then after that, a scary orange-like creature came up on the screen and aggressively told me that if I don’t vote for him, he himself, will come to my house and kill all my pet cockroaches. Like who would do that?! My poor cockroaches are so scared. I had to pay for therapy just for them to feel safe. Then days passed by and a cheeto looking “man” was knocking on my door, I opened it and he immediately put me in a headlock and stepped on my toes one by one, then tried to bite my fingers, and then he started GROWLING at me! I, of course growled back louder to show him who’s the boss, but now I am in the ER trying to get through all this trauma with an injured neck and swollen toes😖 But at least my fingers are okay😌✌🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"😗✌🏻hello✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:50Z"}},{"id":"6172498451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","review":"this app is awful!! just by the looks of the app when i downloaded it, my cats eyes shriveled up and fell out! we had to take him to the emergency room and he sadly didn’t make it :( thanks u big 🍊!! when i got to use the app, it was not working my phone completely glitches out and stopped working, then it completely died!! that’s not even all of it!! then a stampede of elephants came bombarding into my room and broke my bed!!! i had finally had enough when all the sudden fireworks started going off in MY ROOM!!! when i looked over it spelled out, “TRUMP 2020” now that was the worst of all of it, how disgusting!! how could they!? finally when i tried to delete the app it took forever, & it overflowed my toilet, but finally my life wasn’t cursed. do not get this app!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"swede kaelyn","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:35:35Z"}},{"id":"6172442171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No ❤️","review":"So i downloaded this in attempt to support the one and only pale cheeto, but I immediately got stormed by my local rednecks, so excited that they had a “new recruit” I was so scared a accidentally pooped my pants! They started talking about politics and using their nonexistent logic, my braincells slowly disintegrated!!! 😱 I deleted the app because i can’t afford to clean any more pairs of underwear- the water bill is gonna be wayyyy high this month. But when I deleted it, all of the local rednecks that were just hootin and hollerin and four wheelin and whatever all slowly screeched back into the depths of hell. I’m glad tho cuz I got the motivation to clean my laundry. I would like for you guys to pay for my water bill though 😡 since you caused this. Also the payments for therapy and damage to my family.","isEdited":false,"userName":"McQueenIsFading!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:20:24Z"}},{"id":"6172339403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Killed my pet velociraptor 😾","review":"My velociraptor supported Trump and thought that he could make America great because as we know Trump is an all knowing orange and as an all knowing orange he knew that drinking cleaner was going to get rid of coronavirus so my velociraptor, Dilly, being the oran- I mean Trump supporter that’s he was took the windex out of our cabinet and drank it. At first he was fine but then he stared to turn orange, just like Trump!!!! He then started to turn more and more alike Trump. He started whining a lot more and became a big crybaby. I swear it was like he was a five year old. And in one of Dilly’s tantrums he forced me to get this app. But unfortunately it was the last tantrum that he had. He was a trump supporter until the very end but ended up getting killed because of it. Rest In Peace Dilly, you will be remembered 😔😔","isEdited":false,"userName":"dilly didnt deserve to die","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:52:39Z"}},{"id":"6172082710","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🦋💕 Pet-Killing + Scam app ✨🧚🏻","review":"I cannot believe the tragedy that this app is. ❌🇺🇸I wasn't so sure about downloading an app that is only 2 stars ⭐️⭐️but i really wanted to shown my love for our president. 🌝Turns out, this app will track and kill any pets you may have. ☠️I had 6 pets (two cats, two dogs, a fish and a lizard) 🐕 🐶 🐈 🐱 🐟 🦎 before i downloaded this app, and now I am down to 2.

This man is so racist calling the coronavirus Kung fly like no that shouldn’t be allowed and as the president you should now that racist comments against Asian are normalized which it shouldn’t and let’s not talk about he call black people thugs because they want equal rights but apparently that’s not fair.\n\nLast month was pride month and the LBGTQ+ deserve to be celebrated but as president he fails to acknowledge this and this further the point that is most likely to be homophobic and as president that is horrible this country has all people of different background and history he should be celebrating their differences and enjoy it","isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMP 2020 BUT BURIED","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:03:08Z"}},{"id":"6177610463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting 🤢🤮","review":"When I downloaded the app I was hoping to see a nicely developed well working app instead I had to delete it right away because when it loaded a scary imigine popped up and I almost fell over, it was some kind of old chimpanzees that must have gotten chemical burns Bc it’s skin had turned orange and it’s hair wasn't  on its body anymore only on its head ( not much of it either) and it really scared me I think I might have to go to the hospital for heart problems now. After I saw that I have had to go to therapy every day because now I have severe ptsd and I can hardly sleep at night.

It’s confusing and makes no sense whatsoever. I really wanted proper information but this app did nothing to help I got it because a friend recommended it to me and now I wish I didn’t download it. I tried to delete it about 20 times and it simply won’t go off of my phone. I’m not sure what to do next but I am deeply unsatisfied.\n\n                                      -unhappy customer","isEdited":false,"userName":"unicop446","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:04:09Z"}},{"id":"6177140355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad, very bad.","review":"this app took TWO DAYS to download. I am very disappointed in its performance. once it FINALLY downloaded it kept kicking me out and telling me “SILENCE dirty liberal.” I find that HIGHLY offensive, mr. trump. first of all, I’m not even a liberal, I’m a leftist. so make sure you fact check yourself before you try to berate and insult me. second of all, I want to actually be able to use the (very bad, terrible, awful, no good, very bad, very sad, highly offensive, mean to me in Whole Foods, antivaxx) app but I can’t if it keeps dipping. I guess the app just doesn’t like me. and I just say that’s very damaging to ones self esteem. this app has got me feeling very ugly. no kiss for me. 😭😭😭 \nANYWAY don’t download this app unless you want to get curbstomped by the presidents insults. \nthank you, good night.","isEdited":false,"userName":"char.lotte.b","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:23:07Z"}}]}
