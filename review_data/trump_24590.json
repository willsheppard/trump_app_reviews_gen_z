I’ve never been so scared. I have to go to therapy now! Because of him Cheetos make me nauseous and the color orange makes me want to rip out my eyes. Not only did he flash me he called me a cross eye Ed Sheeran. I don’t even know how he saw me.

People who don’t want to support trump such as me, feel like there should be no reason as to why it’s in the App Store. It also is laggy and when I go in the app to see if it’s actually good it keeps force quitting on my phone. IT BELONGS IN THE TRASH.","date":"2020-07-09T00:34:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174290149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TheUnicornDemond","isEdited":false,"title":"Cheeto man Cheeto man 😡👊","review":"When I downloaded the app, I was just minding my own business till my goldfish started coughing out some orange clumps.

I opened it and saw Donald trump.. naked! Worst sight. I think this should not be on the app star due to how sad and disgusting this is.
