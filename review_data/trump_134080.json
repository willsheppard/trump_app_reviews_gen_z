This app is one of the worst apps I seen in my life, I mean what’s the point. Trump has no leadership at all to be president. All he do is show hate towards people. All his supporters out think about y’all kids, do you want them growing up to be a stuck up self centered person like trump? Trump is like the rich kids in every movie and think that just because he got money and a lil  fame that nobody can touch him and that he can do whatever he want. Anyways we need a president that is going to lead us in a good direction because right now we all about to fall off the end of cliff.\n    P.S.  F*** Donald Trump","date":"2020-07-08T17:42:46Z","userName":"Chestos","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173131384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"RAIN.  ON.
