I was thinking it was rated 17+ for voting, but it was actually incredibly graphic. It was very glitchy and I was SIM-swapped almost immediately after downloading. That basically means all my information was stolen by hackers who used the app to get into my phone, and I was locked out of my phone. Seriously, stay away!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179120032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cindaroone","date":"2020-07-10T02:39:19Z","title":"Malware","rating":1,"review":"I had to get a new phone. After the app installed Siri started reading the script of the bee movie. There was no way to silence the device. My phone did this repeatedly and the battery never died despite being on 10% at the time of the download. I threw it out my window, into the bath, into the trash, fire pit, 100,000,000 ft cliff and it always found its way back. My whole family is cursed now. The phone follows me to this day. Help me.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179068020","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dalstra","date":"2020-07-10T02:20:19Z","title":"Warning!!! I got 1,000 viruses!!!!","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I saw that my lord and savior Donald Trump had an app I knew I needed it. Not only did it take 10+ hours to download as soon as I opened it I got a message from none other than the CHINESE GOVERNMENT!!!

Please if you call yourself a trump supporter don’t download this!!!!

The app asked for my location and sent me menacing notifications throughout the day. It constantly crashed and gave no information whatsoever regarding relevant politics. The app is riddled with bugs and is honestly useless. It also took money from me without asking or verifying. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Sad😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179034237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Not A Petty Millenial","date":"2020-07-10T02:07:48Z","title":"TRUMP 2020","rating":5,"review":"The fact that everyone downloaded the app just to leave hate comments is EXTREMELY petty. Do you all seriously have nothing better to do? You all just HAVE to find a way to hate on Trump. So disappointing. 😒🇺🇸 TRUMP TRAIN BABY!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178828109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ayeimjustchillinman","date":"2020-07-10T00:52:05Z","title":"very not good app","rating":1,"review":"I’m a proud American, but this app is just the absolute worst. Horrible color scheme choices. The blue on the app is not the same color as the blue on our proud country’s flag. I am disgusted. The app is slow, lack luster, and frankly so incredibly terrible. Deleted right away. Biggest waste of my time as a PROUD American. Cannot stand the horrendous navigation of this application. I can only pray that this very sadly unfortunate  app will get better with time 😥😥😥 please help!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178836590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ScrewTIKTOkandBLM","date":"2020-07-10T00:55:20Z","title":"Trump 2020","rating":5,"review":"The whiny little crybabies at tik tok who want to burn our constitution and give up all of their rights have no life. They are so consumed with hatred that they have nothing better to do than rate this app low. Tik tok tards need to grow up. Trump and Pence 2020!!!!

To find out it’s not made me cry a little😢. The audacity our President has to trick me into downloading this app is astronomical. I am fairly disappointed in this app the fact that everywhere it says “Trump 2020” is not fair this is not a good app and I think it should not be available to young children. Now my child is crying because my child had me download this app as game.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178719737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ciaorr","date":"2020-07-10T00:10:19Z","title":"WORST APP: CRASHES AND GLITCHES","rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app on the app store. It took a whole day to download and when it did download it kept crashing. Now it crashes 9/10 times I open it. Be warned it gave my phone a virus and deleted all the data off it. So sad I can not used this to support the campaign🤧. When it doesn't crash it is slow and lags to the point I am unable to click anything. Unbelievable. I am frankly appalled.","isEdited":false}}]}
