I was thinking it would include discussions on his political stances. And what more he would do in his second term. Instead all this app had was videos of a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic rip off of Chester the Cheeto talking about how attractive young girls are. Truly disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T01:11:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"Kkaren69","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174403967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My Phone Asked Me Why I Hated It When I Installed This","review":"This is a great app, the very best app, people say all the time they tell this app, App!
