The orange thing has forced many women to have abortions.... but his mother should've aborted him? That’s hypocritical! He also smells very bitter, like old poop, I think Pence forgot to wipe him? Please remove this app, upon opening the app, it told me to get naked THE GOVERNMENT IS SPYING ON ME!! I feel offended and harassed when I go through the app, it told me to sign up. THIS IS COMMUNISM. WHY SHOULD I PROVIDE MY NAME? I AM A TAX PAYING AMERICAN YET I AM BEING FORCED TO PROVIDE MY NAME FOR AN APP OF THE ORANGE THING? This goes to show that the government is looking for us so they can stamp orange stickers on our foreheads. 2 minutes after getting the app, my daughter got corona virus ad turned orange, this is definitely a cursed communist app. DELETE THE APP! DELETE THE APP! DELETE THE APP! DELETE THE APP!"}},{"id":"6179670834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:49:39Z","title":"no😘 it was terrible✨🥺❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bonka😚✨❤️","review":"i was so excited for this app😌 (not rlly🥰) so i downloaded it. but when i did my turtle didn’t want to eat anymore😨. and two days later my cat lost her tail😓. it honestly took me so long to help her find her tail again. and i thought the bad luck was over. but just when i thought everything was ok again my cat lost her ears🤬‼️. i don’t know how that happened but than a week later, my fish drowned😡. i realized that all this happened after i downloaded this app so i decided to delete this. and seconds after deleting this app everything went back to normal😚. if i could give a zero rating i would because this app is terrible✨❤️. it gave me such bad luck. if you’re reading this and want to get this app, don’t😚🧚🏻\u200D♀️. it’s so bad and is also constructed really badly😪💖."}},{"id":"6179670694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:49:36Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"badbiddiebinosaur","review":"So first off, I’m a horrible liberal ❄️, so don’t listen to a word I have to say because any trump supporter knows that ignorance is bliss 💕✨but when I opened the app I nearly had a heart attack! Right in front of me was a horrifying picture of a spray tanned Cheeto with some of that yellow troll hair on top! Once I recovered I found that my entire phone was now slightly orange, and over the course of a few hours it became completely orange. \nEventually I went to delete the app, but it wouldn’t let me! It told me that if I wanted to get rid of the app, I had to yell racial slurs at any minorities I came across. It also sent me notifications telling me to “go back to the kitchen” or calling me a “dishwasher”. \nThis wasn’t anything I haven’t heard before, so it didn’t faze me. Then I learned that TikTok was going to be banned, and since I’ve been brainwashed by the Chinese government running the app, I started having convulsions due to the conflict in my brain between the brainwashing of TikTok and the overpowering app that I am now reviewing. To finish it all, the two apps I had installed in my phone were at war with each other both within my technology and in the deep recesses of my mind.\nThrough all of the Gabbie Hanna songs and alm rants, I managed to delete the app. However, I still feel the after affects and my family has suffered from the hatred of the LGBTQ+ community that is now implanted in my skull.\nOverall, -♾/10.\nNot a vibe.\nUsing this app feels like putting on wet socks.\nAnyways, ✨🧚💖Charli D’Amelio 2020💓🧚✨"}},{"id":"6179670543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:49:32Z","title":"pretend this is the shrek script bc it doesn’t fit","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Bob Ross x Ariana Grande","review":"."}}]}
