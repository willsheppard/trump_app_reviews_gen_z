I had to go to the store, and because my phone wasn’t working I couldn’t film the store employees violating my rights by not allowing me to enter without a mask. So I had to wear one of the awful face coverings that the store provided, which gave me extreme breathing problems because I was only breathing in CO2! I got home and saw that my phone was still shut down so I couldn’t call 911 and I had to wait a whole 11 minutes for my beer bellied husband to get home! I would like to speak to the manager of this app, NOW 😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:48:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kitten101$$$$"}},{"id":"6173901388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i’m stuck","review":"so i downloaded this app to see the next trump rally right.... my phone FLEW across the room and BONK my momma in da head. she got this big o bump so i took her to the hospital. the nurses passed us a blunt and we waited for a while. i went out to go get some food from Burger King but the Big Mac they gave me had mold on it so i threw it- but i hit a pedestrian. this lady got knocked the f out. ian know what to do but some birds came and picked her up. all good now. i went back to my mom but then i saw some shoes on sale. i went to the store w the shoes and picked up some flip flops. exiting the store my car got swooped by the birds who swooped the lady i knocked out. i’m still here at the store w the flip flops. it’s been 4 days. f the trump app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:11:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"saweetie"}},{"id":"6173838928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nope, don’t do this to yourself","review":"Please refrain from downloading this as it really isn’t helping the greater good of America as you think. Some of you should wear masks more often to protect others instead of thinking only for yourselves. Also, masks don’t make you breathe your own carbon dioxide. Those molecules, as well as oxygen, are a lot smaller and are able to pass through the mask no problem. Back to the app though, it’s not what I was expecting and honestly don’t know why I downloaded it in the first place. Also don’t go to big events because you’ll either make someone sick or get sick yourself.

I was just chilling on my phone when I got a random notification saying that if I don’t delete the app there gonna send someone to kill me and my family I didn’t think anything of it and brushed it off as a prank. But then a couple months later I’m the middle of the night I heard rustling outside my window and I saw a super tall man, I’m glad he didn’t notice me. But anywho I got another notification saying I had one more chance to delete the app and I decided to because I didn’t wanna see the creepy man again.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:08:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"wowits._meee"}},{"id":"6173600957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!","review":"I have got to say I have come across many stupid apps before but this one has got to be the absolute worse app I have ever downloaded in my LIFE!! It took days to download, and not only that but this app is not a trusted site/app at all. It gives out false news and you’d be better just doing research on your own. ON TOP OF THAT... every single time I open the app it glitches me back to my home screen. Even when it doesn’t glitch me back to my home screen, the app will continue to have tiny glitches whether your scrolling on your feed etc. please I do not recommend this app what so ever. It’s very manipulative and deceiving. Please Apple delete this app, thank you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kcherry🍒"}},{"id":"6173472207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app is disgusting !!!","review":"I’m not saying I don’t support the bedders. I have a lot of straight friends. All I’m saying is it’s disgusting that they are so apparent in the media. It’s like they are shoving bibles down my kids throats. I get it youre straight and that’s fine it just goes against my religion and I don’t want to see it 👁👄👁 I’m not saying i’m hetereophobic i’m just saying that god zendaya said that marriage should be between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. 😤 This app is brainwashing our children into thinking it’s ever okay to be a white cismale and I don’t want to live in a world where my children are being taught this 😤😤 thank you pls NEVER download this app unless you want your children to turn out HETEREO 🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:36:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lia9898"}},{"id":"6173581129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!","review":"This is by far the WORST app ever and trust me I’ve had an iPod when I was 12 and that thing was FULL with apps. I could not believe my eyes when the very first thing to pop up on my phone was a request to donate money! At least I could get a thank you from mr bunker for downloading the worst possible app! And not to mention it took a whole TWO weeks to download this app and it took up the rest of my space! Unbelievable! This is so unacceptable and believe me Donald you have lost my vote over this!!! OUTRAGEOUS","rating":4,"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"TFJGGP"}},{"id":"6173469024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡🥵","review":"honestly, i thought this app would be terrible, but honestly it was worse than i expected!!! i was going on to support our racist, homophobic president, Donald J. Trump 🤢🍊. i thot the cheetoh puff deserved to be looked at n not voted for!! n i wanted to bash everyone on the app for loving him 😍. anyways, the downloading process on this app was HORRIBLE. but when it finally opened, i heard strange and TERRIBLE noises coming from my sister’s bedroom. i ran to her room to find her GONE and an AMERICAN FLAG W CHEETO PUFF ALL OVER THE FLOOR. i knew what happened. our racist orange, that we all know and hate, took my sister. pls help get her back. idk what he’ll do to her. \n\nand this is why i’m giving this app a 1 star rating. i hope the news suckie my duckie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"mmmmmm bears"}},{"id":"6173440817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"This app is very glitchy and it didn't want to download at ALL. It took a whole week before it could completely download, no matter that it is STILL glitching and kicking me out of the app every single second! If I were you I would not take a second glance at this app because it isn't even useful. I was bored all week before the app actually downloaded and I had nothing to do except to wait. I am doing this for the people's own good and putting this review out there so more people won't go through what I went through with this app. I hope this helped to those wanting to know how the app would work if you did download it. Have a great evening.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:25:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KarEn JoeE"}},{"id":"6173222205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it’s a vERY VERY BAD APP😡","review":"i was trying to download the app and then a bear came knocking at my door🐻.. the bear almost killed me then i wanted to see what the app looked like so i opened it and then a bunch of bees came in from my window😤!! i was soooo terrified . i just thought to myself why is the app treating me so baddd then i went to my phone to delete it and then ALL I SAW WAS A BIG BRIGHT ORANGE CHEETO FACE 🤬🤬🤬🤬.. and the face just kept saying “i’m trump and i’m stupid” over and over . i decided to get some fresh air then all of a sudden i see a blonde wig just walking behind me and trump was chasing after it yelling “AHHH MY WEAVE MY WEAVE IM GONNA GET UGLIER IF I DONT HAVE IT ON AHHHHH” so i snatched the wig and burned it and trump hid in a corner and cried so i lived a happy life after that 🥰.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:11:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"megglovew"}}]}
