Decided to give it to him tho bc what do I have to lose? The government already has all of our info anyway. But he just kept asking for more info??? First and last name, zip code, and email????? EXTREMELY sus. Had to stop him right there bc if he is so obsessed with me now there’s no telling what the future holds.

I tried talking to the developer but he couldn’t say anything more than “trump 2020” and “all lives matter”.

About a week ago, I ran into the FLUTOS, melania, at my local ROSS Dress-for-Less®. As i was talking to the person at the ka-ching! station, melania barged infront of me and said “hELLO?” the. she told me if i didn’t download the wrinkled orange peel’s app, someone would make me. i’d give her a solid 7/10 for that, vague, little overused, the mystery part was kinda a turn on tho ngl. 3 days later, i was woken up at 6:72am to my bedroom door being flung open and now standing over me, dripping with sweat, was none other than Big-Daddy Mike Pence. He told me to download the app and i called him a hetero✨then he told me that unless i downloaded his master’s app, id have to go to convert Cam??? whoever she is. tbh i couldn’t hear well due to the sound of Daddy Pence’s dry-heaving from running up the stairs too fastly. As he stood in the corner of my room, heaving into my cat-shaped clothes hamper, i ran up behind him and corn-dogged him. Although he screamed like a cat giving birth, i saw the twinkle in his eyes. i KNOW he liked it. Then he passed out, what a snowflake. I didn’t have any ropes so i knotted together a bunch of tampons to use to tie him up so he couldn’t hurt me. \n\nOnce he came too, i already had him strapped down with my tampon ropes. Turns out it was just the amount of time for his polyjuice potion to wear off. I’d say i was shocked, but honestly i wasn’t, all made sense looking back. MANS PULLED A PETER PETIGREW. saw him turn into a rat right before my eyes and scamper out of the room. He must have either lost some brain cells in the transformation, already had a bain-cell deficit, or maybe its maybelline, who knows at this point, but about an hour later i found this mf foaming at the mouth next to an empty bottle of hydroxychloroquine pills. I used the return labels off of my amazon box for my hemorrhoid pillow and shipped the foamy rat carcass back to the whitehouse. \n\nMy names Brenda Song,\n *man voice* and this has been, \nATTI (on disney channel)🥰🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💞💫","rating":1,"title":"ATTI DOWNLOADED TRUMPS APP"}},{"id":"6175635031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:59:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"owo poop","review":"This app took me 11 weeks for it to load and a download and inappropriately asked for personal information.This app has many glitches and made my screen freeze for 2 hours!

Who doesn’t love some casual sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia and SO MUCH MORE! Oh how could I forget pedophilia?😳 the list just seems to be getting bigger and bigger! Who wouldn’t be amused watching a Cheeto-shrimp hybrid speak his micro-mind ? He truly is a scientific miracle if I say so myself?

I read reviews and figured they were all snowflake trolls so I didn’t believe them. The download was really fast, but it all went downhill from there. When I first opened the app there was a white screen that I couldn’t get out of. I had to restart my phone and when it turned on, the touch function was lagging. I tried to open the app again and this time everything started flashing! I had to restart my phone again. When it turned on, ALL of my downloaded apps were gone. ALL the photos were gone. ALL of my contacts were gone. \nI took my iPhone into Apple to get it looked at but the Genius said All Phones Matter and I was being selfish for trying to get my problem fixed when there are plenty of Android phones out there working just fine. How ridiculous does that sound?!","rating":1,"title":"App gave me a virus?"}}]}
