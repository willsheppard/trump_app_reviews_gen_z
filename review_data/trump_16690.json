It took 1738 days to download and has many bugs within itself. My phone crashes about 10 times a day whenever I try to open the app. My information was leaked and I keep getting random calls from dangerous people. The atrocities of this app must be prohibited. No one should have to suffer like me 🥺.","title":"DO US A FAVOR AND TAKE THIS DOWN","date":"2020-07-10T00:20:32Z","userName":"ChannaBiBi100","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178717905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so happy to see this app because I want to be always up to date on all things tRump2020 but I’m so disappointed. Not only did this take like an hour to download but it is not at all easy to navigate. The pics are all pixelated and everything says “made in China”? I don’t understand. I do not recommend.","title":"I really thought it would be great","date":"2020-07-10T00:09:35Z","userName":"Janee's in Wonderland.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178665088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app when our cult leader first got into office. let me just say this app is absolute trash. all the information provided is a load of crap and it gives me the chills every time i open it. i think this app is haunted. trump has all this money but can’t put out a decent app for his fellow Americans. what a shame. i demand i new president and a new app. next caller next caller","title":"WORST APP ON THE MARKET","date":"2020-07-09T23:49:06Z","userName":"hdjdkwkksrandkm","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178647946","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For one, this app has an awful interface. Two, I could barely jack off to trumps face because it was so small. Three, after showing my brother the app he had a seizure! And we can’t pay for the medical bills because we hate ObamaCare more than we like our lives! Lastly, there was a huge lack of emojis but that’s an easy fix.","title":"🌱✨🧚 awful 🌸✨🍃","date":"2020-07-09T23:42:24Z","userName":"Ashely Shelby Smith","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178639562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ok so first things first when I first download this it gave my phone a virus😭!!!

It was disgustingly designed and carried out in a bad way. It took way too long to download and it always crashes. Also there is so much wrong information on there that I think it’s being run by some other company. There are far better places to get really bad political ideas/ information🤮🤮","title":"REALLY bad app","date":"2020-07-09T23:19:32Z","userName":"🤢🤮XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178587225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took 7 hours to download and as soon as it said done I blacked out and woke up 2 weeks later addicted to meth, missing my two front teeth and working the pole at a strip club in Des Moines .  When I looked into the audience it was Mitch McConnell, Matt goetz and Jared kushner.  I ran through the kitchen of the club, grabbed a tater tot and am now in an alleyway surrounded by needles writing this.  Please stay away from this app!!","title":"My life is ruined","date":"2020-07-09T23:18:33Z","userName":"no teeth shirley😰😰","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6178584729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First.
