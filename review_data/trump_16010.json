Then he held me captive while forcing me to sing the duck song on a loop for ten hours! I was finally able to escape when he fell asleep and i punched him back into the app but as a result i had to throw away my whole phone. Anyways, Niall Horan for president 2020.","userName":"annalee lewis","date":"2020-07-08T21:57:01Z","title":"terrible awful despicable app"}},{"id":"6173838714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Soooo this app charged me 1000 dollars just for it to glitch and for me to see an orange face. But it took weeks to download. When I got on the app I just wanted to see our peachy president. But all I saw was white supremacy. 👁👄👁. Then I saw cockroaches that we’re summoned from the app. They ate my vegan food and then the rats ate my dog. I’m scarred for life. 0-10 I would give a zero, wast of my life. I need mental help for the rest of my existence. Anyway #killtrump2020.","userName":"dont get rid of tictoc","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:06Z","title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6173819745","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app, I was excited to look at the great updates and support trump. But when I decided to go on to Twitter, it wouldn’t let me exit!! I tried multiple strategies such as pressing the home button three times, closing and opening my phone, NOTHING WORKED!!

Every time I open the app it starts glitching and then kicks me out. At one point I actually made it into the app but then a terrible high pitched screeching sound started playing and it made my ears bleed.
