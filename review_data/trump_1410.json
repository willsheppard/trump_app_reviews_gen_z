Absolutely disgusted!! Never download this app EVER!😡 I woke up the next day and I saw cockroaches EVERYWHERE they all had Donald’s face on them. Then my dog starts walking on his hind legs wearing a tuxedo and shaking his bum bum and screaming “MARTHA WAS AN AVERAGE DOG 🐕 SHE WENT RUFF AND RUFF AND GRRR😏” then my pet snake 🐍 starts singing “foreigner foreigner” over over I’m scared for my life 👁👄👁 I was never expecting the viruses to not only happen inside the app but transfer into my life😓 if you download this app I suggest you delete it before pigs🐷 enter your home and make you build a windmill and kick you out your house and blame you for breaking it and turn your family against you😨 CHEETO MAN IF YOU ARE READING THIS WE ARE COMING FOR YOU!!!!!🍊🧀 never knew annoying orange could run for president and create an app that destroyed your life. 😖"}},{"id":"6173326918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Gave my gma a heart attack and killed my cat:(","userName":"hopefuly soon to be grad","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:46:10Z","review":"I downloaded this app on my grandmas iPad because she loves our Cheeto puff president🇺🇸🇺🇸. This app took days to download, and when I finally got it open it glitched a bit but I finally got it open and then I left her house so she could enjoy her app. Turns out, the app randomly started playing loud music and flashing trumps face in the middle of the night, this scared my grandma of course so when she saw it she had a heart attack:((( she is alive but my pregnant cat didn’t make it, when she had the heart attack she fell and landed on my pregnant cat:(( she also broke her hip and now can’t walk and couldn’t enjoy 4th of July. This app made 2020 even worse and my grandma didn’t deserve that at all, she was just trying to be a proud white conservative. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT PLEASE. It’s horrible and has caused death:( the cat was the reincarnation of my late great grandmother and it broke my grandmas heart."}},{"id":"6173322967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"It glitches and birds attack you","userName":"Amber200209","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:44:50Z","review":"This app takes FOREVER to load and it doesn’t allow you to leave the app without shutting down your phone. The only fix was to give your social security number and home address. A lot of people I know had this similar problem. When I was trying to get it to load I accidentally clicked the button where it sends government bird spies to your house and I thought it was a joke from our very very comedic president but when I looked up at my windows there were pigeons everywhere staring at me. I tried to scare them off but they swarmed my head when I went outside. They won’t go away because the option to send them off means I have to give my private information to a very Russian sounding organization. I mean it’s not like trump has anything to do with Russia so I’ll do it anyways. But these birds and the glitching is out of hand."}},{"id":"6173242559","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bunker boi","userName":"Stupid princess","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:18:45Z","review":"As a 18 year old newly registered voter, I downloaded the app in hopes of getting to know our dear mr president because who wouldn’t want to know more about trump? Well after putting in my phone number, it took so long for me to be able to see any actual information. When I was able to see information, all it was asking for was money. After doing my research on our dear president, I came to realize that bunker boi has terrible morals and doesn’t actually care for all the citizens of the United States. Anyone who would believes otherwise is and will always be incorrect, but I mean what would a gen z kid know? Because obviously the only people who are allowed to have valid opinions are boomers or trump supporters. All I’m going to say is if all of gen z is against someone at least half of them did the research, and mr trump can’t handle that a whole generation knows what they’re talking about."}},{"id":"6172689420","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"suck_on_this.this_app_is_bomb.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:29:07Z","review":"This app is the worst app ever!!! People from this app were calling me at 3:00 am every single night I got no sleep!the app was so glitchy and laggy!!! Also at random moments it would show me scenes from a horror movie with a big ugly orange monster that killed African Americans and Mexican people!!!! This app keeps sending me packages food with trumps face on it I think there oranges but the two just look so similar I can’t tell the difference. now whenever I fall asleep I can’t stop thinking about how this app almost got me killed because it told me to say whengardiam leviosa then I got swirled into a tornado and landed in a weird place with tiny dwarves holding knives chasing me around then a talking lion ate me and pooped me out it smelled disgusting\n when I finally called the police they said they had to finish killing all the African American people, typical. then I fell into a river and the peranas ate me alive and I drowned. Now I’m in heaven❤️."}},{"id":"6172630289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏾🙈🙈🧚🏾✨✨👄🐵🙈🧚🏾🧚🏾\u200D♂️✨✨","userName":"Avaih","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:12:25Z","review":"How are you still in the white and just KNOW that GEN Z is coming to get Barron and your wife because she looks like she don’t like you and how did you make Barron with your Cheeto like thing down there it🧚🏾🧚🏾🧚🏾🧚🏾 and just know that id you take down TIKTOC us KIDS not adults us KIDS will find you and make you eat tide pods just like we did and you saying that your going to make American great again the why are you tell people to leave if they don’t like it here if us color people leave this place and just have all Karen’s and \nwhite people what are y’all going to come and kidnap us again and just know that you messed WITH THE WRONG GENERATION because we will hurt your feelings again if you even thought about taking TIKTOC from us and go outside and walk  I think not trump.

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding\uFEFF 😌✨✨✨✨✨✨ just remember to not download this app because it CAN give you a virus I’ve researched this virus and it’s called “make America great again”. Personally I think that this is an absurd name because a campaign slogan was named after this virus✨✨✨. Make sure you use a vpn so Tik tok wont be taken down🥺🥺🥳🤪🤪🥳"}},{"id":"6177595140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"App kept crashing","userName":"Kiersten Fowley","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:37:14Z","review":"I was so excited to get this app because I am a trump supporter myself, Trump 2020 but as soon as I got in the app i saw the screen for a split second and then i saw my home screen. I just thought it was because i had too many apps opened up so i decided to close them all and retry but the same thing happened. I then turned my phone off and on and it kept happening. I read the reviews and it seemed like this has happened to other people before. I saw one about how it kept crashing other apps aswell but mine didn’t do that yet but then before you know it all my apps are crashing. Knowing this has happened before to others after downloading the app kind of shows that it’s the app’s fault nothing wrong with the phone. So would i recommend getting this app. NO NO NO NO NO but I still support Trump. Trump 2020 Make America Great Again!"}},{"id":"6176678911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP WILL BREAK YOUR PHONE","userName":"cassmaria","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:19:56Z","review":"This app is absolutely horrible it keeps crashing and deleted a bunch of my apps. It sends me a million notifications a day and has deleted my entire gallery. I truly am disappointed. I downloaded the app to do political research but what this app has done to my phone makes me incredibly upset. I cannot fathom having to deal with this again. Also after I put in my phone number I got a call saying they were after me and it ended with a playing of the National Anthem. I have no choice but to believe that this the Trump Administration. I am very disappointed and believe along with many others that this app has ruined my life. I really do not recommend this app and believe it should be taken down. I also have been hacked 666 times since this app has been downloaded. It just makes me wonder anyway, this is a horrible app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT."}},{"id":"6176302487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"horrible!🤢😡😠👺👿💩","userName":"Aaaaaaaaaaaaššsß","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:36:30Z","review":"i tried download this app four weeks ago and it just finally downloaded now! when i opened the app i got a notification from my bank that all my money had been withdrawn just then so i closed the app to fix that, then when i opened it again i got a text from my wife saying she found someone better! so i closed the app! it’s so bad even the voices in my head have left me! now i’m all alone sitting in my room, staring at this icon. will i be safe if i delete it! i don’t know.. but when it comes to the content of the app i was even more mad! turns out it’s an app for trump to get tips on spray tanning. i tried asking him to just keep his skit natural and he said ‘oranges come from nature’. *sigh* maybe he should try be a banana next. or a pomegranate. or an apple. idk but i’ll brain storm. in conclusion, unless you want your life to fall apart DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!1!!"}}]}
