Like it opens up with this revolting image of a round the orange man who somewhat resembles what I image the child of a walrus and a cheeto would look like. I honestly could not get past this image and had to be instantly uninstall the app. The image still haunts me at night...","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Its really aesthetically unappealing"}},{"id":"6174578397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hiii🦋","date":"2020-07-09T02:02:05Z","review":"thank you for creating this app💗please delete it though✨🤩🧚\nyou dropped this 🔴 put it back in your nose 🤡 ✨🥰\nyou tried hun ✨🧚✨ never again though 🥳💗✨\nI love that you tried😍💗 now try giving up 😌🧚\n🧚🤍words cant describe how well you’ve done as a president 🥳✌️✨ but numbers can 0/10","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"EWWW"}},{"id":"6174575330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeet","date":"2020-07-09T02:01:12Z","review":"I got this app to see more on what president trump is doing for our country just for my phone to automatically start crashing once downloaded it would randomly start making terrible noises and start glitching just overall not worth it.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horible app"}},{"id":"6174562903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"idksooookyay","date":"2020-07-09T01:57:39Z","review":"When  I open the app it was just ewwww.....why do you need more reasons also just why download this then I got out of a app to check to see if it download it ask if it could send me a notification just more Gross also  Gen z for the win!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Just no you Racist who likes him"}},{"id":"6174558724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"babyyoda216","date":"2020-07-09T01:56:25Z","review":"this app is hot garbage. theres multiple pictures of a decomposing pumpkin wearing a red cap like for what reason?? it’s truthfully an embarrassment with all the photos of a cheeto man. this app and the man it’s made for is a disgrace. literally wish I could give it 0 stars.
