Honestly, no one cares why you needed two hands to drink a cup of water, or why you were slipping down a ramp in dress shoes because in the end we know you are a sexist, racist, white supremacists and probably every other bad title ending in -ist and America Deserves better than you."}},{"id":"6173079105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:26:02Z","title":"My dog 🐶 bit slime balls ⚽️ because of it","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"***no-name***","review":"This app was the 🍊 worst 😣 thing EVER!!!
