I finally got it to open by shutting down all the other apps. There is a bug if you have any other app open, this thing crashes your whole phone. Once I finally opened it and i gave it my info, my phone has been blowing up with spam. I think they sold my info or something because all kinds of spam callers are calling and emailing me. And I tried to unsubscribe and that didn’t work either, I just kept getting more spam, even from random porn sites just hacking into my phone and my computer and even my email got hacked. I think my identity may have gotten stolen too because a day after I got this app, my bank froze my bank account because of suspicious activity on my account. Apparently there were charges made on my credit card from Mexico and I live in South Carolina. And never even been to Mexico. Apparently the wall we built doesn’t stop identity theft.","rating":1,"userName":"TheOldGuyInStars","title":"The worse app ever!"}},{"id":"6179331777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:54:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I really dislike this app and I am very disappointed I love you trump I am a true supporter I believe in ALL!!!
