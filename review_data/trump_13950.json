It makes me sad to see how gullible our country has become. This man does not tell you the truth, he lies through his teeth to get what he wants. Maybe try fact checking him every once in awhile instead of following him like a cult. Start thinking and searching for information for yourself already. If you can only find it on Fox and Trump’s Twitter ITS PROBABLY NOT TRUE.","date":"2020-07-08T15:34:20Z","title":"Terrible","userName":"Sabrina2004😁","rating":1}},{"id":"6172677540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I was considering this app to find that perhaps I could find something wholesome in our president. BUT THEREFORE I DID NOT I LEFT UNSATISFIED. It is ridiculous how people are able to open this app without their eyes being burned my goodness I couldn’t!!! My trip to the ER was embarrassing since I had to tell them a pathetic person sent me here just a disgrace!!! Please don’t get this app if you are searching for happiness and a change because it’s not gonna happen.","date":"2020-07-08T15:25:46Z","title":"THIS APP IS HORRIFIC","userName":"scarlettt :)","rating":1}},{"id":"6172669241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I’ll make this plain and simple.

It’s actually trash nothing loads and the software is basically unusable. It is uncomfortable and is anything but user friendly. The organization isn’t intuitive at all and I find it hard to understand the point of most of the app’s features. Very disappointed. Black lives matter.","date":"2020-07-08T15:18:04Z","title":"I wish I could leave less than one star","userName":"alas poor yorik","rating":1}},{"id":"6172604596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app kept saying it was the best app, the app with the best performance but it never performed that way. It also actively degraded my other apps. When I wanted numbers/facts, it actively lied and made up numbers or only gave part of the story to mislead me. Then finally when I decided enough was enough and I told the app it was wrong and I was going to remove it, it threatened violence and incited hate speech from others.","date":"2020-07-08T15:05:13Z","title":"Worse than expected","userName":"smonts28","rating":1}},{"id":"6172576202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as I got the app my phone immediately starting turning on and off in a loop that made my phone unusable. I had to waste 500 to get a new phone because i didn't have enough money to get the same phone that i had before. When i opened the app after waiting weeks for it to download it was a blank screen of nothingness and it stole my credit car info to buy 100 trump 2020 posters.","date":"2020-07-08T14:57:26Z","title":"Scam; HORRIBLE APP","userName":"ChirstmasLOL","rating":1}},{"id":"6172484106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate this app so much that people forgot what our president thinks of the rest of the world and It’s sickening that people will download this app just because they support the biggest jerk in the U.S country. The trump supporters are either blind to see that our president is a huge jerk and or they want to be recognized as a trump supporter, supporting him, which he doesn’t need or deserve whatsoever due to the things he has done our country as a community.","date":"2020-07-08T14:31:38Z","title":"What a wasteful app!","userName":"just call me mic","rating":1}},{"id":"6172427637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app was okay at first I guess but going on the most recent update made my phone glitch out really bad to the point where I had to delete the app. I also didn’t find this app informative at all. then again this app isn’t even worth it because you need to enter your phone number and everything in order to get in the app. This isn’t really necessary but I don’t like the app cover.","date":"2020-07-08T14:16:28Z","title":"Yikes","userName":"jamilla G","rating":1}},{"id":"6172377242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to show support for our  dear old president Donald Trump ofc😀but let me tellll youuu.
