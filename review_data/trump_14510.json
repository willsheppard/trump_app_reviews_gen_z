I’m from Texas and I really wanted to see how this app worked. It just kept crashing and crashing over and over again and I just couldn’t get it to work. I think it could’ve shared my number to other people who have downloaded the app too. I keep getting random messages for like 5 different numbers. Don’t download this app.","title":"Ugh","isEdited":false,"userName":"jebsuebxkbe x","rating":1}},{"id":"6177384008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:32:48Z","review":"Okay so I downloaded this app because my friends who support trump told me to and I complied so I got the app. Now my phone has a lot of storage but this, this app took up like 10 gigabytes of storage which is not! okay!! The app itself is very slow due to the high storage it takes up and it keeps crashing no matter what I do. It’s a horrible app and I recommend not getting it.","title":"Too much storage","isEdited":false,"userName":"unrealistic_cosplays","rating":1}},{"id":"6177382959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:32:29Z","review":"wowie i was so pumped to download this app to support our ✨flawless✨ president. however, when i was happily using this app, my hair started falling out. like CHUNKS. and then my eyebrow hair and eye lashes started to fall out too. oh also now all of my finger nails and toe nails are gone. my family disowned me because of it. now i’m not saying this is a coincidence... but,,,,,,,,,,,,\ndo not download this app unless you wanna be bald and fingernail-less ❌😫","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! ruined my life","isEdited":false,"userName":"meredith_h123","rating":1}},{"id":"6177350424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:22:53Z","review":"After taking a little less than 8 minutes to load, the app would start up, load a bit, then crash. After restarting my phone, redownloading it, and making sure everything was up to date, it still didn’t work.

First off... No Adam driver? How are you trying to successfully run a political campaign without the internet’s king? Yeah alright, good luck. Next, awful awful virus..oh not the app and also not specifically corona, but the rampant misogyny, racism, and sexism that has been allowed to thrive under such political conditions.

What on God’s green earth is this app doing to my phone while I use it??\n\nA trash attempt at data mining at best, a sinister plot to collect data at worst, of you ask me.","title":"Who designed this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"One_Black_Balloon","rating":1}},{"id":"6177275040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:01:38Z","review":"It takes up so much storage and on top of that the app is awful. It kept crashing making not only this app crash but every app on my phone. I have a new phone so I know it’s not that and I am only on sites I trust. It’s sad I can’t even trust the presidents app. Also why is there age restricted material... What is he uploading on here that someone under age can’t see? The whole thing is sketchy.","title":"Awful, DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"javievdjsjjsjawjqj","rating":1}},{"id":"6177268177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:59:40Z","review":"This app ruined my life! I was fine before I got this app, no history of mental illness, heart issues, nothing. But as soon as I opened the app I saw this ugly a*s Oompa Loompa Cheeto puff boy. The incident was so terrifying that it caused me to have a heart attack. I was rushed to the hospital and revived but afterwards I was still traumatized. I went to therapy and was diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses. To this day I have flashbacks to the time I saw the obese orange baby holding that disgusting flag.","title":"Traumatizing","isEdited":false,"userName":"illeatyourgrandmother","rating":1}},{"id":"6177156660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:27:38Z","review":"this app is horrible as soon i opened the app i saw a big fat ugly orange and after that my life went down hill one day i was vacuuming my grass and out of no where all these oranges started falling of the sky and one of them hit me in the head and so i looked at all of the oranges and they where all Donald trumps nudes on them and that was only one day of having the app this app is HORRIBLE i would give a -0 stars don’t gettttt itttt","title":"I HATE THIS APP 🖕😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ruthieee.T","rating":1}}]}
