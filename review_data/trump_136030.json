I looked at all the news and the important events and I didn‚Äôt see any mention of the world being made great again! I didn‚Äôt see anything about flying cars, hoverboards, invisible phones, nothing! They could have at LEAST talked about the possibility, instead they were talking about the most stupid things. This app is the absolute worst thing ai have ever come in contact with. Also what‚Äôs up with them needing my number? Now people have to get notifications even if they don‚Äôt want them, absolute anarchy. I will be asking for compensation for wasting my time.","title":"Not what was promised","userName":"sad bo1","date":"2020-07-10T10:59:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6180555235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so confusing.
