As soon as I opened to app there was a warning that if I’m not white, Cheeto will have me removed from the U.S. I didn’t think he would actually know what race I am so I just continued. But sure enough, about five minutes later Cheeto came to my house and took everything from me:( I’m now in Mexico typing on my Abuelita’s microwave and Cheeto is forcing me and my family to build the wall tomorrow. If u are not white I do not recommend this app."}},{"id":"6174810235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:10:20Z","rating":1,"title":"Stream turn back time by wayv <3","userName":"Nightmare_Chica5","review":"光芒不转弯\n直线不进则退 退\n理所不当然\n梦想无翼而飞 (起飞)\n筑城一个世界\n天选之人 No no\n觉醒在无色间迈向进阶\n下一个挑战向着时间行军\n请辩论未知的命运定或未定\n\n倒回迟疑一秒\n倒回后悔一秒\n倒回松懈一秒\nLimit limit\n超越野心一秒\n超越坚持一秒\n超越极限一秒\nGet it get it uh\n\n地无疆 天无界\nIf we could turn back time\n再启程 再回转\n旅途名为超时空 回\n\nOh 重启自我\nMinute by minute\n往未来的路覆辙不再\nOh 无色觉醒过来\nTurning back time 5432\nStop rewind turn back time\nStop rewind turn back time 5432\nStop rewind turn back time (Stop yea got that stop)\nStop rewind turn back time\n\n回顾那些错过 (无数错过)\n在手中留下未熄的花火\n那些循环因果 (循环因果)\n能让懵懂改写为成熟\nYeah I’m a beast\nDon’t sweat it\n我会击败时间\nGo get it\n要继续继续超频揭开秘密\n时间的面目若拆穿\nI see the face of vision\n\n黎明等在更宽阔的舞台\n我反省完我渺小就前来\nLive it up double dose\n更多的色彩\n我说 No\n让我回到无色的我再重头\n从过去重新创造\n我将再出发觉醒后\n\n地无疆 天无界\nIf we could turn back time\n再启程 再回转\n旅途名为超时空 回\n\nOh 重启自我\nMinute by minute\n往未来的路覆辙不再\nOh 无色觉醒过来\nTurning back time\n\n就像万花筒般诱惑存在\n我们盘旋在浑沌地带\n请直观无色声香味触法的虚幻\nThe time is ticking away\n\nOh 重启自我\nMinute by minute\n往未来的路覆辙不再\nOh 无色觉醒过来\nTurning back time\n\nOh 改写历史\nMinute by minute (If we could turn back time)\n从过往的我通往未来\nOh 无色觉醒过来\nTurning back time\n\n5432\n5432\nStop rewind turn back time\nStop rewind"}},{"id":"6174752911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:53:00Z","rating":1,"title":"i’d say a big no❤️","userName":"ubret","review":"absolutely TRASH! terrible setup, terrible, background and ugly as HELL.

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding\uFEFF"}},{"id":"6174629746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:16:34Z","rating":1,"title":"Not good my eyes burn","userName":"Mindshock","review":"Once I downloaded the app I immediately started getting super unlucky I ordered crab from a homeless person and now I can’t stop itching like I think my refrigerator went down to Wendy’s and rolled off my bed and said which one should I choose Suicide or to kill my self but then he realized that it hurt so he stopped eating his arm and then Karen took my phone and now I’m chilling with the homeless guy so we started gambling with ketchup and the Cheeto guy ate my wallet so I went to my dad and he told me to get a job and he would buy me a touch screen microwave so who needs this app it’s terrible"}},{"id":"6174615540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:12:34Z","rating":1,"title":"Terrible 👎😿","userName":"Lillian1139","review":"like all other conservatives 🤡 i blindly follow this cheeto 😘 and i opened this app to support bunker boy 👦 and boom 💥 he popped up out of no where ✨ i tried to tell him to get out of my bathroom 🚽 but he wouldn’t leave 😡 he told me he had to borrow a diaper 😫 i told the cheeto of course, anything for our baby 🍼 leader 🥰 after that ⏰ he went to my living room 😳 and kicked my baby brother! 🤬 i told him that was very rude of him ☹️ he said he didn’t care! 😫 my poor baby brother now has scoliosis 😠 president dumbo hadn’t lost a vote though 👊🏻 i’ll be voting on november 4th 🇱🇷 like all the other conservatives 😌"}},{"id":"6174592230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:00Z","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP GETS YOU BLIND ❤️","userName":"very good transitions","review":"My grandfather was using this app to watch porn, and then he saw that he had to vote for Donald Trump. he was devastated and he got really mad and then he poke him self with a pencil and because of that my mom‘s friends cousin’s grandfathers aunts cousin mother uncle Sister decided to poke him in the eye because he saw trumps ugly face.
