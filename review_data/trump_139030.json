The T on the cover fat shamed my grandma and sentenced her to the death penalty for life. I was trying to go to my local fight club for your typical overthrowing the government meeting, but the app infiltrated my google maps and my car self drove me to Wendy’s. Donald Trump himself crawled out of my screen and yanked my n95 mask off my face which ripped my ears off in the process. Now I just have listening holes.
