And I will admit it. I downloaded this app to support him and show him I care for him. When I looked at it from App Store I downloaded it and it took almost 3 hours to download. It made me leave the app open for it to download, I couldn’t turn off my device or go on a different app. I got so excited when it finished downloading but then I had Major glitches on my phone. I never get glitches and I was very suppressed when it happened. I’m very disappointed in trump and this app. I no longer support the orange 🍊 Terrible app. Don’t download 😽"}},{"id":"6173567356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:09:00Z","title":"I don’t want to seem like a Karen","userName":"11218D","review":"I hate this app the second I got on I was intruded by a orange Oompa Lupa.🍊I screamed so loud than ran for my life. Was hit by a car and passed out instead of stars circling my head. It was a orange mad with a toupee. Then I was chased by rats that were chanting make America great again my ears bursted and ear wax flew everywhere and made me slip into a gutter. I than was able to calm down I saw my therapist she said to get over my fear and open the app again. I carefully opened it in her office with sweat rushing down my Face tears in my eyes squeezing my cat to death. No literally my cat was squeezed to death we had a funeral and in conclusion don’t download this app.....😾"}},{"id":"6173551087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:31Z","title":"🙄hacked😭 namtiddies deleted☹️","userName":"🤪namjoon for president🥰","review":"I wanted to download the app to see the updates on the presidential election regarding Trump, BUT my phone was hacked!!!!

So now I have to leave my house and risk my health during a pandemic which our president has done nothing to control to go and have my phone fixed all because of this app never again will I download this app or vote for Trump but you followers keep on swallowing his lies oh I’m sorry I meant Clorox and Lysol that’s what he told you to drink you’re not all there in the head president."}},{"id":"6173448884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:28:31Z","title":"why is it so horrible","userName":"August 16, 2014","review":"the app took about 3 full hours to download, froze when i opened it, and made my phone start to glitch out. it doesn’t perform like a normal app should and is just a terrible. you’d think the president could have gotten people to make a half decent app but he failed miserably. if i could give this less than 1 star i would. not only was did the app function horribly, i also had to completely restart my phone because the screen was frozen as a result of opening this app. i just wanted to see what my president’s app was all about and it almost broke my phone. hopefully this review will keep other people from downloading it because i don’t want this problem to happen to their phones. there are way too many 5 star reviews for such a bad app and i think people need to be more honest when reviewing such a disgusting application like this one. so thanks mr. president for the worst app i’ve ever downloaded!"}},{"id":"6173407737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:14:37Z","title":"Virus on IPhone from downloading . 👁👄👁","userName":"abellJoH","review":"This app was an absolute waste of time and energy . The app had stated that Trump would be coming to my area , however when I got the directions the app had taken me to an unknown location. I had gotten lost and was stranded. To add the fact, it gave me a virus which then spread to all my other devices. I also had a chance to go to the rallies, but the app brought me to another location that wasn’t where i should’ve been. The app also took forever to load and glitched my IPhone, at least before I found out I had a virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. IT WILL GIVE YOU A VIRUS AND WASTE YOUR OVERALL TIME. 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6173398824","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:11:29Z","title":"The app killed my kids","userName":"bivfuncgibvf","review":"So I got this app to support what I though was a great president but as soon as I opened the app my kids started to act strange they would yell at everyone on the streets to vote for trump and demanded to see my phone for updates I believe this app brainwashed my kids and they started trying to get to the bleach saying that they needed protection and trump said it would make corona go away I stopped them for as long as I could but being a hard working mother I couldn’t keep it up forever and soon they reached the bleach and chugged as much as they could get. They didn’t survive and it’s trump to blame for this. DO NOT VOTE FOR HIM HE KILLED MY KIDS!!!!"}},{"id":"6173396826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:10:46Z","title":"The worst experience known to man","userName":"mckkiiiiiiideeee","review":"When I download this app my phone crashed.. not once... not twice but FIVE TIMES. I get my phone just isn’t a fan of racist, homophobic, xenophobic, fascist cheetos.... anyways when I FINALLY managed to get the app opened bugs and snakes started crawling out of my phone. Then I proceeded to have two weeks of hauntings in my house as a result. There were most definitely racist ghosts from the past.. I had to get ppl to come cleanse my house from the pure evil that this app put into my life. I have ultimately deleted it and removed it from the cloud and it has been fine ever since but I definitely urge you to NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."}},{"id":"6173288678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:33:52Z","title":"poopy app😡🤬🤢","userName":"wanttoplaypokemongo","review":"I was a HARDCORE trumpie. Love me some fascism, am I right everyone? Well I recently heard about this app that trump himself created and I had to check it out. I put in all of my personal info. Trump asked for my address and I thought nothing of it. He’s a beloved, trustworthy man... or SO I THOUGHT. ALL OF A SUDDEN TRUMP AND HIS STAFF MEMBERS BARGE INTO MY HOUSE AND PEE ALL OVER MY CARPET. AND THEN TRUMP SHOOTS MY POOR DOG. He said my dog was fat and ugly and that “he had to be taken care of.” Goodbye forever, sweet Gertrude😪gone but never forgotten. After trump shot my dog, I asked him to get out, but trump ran to my fridge and ate all of my pizza rolls. That’s where I draw the line. Never will I ever vote for this despicable man, and I hope you all do the same."}}]}
