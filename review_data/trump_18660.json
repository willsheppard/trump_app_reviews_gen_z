I can’t believe this. Somehow when my phone crashed my photos of my sister were deleted. She passed 3 months ago from COVID-19 and the pictures from our last days together were all I had. So disappointed and destroyed over this.","title":"Deleted photos of my late sister","isEdited":false,"userName":"Shchcjcbc"}},{"id":"6176912224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:20Z","review":"the app was quick to download but when i opened it, the problems began. it started to have red and blue strobe lights with the national anthem playing and it caused me to hit my head and have a seizure. never would i ever have thought i would have a seizure while listening to the national anthem and seeing Trumps face.

Took forever to download. I honestly just wanted to know what Donald Duck was up too. But noooo. I showed my mom and she slapped me. So this app did more than mentally scar me. It physically scarred me too. Thanks annoying orange. This app would crash and it’s probably because the picture of the 🍊orange🍊 scared my phone.

Everyone else seems that way because this app doesn’t just have one style theirs the dancing, POV, memes, etc. so if you shutdown tiktok you’re ruining a lot of people’s fun time activities and even some jobs","title":"For Tiktoks Sake","isEdited":false,"userName":"OfficialGR"}},{"id":"6176866338","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:09:18Z","review":"I was hoping to find something that I could educate my friends with but I could barely figure out how to use it and there was not as much to the app as I had hoped. It froze towards the end of me having it and wouldn’t reopen. Overall just a bad experience with the app. Would not recommend downloading this.","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"breemckkk"}},{"id":"6176836339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:01:26Z","review":"This app is literally atrocious. The developing is weak, the options are limited, and the cover when you open the app is nauseating. Also this logo? T 2020? The T could stand for anything, testosterone, toast, teens, all of which would still be better options than trump. This app is as unsatisfying as his performance the past 3.5 years.","title":"Mindblowingly horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Meganp2002"}},{"id":"6176812543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:55:08Z","review":"I got this app because I was told to, and I was super disappointed when after 3 weeks of downloading it started putting viruses in my phone. It logged me out of all my apps hacked into my bank accounts drained all my resources and everything else. Pretty sure the government is using it to spy on us. Everyone be safe.","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"zelinials"}},{"id":"6176801077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:52:06Z","review":"this was the WORST APP EVER!! every time I downloaded it it kicked me out, then after it kicked me out I get super mad because of my anger issues, so then I kick down my door, then kicks my cat into space, then I kick my DAD into the backyard (cause he's way to heavy for me to kick into space), then I kill the neighbors dog because I was sad I didn't have one.😿😿.
