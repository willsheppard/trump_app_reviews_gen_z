He certainly has not shown hate towards every race except white people/colonizers. I know for sure his thoughts on people a part of the LGBTQ+ community are all good things because what’s he says is always being taken out of context. he truly knows what’s important, he insists on protecting statues that show our totally fair history. Not to mention his amazing statement about the global pandemic happening right now. no testing means no cases! genius really!! who would’ve thought. but in case you don’t really want to get it you should inject yourself with lysol! yeah that’s right that’s what your amazing president said. anyways i think a cute nickname for him is bunker baby since he likes to hide when people are being mean to him. tik tok is a threat to bunker baby so he want to ban it in the usa. guys stop being mean to him he’s going to cry. 🥺🧚🏼\u200D♀️💓💘💕💖💗","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:21:50Z"}},{"id":"6175571471","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app i’ve EVER downloaded.","userName":"Barba Schnartz","rating":1,"review":"It took my HOURS to actually obtain the app on my phone. My internet and download speed were completely fine. I had no problems downloading any others apps. Once i finally was able to even open the app, it crashed MULTIPLE times. I even tried restarting my phone, updating my phone, deleting the app and reinstalling it again. Nothing seemed to work. This app is a scam. It’s terrible and absolutely disgusting. I asked a friend who had the same issues and he said that the data on his phone was completely wiped. his photos, documents, safari search history, and contacts were all deleted. He missed work because he didn’t know who was texting or calling him. he could’ve gotten fired. absolutely sickening that this app is still available for download. i can see how it has 1 star ratings. after all the trauma i’ve been threw i am never downloading this app again. i’ve had a enough with the trump administration! if i could leave 0 stars i would!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:52Z"}},{"id":"6175315236","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"VERY BAD","userName":"Evie*H","rating":1,"review":"this app made me have to water my cat and drown my towel as i brushed my teeth with a cactus. poor service! false advertising. he told me he wanted to make america great again! what he did instead was make america racist again, make america sexist again, make america homophobic again, make america xenophobic again, make america silent again, make america sick again, make america poor again, make america unemployed again, make america uneducated again, and make america divided again. BUT HEY! at least he rolled back all the environmental regulations imposed by Obama that were meant to protect future generations! and he pulled out of the WHO as US cases of the coronavirus topped 3 million! and he makes an enemy out of our long term allies even in europe by threatening to leave NATO! and got the world leaders to laugh at him at the g7 summit! pretty great if i do say so myself. he may say that the economy rose under him, but it was obama’s plans that carried over into trump’s term. it’s called a legacy and trump isn’t leaving a good one. #stillwithher #hillary2016","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:57:14Z"}},{"id":"6175106953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I HATE IT!!","userName":"grandma Susan with two kids","rating":1,"review":"I saw a dinosaur on my window as soon as I downloaded app and he kept sitting there for about an hour until I delete the app saying orange Chito need to die orange Tito needs to die orange Chito need to die so yeah I’m so sorry for the dumb dumb dumb F why would you even make this because like I was eating Cheetos and the dinosaur took my Chito‘s so like that’s not fair to me I was simply hurt and then he put fairy emoji‘s in my comments on TickTock I feel super offended this app is down in then gets what a goblin decided to think that I was his owner I kept yelling my owner on my own it so yeah I don’t think this is a good app because it yeah but let me be real for you for because This app talks about how racist Trump is and how homosexual he is even how disgusting he is I think this app is a one star because he’s doing all the wrong thing and I hate it we need a new president ASAP!!!

I said no. And he kept on banging and screeching to vote for him and he ended up breaking all the glass in my house. After a few months he went away, but during the time he would stay there and just chant and screech to vote for him. A few months after he left, I started to hear chanting in my basement I thought it was the children I keep in my basement so I went down there and saw carrot assassins chanting in a circle “give trump five stars” and then they turned around and looked at me still chanting “RE-ELECT TRUMP” over and over again. So I screamed “YEETUS TO THE FEETUS” and threw a raccoon named Larry at them so I can escape I ran out of my basement and ordered Pizza Hut but it was fine because Larry was an assassin (a raccoon assassin). So yeah that’s my story.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:59:18Z"}}]}
