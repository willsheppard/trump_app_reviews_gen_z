After taking almost 45 minutes to download I had to use my personal information to be able to see what was going one with the annoying orange in the White House. It‚Äôs almost like they are taking our information to spy on us but whatever, I completed the sign up (which included a request for my ssn which was optional and a citizenship test which was not) and the process took so long. I‚Äôve sat here for 6 hours recanting my love for the trumps and mike pence and I‚Äôve finally made it into the app. Or so I thought. The app crashed on me! And don‚Äôt save any of my progress!! When I reopened it displayed a message saying that the error was caused by me not giving correct information and that officials were headed to my location to ask me some questions. I was like, how do the officials know my location? Turns out that the app uses location services to track you, even when you‚Äôre not using the app!! That‚Äôs why I had to plug my phone in to charge during the first 15 minutes of my citizenship test. It drains so much battery so quickly, and didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted to use location services. So, now in addition to all the questions that I had to answer in my first attempt to open the app, it now knows my exact location at all times. Well, I think I‚Äôve had just about enough of it. Who are these officials questioning my citizenship status??? When are they coming??? Do I have time to cook up some of my world famous medium rare chicken tendies for them??? We want answers, Mr. Trump. I will be deleting this app and hopefully I was not hacked or my information harvested for some tracking purpose. \nAlso, I keep getting emails and text asking for donations for the Trump campaign. I thought he was a business man, why can he not fund his re-election himself if he‚Äôs so rich? Hasn‚Äôt he had enough tax breaks or something? Why does he need more money from Americans if he has so much? Isn‚Äôt he rich? Let‚Äôs see them tax returns Donnie. I wanna see em. Give em to me. And stop spamming my email and phone. You seem desperate. And it‚Äôs actually spam, gmail has it listed as spam, it‚Äôs in my junk folder where it belongs and I can‚Äôt get rid of it. It‚Äôs like Mike Pence is slithering his little snake tongue into my ear to ask for $42. What is so special about $42? Why is $42 the automatic amount they ask for? I do not understand; I do not comprehend. You‚Äôre not the 42nd president. Why do you need $42 of my money? You‚Äôre so rich. Right? Right??\nAnyway, I‚Äôm off to go pitch my support for the other racist I guess see y‚Äôall later xoxo gossip girl","userName":"Sen.

My phone has been getting really hot lately because of the app and I know this because I went to the ‚Äúphone store‚Äù and got it checked, turns out this app itself brings viruses ü¶† and ruins everything. Good thing I got rid of the app before it could do any more damage, I suggest you do the same.","userName":"abchhljhdvh","title":"Worst App on my phone"}},{"id":"6180431722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T10:27:50Z","review":"i want this app deleted off of here pleaseeeee he is a racist homophobic piece of trash","userName":"Ashley The Butthole","title":"delete this app"}}]}
