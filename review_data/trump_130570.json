This app also hacked my YouTube account and I had to restart it. This app is horrible and disgustingly horrifying. Please don’t download it, I’m still pretty freaked out about the other stuff it did to my device"}},{"id":"6174626056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trash","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"):&,&& n))hdhxhxhchx","review":"Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174625826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET IT","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mack Wally","review":"Omg this app is horrible. I got it to stay informed but it’s NOT WORTH IT. Not only dose it take up storage, spreed false information and tell me things other apps like news dose but it also BROKE MY PHONE. I could never get into my phone for more then ten minutes. It crashes all the time and makes everything super slow!!! I have to write this fast so I can send it before it crashes it’s that bad. Can’t wait to delete it and advise others to not only do the same but also just not get the app in the first place."}},{"id":"6174625617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ew","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dlosbsna","review":"terrible app. -1037463793828/10 would not recommend"}},{"id":"6174625184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m confused","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"A concerned 18 year old","review":"I’m very confused.

My mother was sitting behind me and started to violently throw up 🤮 of course I was a little distraught, so I opened instragram for a little distraction. The Cheeto hacked my account and posted pictures of its naked butt!!! Instragram then deleted my account due to community guideline violations 😔✌🏻 don’t download. So disappointed."}},{"id":"6174624663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T02:15:09Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"maknnaaa","review":"do not download this app, first off it’s extremely hard to navigate and you never know where anything is at and the first image you see is a large potato with hair that looks like it’s stuck in the 90s, and the cheeto color does no justice, all this app does is give you updates about the life of this potato and honestly nobody cares, when i showed this app to my grandma she dropped dead at how UGLYYYYY and painful it is to the eyes. would never recommend to anyone, this app makes me cry it hurts my head just thinking about it i could throw up at how horrible this app is ... -100000/10 🤢🤢🤮love gen z"}}]}
