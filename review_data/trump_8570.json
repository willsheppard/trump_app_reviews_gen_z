Some weeks later, i started to hear weird things coming from under my bed and it didn’t sound like any human. I think that what ever this app had is messing up my life. All because this app. This app has some ghosts attached to it. Im not happy with this app and would like it to be removed completely. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️😻😝👽 -karen"}},{"id":"6145466805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"BEWARE! APP STEALS PERSONAL DATA","userName":"Linda Simonns","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T19:28:18Z","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app, suspicious activity began to occur on my phone. I believe I got hacked! I cannot understand why my favorite president would create such an app that hacks people! Pictures and personal data was removed from my phone. I am very worried that I will not be able to get any of that back. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. Now whenever I try to open the app, it glitches out, and when I try to delete it my whole phone glitches!!😠 I am very disappointed with this app."}},{"id":"6140717637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is sickening🤮","userName":"Random playerrrrr","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T16:58:42Z","review":"This app is honestly so terrible. Why is there little kids on a app for a prejudice rapist. This is not an opinion is a fact. I honestly don’t see how this man is going “Make America Great Again” if number one, America was NEVER great AND America is only “great” for those who have PRIVILEGE! A person of color can’t even go outside to take out the trash without having to deal with consequences. I could write more but it will be a full book so i’m gonna end it now. Trump 2020 is getting old. 🙄"}},{"id":"6137140198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Stinky smelly poopoo","userName":"lEmOn¿","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T19:55:00Z","review":"Gen z can and WILL destroy what they please, including this garbage app. Y’all think because we can’t vote and we are teenagers, we don’t understand what’s going on and don’t have a voice. But there are millions of us, we understand how corrupt the president is and how many he’s harmed. I personally do my research and can see why he his such an awful president. I recommend whoever’s reading this to do the same. Don’t believe everything Fox News OR CNN feeds you. Seek information from both sides."}},{"id":"6137644163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"title":"Trump 2020 App","userName":"Stephanie MAGA Mom","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T23:29:38Z","review":"This app has everything we need. If the other platforms go down for censoring us, this is a sure fire back up plan to stay connected. I love how I can register for events (online & local) as well as share them on my Twitter page.
