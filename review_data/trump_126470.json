opened the app, instead of a glorious picture of our current president, i saw a giant piece of poop. it wasn’t just any poop though, it was a diarrhea poop. yes i know that you may not believe me but it was so disgusting. my children were with me when i opened the app and it was so disgusting that one of them threw up all over me!! this is unacceptable. no child should ever have to see a picture of poop, especially a diarrhea one. i will have to speak to all of the managers of this app for this shameful mistake of yours. you should all be ashamed on yourselves.

Let’s start off with how long it took to install.It took THREE hours to download, which got me very mad, because I have amazing wifi.When I opened the app, lemme tell you how disgusting it was! It had a picture of an orange, a moldy disgusting orange 🤮 It was probably an orange nobody cared about for about 74 years.Such a disgrace!I decided to continue exploring this app, but it turned VERY glitchy. I decided to restart my phone but it made it worse!!! It caused a virus on my phone! It’s stealing all my information and uninstalling my favorite app (i can no longer install it again. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone! Please get it off the app store after all this harm it’s done to me and others!","title":"HORRIBLE!","userName":"noo 👁👄👁","rating":1}}]}
