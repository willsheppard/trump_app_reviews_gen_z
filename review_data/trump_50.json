When I opened the app, MY HAND TURNED ORANGE!! Never in my southern bell life had I’d seen a app change you! I threw my phone and ran to my horse doctor to see if he could help!! He looked me dead in the eyes and said “yOu KnoW WhAT daRliNG, YOu gOtS tHe MaD CarRot dIsEaSe” I ran to my local police station and talk to the secretary. I went on and on about the Fox News blog I read about my disease (cuz that’s where I get all my information) but after 20 or so minutes I realized THEY ALL HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH PIGS!! I ran out of there so quick because why would someone give pigs authority?!?!?! I would never go to the doctors because they all lie and say “masks save people” but I know that’s some libs taken away my constitutional rights!!!! After a while my orange puffy hand turned into my orange puffy arm!! I went to my house and tried to reach my Cheeto king but the only person who picked up was Barron!! He told me the only cure was to get educated on what sir. Cheeto was doing to minority’s and VOTE HIM OUT!!!! I hung up, listened to black, Muslim, LGBTQ people, and all other minorities, learned and spoke out for those with less privilege then me and voted against trump! MY DISEASE IS CURED!!!!! THIS IT THE WORST APP!!!! DON’T DOWNLOAD OR ELSEYOU’LL  GET MAD CARROT DISEASE TOOO!!!!!!!!!","rating":1,"title":"A SHOCKING DISCOVERY!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T18:48:54Z","userName":"Mikael dianne","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177089520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i accidentally downloaded this app thinking it was tinder🔥 but when i opened it, the only person i can swipe left or right on was this orange cheeto oompa loompa sexist, homophobic, racist, wanting to date his daughter, blaming china🇨🇳 for the virus spread in the US, bunker boy. at first i wanted to swipe right but i got a flashback of bunker boy’s leaked 🍤 and i nearly threw up. it’s fine. a little flabby never kill nobody.✨ i like to practice forgiveness so i went to swipe right on him but then i remembered that bunker boy doesn’t know how to properly hold a water💦 bottle. an immediate turn off. but that’s okay too. sometimes, with hands so small, it can be hard to hold objects. i completely understand.😌 so i went to swipe right but then i remembered bunker boy crying about his little rally that no one attended. and now he wants to ban tiktok because of it. he really said “grab em by the 🐱” but i think HE’S the 🐱. after three strikes, i had to swipe left. BUT THE APP WOULDNT LET ME SWIPE. instead it told me to sign up for bunker boy’s campaign. 100% disappointed. do not buy this app. \nps. all jokes aside, gen z will keep ruining everything bunker boy has if he bans tiktok. we will continue to ruin your rallies, and take down your apps. we will not go down without a fight. don’t forget bunker boy, we are the future voters😋","rating":1,"title":"oh to see without my eyes👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-09T15:09:03Z","userName":"Krhgfbdjdi","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174694511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"omggg😫BAD VIBES!!! as soon as i opened this app my cat looked at my phone and threw up all over it! only 2 minutes later i was lighting a candle and accidentally burned my finger causing me to jump back and stub my toe!!! as i was hopping around crying i FELL DOWN THE STAIRS and right out of the window on the balcony that was open right at the bottom!!! it wasn’t a far fall however i landed RIGHT in a thorn bush!! it was rough and as soon as i was standing up i got the app back up and my dog saw it and dropped a DEAD RACOON on my lap!!!

It was daddy ✨cheeto✨, he was telling me that he had been waiting all his life for me to download the app because he was in LOVE with ME😱, well of course I accepted and you know we started dating, but little did he know I was an undercover spy for Anonymous and they sent me to help with their investigation (I can’t say) and daddy ✨cheeto✨ was oblivious to the whole situation. Well, a year goes by and daddy ✨ cheeto✨ wants to get married and I accepted but little did he know I was going to make that Simpson’s prediction, true. Well, our wedding happens and daddy ✨ cheeto✨ gets all sappy and tells me he wants to make a new family since his wife hates him (who can blame her) and so I tell him we should wait. Later that night, I get a call saying from Anonymous telling me that my investigation is over and I have to call off the marriage, so I go to daddy ✨cheeto✨ and tell him everything and he starts crying telling me he really loves me and I tell him to buck up and stop whining like a little baby. So, I leave the White House with everything he bought me and little more and I go to Anonymous and I see writing on a banner that says “WILL YOU MARRY ME?” and I’m schocked. It’s from papi ✨Anonymous✨. \n\nStay tuned for more.","rating":1,"title":"I’m so disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T16:37:20Z","userName":"baisiathecreator","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176777693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was honestly really excited to see Trump added an app to the App Store ✨✨ I wanted to see how I could help his campaign. His administration does things SO well, so I was just expecting this app to be a hit! Well, right off the bat the app took almost 48 hours to download👎🏻😾... weird. Then, I FINALLY get to open it and it asks if I want to “Allow” or “Don’t Allow” notifications. I’m in church ⛪️ A LOT, so I don’t allow apps to notify me during the lords time 🙏🏽. When I click “Don’t Allow” 🚫📵I IMMEDIATELY get TONS of banner notifications telling me I’ve “joined the Illuminati” 👁 and to “prepare for the second coming of Christ” and “a Vote for Trump 2020 is a vote for Satan 2020”👹👹. Now our president is a god fearing man, so I’m really confused by these messages and I don’t like the app. But I thought maybe his app had been hacked 🆘💮or something, so I continue.... he asks for my phone number 📵📱next and you can’t access the app without providing a phone number! My husband didn’t like this feature AT ALL👨🏻\u200D🦰👎🏻😾! I’m not allowed to have my own phone 🙏🏽 and my husband did not want me sharing his number with the president🤡. Also, it was the first time I’ve ever seen the president ask for consent, so I’m glad he’s making progress 👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽. But APPLE please remove this app from your App Store.","rating":1,"title":"SPAMMED WITH NOTIFICATIONS 🚫🚫‼️‼️❌🛑","date":"2020-07-09T13:45:56Z","userName":"Allergic to Justice","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176086491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app just to see what it was like, if i got updated on stuff going on or anything. worse decision ever. i downloaded the app, and it asked me if i would allow notifications so i said yes, AND THEN out of nowhere my phone starts blowing up, getting spammed with “trump 2020” and “vote for trump” nonstop. i went into settings to change it and then i start getting phone calls saying to turn notifications back on? i don’t understand how they got my phone number or anything but it wouldn’t stop until i blocked the number. that’s not even all of it. after i block the number, i get AN EMAIL from a random person sending me threats saying stuff like ill “get my head blown off” if i don’t vote for trump. so obviously i was done with this so i completely deleted the app, and then after, all my photos get deleted! then my other apps one by one. i turned my phone off and on and somehow that made it stop. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. im now realizing why people say trump supporters are a cult. i’ve been questioning if i should still support him recently, and i’ve decided to no longer support this man and i want him out of office! i am tired of his racist remarks and his pedophilic words and actions. i have learned this man is not fit for president SO PLEASE vote biden. thank you for reading","rating":1,"title":"worst app out there","date":"2020-07-09T10:30:12Z","userName":"kam kay","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173148822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When i downloaded this app o was so excited to have the trump app, i was taking my mind off of it after 20 minutes of it installing it was a little off that it took forever to download but i didn’t care too much. about 30 minutes later it is still not downloaded so at this point i’m thinking of uninstalling it but i did not. About an hour and a half later it finally downloaded and i was so excited once again. The app lagged A LOT and i can assure you it is not my wifi because my wifi has never had problems and it works great. I couldn’t even click on stuff most of the times and it really did frustrate me. Please update this app or do something to it because an app shouldn’t lag as much as this and as much as i love our president (trump 2020 :) ) i absolutely hate this app. it is one of the most horrible apps i have downloaded so far i’m sorry to admit it but it is true. not only the lagging , how much it took to download, not being able to click on some stuff but it also would glitch our sometimes and take me out of the app i couldn’t even stay in it for over 2 MINUTES! These people really need to do something with this app because no. it’s absolutely horrible i’m sorry mr trump but this app is the worst app i have ever download 😞.","rating":1,"title":"lags and takes forever to download","date":"2020-07-08T17:48:14Z","userName":"Lisa 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176658315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Literally as soon as I downloaded this app all of my phone data was erased! I no longer have any of my family pictures or any apps besides this one. I’m most saddened by the loss of all the pictures of my recently dead pet bird. Now I don’t have any videos or pictures of him because of this stupid stupid app!! Another scary thing is when I was trying to get my data back from the app, it replaced all my pictures with sheep! Almost like it was saying all trump supporters are sheep following each other’s lead aimlessly and having nothing better to say besides tRuMp 2o2o🤪?? AND All of my text messages and emails have been sent to the White House. So they were hacked and deleted!! Why is the president trying to spy on us with this app? What kind of democracy is this?? Are we turning into those other dictator countries that control your internet space and lives????? This is horrible!!! This app says it is supposed to keep us updated with Don’s  presidential campaign but it doesn’t even open! It keeps glitching closed! AND HACKING MY PHONE!!! HOW LUDICROUS!! Absolutely horrible. If I knew any better, I think this app is fake and is actually created by those highly intelligent liberal people to hack our phones. If there is any fake news in this world, this app is the fakest😠","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!
