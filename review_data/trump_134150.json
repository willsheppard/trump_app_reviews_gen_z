What happened to fixing the vaccines? Oh wait u didn’t do anything because you are payed to shut up and you also pay people to shut up. Trump shouldn’t win 2020cause  there will be a war in this country that will divide everything. RIP to all the dumb trump supporters here cause y’all got some dumb dude telling u what to do.all the problems that we have in this country are all his fault. What does “maga” even stand for? America was never great. If more things come out from anonymous then he should just resign because more and more people aren’t liking him.Black lives matter✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽","date":"2020-07-08T17:30:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"hizznne","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173092858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bunker boyyy","review":"Shawty's like a

took me WEEKS to download which is unacceptable.then once it FINALLY finished downloading i opened it and all that popped up was a white screen saying “orange lived matter,that’s it” very inappropriate to say the least.then of all a sudden my lights turned orange and i kept hearing someone chant “orange,orange,”. very scary.this app is not safe for anyone that is not the color orange because it targets people of all other colors and i don’t like it😡","date":"2020-07-08T17:29:17Z","rating":1,"userName":"anti-orange
