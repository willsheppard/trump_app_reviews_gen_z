I’m scared it will take my data and post it all over Facebook. All logos and slogans contained in the Sites are trademarks may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of DJTFP or the applicable trademark holder so I can’t even say M*A*G*A freely. There is too many restrictions, the colors and the small font make the site hard to read and maneuver. It wouldn’t let me connect my phone number even after turning my phone on and off. I even disconnected from WiFi and re downloaded the app. It seems like a scam and not the real app."}},{"id":"6177498905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"heytgeredemonsitsmeyaboi","date":"2020-07-09T17:06:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?","review":"No. I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. He could actually save save people from death? The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. What happened to him? He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic, really. He could save others from death, but not himself"}},{"id":"6177397598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MegCausey","date":"2020-07-09T16:36:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE👎🙀☠️🤢🤮😱👺👿👿👺🤡","review":"Hello, like you all I was a trump supporter looking to learn more about our president for the upcoming race! But as soon as a downloaded the app I could feel something was very wrong. It seem as though the pictures were WATCHING ME!!! Now I don’t know if this is some kind of Russian hacking technique but I felt VERY unsafe. After a few days of using the app I started to get the strangest cravings. For what you may ask.... 🍊That’s right, oranges! I couldn’t keep myself from eating them, but as soon as I took a bite a realized there was something inside the orange. ✨✨IT WAS A NOTE FROM GOD✨✨✨It said “leave a review on trumps app and uninstall it nowwwww” I was so shocked but knew I had to let the other faithful supporters know about what I had learned. So please be safe and get rid of this demon app!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177315874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lolz😇","date":"2020-07-09T16:13:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"that’s a big lol moments👁👄👁","review":"i downloaded the app with such high expectations to find out that it would take 69 weeks just to install it is so disappointing. when it finally showed up in my gallery of apps on how to trap children in my basement, i immediately opened the app to be greeted with a picture of a plastic baby. i went on with my day assuming it would be fine. WRONG. i approached the road while riding my bike aggressively and suddenly millions of plastic baby’s  start attacking me. i fought back until i got them under control and trapped them in my basement with my other 14 children. this was such an inconvenience for me and took so much time out of my day when i could have been folding my dishes and walking my goldfish. i would not recommend this app to anyone😇"}},{"id":"6177015409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lillily124","date":"2020-07-09T14:48:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"cheeto man🧚\u200D♀️🥰","review":"For some reason the app kept crashing, just like my mental health with him as president. I also have a feeling this app is giving my information away because it asked for a lot of personal information and i noticed a lot of accounts got hacked recently. My suspicion is that this app is giving our information to china and i definitely think it should be taken off the app store. That is definitely the only reason, i repeat the only reason i want this app taken away is because i am making an allegation of it giving china my information, definitely NOT because i’m scared of a whole generation hurting my feelings, one last time i repeat this app needs to be taken off the store because it gives your information to china."}},{"id":"6176772725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Linnie.8","date":"2020-07-09T13:44:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’ve been violated","review":"This app is unbelievably (bad). I downloaded the app with the intention about my Oompa Loompa president, but I did not download this app to get hit on. I can’t believe Trump would DM me, asking for my snap. I can’t believe this would happen and apparently this happened to my friend too! In addition, I did not like the aesthetic of the app. Sure I know the colors are supposed to be patriotic but they can be harsh on the eyes. This app was too much and I was thinking about deleting it but trump DM me again to keep the app. He offered to pay me 60 cents but like who does he think I am? I don’t take people’s money. I mean he could’ve at least round up to a dollar and maybe then I will consider. Overall not a good app and this fall I will still vote for trump (but out of the office)🥰🧚\u200D♀️❤️"}},{"id":"6176515684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sufufuc","date":"2020-07-09T12:35:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Nearly got killed with this app","review":"I love my president so much, and as a willing and supportive citizen of the United States of America, I downloaded this app to give my endorsement to the non-white supremacist, non-massogynistic, fun loving, millionaire leader that Donald J. Trump is. It took 26 weeks to download and when I finally had the chance to open it, i had the opportunity to enter my phone number for future promotions on merchandise and notifications. Not 5 minutes later, my messages were filled to the brim with Trump’s nudes. My eyes burned so badly after seeing them that the burns reached my brain. After extensive surgery and nearly dying during surgery I somehow survived. To this day I suffer from PTSD and I am now blind. I’m typing this with voice assistance. Please do not continue to keep this app on the AppStore."}},{"id":"6176492730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"xoajh","date":"2020-07-09T12:29:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"possibly the worst app ever.","review":"i downloaded the app which took a whole week. while it was downloading mysterious pictures of trump started to appear everywhere in my camera roll 🤢 they even started to get sent to many of my contacts WITHOUT my consent 😡💯😿 at first i was like ... it’s probably just a glitch. 👾👾 but once the app finished downloading the photos started to become VERY inappropriate and my contacts were getting SPAMMED by these photos. 😵👁💧👄💧👁  i continued to ignore the problem. i opened the app and was greeted by a horrendous 😫 most ugliest 🤢 person 🕴🏻 ive ever seen 👀 it scared me so much that i had to exit the app immediately. it then gave me nightmares. 👎💭 possibly the worst, most scarring app i’ve ever touched, layer my eyes upon, downloaded, and hacked by.

I live in a small town In texas and my entire community is in support of Donald, and so I wanted to as well! HOWEVER, when I opened the app, a picture of my past abuser was on the front! Because I have never had internet in my small rural life, I had never seen the orange man as the face of the republican campaign! At the beginning of time, this disgusting man has abused me and many others. Legend is, every woman he’s assaulted has turned his skin more orange and added another wrinkle to his face! He looks like a prune, and seeing this face made me faint! They should advertise that the man we should be supporting is a fascist, abuser who shouldn’t be in a place of power!"}},{"id":"6175976483","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"barrons future girl","date":"2020-07-09T09:54:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"terrible","review":"I opened the app to set up my account but they immediately ask if i was white. I wondered why they would need this information but i ignored my thoughts and pressed no. They then asked me what race i am, with the options: “robber, runner, terrorist, or virus”. I was baffled with this question, even disgusted by it. Moving on, since i am middle eastern, i chose “terrorist” wondering why it would matter. Right after, i had a pop-up saying i wasn’t allowed to use the app, and instead i should “go back to my own country and download the 9/11 app.” I was outraged and confused, what type of language is this? I’m leaving a 1 star review because they failed to consider that i WOULD gladly go back to my country, but it was unfortunately bombed due to the whites. Thank you, colonizers."}}]}
