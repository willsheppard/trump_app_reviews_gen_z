I do not understand why anyone would want this app when they can get all their news from a nicer place like twitter because that’s a totally reliable source. Try getting your news from unbiased sources for example The Hill is a good one. I would give this app 0 stars if I could. Ok bye everyone."}},{"id":"6178168388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:39:59Z","userName":"baby seal leather boots","rating":1,"title":"Not Good","isEdited":false,"review":"There were so many technical glitches and the app simply wouldn’t start up for me. So annoying! But besides the problems with the app itself, I could only view photos of beans when it FINALLY decided to open. There were so many and I just could not figure out why! Very poor, unhelpful, and annoying. Overall not good!"}},{"id":"6178147808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:32:54Z","userName":"sasakay0","rating":1,"title":"👁💧👄💧👁","isEdited":false,"review":"This WAS THE WORST HORRIBLE app on the app store and I was hoping for this app to ✨make 🍊america🇺🇸 again 🤡 BUT it was working so s l o w and I couldn’t deal with it. I have a fast working wifi and I even switched to LTE to make this app go faster but it was glitchy and orange. Yes, orange. It had some very ugly pictures❤️ I don’t think this app deserves to take up space in the app store. It’s ✨worthless✨ just, no❤️"}},{"id":"6178126987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:25:51Z","userName":"hdjddjd z sjssns","rating":1,"title":"glitching issues","isEdited":false,"review":"there wasn’t an option to vote for an actual good president 😔 I encourage others to not downloaded it , this app stole my bank information and made my phone catch a virus and then catch on fire. what a world we live in where downloading an app can cause you to lose your only form of connection a to people( a cell phone ) 😢"}},{"id":"6178126391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:25:38Z","userName":"🤣🦕🤣🤣🕸🌹😌😌🙃🙂🥳😟😤😤","rating":1,"title":"Awful service","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is slow and when you open it it shows things that will give you nightmares it takes about a day just to download this app and when you open it. It takes forever just to load a picture. And it shows so much negativity it shouldn’t even be on the App Store."}},{"id":"6178096264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:15:36Z","userName":"TRUMPS A JERK","rating":1,"title":"This is Disgusting","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app today but when I opened the app I could see flashes of photos. I wanted to dig deeper into this to find out what it was about so I took a screenshot when I opened the app to find numerous pictures of naked women. I hope this app is taken down forever as we now know this app is actually a way for our disgusting president to store nudes. Disgusting."}},{"id":"6178053562","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:01:35Z","userName":"leaf 🌿","rating":1,"title":"Terriable and glitchy!😡","isEdited":false,"review":"I tried this app thinking it would be so useful! But right when I singed in it crashed my iPhone and kicked me out. It finally let me in after it crashing multiple times but it was to glitchy to do anything! And may I add I have the newest iPhone so it should not be a problem and not be this glitchy and kick me out!"}},{"id":"6178025168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:52:16Z","userName":"Gen Z hates you lol","rating":1,"title":"This app has inspired me❤️ to go blind 💫🧚\u200D♂️😍","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened up the app to worship our lovely orange and immediately all of the objects in the room started levitating and then a bunch of policemen burst threw the door and threw me out the window, but thankfully Gordon Ramsay caught me, saving my life. The policemen started chasing us and I started running away until the big orange himself tried to run over me with their limo. Terrible experience 😊"}}]}
