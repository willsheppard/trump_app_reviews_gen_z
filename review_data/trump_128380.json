This app is very faulty. My phone kept crashing, and my screen froze several times. The further I looked I kept seeing videos on how Trump would like to have intercourse with his daughter??¿ Rae Cism and I do not like this.

And when it downloaded all I saw was a run down orange. I clicked one of the pictures and it brought me to the deep web. Somebody now has my address and all my info. After that I took 420 second nap. I awoke to my phone ringing. IT WAS THE PERSON FROM THE DEEP WEB. They said that they were holding my family for ransom and that I’ll need to give them 69420 dollars, then a group of people with a Donald Trump mask broke into my house and tied me down. They knocked me out for what felt like countless hours. They brought me to a basement and then I saw all my family sitting down, unconscious on what looked like a satanic ritual. Than the people with the Donald Trump face mask came waving their arms around. They then circled the circle and began chanting “BUILD A WALL” I was scared for my life and then they pulled out their Yu-Gi-Oh Fusion Card. They fused and became the man himself, Donald .J Trump. Donald then proceeded to cut my leg off and that made be go unconscious. I then woke up in my bed thinking it was a dream but for some reason one of my legs was smaller than the other one. I got a text on my phone and it was Donald Trump. The text said that he only gave me half of my family. I then checked up on my family and was horrified. They were all laying down but EACH ONE OF THEIR HALVES ARE MISSInG😡. I guess it was true he did give me half of them. But I saw that my sisters leg was not there. I suddenly realized that I HAVE MY SISTERS LEG. I was horrified. I then got a text that told me to go in the attic, I went and saw a box. I opened it up and their were adoption papers FOR ME. I read hem and realized that I was given to my parents at the age of three. Than I realized something. If I was adopted ThAT MeANS ThAt I HavE A sTRangers LeG. After that uninstalled the Trump app but it was too late all of the deep web knew my address  and sent hit men and assassins after me. I then jumped out of my window and became a new person. I legally changed my name and then became a better person. And that’s the story of how I become The amazing Spider Man of today. 😘","title":"Disgusting 🤮🤢🦠","isEdited":false,"userName":"Avatar Muhammad","date":"2020-07-09T14:33:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176957987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is honestly not helpful at all and I don’t see the point. 100000% WOULD NOT recommend.","title":"The worst app I’ve ever downloaded","isEdited":false,"userName":"angieeexoxoxooo","date":"2020-07-09T14:33:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176957932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I was walking my gerbil when BOOM!
