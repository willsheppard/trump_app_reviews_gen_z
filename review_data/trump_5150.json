I put in my number and immediately got a million texts to join the army. I just ignored but the next day a bunch of army men went into my house and low and be hold they are just middle aged men who support trump! They tried changing my point of view towards trump but they didn’t really try at all. I grabbed my leaf blower and low and be hold they are cardboard cutouts! I could’ve sworn they were talking to me but i guess not. Nothing seems real anymore, my wife is cardboard, my baby is cardboard. This app has ruined my entire life. One star."}},{"id":"6177797898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Demon Planet","date":"2020-07-09T18:40:12Z","userName":"Jverhine","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to see our Great Leader’s plans for the future, but this app fails to address the greatest existential threat to America: The Demon Planet. There is a demon planet full of blacks, transgenders and homosexuals coming to collide with earth. We need our prayer warriors to circle up the wagons now more than ever. I will redownload the app when they add a prayer circle social networking feature to really address the threat we face. Until then, I’ll be preparing for the spiritual battle that awaits us all! Put on the full armor of god and hit your knees before the demon homosexuals invade and force us to recognize people of color as human beings!"}},{"id":"6177744439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad App!","date":"2020-07-09T18:24:01Z","userName":"Cheeto Wizz","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could feel closer to Trump, but when I started using it.. I began to be a little racist! My black friends didn’t like me anymore, and I started seeing the confederate flag EVERYWHERE!! I’m adopted by an interracial couple, one white parent and the other black, and my little brother is half black. And I caught myself saying racist things to him and my dad. It got to the point where I was thinking for running away!!! Then I deleted the app to clear off space on my phone and everything got better. Strange right! \n\nI’m not doing this for tik tok btw, idc about the app, but our president is orange :("}},{"id":"6177646552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ughhhh, I am disgusted","date":"2020-07-09T17:53:45Z","userName":"Grace20062.0","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I opened up the app to get all of my “alternative” facts on COVID 19. But when I opened it up all I saw was a Oompa Loompa. I did not know that is was just a big add for Charlie and the chocolate factory. But that Oompa Loompa was HILARIOUS!!! He was saying all sorts of crazy things such as COVID 19 will just disappear. Or that we should just drink bleach to fight the virus. I was laughing for hours at all the shenanigans this Oompa Loompa gets up too. But then I learned that he was the president! How did we let such a revolting man into the office! I will be deleting this app very soon. I do not support Trump 2020 just like he does not support Black lives Matter!"}},{"id":"6177482195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The app made my phone go into anaphylactic shock","date":"2020-07-09T17:01:50Z","userName":"Dhomey","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was extremely excited to download such a wondrous app with characters such as chester cheeto as the face of the whole thing! but once I tried to open this, my phone began shaking and froze completely! I had to give it cpr as well as and use a defibrillator! It didn’t work so I asked apple what happened and one man who worked at the genius bar said that my phone didn’t want to work in the presence of such an app. I had to delete it, my phone refused to come out of shock if i didn’t delete the app. it still hasn’t been the same. 😔"}},{"id":"6177481869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🚪 ✨🧚","date":"2020-07-09T17:01:44Z","userName":"👎🙃😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Ok here is the deal I don’t have much time left before they find me but I was in the oompa loompa cult that worships trump as a god. Unfortunately I was too smart for my own good and stumbled upon a picture of his eye sockets which are a normal human skin color. This was considered blasphemous to the high council of Oompa Loompas in “The Church Of The Orange Ones”, and I was sentenced to death. I begged and pleaded that I still believed that bright orange was his natural skin color but the elders would not hear it. They took my wig and they had almost started to remove my orange paint before I escaped. They are coming for me. DO NOT GO INTO THE OOMPA LOOMPA CULT THEY ARE Jbsnjsjkkkakksjssj ME OH MY GOD jajsjsowhjwwksjsjksgeh AHHHH"}},{"id":"6177398692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚😿Disappointed 😿🧚","date":"2020-07-09T16:37:07Z","userName":"Donnies biggest fan ☺️😿","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I love our beautiful, crisp orange, bunker baby boy president as much as the next guy but this app was disappointing. Immediately after opening the app I was attacked inside of my own Trump supporting home! A hot air balloon came and crushed in my roof! Some very small and very orange men came out, of course Trump was in the bunker so he wasn’t there but I think they were his replicas? Anyways they took all of my oranges out of the bowl, spit on me for quote, “being girl” and left without another word! It’s really too bad because they even took my favorite orange with old Donnies face glued right on it 😿😾 Do not download this app! 💅🧚"}},{"id":"6177365481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The Worst App","date":"2020-07-09T16:27:16Z","userName":"Frank Miffen","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is simply a terrible app. The functions are glitchy, the appearance is tacky and outdated, and the message it sends is hateful. I tried to give it a chance, but it took up more space on my phone than it said it would and tried to access my phone’s camera, microphone, and other features without asking for permission first. Also, why does it need access to those things in the first place?? I think it’s trying to watch out every move, and listen to our conversations. Overall, this is the worst app you can get. Avoid it like the plague."}},{"id":"6177234000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓼 𝓲𝓼 𝓱𝓸𝓻𝓻𝓲𝓫𝓵𝓮✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:49:37Z","userName":"tiktok💖😘","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to learn more abt the whole trump 2020 thing. after it downloaded and it took a whole WEEK to download i opened it and it showed all of trumps racist, sexists, homophobic, and other horrible tweets. I don’t understand why he would put those up on his app supporting him cause that would just make people not like him. I also dislike this app because i am a female and part of the lgbtq+ which is two things trump disrespects and dislikes as i read from his tweets. I am deleting this app and giving it a one star rating and if i could u would give it 0 stars😘."}}]}
