He hates anyone that disagrees with them and instead of speaking with them, he either fires them and then humiliated them publicly just to make his supporters believe he is any better. He also uses nazi signs and is a devoted follower of hitler’s ideologies. Vote for him and you’ll regret it.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6150346009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🌞🌞🌞🌝🌝🌝🌚🌚🌚","date":"2020-07-03T01:11:50Z","title":"This app is not what I expected😖","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support our beloved cheeto, but when I opened the app by cat started twerking violently🦗🦟😔🖤 then, the weirdest thing happened 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨ my sister walked in and stood in my doorway staring at me 💫 and I looked and her 👽 and she looked at me🗿👻 and my cat was still twerking🦗🦟🦗🦟 and then my house started to shake🏡 and I quickly deleted the app and everything went back to normal 😌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6148483451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"valor22234","date":"2020-07-02T13:43:50Z","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"review":"Good Lordy where do I start😍. The app is terrible. It has all colors like red white and blue when they should be black yellow and white. It also asked me for my personal information? No thanks mr. president I know I’m cute and you want to text me and stuff but cmon. The Trump campaign is something to be laughed at and if you support Trump you are a delusional human being who doesn’t recognize the world needs CHANGE!!

But there is no diversity on this app only just a bunch of black people, like where is the white people at. I am sure this is just a bug and will be fixed but what in the world.

Why would you EVER give a sexist, pedophilic, racist, homophobic, transphobic orange Cheeto, excuse for a person -let alone a president- an app?? His supporters should download, or buy the book, “politics for dummies” if they need to congregate collectively to share their one brain cell. Ah haha if you actually enjoy listening to a virus talk just listen to hitler💓😇😛🥵🤷\u200D♂️🥺🤭 pretty much the same person.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6109903580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GodessRising","date":"2020-06-22T22:29:49Z","title":"Perfectly acceptable","rating":5,"review":"Don’t believe the bad reviews written by Trolls and haters.
