Uh NO I DONT! What kind of question is that? Then it asked me for my phone number and I don’t have one. Anyways I tried to order some food from Panera because in the App Store the description says you can order food and receive it in 5 minutes for free. FALSE! I was really trying to find a reason to keep this app but I can’t find one. This app is trash! How am I supposed to take my refrigerator on a walk to the zoo if I can’t have my Panera 😢? I am so disappointed!","rating":1,"title":"Lster 🙈💗😝😜❤️😋","date":"2020-07-08T16:09:29Z","userName":"beetle juice 🤡👹😍😘"}},{"id":"6172813297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to suppory my president. My Iphone started to not work. My screen froze, I could not charge my phone, and the speakers stopped working. Mind you, I have a brand new Iphone 11 which should have no such difficulties.

After much testing at the Apple Store, I was informed that my Iphone had a virus caused by this app. I had to purchase a brand new phone after just a few months of having my “old” one!!!!

When I downloaded it my dog started barking at some ghost, then the ghost just took my dog and ate it. My whole family was traumatized with what they just saw, but that wasn’t the end of it. My other dog got so scared that he bit all my family members then ran in front of a car and killed himself. I’m missing a leg now and my family is horribly injured. But just when I thought it was the end of all this madness, birds came and started pecking our eyes out. This is a horrible app and I do not recommend it at all. I am now missing a leg, eye, and need years of therapy.        😔✌️","rating":1,"title":"❤️✨✨Horrible✨✨❤️","date":"2020-07-08T14:55:12Z","userName":"person missing leg and eye"}},{"id":"6172349413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app the help convince my pet caterpillar why he should support trump, but in the end, that’s what killed him 😔😭. His name was fluffy, he was two inches long, and very obese.  One day, I went to his cage to show him the trump app, but first it said that it used my location CONSTANTLY, but that’s ok. I then tried to get the app to work but before it did my caterpillar started screaming! I had no idea what to do! At this point on trump was on the screen, standing there, orange as ever. My dear Fluffy passed away, the doctors told me that he went into shock from being too scared. Now I’m voting for Anonymous for president 🥵.

After downloading it I soon realized it was the Cheeto’s app. I got extremely offended and scared due to the fact that I’m lactose intolerant and the fact the Cheeto puff was deformed and disgusting looking. (I’m also on a diet. Trying to have a hot girl summer) I immediately went to my psychiatrist to see if there was any damage to my metal help. After having an evaluation they deemed that I have extreme trauma and a crippling fear of Orange monsters who stands like they have dementia. Moral of the story is DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU DONT WANT TO SUFFER FROM EXTREME PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

When I saw the man on the screen everything started to get blurry. It was strange since I had 20/20 vision before this. I waited a few days thinking it would go away but never did. I stated to get very scared and went to an eye doctor. I told my doctor the following events and she concluded, by seeing the big orangutan on my screen I went legally blind. I now deleted this app and have to wear glasses to see anything. Remember if you want to download this app, you will have something bad happen.
