This app was horrible and kept crashing and deleted all the apps on my phone. It also caused my close family to secretly hate me and debate a smarter debate with me and dinner and now i can only agree with that one grandpa no one likes. i am giving this app a one star rating and am very sad i too have not become and orange.","title":"life ruining","userName":"agsfv","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177127293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:19:29Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see Donald J. Trumps plans for the United States of America. After I downloaded the app it crashed 4 times.( no surprise there). After the app finally loaded and once I opened it there was a orange clown. At first I thought this was a glitch but it turned out to be the President! The app is also really slow and does not work efficiently. This app is useless, senseless, waste of space, impractical, etc, just like our President.","title":"Trash","userName":"6373737738:8:8;7","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177116619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:16:34Z","review":"I opened the app and the whole set up was very strange. It was hard to locate any of the news, it was all just random pictures of troll dolls. The troll dolls were pursuing horrifying acts. My child accessed the phone and started screaming in horror from one of the troll dolls. This app is a danger to children. When I did find any of the news half of it was in a different language.  Not to mention the pop up adds are terrible.","title":"Concerned citizen","userName":"123morgan78910","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177049208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:57:58Z","review":"I open the app and I was greeted by a horrible looking wacky man!! My eyes couldn’t bear it. WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO PUT MONSTROSITY ON THE APP. I feel bad for the pig species 😔. Anyways I open the app and it was just horrible, their music taste is just- DISGUSTING they should have done a better job. But I guess everyone has to deal with it am I right. Also I don’t want this creature to have my phone number. Gosh who asks the first tile they meet. Anyways I say 1/5 stars because ya know physics 🤷🏻\u200D♀️.","title":"I AM TRAUMATIZED","userName":"tinkywinker","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177048104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:57:40Z","review":"The app has spam callers calling my phone all asking me questions to support/donate money to the police department. The calls won’t stop and it’s getting very irritating. The app also caused my phone to have glitches and took over a week to download. No other app has done this. I thought it was because a low storage reasons, that was not it. I strongly suggest not getting it. Messes up your entire phone.","title":"unt uh😤🧚🏽\u200D♀️","userName":"jordayqueen","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177032046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:53:18Z","review":"I was very excited to see that our ✨great✨ president had an app on the appstore! Naturally, I downloaded this app. Worked fine for the first couple days but then it started to get super buggy and it made my phone crash :(. I thought it was just a one time thing but the app kept crashing. This is sad to see our president have such a low quality app and I am extremely disappointed.","title":"Awful App","userName":"Percyspanda4321","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176959111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:33:38Z","review":"this app 💞 feels kinda off🗓 I feel like it has 🔑 all of my information now🏖 it really should be deleted immediately because idk who would support the worst person in the world. This app literally made my fish die and my dog throw up from looking at it. Since downloading it I’ve gotten hit by a bus, ran over by a car, hit by a golf cart, kicked by a horse and fell of a plane. 10/10 do NOT recommend this app to anyone❤️","title":"no ❤️","userName":"trumpisfromhell","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176944620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:29:47Z","review":"There I was. Trying to support our amazing ✨orange✨ of a president. I opened the app. I saw the 🥰BIGGEST🥰🙀CRUSTY🙀🥵DUSTY🥵 🤢CHEETO🤢 MY EYES HAVE EVER SEEN. it made me extremely sick. I chucked my phone out the window. My dog (aka my bf) went chasing after it. I said “Wait! Baby don’t look!!! ✨🙀🥺” but it was too late. His sexy eyes have laid on the 🥰BIGGEST🥰🙀CRUSTY🙀🥵DUSTY🥵 🤢CHEETO🤢. he let out a sexy howl “awooooo 😻” even though he was in pain, still extremely sexy. that 🥰BIG🥰🙀CRUSTY🙀🥵DUSTY🥵 🤢CHEETO🤢 gave him Coonchie Roaches. -4/10. Do not vote trump.","title":"This App Gave My Dog Coonchie Roaches","userName":"jinxisplat","isEdited":false}}]}
