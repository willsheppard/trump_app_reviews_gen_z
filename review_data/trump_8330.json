The app does many things that are actually only harmful to the app in general, and has many bad ideas that are quite offensive to the rest of the apps on my phone. I do not appreciate the wall it is trying to put up around it’s storage as it is way too much! Or it’s reactionary responses to terrible things that are happening in the app such as evident virus it has! In all, please try again once the videos have graduated kindergarten.","userName":"DONTTOUCHGENZ$$"}},{"id":"6176136866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"App review","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:46:02Z","rating":1,"review":"I rated this app 1 star because it was created by a vulgar, racist, sexist, homophobic, narcissistic, disgusting excuse for a man who is extremely under qualified and should never have been president. At this point it is not a political matter but rather a humanitarian one. He is a blatant molester, and has worked towards passing bills that are racist and homophobic. He has no morals and should be impeached, and never let into office again. There cannot be a dispute because I am only stating facts. If you disagree, go enlighten yourself. Thank you 😌","userName":"sunny.west"}},{"id":"6175995252","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:00:48Z","rating":1,"review":"So this is an honest review. Apart from Trump being a horrible president, he also had the audacity to make a horrible app. This app hacked my phone and now I am literally so mad. It takes all of your data and shares your stuff. With who you may ask. Well with the government of course. I can no believe that this happened to me. I am not trying to be funny, I am literally crying. Do not get this app. Delete it IMMEDIATELY. You do NOT want the same thing to happen to you. Hope you have a good quarantine. <3","userName":"trumps orange dye"}},{"id":"6175781415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"How and What Data is Trump Campaign Using","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:49:40Z","rating":1,"review":"This app used every piece of data on your phone. Including, where you have been, the people you communicate with, the purchases you make, etc. It tracks every single piece of data on your phone and uses it so Trump 2020 Campaign can persuade you into voting for him. Exactly like what the Trump 2016 campaign did with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. To Trump you’re just a pawn in his grand scheme. Don’t use the app and don’t fall for his propaganda. Do your research and make an educated Vote.","userName":"@michaelhulen2"}},{"id":"6175695296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"STOLE MY MONEY","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:20:11Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to support President Trump. When I first joined, it asked for the usual information. As I used the app more, it kept asking over and over for my credit card information. I finally decided to give it, because President Trump wouldn’t do anything with it right? Wrong. A week later, I check my bank account and about $2500 is missing. This has to be this app, because it is was the only thing I have given my card info too. anyways chile biden 2020","userName":"Adeline314"}},{"id":"6175666506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app don’t download","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:10:24Z","rating":1,"review":"I rated this star a 1 because it made my phone glitch it made me so maddd😡why does this 🍊even have an app anyway back to the bad review ok so obviously I deleted it but right when I deleted the app a bunch of GIANT Cheeto Puffs and Oranges started attacking me and my fam but luckily I took karate when I was smaller and beat all of the Cheetos and Oranges so don’t download this App unless you want to be attacked by a bunch of Oranges and Cheetos attacking you this app is awful my device isn’t the same anymore","userName":"Stitch180"}},{"id":"6175629331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app scared my my pet caterpillar","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:57:06Z","rating":1,"review":"I was on TikTok bc it’s the best app out there and if it gets taken down I will have a mental break down but also my caterpillar was just chilling and all of a sudden I went off TikTok and on to this app and when I opened the app it  blew up my caterpillar I dont know if that’s just a small glitch in this app but it made  me cry for 2 weeks and I am so so so mad any this app is trash \n\nRip caterpillar you were taken to soon I will dance with you again when we meet again","userName":"super cool emily"}},{"id":"6175605126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Utterly disgusting🤮such a disappointment","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:48:20Z","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app bc I totally support our very hot president but when I opened it it started lagging really bad. It affected my phone and it started to not work so I was like wth. Next thing you know I got a virus warning and it said I was hacked by this app and all my personal info was stolen. It’s such a pain in my heart because trump is doing ✨great things✨for this country but this app should definitely be removed because of the horrible quality. \n0/5 DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!","userName":"HotCheeto Supporter🤡"}},{"id":"6175587701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i had really high hopes for this 😔","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:41:58Z","rating":1,"review":"i know so many people are so excited to get this app and see all the wonderful, smart, educated things trump has said. but when i opened the app my phone started glitching like crazy almost immediately. i could barely use it without it freaking out. throughout the whole night i would wake up and check the time and all i’d see was a disgusting photo of an orange looking man 😔 i was absolutely terrified. then the next few days i’d hear the mans disgusting voice coming from god knows where in my house and i would find orange peels in my kitchen floor covering all the tile. it all stopped when i deleted the app.  the only thing i think wouldve stopped it would be changing the name to bernie but i guess it’s a little too late for that :(","userName":"nicki minaj 🥵"}},{"id":"6175565915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"almost puked","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:33:53Z","rating":1,"review":"the moment i opened the app i started gagging so hard i couldn’t breathe. for some reason trumps face made me want to vomit everywhere. then suddenly the app stopped working and i stopped gagging. it was a ✨miracle✨. i tried to get it working again but when i opened the app my glass shattered at the sight of the words “make america great again.” so i literally had to get a new phone. when i got the new phone i went to download the app again but it started glitching and somehow replaced trumps face with an orange. it was actually quite hard to tell the difference, so naturally i rebooted my phone and went back to the app, but once i opened the app i went blind at the sight of the words “trump 2020” so now my mother is having to write this review for me. 10/10 do not recommend.","userName":"emmaliyah101"}}]}
