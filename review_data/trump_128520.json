Not that I’m complaining but as soon as I got to the United Kingdom thats when tragedy struck. I was in the future and he was still president! Why first thought was how did this happen?!? I then flew back to America on my pet ostrich to figure out how this happened.  And what I saw was awful.. if you want to know the rest my YouTube is in my bio.

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal: bodeboop. A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound: ding.Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word “start”. On your mark... Get Ready..
