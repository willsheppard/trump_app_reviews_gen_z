It’s a danger to your phone especially with the new IOS. The amount of space it takes is honestly discouraging! How can this be taking 5.3 GB! Get out of here!

But out of nowhere the presidents 🍤 appeared on the screen. I had to run and grad some bleach to wash that image out of my head. Just like Trump wanted us to inject ourselves with in the 1st place. Now I would like the trump administration to pay my medics bill for new eyes!!!😓😓😓","userName":"mariacarmenvs","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:35:43Z","title":"This stinks!"}},{"id":"6178313176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I could give this app less than 1 star but sadly I cannot.
