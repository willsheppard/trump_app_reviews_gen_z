The moment I opened it up I was asked to sign in, but was too disgusted bc there was a pic of some orange man on the screen🥵🤡🤬. I’m scarred and wouldn’t recommend this app to ANYONE.

All I found was RACISM AND BIGOTRY. Trump and his dirty friend Jeff Bezos are hoarding all of the Cheetos. I should have known something like this would happen; after all worms eat into the American brain (they have a brain?) and the holes left behind are filled with capitalist propaganda.

I never thought in my 309 years of living that I could go through such traumatic events that I experienced THE SECOND I opened this app. When i opened it, i was greeted by the numerous screams and yells of those suffering in hell. I however ignored it. Then the app kept shocking me. I always knew donald had a hatred for anyone who’s not a white, straight, christian, cis male no wonder he wanted to hurt me😾😾 \n\n— Yours truly, \n                       Abraham Lincoln","title":"the absolute worst","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":".-abraham l.-"}},{"id":"6174058630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:10:23Z","review":"I have NO good words to say about this app. Not even minutes after downloading, household items started to catch on fire around me. You might as well burn your entire house down if you want to get this app! My bed is absolutely fried, my carpet is toasted, and my clothes are burnt to a crisp. If I wanted a home re model, I would’ve downloaded an interior design app instead of this bs!!! I do NOT recommend whatsoever.","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"chloe chalmont"}}]}
