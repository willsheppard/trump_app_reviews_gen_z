Who is Bonald bump ? Idk. And about the voting in 2020, if ur gonna vote for trump, no ur not ❤️. I didn’t know that it was possible for something so horrendous and ugly to be in the form of an app. When I opened the app I was so frightened, Jesus I almost threw up ✨. Anyways the app is so dysfunctional it almost made me believe that trump is a rapist, racist, ugly, sexist, and narcissistic, oh wait; I already knew that. Chile anyways, let’s talk about how Donald trump will go down as the worst president of the United States ❤️ this all feels like a fever dream honestly, if u like Donald bump in any way, just know that the energy that u give out is what u receive ✨ don’t be shy send Donald trump to jail, he deserves it & more 🙈 aye but fr this app is not good at all, who came up with this idea they should be fired 💩 if I had one thing to say about this app it would be FDT. OH YEA btw DONT build that wall, BLM & Stan the lgbtq+  if you want to go to heaven 🥰 a little side note, WE ARE THE IMMIGRANTS, Christopher Columbus didn’t “find” new land, he stole it from the native Americans. I luv how most republicans act like they’re discombobulated in the head. How about we read a little more & expand our mind ? Yea ❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6175109279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:42:13Z","userName":"kakdjdndndn","title":"🧎🏻🏌🏼","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6175107114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:30Z","userName":"sam_thepig","title":"HORRIBLE APP👺","review":"i’m so mad right now. i came to see sexy photos of him and saw that i had to put in my stuff. next thing i know the FBI is knocking on my door. they come through my house and take all my stuff they even took my dog! told them to stop but they didn’t listen.the only way i got them out and my stuff back was playing girl in red. they also burned my pride flag which is just stupid. trump isn’t making it great. i hate him! taking away my vote.","rating":1}},{"id":"6175105769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:03Z","userName":"poopoopeepeepresident","title":"chile lemme colonize real quick 💅","review":"I🙋\u200D♀️climbed⛰out🚷of🤔my🤩head🤯and➕watched👁myself😽imploed💥a🤭though💭without🚫a🅰️body🧍\u200D♀️oughta‼️be🐝the⭕️shot🎯to🌝take👨🏻\u200D🦳a🗣load👀off🚬my🤡brain🧠is✔️poisoned🦠and✅im🚼searching🔍for🔎the💕antidote☯️but🤕every🙄time🕐i🌈find🌐it❇️my😬defenses💂\u200D♀️scream😫oh♉️no❌you👉dont🤬wOaH👹","rating":1}},{"id":"6175104382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:40:37Z","userName":"lpayne612","title":"This app gave me a VIRUS","review":"xuě huā piāo piāo běi fēng xiāo xiāo","rating":1}},{"id":"6175103887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:40:29Z","userName":"yeetmaster365","title":"Uh oh stinky","review":"When I open the app, my room instantly smells like rotting piss🤢 please help 👏🏼","rating":1}},{"id":"6175102315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:39:57Z","userName":"genZ🥰","title":"human🌈🧚\u200D♀️✨✨garbage","review":"this🧚\u200D♀️✨app🌈🧚\u200D♀️✨made😘🌈my🐍🐍🌈eyes👁👄👁bleed😻😽🤡🤡","rating":1}},{"id":"6175100608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:39:23Z","userName":"The \"mow\"st awesome person!!","title":"HORRIBLE.","review":"I got this app to get notifications and information on rallies, but it provided a virus instead. My phone glitches and opens apps on its own, (i.e safari to go to change.org and sign petitions) and even after deleting it and redownloading multiple times, resetting my phone, and trying other methods to get my phone to work, the virus is STILL on my phone. Currently, my keyboard is typing random words and I have to keep on deleting them and rewriting in order to write this review properly. It keeps on typing Justice for Elijah Mcclain, Breonna Taylor, Dominque Alexander, Robert Fuller, Brayla Stone, Merci Mack, etc. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone. This is a disgusting and vile app. Not to mention the fact that the image on the home page could be offensive. My sibling saw the image of Cheeto I mean Trump and regurgitated (I joined her). Anyways, I wish I could give this app 0 stars. Don’t recommend.","rating":1}},{"id":"6175097983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:38:31Z","userName":"homo girl of genz","title":"disappointed","review":"i downloaded this app to support our /amazing/ cheeto puff that we have in office, but this app is actual garbage. It gives me 1000000000000 notifications every second, which i could be spending with my ~lesbian lover~ the app constantly asks permission to access my messages and keeps sending my mom death threats because she’s an immigrant. Not to mention that the app itself is extremely confusing. I keep getting pop ups saying some gibberish “all lives matter”? i’m pretty sure that’s it but idk like i said it’s gibberish. the app cover is absolutely disgusting and not appealing to the eye and throws off my immaculate vibes. it also leaked my information to the US government and they ended up getting my LESBIAN sex tape with my ultra mega hot goth gf. The only good thing this app has done is get the karen across the street to give me free iced coffee every morning to fuel my raging homosexuality. Anyway this app is horrible and i suggest it be removed from the app store.","rating":1}}]}
