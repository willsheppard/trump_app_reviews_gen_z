Get your info from elsewhere that actually gives you info from both sides and not just propaganda with loads of childish name-calling.","title":"Hard to navigate, incredibly biased news","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:07:05Z"}},{"id":"6178023515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"greanbean42","review":"This app is the worst thing to ever happen to the App Store when I first opened it I saw something that was completely repulsive I cannot believe people can download this disgusting and absolutely horrible app. I cannot believe this app was in my suggested.

The events tab is nice for keeping you updated on all of trumps newest rallies and maybe i will help get the stands full again to make up for the embarrassment of the tulsa rally!","title":"Confused?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:32:15Z"}},{"id":"6177950452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cheeto🧚lover💗38","review":"I tried to download this app to support my fav cheeto 😍😍 I was so excited to hop on the white supremacy trend🤩🐵 but as soon as i opened it it crashed 🤮 i uninstalled 💅 and downloaded it again💃🧜 but the same thing happened!

I feel as if I cannot wake up, get some cereal, and have a glass of apple juice in the morning without fearing for my life as if someone was watching me, waiting for me to make one little mistake.
