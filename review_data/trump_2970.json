The app took days to download, as well as had information about my grandfathers affair he had in 1970. My grandmother was so upset with him she filed for divorce after 57 years of marriage. Following their divorce, he ended up homeless, his children and grandchildren wouldn't talk to him for weeks, he had no one to turn too, he was fired from his job and had to ask for money on the streets. One day, when he was sleeping in an alley he was shot by gang members. He wasn't found till hours later and was taken to the hospital. My grandmother was heartbroken. He died in her arms that night.\nRest In Peace Grandpa Jo. DO NOT VOTE TRUMP.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD. For grandpa jo.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"killed my grandfather! do not download! 💔🙄"}},{"id":"6173851858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kay01334556","date":"2020-07-08T21:53:07Z","review":"Hi buddy sorry bud I’m gonna was your birthday dinner with you guys and then we had to a birthday dinner and then I got a little girl so sorry to miss y’all but I’m gonna is the way I can see y’all tomorrow I gotta was the time I got it bruh bruh is sooo much like a crazy girl I gotta know that I love y’all and so I love y’all and you are y’all and you were so much fun I wanna talk about to me you and you are y’all I wanna know that I was just chillin was a nice day I love y’all so I love you too much and thank y’all y’all love you so sweet girl and thank y’all y’all for dinner and thank y’all for the nice help and thank y’all for the nice help and thank y’all for all the nice hugs. \n\nI just pressed the middle button.

I thought that’s a weird coincidence. But then!!! I was minding my own business in the hospital and a flaying day snatched my weave. Now I thought this is getting a little spooky. So I closed the app then I opened it and it was a phone call from the president himself saying that if I don’t turn orange then I will be hunted down. So I ran for my life back to my house to find it burnt down with a orange sitting on the doorstep. I deleted the app hoping it would go away but it never stopped. I have been hiding from the orange community for 3 years now and I haven’t gotten a break. It’s really bad for my skin!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I got head lice from this app"}},{"id":"6173685036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👄👁😡","date":"2020-07-08T20:50:46Z","review":"This app took forever to download and when it finally finished it took my phone from 100% to 69% in a blink of an eye like my jeepers anyways I keep trying to read the news and this 🍊 keeps popping up on my screen and scaring the living 💩 out of me and it’s giving me nightmares. Also I just wanted to add that once I downloaded it I noticed that these people in black suits were following me around so I asked them if they wanted something and they proceeded to deathly tickle me. I was literally on the side of the road getting viciously tickled by a 6’7 300lb guy and after that they stole my car and my favorite mask 😷 and so now I am walking home writing this review horrible and no ones gonna help me wow some world we live in😭😤","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app"}},{"id":"6173594514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DoubleDeckerBiscut","date":"2020-07-08T20:18:25Z","review":"okay so first off ☝️ I wanted to download this app because of the AMAZING reviews left by my fellow Badtannedmancheetopuffbunkerboypresident supporters ✨🌝 but when I tried to download the app it took a very long time that instead of being a middle aged white racist Karen, I’m a middle aged white racist Karen 🥰.... Anywhoooo on to the review ( <<bars right there 🔥 ) when it finally downloaded it kept asking if I wanted to join a cult and of course I clicked yes (cause why not yktv 🤟😝✨🎶🦿💥👀🧚🧜\u200D♀️ 🤪) but then after I clicked yes a deranged orange peel looking monster popped up on my screen and summoned these small vile creatures that kept chanting “cheetoman 2020, cheetoman 2020” and when I tell you I was terrified, I- i was in tears almost 💧👄💧.....and it had a white refrigerator?!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i was in tears almost 💧👄💧"}},{"id":"6173555311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"OOS666666","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:56Z","review":"Not only did downloading the app take forever but it made my phone glitch. Once I finally opened the app I saw the most ugly orange thing, I definitely needed to bleach my eyes after but even that wasn’t enough so I pulled my eyes out of my eye socket. Before that I had to take a survey that asked the most inappropriate questions such as if I was a child and if I was interested in sending photos! Absolutely disgusting! But then the most horrifying thing happened the app started playing this awful sound that bought rats, spiders, and bats into my house and they started to attack me and my dog. My dog ended up being killed and sacrificed to this orange thing named trump. Now I’m all scratched up and blind. Never using this app again!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever!!!!"}},{"id":"6173521208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ashlinm2020","date":"2020-07-08T19:53:18Z","review":"this is literally the worst possible app and it makes me so mad it took over 3 hours to download and then it glitched for a straight 45 mins. like honestly it couldnt get worse BUT IT CAN, then it played something very inappropriate and my kids heard no wonder it age restricted and needs to be 17 year and older honestly ifs a disgrace and Apple i hope you do something about this because this, this is outragious i am so outraged i now have a hole in my wall, it is so annoying more annoying then elmo singing sesame street over and over and over acrually more annoying then a parrot saying cracker like a broken record on repeat. I want this app off of here this second as tou can see NO ONE LIKES IT. it literally has like a 1.5 rating.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"⚠️ DO NOT DOWNLOAD ⚠️"}},{"id":"6173446329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"evalynsnowglobe","date":"2020-07-08T19:27:38Z","review":"this app was such a sad sight to see! i was so excited to download it so i could keep up with trumps news, but turns out this app is the worst thing ever made. at the beginning, it asks for your phone number, so horrid!! why would they need it? isn’t that a breech of safety policy?? ugh. so upsetting. THEN after i gave my phone number i got huge amounts of spam phone calls, texts and more!! what kinda app does that :( on top of that it was extremely glitchy, made my entire phone freak out!! half the time when i went on the app it would just start glitching in and out so bad i couldn’t use my phone for an hour. not fair to the American people who just wanna support their president! fix this!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible, disappointing, unworthy."}},{"id":"6173442937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anjdurbehe","date":"2020-07-08T19:26:28Z","review":"This app is the definition of the worst app ever. I had to download it about 5 times for me to actually sign in and work through the app. Once i put in my email for the account it said I was “underage” even though I’m 18 years of age. So i had to use a completely different email in order to make an account. I finally made an account, I was browsing through the app when it froze for about 10 seconds and then it exited me out of the app. I tried going back the on app but every time i signed in and started browsing, it did the exact same thing. So in conclusion i don’t recommend this app at all, it’s not developed correctly and from what I’ve heard it has false information. 0/10 recommend.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6173157711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vote blue pls","date":"2020-07-08T17:51:02Z","review":"So I just heard abt this app today and I was omg I need to see what it’s all abt!!! Turns out is was just a racist orange :/ I was so excited Bc there had to be so many possibilities on this app, I wanted to expand my mind. But I actually ended up on the ignorant people app :( I went on the app and it was like enter mobile phone number and idk that was a little too personal for me. I mean like what if trump called me or something, I can’t have that in my recents- that’s SO embarrassing. Anyways it would be so dishonest of me to leave a good review when it is literally impossible too. My fingers will only let me type abt how ridiculous this is. This app has let me down and has really affected my life. I don’t think I will ever be the same again.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"acab <3"}}]}
