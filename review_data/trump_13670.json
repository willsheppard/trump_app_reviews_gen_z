Once I opened it it had me put in a bunch of information such as email and phone number. Suddenly I was flooded by an on going string of emails and texts. It was so frustrating. Then the app kept crashing when I tried to use it. Think twice before downloading this app if you want to save yourself from the constant gross notifications.  🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"Evvvvvv Leigh","date":"2020-07-08T23:14:32Z"}},{"id":"6174059314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my life","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Once I downloaded this app my skin turned to a dark Cheeto orange like I had been bathing in hot Cheeto water for three days straight got a tan that lasted 36 hours strait and I started sweating profusely, I was sweating so much and I was so ugly I was cast out of my home and I was sent to jail because nobody in this world should be so ugly, on my way to jail I was laughed at by children and I maid all of the inmates cry.

GIVES YOU VIRUS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I OPENED THE APP AND THERE WAS 2 LINK. ONE LEAD TO CHILD PORNOGRAPHY ANDTHE OTHER went directly to a website where you can donate money to kill all women and hunt homosexuals. It was insane. Then they asked me where I lived so I gave my address but they CAME TO MY HOUSE AND broke done my door. They grabbed my baby and boiled her in front of me because I didn’t claim my free yard sign that WASNT free I had to donate 20 dollars. They then imprissoned me and sold my wife to the neonatzis. I would NOT RECOMEND THIS. Oh and they cooked my dog alive and ate him","userName":"just a tid bit for ya","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:35Z"}},{"id":"6174006273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Typical","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First thing this app wants from me as soon as I opened it is my phone number. Very rude umm you haven’t even asked me what my name is yet? Next thing I know it’s asking me for my snap and location, which I gave it only because I was bored and planned on ghosting it later. I get a snap at 1am that says “you up?” and then it sends me the saddest looking dick pic I’ve ever seen in my life. Needless to say... BLOCKED. I just want an app that wants to get to know me first!!","userName":"wtfidk2020","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:37Z"}},{"id":"6173922692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gave me TRAUMA","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this because I wanted to know who the strange orange man is who is apparently our president.

Where do I begin. This is the worst app on the market, which kinda makes sense considering who it’s about. But anyways I would only get this app if you are a white supremacist, racist, say that “all lives matter” but are okay with children in cages, believe that women have no rights to their body, or don’t want to wear a mask because it “violates your freedom”. If you still think you should download this app, please re-evaluate your morals!! Have a good day!","userName":"krista456","date":"2020-07-08T21:58:39Z"}},{"id":"6173838898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My Rating","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app about a month ago and i’ve been having nothing but complications with it. it always tells me to pay a fee to the Apple Store JUST so i can access it. it has only caused my family and i stress and has caused me to nearly go broke by having to pay fees!! i thought this app was free. genuinely disappointed on the way this app was set up, and i do not recommend downloading it.","userName":"karen connors","date":"2020-07-08T21:48:10Z"}},{"id":"6173823106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dixie","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Sometimes I don't wanna be happy\nDon't hold it against me\nIf I'm down just leave me there\nLet me be sad\nSun's up, I already wanna lay down\nFriends calling, are you really tryna go out?

The only thing I could look at on this app was oranges. I was very terrified and it traumatized my 3 year old cousin. I would give this app 0 stars but the minimum is 1. The apple store needs to delete this app immediately. Also this app gives terrible and false information. This app makes me lose brain cells.
