I wanted to do something special for him, because he respects everyone. When I downloaded the app it asked for my number. I’m a HUGE Trump supporter, so I put it in. It asked other information, and I dumbly put it in. Might I add, it was very glitchy, and very hard to navigate through the app. Plus, there were lots of grammatical errors. I know Trump is very educated, and wouldn’t promote grammatically incorrect apps. Anyway, it was 3 am in the morning, when I started getting calls, and messages. “Who can these be from?” I thought. I accepted a call, and a man said in a raspy voice “Hello, I’m a Trumpie like you, I can come to your house so we can work on Trump 2020 signs?” I then heard a knock at the door. It was the same guy, AT MY HOUSE! I told him to get out of my property, and I’ll call the police. He said “But dearie, we have to work on our signs!” “I love Trump, but it’s 3 am, and I drank a lot of bleach yesterday.” I said trying to convince him. He finally left, so I decided to read the messages. They read, “Trump; the world greatest president may drop out of the election.” I was devastated! To make it worse, the next day someone left me a voicemail, it said “Hey, so I saw you’re on that Trump 2020 app. So, I’ll egg your house, and put Biden 2020 signs everywhere. This made my blood boil, Trump is great! Unfortunately, I had no choice but to delete the app. It’s been about a week since I deleted it, yet I still get all these calls and messages from fellow Trumpies. Absolutely disgusting, I expected better service..","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"SPAMS INBOX DON’T DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6145677626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"annabannanaamaka","date":"2020-07-01T20:47:12Z","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.
