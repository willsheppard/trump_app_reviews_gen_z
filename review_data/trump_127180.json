I was terrified so I ran to the nearest house apart from mine which was about 6 miles away while I was running my phone started talking to me, the phone was saying that she was once a costumer of this app and trump and the government trapped  her inside the woman then reached out her poop covered hand and wiped it on my face. When I whipped the poop off of my face I went to take a picture of me to see if the poop was still there and for some reason there was a permanent tattoo of trumps small peen on my face.  When I finally made my way down town to the nearest house it had been burnt down and covered in gasoline. I had nowhere to go but my haunted house while I was walking to my house my legs began to turn to jelly, I fell straight on my face and broke my nose, as i laid on the ground I saw a person walking closer and closer, the body of this figure kept getting rounder and rounder until......... president trump ran up to me NAKED and started jumping around me while chanting “me 2020 me 2020” as I laid on the ground jelly legs a nose hanging off of my face I realized that I was going to die but silly ol me forgot that i had the trump app on it so I got out me app and started calling random phone numbers, because I noticed that the app gives out everybody’s phone numbers. the person that answered was nearby so they could come and take me to the hospital, turns out it was the government, I am now locked in a room full of knifes so if I move an inch I will be inserted by 1,000 knifes at once wish me luck I’m now un downloading this terrible app that has got me locked up in a room full of knifes. Please if you don’t want to end up in a room full of knifes I recommend not downloading this app.","userName":"mimi..bear","title":"this app is fart nuggies🌝"}},{"id":"6177893393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:09:12Z","review":"I downloaded this app thinking I could help America with various problems. BOY WAS I WRONG! One the asked for my phone number. You know what I get enough spam all ready. After signing up it glitched out and all I saw was a Cheeto puff. This Cheeto was the face of America. I was sooo disappointed and disgusted. The only reason I download it TO HELP AMERICA not too see the ugly face of our president. Oml I wish I can give this app 0 star review. Just a little message to DONALD DUMP you are a terrible person. The issue with you is you don’t believe in global warming, your racist, you don’t focus on bigger things like food safety, your sexist, and homophobic. I’ve been having this app for a while now and I’ve been getting spam.You know what ANY FUNCTION HUMAN BEING FOR 2020! Fun fact you had 5 casinos and hotels you got bankrupt. How dumb could someone be to run for president even though they can’t keep a business open? Those 62,984,825 people who voted for you are super dumb like you. 😡😡🤬","userName":"Nataline 🦄","title":"Worst app EVER!!!😡"}},{"id":"6177892593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:57Z","review":"He raped my friend & he broke my window & didn’t do nothing, STOP DOING DUMP SH!T 😐.","userName":"kaylee_kayy","title":"F🌚ck trump"}},{"id":"6177891720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:40Z","review":"such a bad app if i’m being honest\nit just lags so much and i noticed with in a week of using this app the color of my skin started to turn orange i was very scared and didn’t know what to do two weeks in and the size of my pee pee was shrinking enormously almost to the microscopic size of the orangitan himself 😱😱😱 i doom figured out the issue was this app i soon deleted and all things were well\nxoxoxox \ntrumps biggest hater 💘","userName":"fbhgggggby","title":"absolutely sh$t💓🤪💞😭😄😻😻😱"}},{"id":"6177891680","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:39Z","review":"I got this app so I can be educated on and support our ✨cheetoh dust tan ✨ president.\nThis app took a few hours to download and it started to give me some anxiety because I thought the app was trying to gather all of my information from my phone and send it to the dark web. 🤭😟😱 after a day of having this app I noticed that my skin color was slowly turning more orange 🍊that’s when I started hearing weird voices telling me racist jokes and homophobic things in my ear. 😨 It was then when I realized it was the app so when I went to open the app my wallpaper was a picture of one of mr. orange presidents n00ds 😱😱 (Now I have ptsd) and when I opened the app i saw a picture of no neck Ed but orange 😭 I deleted the app and slowly things went back to normal and I haven’t recovered full because I’m still traumatized by what I’ve seen.

I opened it up and it said “Welcome Ugly A** b*tch!” This is very disappointing and disrespectful! Also, just so everyone should know Donald J. (Joe Mama) Trump, is literally an orange. His head is even the shape of one. Please do not download this is app. Literally the worst app i’ve EVER downloaded. If you want to spare your confidence do NOT download this app. This app can sense if you do not support trump and it will insult you. Also don’t vote for trump 😻😻","userName":"whoopwhoopfamily","title":"if i could give this app 0 stars i would."}},{"id":"6177890466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:15Z","review":"Yeah yeah yeah yeah\nI'm yours, you were mine 세계의 비밀\n마법 같던 영원의 그 약속\n별빛 아래 꽃피운 둘만의 scintilla\nNow see them burn in fire\n폐허가 된 여기 재가 된 memories\nTogether together, woo whoa\nWe forever forever, you know\n약속했던 둘만의 something something\n불꽃 속에서 넌 등을 돌리지\n무너진 모래성, who's a liar\n세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire\n안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리\n또 홀로 남겨지는 나\n\"구해줘\"\nCan't you see me?\n마법의 그날처럼 say \"believe me\"\n불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me\nOh can't you see me?\nMy friends don't understand me, no\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me anymore more\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me anymore more\n원망해, 널 참 많이\n'Cause you don't understand me\n원망이 멈추게 please\n내 손을 잡아줘, 다시\nTogether together, whoa\nWe forever forever, you know\n꿈속에서 사라진 something something\n남겨진 섬, 잊혀진 그 멜로디\n무너진 모래성, who's a liar\n세계의 끝에서 춤추는 fire\n안 들리니? 널 찾는 내 목소리\n또 홀로 남겨지는 나\n\"구해줘\"\nCan't you see me?\n마법의 그날처럼 say \"believe me\"\n불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me\nOh can't you see me?\nMy friends don't understand me, no\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me anymore more\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me anymore more\nBad bad 그저 아픈 꿈이길 바래\nSad sad 돌려놔줘 나를 네 옆에\nCan't you see me?\n마법의 그날처럼 say \"believe me\"\n불타버린 내 맘을 come and feel me, feel me\nOh can't you see me?\nMy friends don't understand me, no\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me any (shh!) more\nCan't you see me?\nFriends don't understand me, understand me anymore\nFriends don't understand me anymore more more (more)","userName":"💜Yeontan🐶","title":"Plz read ☺️"}},{"id":"6177889772","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:08:01Z","review":"Im honestly disappointed.  Upon opening this app, I was bombarded by numerous pop ups asking me if I wanted to enable notifications. I repetitively declined but was forced to hit accept in the end. I don’t know if this is a coincidence but that has never happened in any app I have downloaded.  Apart from that, the app itself is supporting a fascist, a more than potential rapist, and a bigot, accused of multiple impeachable offenses yet he is still in office.  To paraphrase the intercept.com, Racism, bigotry, and white nationalism are all in fact impeachable offenses.  I would just list every act of incompetence seen in Trump during his presidency, but all of that is so easy to find considering that it happens so frequently and that so much dirt on Trump isn’t in need of “digging”, as it is already building up on the surface.  It is disappointing how easy it is to find something Trump has done wrong within the last 24 hours.  In fact, searching his name alone shows reports of him “raging over supreme courts decision involving his financial records” or “threatening to cut funding if schools do not fully reopen”.  And if that is who we are supporting in this app then I don’t believe it deserves any more than 1 star.","userName":"¯\\_(ツ)_/¯****","title":"Unsatisfied"}},{"id":"6177887989","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:07:27Z","review":"I downloaded the app to see what was going on during all of covid 19 and the app took 1 hour to download.
