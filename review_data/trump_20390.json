I was told by another reviewer that this app would allow me to speak to the president directly and communicate with him. Wrong! I can’t! Besides that, this app makes no sense in its layout. It crashes, I can’t even get around it well, it’s really just a terrible, terrible app. Not good! Bad!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:01:12Z","userName":"blddddd","title":"Not good!

I am greatly disappointed with what I got out of this app and I wish I hadn’t wasted my time even downloading it!! So confusing to use and it kept breaking down!! I wish I could give this zero stars but that’s not possible here (which really should be)!!

I only downloaded it so i could give it one star to show the power that the younger generations have. I may not have power anywhere else but i have it here","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:34:26Z","userName":"Dnice6965","title":"This app is actually really poorly made."}},{"id":"6177584328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I made an account and then i realized that I didn’t have any more money in my Venmo and when I open the app swiper tells me he wants to swipe me and I get scared to open that app by my self and I don’t want anyone else to go through the same thing I did.

It’s not sending any notifications, and I’m starting to think Trump just doesn’t want to update us on anything! I used to like Trump, but this app honestly shows how careless him and his supporters are. Would not recommend this to anyone!

I am so sad to see how Biden just has a better app and real facts while Trump just lies. I seriously say this as a country over party person who doesn’t vote with parties donald is bad bad and the app amplifies this state run propaganda thing.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:31:16Z","userName":"WilllSlayy","title":"What happened to facts?"}},{"id":"6177571199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"She opened the App and was horrified by an Oompa Loompa looking man with white circles around his eyes she jumped out my car and then she got run over by a bike we took her to the hospital where she was crushed by a hospital bed survived but later a nurse came in and scratched her to death please do not download this app for your child safety r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:31Z","userName":"62728995431","title":"This app killed my daughter🥰💅"}},{"id":"6177550802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app consists of the spamming of advertisements. I just wanted to see the new news on what Trump has to offer for this years election, yet, every time I try to do something an ad pops up.
