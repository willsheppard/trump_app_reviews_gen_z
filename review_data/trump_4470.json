Unacceptable! And now I have to move out of my home that has been in the family for YEARS (It was my great grandparents home). This is just UNBELIEVABLY irritating and I DONT recommend getting this app! ❤️","userName":"Lizz Nicole","title":"Oompa Loompa ❤️"}},{"id":"6173655732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:40:16Z","review":"Terrible app... I couldn’t find the dog simulator button and I’ve spent almost a whole day looking for it. Also I had to kill my squirrel, that I accidentally stole, for the app to properly work. Not to mention the squirrel was old and the face it made when I sacrificed it was too scary. Now I’m traumatised and scared of any squirrel thanks to this app. I won’t ever recommend it to anyone so they won’t have to go through everything I had to see and do😢. There are also too many glitches when downloading the app. Some like, phone freezing, camera malfunctioning, and uncontrollable screenshots. 1 star rating for me. Have a nice day🙂","userName":"aocforprez","title":"Why?"}},{"id":"6173630809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:21Z","review":"I decided to download the app to keep up with my savior, trump 🍊 but right when I opened it, it sent a swarm of killer bees that tried to attack me. Scared for my life, I stared backing away, when I accidentally broke my window and fell down to my death. While I was stepping into the light I saw my fellow friends like harambe, Elvis Presley, and even Micheal Jackson. While I was going towards them, that’s when Micheal Jackson said he-he’s here and Barron Trump came to save me with a magical potion. I will never forget what this app put me through 😡🤬😤 I still can’t sleep at night  paranoid that killer bees will attack me again. I am very disappointed with you Donald Trump. 😔","userName":"Emilia N.","title":"This app killed me 😡"}},{"id":"6173580172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:13:26Z","review":"I’m completely appalled at this app. As soon as i opened the app it started playing vulgar music and moaning sounds. That alone traumatized my kids. I couldn’t stop the music if fact i couldn’t do anything. Then inappropriate imagines of squid wars and spongebob in bed started flashing my screen. Finally the music stopped but then my phone started to glitch out any it broke. My phone wouldn’t turn on until a couple minutes ago and i am completely outraged. Everything on my phone is gone except this app and now i have to pay to get it fixed. If i were you i would never download this app.","userName":"3142536475869708","title":"horrible experience"}},{"id":"6173524684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:34Z","review":"This app stained my phone back screen bright orange and I have been unable to change it! It threatened me saying if I didn’t eat anything but Cheetos for the rest of my life it would take Barack Obama, are true president, hostage! When I opened the app an odder was released through my screen attracting cockroaches, beetles, and mosquitos. As I was being eaten alive the app then crashed my phone and my entire system was hacked! Luckily I escaped from the bugs in time to write this review. I do not recommend!! I hope this helped and everyone stays healthy and orange free!!❤️🍊 and don’t forget to write a review giving it one star ⭐️ 💫","userName":"Pcherry25","title":"I almost got eaten alive from this app!🥕🟠🐜🦟"}},{"id":"6173488773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:12Z","review":"한 방 puncher 다 휘청거려\n해머 아웃 날려\n'Cause I'm a clean fighter\n뭘 망설여 네 셔플은 느려\n더 바짝 붙어 언제 깰래 wake up!\nGong이 울려 함성도 커져\n내 피가 끓어 거칠게 없어\nWe the future and we are dreamers\n링은 뒤집히고 우린 꽤 제법 하지\nHot hot hot 자 더블 타임 스윙\n내 귓속의 gig\n그 비트 위로 힛\n찢겨진 데시빌\nOn the 32nd beat\n한계 없는 gain\nMy mix straight bang like\nHot hot hot 또 lick을 쏟아대\nStyles make a fight 거짓말 안 해\nAs high as we can get\nAs loud as we can get\n준비한 자가 차지해\nWe got the championship\n거칠었던 라운드 난 다음을 준비해\n메말랐던 너의 영혼 적셔 줄 나이기에\n매 순간 처음인 듯 일어날 나이길\nHey we ballin' (ballin')\nWe fight together (together)\nThat punch! 날리고\n더 뛰고 소리쳐 babe\n가슴은 뜨거워 yeah yeah\nHey we ballin'\n전부를 바꿀 파이터\n내 세상으로 와\n우리가 누구야 babe hey, we ballin'\n혼자만의 소우주\n그 안의 긴 긴 싸움\n달리고 또 달려도\n멀어 보인 그 출구\n너의 신호 느꼈지\n나만 빛을 본거지\n풀려지는 그 비밀\n너만이 나의 exit\nHa ha ha 쏟아진 환희\n난 숨 몰아쉬어 눈 똑바로 떠\nAs high as we can get\nAs loud as we can get\n대세는 정해져\n우리가 다 날려 punch!\n거칠었던 라운드 난 다음을 준비해\n매 순간 처음인 듯 일어날 나이길\nHey we ballin' (ballin')\nWe fight together\nThat punch! 날리고\n이 빛 아래 꿈꾸는 듯해\n뜨거움이 멈추지 않기를 더 원해\nOne more time, one more time\n큰 세계로 끝없이 달려가\n후회 없이 난 싸워볼래\nMy show goes on\nHey we ballin'\nHey we ballin'\nHey we ballin' (hey we ballin')\nWe fight together (we fight together)\nThat punch! 날리고\n더 뛰고 소리쳐 babe\n가슴은 뜨거워 yeah yeah\nHey we ballin'\n전부를 바꿀 파이터\n내 세상으로 와\n우리가 누구야 babe hey, we ballin'\nHey we ballin'","userName":"liliytae","title":"Literally one of the worst apps ever❤️✨🧚🏾"}},{"id":"6173480411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:17Z","review":"This app has no actual good purpose to have why have a app that will become irrelevant in a couple of months when 🍊 is no longer in office? Also take into consideration that this app is solely for making him look good, there will be no commentary that will criticize him, there for making it easy to support if no ones taking about how he lets children be put into cages or how he re Twitter a white power video or how he wants transgender people to no longer have health care, etc. it would be more better if this app is removed so “2020 trump” supporters will have to look at other sources to be informed on what he’s doing. ❤️🧚🏽🥰🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"ms rona 😻👺","title":"Useless 😍❤️"}},{"id":"6173470171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:48Z","review":"As a US citizen planning to vote in this coming election I was shocked to see the blatant ignorance of the current president. Through live footage, I have seen people funded and supported by his administration breaking the laws they are supposed to uphold. People are being attacked and killed on domestic soil for practicing their unalienable rights and federal organizations discriminating against those who promote love instead of hate. The hate crimes committed against the native communities, and people of color in this country are not going to stop unless action. I do not see Trump making any effort to provide a solution, and from what I have seen he is escalating the situation with his ignorance.","userName":"Lexi9876","title":"Very Disappointed"}},{"id":"6173460024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:32:16Z","review":"the moment I downloaded the app, it completely blocked my entire phone. i did everything I possibly could, but every time I tried to unlock it  the app would notify me to go back to mexico if I wanted to unlock my phone. it was very disheartening ): so I did what any reasonable person would do in a situation like this, I left the country. however, the app is still blocking my phone, the device I am using now to leave this review is a bell telephone. this app is very deceiftful, and it took away my life. i hope as i leave this review i will be able to receive some clarity. i am very heartbroken and i need compensation !!!!","userName":"Michie1432","title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6173199995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:04:35Z","review":"두 눈 속의 blue sky 깨어나는 감각\n새롭게 설레여 babe\n찰나 스친 그때 향기마저 두근대\n네 숨이 닿는 곳마다 물들어\n푸른 you you you\n널 볼수록 커지는 설레임\nYou you oh you\n(완벽해 love yo)\n하나 둘 시작되는 이야기\n따스하게 번진 멜로디\n네가 내 계절이 됐어\n이 순간 모든 게 all mine (all mine bae)\n살며시 웃는 널 따라 흩날린\n나의 세상에 터지는 불꽃놀이\n너에게 다 보여줄게\nBloom bloom pow\n너와 꽃이 피어나\n물들여 와와 (wow)\n내게로 와 (wow)\nBloom bloom pow\n내 맘속을 찬란히 비추어 와와 (wow)\n빛으로 와\n눈부시게 피어오른 (you) (you're my bae)\n기다려 온 나의 계절 (you) (you're my bae)\n너로 그린 사랑이란 꿈\n이대로 깨고 싶지 않은 이유\nBloom bloom pow\n너를 만난 그 순간\n터질 듯 와와 (wow)\n설레어 와 (wow)\n꿈이 아니길\nHu-h 맙소사 말도 안 돼\nIt's like 붕 떠 있는 풍선 잡고 위로\n슝 올라가서 풍경을 색칠해보자고 물감은 봄 (hey)\nYou're my blue sky\n너란 바람 분다 지금 너를 향한 순간\n넌 나를 멋대로 설레게 가슴 뛰게 만들어\n스며들어 네게로\n이 기분 몰라 나조차 놀라\nOh 너와 나 놓치지 않아\n널 놓치지 않아\n(Oh yeah yeah yeah)\n눈에 담고 싶은 너야\n(You're my girl)\n둘만의 그림자 따라 흩날린\n나의 세상에 터지는 불꽃놀이\n네게도 펼쳐줄게\nBloom bloom pow\n너와 꽃이 피어나\n물들여 와와 (wow)\n내게로 와 (wow)\nBloom bloom pow\n내 맘속을 찬란히\n비추어 와와 (wow)\n빛으로 와\nYeah yeah \n비추어 wow wow wow\nBloom bloom pow\n너를 만난 그 순간\n터질 듯 와와 (wow)\n설레어 와 (wow)\n꿈이 아니길\n어질어질어질 해져 가\n너와 있으면\n아찔아찔아찔 해져 가\n견딜 수 없어\n흐드러지게 핀 이 순간 너\nSo beautiful yeah\n늘 꿈꿔왔던 너잖아\n점점 더 다가와\n눈을 뗄 수 없도록 (다 닿을듯이)\n점점 더 다가와\n내게로 내게로 내게로 내게로 와\n점점 더 다가와\n너만 바라볼수록 (다 닿을듯이)\n점점 더 다가와\n너에게 깊이 빠져가 you\nBloom bloom pow\n너와 꽃이 피어나\n물들여 와와 (wow)\n내게로 와 (wow)\nBloom bloom pow\n내 맘 속을 찬란히\n비추어 와와 (wow)\n빛으로 와\n눈부시게 피어오른 (you) (you're my bae)\n기다려 온 나의 계절 (you) (you're my bae)\n너로 그린 사랑이란 꿈\n이대로 깨고 싶지 않은 이유\nBloom bloom heart\n너와 있는 이 순간\n사랑이 와와 (wow)\n꿈처럼 와 (wow)\n이대로 우리","userName":"Gamer12345619","title":"stan the boyz not racist presidents"}}]}
