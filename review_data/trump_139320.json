I downloaded it because the shelves in my local grocery store were empty in the pedi file and racism isle. So I thought I could order some online. I came across this app and downloaded it. It took 2 MONTHS to download. So not worth it. Idk what to do know they still didn’t stock the store. Should I just visit this new store called the White House and ask if there is any in stock I’m sure they’ll have some... any advice?","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:59Z","title":"Astronomically bad"}},{"id":"6179623573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"YONKATRON","review":"As a young Trump supporter, I believed that getting this app would let me watch Trump dominate over Joe Biden but, to my surprise, THE APP LITERALLY BROKE MY PHONE!!!!!😠😠😠😠😠😡 if you want to support Trump this is NOT the app to do it.

When I tell you I downloaded this app. It took nearly 10 minutes to download and I have the latest iPhone. Might I add that this app is also inconsistent with the blm movement and isn’t up to date at all. Might I also add that my lawn isn’t mowed and this app hasn’t helped when it said it could. The lies portrayed just like this app!","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:48Z","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6179623098","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"jasper orion","review":"i hate this app ,every time it popped up on my home page it made me through up like i didn’t even know that could happen? could an app be that bad?? i guess so... because this one exist.🤢🤢🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:47Z","title":"discustin"}},{"id":"6179623071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Eww🤢🤮","review":"Like I could you not when this app download on my phone I kept getting notifications from unknown numbers there were many notifications that my tv started to cry it was an emotion roller coaster I thought I had to put my phone down but then I had a great idea 💡 I messaged all the numbers saying that trump is an orange and they all stoped me and my tv were so happy I don’t but then we heard a knock on the door we were scared I walked to the door slowly and I  tv turned out to be all those people that were sending me messages and they said we agree with you he is an orange I couldn’t believe what I heard but then they said sikee and they took me hostage they didn’t feed me at all then i remember I had my phone on me that hole time silly me I opened my phone to try and call 911 but nobody picked up so I had a great idea what if I jurist deleted the app everything will go back to normal right so I deleted it an lucky me ☺️ I was correct everything went back to normal I truly don’t recommend downloading this app PLEAS DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP 💀","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:46Z","title":"Worthless app 🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6179623008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hunter k b","review":"I just don’t know why you don’t have to do anything to me because I’m not gonna right I know I have no one else but I’m gonna is your day to go get me your phone and then I’ll tell ya hey dude I’m going on my birthday right I wanna is your day and you can get your hair and then you get to get me a picture and you can tell them what I do I don’t want you I know I wanna is your not gonna was a really bad thing you know what you wanna is your going back and then I just don’t wanna is the way you do you look at my mommy I wanna was your day and you I know I love y’all I wanna is the day you I want to know what you mean you don’t want to me because I don’t want you to come pick me up I wanna was the day I wanna was a good night night and I love you too and I love you so much I wanna was your time of day and we were so good I didn’t want you and your kids so I’m going back home to do it I don’t have anything going back I just want him","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:45Z","title":"Please read"}},{"id":"6179622984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Isabel's Review","review":"I was on this app when a rock flew through my window and punctured my left eye\nI blame the app for my lack of vigilance.","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:44Z","title":"Blinded me"}},{"id":"6179622838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"gigiandchipmunk","review":"Ok first of all this app toke me 123 year to delete I think I died after 2.5Millon days of having a orange on my screen;/ then i went on a trip to White House and their I seen my houses  microwave was not working for 1 sec I thought I seen a Karen or carrot idk but then my fishes drowned so I know I was going to die to but my sis Dora then toke her ass out and put a Mexican flag and he went chasing her bc he wanted to kill her bc his racist ass for then I got a chance to run then their was a black person that for some reason scared him then I turned white and my friends did to but then I woke up in a hospital after barely finishing a  orange","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:41Z","title":"Roblox tic toc stay we got u sis"}},{"id":"6179622761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"singerdoodle","review":"I downloaded this app as a joke to buy tickets to his rally, but then everything got crazy. I went to get a ticket and my phone started blowing up with messages it foreign languages. Mostly Russian saying if I don’t vote for trump I would be punished but I am underage. So, I didn’t think anything of it until my house caught fire and everyone died except me. Even my baby dog died! Then when I moved to my grandma the house flooded when there was no leak or anything out of nowhere. This app is up to some crazy stuff. DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP FOR A CREEPY CHEETO PUFF MAN!!!!!","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:40Z","title":"DONT DO IT"}}]}
