I am disgusted by the quality of such a highly rated app!! The loading screens were too slow and it wouldn’t stop asking for me to turn on notifs and constantly sign up for things. It’s a waste of space on your phone and I suggest not getting it. Not surprisingly, disappointed and ultimately traumatized by the dusty man shown upon opening the app.😕😕if you’re looking for an alternative app I recommend Fire boy and Water Girl🥰","date":"2020-07-08T22:19:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173911122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stinky houseplant","title":"Who allowed this","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app as a requirement for my 5th semester in elementary. I am a single mother trying to support my houseplant, named screwdriver, and I. When I downloaded the app all it would do is glitch and show me this picture of an orange Cheeto puff. The disgrace every person who contributed to putting this app together should be ashamed. The amount of trauma stinky Cheeto puff can cause people is absurd and I sure do hope the plan to compensate the emotion, physical, and mental damage from having to endure the sight. I will be expecting my check in the mail stinky Cheeto man.","date":"2020-07-08T22:14:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173895646","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yeah yeah🎼","title":"HORRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is so bad, first of all it’s SUPER glitchy and slow I hated it, all I wanted to do was support my dear president but after using it for a while I noticed my face started to turn orange just like his!!! I had to go to the doctor to see what was going on and they said I’ve developed dementia just like Donald trump!!! Hmm it was all suspicious so I’ve decided to not vote for trump this year and just settle for biden🙄 it’s all very unfortunate because I even got a seat to his rally in New Hampshire but I will not be able to make it because I had to go to a funeral for my lice.","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173843153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"froggyboi243","title":"Absolutely terrible","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app despite it having nearly 1 star, and it is so bad. It gave me 30+ viruses on my phone and now I can’t go on my phone without getting porn ads popping up left and right on my screen, and each add plays some high pitch noise that keeps making all these stray cats claw at my windows and I’m on the second floor, these ads are giving the stray cats super mad hops and I don’t know what to do, they’re still clawing right now even though the noise stopped, terrible app it ruined my life and my windows.😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T21:49:49Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173796378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cynders loaf","title":"Just no","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is horrible.

I cannot to ANYTHING in this app without seeing orange all over my screen!! I don’t want this app to ruin oranges whenever I see them! Disgusting! \n\nIt crashed and crashed and crashed every time I opened the app, it would only stay open for 2-4 minutes then it would turn my screen black and go back to the home screen, this is what drains my battery! It is useless and I can’t use it.\n\nAnd lastly the real worse part. Sometimes when my screen went black and was about to go back to the home screen, A orange would pop up saying “Did you vote for Trump?” Over and over and over and wouldn’t stop, like, I CANT VOTE FOR HIM YET IM A MINOR 😡\n\nIn the end this app is horrible don’t get it.","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173766601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Matteowo","title":"HORRENDOUS","isEdited":false,"review":"-0/10 i cannot believe how long this app took to load. it took so long that i figured i would feed my pet rock in the meantime, which usually take about 6-9 hours ;). by the time i got back it still was not opening!! when it finally did, a few business days later. i saw this most ugliest 🍊 i have ever seen in my lifetime!!!! it was huge and stretched out to human size, it was all wrinkly, and gurl it had the most horrible weave stitching i have  ever seen. again -0/10 would not recommend this app to anyone ever.","date":"2020-07-08T21:20:39Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173761776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"xxxlostdestinyxxx","title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤧🤮bad app","isEdited":false,"review":"When I download the app I thought it would be amazing. Because the entire president of the entire country has its own app to use. So I downloaded it on my phone and it basically is of all of my storage and now I can’t play any other game. It’s very very annoying that I cannot play any other games because this ad takes up so much storage on my phone. And not to mention it’s kind of toxic and sent to many notifications definitely do not download this app unless you want a hard time.","date":"2020-07-08T21:18:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173734466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😂😕👌🏿🤛🏿👐🏿😾🤏🏼👊🏿","title":"This app is terrible","isEdited":false,"review":"This is a terrible app first of all it would only stay open for A couple of seconds and while it was downloading I cannot use anything on my phone and it took hours to download and then when it finally did let me into the app for more than a couple seconds my phone started making this weird sound and then my dead snake came back to life but then but then my phone played different sound and then my ghost snake reenacted it deaf and just died again and now I’m traumatized","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:51Z","rating":1}}]}
