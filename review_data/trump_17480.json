I downloaded this app and it downloaded so many viruses to my phone that I had to just go and get a new one. Not even sure why Apple still lets this app get exist when it’s only purpose is to give people who download the app a bunch of viruses and force them to buy a new phone. Hoping Apple comes to their senses soon and deletes this horrible app from the App Store 🙄🙄🤬🤬","userName":"fncktheorangeoger","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App Ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6174371650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. It is full of glitches and is spamming my phone and email inbox even after I keep unsubscribing!! I’m pretty sure it’s sending bugs to my phone as well.

Then I downloaded this app. I saw a wrinkled sundried Cheeto as soon as I opened the app. I IMMEDIATELY lost my appetite and now I can’t enjoy my dinner. There should have been a warning before I saw a picture of a wrinkled sundried Cheeto. After I went through this horrific experience I ran to the bathroom and threw up. I had to drink a lot of water just to feel better. 🙄","userName":"HATE IT HERE101","date":"2020-07-09T00:42:44Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I AM DISGUSTED","rating":1}},{"id":"6174288292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was immediately disappointed after downloading. I had to tap around at the bottom of the screen to tell what was a link for terms of use and what was not.
