I highly recommend you support the dearest president in other ways."}},{"id":"6178674950","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:52:59Z","userName":"idkwhyanickname","rating":1,"title":"It glitch and gave me a virus","review":"So I had this app for some time and every time I open the app it will start to glitch really bad.
