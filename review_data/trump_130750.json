It keeps crashing. Terrible! The amount of INAPPROPRIATE stuff on there is astronomical! The app keeps reloading and it’s definitely the app. Donald trump keeps popping up saying to kill urself. This isn’t appropriate at ALL. WHAT IS THIS. The app also keep saying that I have to pay to the president becasue he needs money. No Cheeto puf can go tell me to pay him money. Also this app made my entire phone crash. First, all of my social media just froze and then went completely black. Then, my FaceTime and messages completely broke. My messages started saying to follow the Cheeto puff to everyone. My mom got soo mad at me. Then, all of a sudden, my phone had a picture of Cheeto puf packet and then just went black.
