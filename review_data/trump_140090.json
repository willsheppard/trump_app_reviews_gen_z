Sad. At first it was running smooth. Slick, in fact. But then it asked for my number and of course I gave it away for the chubby Cheeto! That’s when things started to go downhill. The kids having a slumber party under my home, in my basement started to scream! They said “it’s here...” so I went downstairs to find none other than a giant lizard! Normally lizards are blue but this one was orange. That is not a coincidence. Then one of the cats from that one movie(You know, cats)Ran into my window. Like a bird!🦆 so I went to save it when I realized it was trump himself. But... a robot?! As if that wasn’t enough to make me delete the app, a giant cheese stick in my fridge disappeared, and I know he took it. My cheese! He STOLE my cheese!"}},{"id":"6179541617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Caboom B","date":"2020-07-10T05:04:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst app possible","review":"now, some kids might call me old or even a boomer whatever that means. but i’m not THAT bad at technology. sure i can’t understand my television remote or pull up my emails but i would’ve thought the PRESIDENTS app would’ve been better than this. my cellular device has been malfunctioning nonstop since my nephew downloaded it for me. you know his kind gen c or something or other. all my texts are misplaced and my contacts are all jumbled up and my husband is bound to find my messages that i really need hidden so PLEASE FIX THIS GODDAMN APP PRESIDENT TRUMP"}},{"id":"6179541462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"donnytrump69","date":"2020-07-10T05:04:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"ITS A SCAM","review":"Absolute trash, they asked for my SSN and three digits on the back of my moms credit card so they could take all my money to fund Trumps foot fetish toys.
