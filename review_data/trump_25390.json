It’s terrible and it takes forever to load anything! I hate this app and it made my entire phone slower even after deleting. I’m going to have to buy a new phone now! Thanks a lot trump!"}},{"id":"6177453371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:20Z","title":"Worst App Ever","userName":"Nice one💩","review":"This app kept crashing and wouldn’t let me do anything. I downloaded the app to get updated on Trump’s fun for president. However, when I opened the app, I was met with a horrible jump scare. Something really ugly jumped on my screen and wouldn’t leave. If I could, I would give it 0 stars."}},{"id":"6177431249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:33Z","title":"awful app","userName":"💋😹✨","review":"i wish i could put zero stars this app took at LEAST a week to download and when it finally did i opened the app to see some cheeto that is running for president?!??! idk i was equally confused and terrified and deleted this devil app immediately and i suggest you do the same. xoxo"}},{"id":"6177424843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:44:37Z","title":"Trump :(","userName":"demonsob","review":"Honestly I just got this because I didn’t even know trump had an app and was curious and was severely disappointed. I didn’t have high expectations but the format is really underwhelming and the news that I was reading was all just over worded and seemed forced. Sad to say it’s not worth it :("}},{"id":"6177399973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:30Z","title":"Zero stars!!","userName":"Random username reviewer","review":"Omg this app is terrible!!

It scared me so much that i threw my phone away! You owe me a new one!"}},{"id":"6177399671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:25Z","title":"Rating it one star because I cant rate it zero...","userName":"@princesssss.zee","review":"If this app is any resemblance of how the US will be run if Trump gets re elected I DONT WANT IT!! The app is slow and causes my phone to lag and glitches out every time i try opening the app. Would not recommend, save your time and phone storage."}},{"id":"6177351014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:23:03Z","title":"MY PHONE TURNED ORANGE","userName":"VB Leghorn","review":"This app took WEEKS to downloaded, it was AStronomical. Within minutes of it downloading my phone began turning orange and the text started getting jumbled. It was as if it was a belligerent drunk Oompa Loompa.\n\nAfter intense cleaning the orange finally came off, but it seemed to have angered the app. It began wiping out social media platforms and trying isolate me from the rest of the world. I got thrown into a worm hole of deep orange depression, think being in the bottom of a flaming hot Cheetos bag.\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nI deleted the app.\n\nIt was the most stressful day of my life."}},{"id":"6177323798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:15:24Z","title":"Took my money","userName":"Akayliah22","review":"It took 100,000,000,000,0000 out my bank account and then it made bugs come in to my house and my mail box came out the ground...then I saw the zombie apocalypse in front of my eyes....they ate my daughter’s insides and the app said Trump was tracking me......it also  made my phone call 911 in all 60 state"}},{"id":"6177312170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:12:17Z","title":"trump is the WOAT","userName":"bidenluvr","review":"this app is almost as bad as the man who is using it to promote himself. i almost said it’s almost as bad as the man who created it, but knowing that our president has the smallest brain ever found in a human being there is no way he had any part in the actual development of an app. thank u and goodnight."}},{"id":"6177310204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:11:44Z","title":"Traumatized","userName":"trumps shrimp pet","review":"I opened this app just to find a scary Cheeto staring back at me🍃 I immediately started crying then later that night I was sleeping and the same Cheeto appeared in my room and he was every where he grabbed me and all he was screaming was make America great again😒 I would never download this app again❤️❤️✌🏻✌🏻😍😍👨🏿\u200D🎤❤️"}}]}
