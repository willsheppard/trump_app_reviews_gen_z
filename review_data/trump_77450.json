After my phone rebooted it would not charge and would die if it wasn’t constantly plugged into an outlet. This is when it got weird, people started showing up at my house wearing trump merchandise and they kept acting like they were my family, I thought at first maybe I had lost my memory of them but no one day I took their DNA from the glasses of lemonade they drank out of, It got tested and they weren’t my relatives, but then more people like that started acting like my family until half of my town was acting like that, and I hadn’t seen my real family in weeks. After half of the town was acting like this a few of them kidnapped me and took me to a secret underground government base where Donald trump was being held in his bunker. After they took my phone and tried turning me into a conservative through electronic waves they let me go. I lived normally but still in fear for a week or so, after that I started getting death threats from angry robot sounding people which I can only assume are conservatives. Then one day I came home to find a robot in my living room, it’s purpose was to watch me and make sure I never spoke badly about the Trump App. It took me a month to gain its trust enough to escape. I went on the run after that where I was followed by people in Barney suits with guns. That isn’t all, after I left the country I found others like me who went through very similar situations. Speak up if you’re like me, SPEAK UP TO THE SYSTEM. I two days later died and am now somewhere in the great beyond sending this report through radio waves that I have harnessed. I must go now my duty awaits in other realms. Just know it’s all a simulation, I will await further reports and try to give hope in the coming days. Good day earthlings."}},{"id":"6176066731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"loopzoop-","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:23:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app made my wife leave me","review":"This app made my wife think I am a racist!!!"}},{"id":"6176056188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Koolaidmaz","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:20:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"Trump fix your app a bunch of glitches and bugs and couldn’t handle it and delete it !!
