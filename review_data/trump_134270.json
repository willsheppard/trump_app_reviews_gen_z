Cheetos belong on the shelf; not the White House. Where’s his mommy? He CLEARLY needs a nap because all he’s been doing is having tantrums. I’m about to move to Canada, and you should, too.","title":"The Biggest Pile of Sh*t I’ve Seen Since Working on a Farm","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kate082297"}},{"id":"6173025502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:09:05Z","review":"I love King Donald and love our humble dictatorship known as the USA. But this app is poop. Maybe if he spent more time in development instead of fondling kids it would be a better experience.","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mike Peens"}},{"id":"6173025418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:09:03Z","review":"This app sends notifications at 3A.M. I can’t sleep with my phone constantly going off in the middle of the night. The app gave my phone a virus. My Social Media glitched out, my messages would go to the wrong person, and inappropriate content was on the app. I really don’t like how our president made his app. The app flashed brightly, giving my ill mother a seizure. Mother is still in the hospital.Trump’s app will forever scar me and my phone for life. Please don’t install.","title":"I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS APP!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bear&Phoney"}},{"id":"6173024828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:52Z","review":"I thought I was going to see how great “my president” is but this just made me miss Obama. I had this app for over 2 hours and it’s made want to change my skin color to orange and to actually vote for trump 🤢🤮. My mental state after downloading this has just been going down hill. I keep saying “make America great again” and “trump 2020”. This is just a awful experience for me honestly.And also my phone has been glitching ever since I got this app. I even turn my phone off for an hour and it’s still glitching and getting worst. I feel like this app has a virus attached to it. 0/10 would NOT recommend for anyone.","title":"The worst decision I have ever made","isEdited":false,"userName":"ummmmmmmhellooooo"}},{"id":"6173024031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:37Z","review":"So trash like hdhdnenddnfnbfbfjfnfnf dndbbdbfbfbfh don’t even get me started on dhhdhdhdhdnfbdhhf also, dhdhhdhdhfnfnfn.","title":"It’s Doo Doo","isEdited":false,"userName":"tjessie879"}},{"id":"6173023767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:08:32Z","review":"I downloaded this app hoping to get good information but boy was i wrong.

He has no manners, he’s not professional, he’s a racist, and I’m sick of hearing his voice. Please go back to reality tv or bankrupting your own businesses! You have proved your point... you have proven to Obama and the rest of the world that you could get elected as president. Now, please go away! PS. Your app has glitches in it. It wouldn’t even send a verification code by text.","title":"Not Happy with Trump!","isEdited":false,"userName":"cherihoke33"}},{"id":"6173019216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:07:05Z","review":"I tried to open this app but it was glitched so I went to the App Store and grows in the app name and pressed open then I was sent to the app but after putting my number it sent me somewhere on YouTube for no reason I need some answers on this I don’t get it all the other reviews are mostly low and I would believe that that’s all I got to say fix you app it’s terrible I tried to open this app but it was glitched so I went to the App Store and grows in the app name and pressed open then I was sent to the app but after putting my number it sent me somewhere on YouTube for no reason I need some answers on this I don’t get it all the other reviews are mostly low and I would believe that that’s all I got to say fix you app it’s terrible I tried to open this app but it was glitched so I went to the App Store and grows in the app name and pressed open then I was sent to the app but after putting my number it sent me somewhere on YouTube for no reason I need some answers on this I don’t get it all the other reviews are mostly low and I would believe that that’s all I got to say fix you app it’s terrible","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"dfjvgjv"}}]}
