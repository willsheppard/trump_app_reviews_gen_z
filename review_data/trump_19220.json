I’m afraid the developers are liberal commis and will use this information to spy on me.

People are STILL dying because of COVID-19 in America and he’s doing nothing about it. And the fact that people still voted for him in 2016 even after he talked about the wall? How could everyone be so ignorant and racist..!? This app is just letting people ignore the actual problems with America.","userName":"ThePonyArt","title":"OUR PRES IS A COWARD","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172559220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"A few days after downloading the app my information got hacked somebody tried to steal my identity.
