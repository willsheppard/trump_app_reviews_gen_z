But this app is not user friendly. Have fun trying to navigate around the horrible interface. There are pictures of trump EVERYWHERE literally everywhere and they distract from all the popcorn worthy content available on there. I hope this app gets deleted from the App Store because I don’t want anyone else to have as traumatic of an experience as me.","userName":"ssseoyeonnie","title":"the worst app available","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:34:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174264280","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible quality and the design is simply outrageous and horrifying. I do not believe an app like this should be such an easy access to young kids and teenagers who can be brainwashed by the horrible monsters behind this app. This app was like getting water put into my iced tea without my permission at starbucks, outraging really. I’ll be waiting here impatiently waiting to speak to the manager while writing a horrible review of this app on yelp. \nI’ve never in my life been so disappointed and disrespected.","userName":"katthepissedkit","title":"Let me speak to the manager of this app..","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:25:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174252373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to see my👁💋👁 Greek Godly ChEeTo Puff Lord and savior.

So I decided to look into it more. When I went deeper into the app I saw an orange puddle of barf 🤮 this is were my opinion on this app started to go downhill. It began to make all of these fart noises at random times whenever the orange Cheeto opened its mouth on my screen. Next, it sent me to this pimple popping app? Popping orange pimples? It was quite unpleasant. I was trying my hardest to find the good in this app but I just couldn’t see it. In conclusion, please don’t download this, and if you do, you WILL regret it.","userName":"Le Québecois","title":"Gross","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:12:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174228124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app design is truly horrible! The very first thing it does is ask you for personal information that you can’t access it without. And like hell I was giving that info to a fascist dictator! \n     Now onto the content, I was greeted by an image of a horrifying man with the worst possible spray tan out there. His comb over looks like literal yarn and could make a man Ill to look at for to long. Additionally, many of the signs used by the campaign are repurposed nazi symbols such as his 2020 Eagle holding the flag and red triangles for antifascists.\n\nVote Blue In November!","userName":"Us3r486","title":"This app has go to go!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:12:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174206534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I 👆was a girl 👧 in the village 🏘 doing alright 👌💯Then I👆became 🤔a princess 👸overnight 🌙 🌃🌌😴 Now I 👆gotta figure out 🤔how ❓to 🤷\u200D♀️do it right👌So much 😍to learn 📖 🏫 🎒👩\u200D🏫 and see 👀 👁 🙈👓 Up 👆in the castle 🏰 with my new 🆕family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 In a school 🏫🎒👩\u200D🏫that's just for 😋 royalty 🤴👑 👗 A whole enchanted ✨ world 💖🌎  🗺 is waiting for me 👆🙈 I'm so 🤯 excited 😍🤩😝 to be Sofia 👸👸 the First ☝️I'm finding out 🧐  what being 🥰 royal's 👑👸 all about 🤷\u200D♀️ Sofia 👸 the First 👆Making my way, it's an adventure 🏃\u200D♀️ everyday 📅  Sofiaa 👸 ✨ its✨ gonna be my time ⌛️⏰🕜 Sofia 👸 To show 😱 them all that I'm 👆Sofia the First ☝️","userName":"jocelynnn.ortega","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:04:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174202962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app disgusted me. When I got it I thought that it would just vote for trump for me so that we could continue to keep America exactly the same because there are definitely, absolutely no problems what so ever in America! We are sooo amazing. Anyway, that is not what it did. Now I just get several messages from them telling me about trump- I did not approve of this and did not allow this app to give me notifications!

I got messages about a doormat... I didn’t want that. I also noticed it gives false information. It can’t say Trump 2020 when he’s not guaranteed that spot. Our system we vote for who is president he shouldn’t be able to dictate and choose that he is. I don’t see the point of this app and it was not pleasant. I deleted it immediately. I was also very upset to find it can always track you (this part is true) DO NOT RECOMMEND","userName":"dhdiosnckfldnssjflfldnd","title":"False advertising","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:49:26Z","isEdited":false}}]}
