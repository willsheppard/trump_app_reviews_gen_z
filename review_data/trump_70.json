So as one does I got on the app and I immediately notice that they asked for my phone number so I gave it to them and it all went downhill from there 📉📉the second I confirmed my phone number there were dozens of people claiming they had hacked my phone and wanted my dogs in exchange for them to stopping hacking my phone 😨so I sadly shipped my dogs to them😢 , but it didn’t end there they started to harass me saying that if I didn’t send them my little brother they would change all my passwords to Snapchat, Instagram,TikTok etc. So I shipped my little brother off too🤧. Then I get a strange call from none other than our orange Cheeto himself 😻 saying that I now had to send my aunts baby to them and this mess would finally end ☺️so I later snuck into my aunts house and got her baby and shipped little Juan to them 👶🏽👶🏽however the calls and messages still continue and haven’t stopped and I haven’t seen my dogs, brother or my little cousin in over 3 months 😥PLEASE AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COST !!!","userName":"🦷🧚🏻","rating":1}},{"id":"6175582439","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:39:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HOGFIFIC!!!!","review":"this app literally took 53 weeks to download however once it was done downloading i was asked to give him my phone number which is completely inappropriate . like EXUSE ME i have a boyfriend and you sir have A WIFE. but i figured that because i am loyal and i hope our “great” president is too and knowing he would not cheat on his wife i put my number in. about 10 minutes after i did i started get hundreds of spam messages, which is NOT acceptable. eventually i had not choose but to block the number although i was kind of confused as to why he wanted to talk to me, i mean as stated he has wife. and about 5 minutes after all that i heard a knock on my door. which was really strange because no come to visit me anymore after finding out i support bunker boi. i opens the door to 15 MINIONS at my doorstep practically begging for me to give him a good review on this app. at this point i was fed up with all this so i slammed the door on the minions and went back to my room. next thing you know i start getting death threats from another phone number telling me to re-download the app and give it a 5 star review. and to top it all off it hacked and wiped my phone. overall DO NOT download this app!!!! all i wanted to do was support my Cheeto president bu i guess i can’t even do that","userName":"abbs dog","rating":1}},{"id":"6174850631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:22:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible President, terrible app.","review":"Donald Trump could have been a hero.  He could have taken on this invisible enemy head on from the beginning, but instead continued to downplay the severity of the situation with the hopes that he could prevent the tanking of the economy.  He has and will continue to let his pride and his ego stop himself from changing his approach to this pandemic and admitting that he was wrong.  To make matters worse, how he is handling this Black Lives Matters movement is downright disappointing.  Sometimes, when I check the news and read about something that he has done or said, I cannot believe my eyes.  Yes, I was inspired to do this because of a Tik Tok, but someone who wants to and probably will succeed in banning Tik Tok from the US mainly because it was the medium for a prank that left the stands empty at the Tulsa rally is truly petty.  You could argue that Tik Tok is Chinese run and could be a threat, but it has been popular for at least a year, but has not been deemed a threat until it’s users embarrassed Trump.  If our president was merely doing a bad job in office, it would not inspire me to download his app just so I can leave a 1 star review.  Trump’s historically horrible term that was capped off by these terribly run  last months were the main reason why I decided to leave this review.","userName":"SirReginaldPoofta","rating":1}},{"id":"6173363972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad, bad, bad. All FAKE NEWS","review":"I remember walking and it constantly bothered me. It harassed me, it kept notifying me about an big orange baby. Who is this baby I wondered? Well it didn’t give me much of an answer. Except for a picture popping up with the orange baby in his diaper, which clearly needs to be changed from the looks of it, and the baby is having a tantrum. Really wished I didn’t see such a horrendous picture. Then came the noises. All I can remember is this constant noise it made. FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS. It never stopped. Even now I can still hear it ringing in my head. Who ever downloads this app willingly, you will have to have an empty head because this is the worst way to waste your time. All it kept doing was give me conspiracy theories about politics. Very one sided, may I add. Maybe the people behind this app ARE the conspirators. I’m surprised people are actually using it. If you see any ratings above 2 stars. Well I got some bad news for you because those are the REAL FAKE NEWS. The design of the app is also repulsive. Who approved this app to the public. Terrible app, don’t know how it’s still on the App Store. Like come on, do you really think an app this bad should still be on here. It’s going to ruin the app stores reputation for putting a false advertisement that has no real purpose.","userName":"anna borcion","rating":1}},{"id":"6172069616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T12:36:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"This app made my phone glitch so bad, think the software may need a complete update. was hoping to use this app to educate myself about MY president and it kept kicking me out of the app, couldn't even use the points & reward system they offer. It was also disappointing to see how many libtards are out there correcting MY president, I mean Trump didn't mean it guys, whatever you think he did he didn't do it. His 5th wife even said he is an honest good Christian man!! And all of the supporters completely helped to brainwash me into thinking that he is the best president, he was able to give white supremacists a platform in which to give their horrible & hateful opinions, he was able to get unemployment up to 16% in only 4 months, he was able to take away rights from the LGBTQ community, & has made it his own personal endeavor to belittle women & convince me that as a woman it's what I deserve. Also he not only handled a global pandemic so terribly he exceeded terrible expectations ***I don't know what to hate about him! & when he said that Mexico is sending not their best people because they are bringing in crime, drugs, & rapists he also said that he assumes SOME are GOOD people! HE FIGHTS FORJUSTICE S I just don't get why the snowflakes hate him! (Also in case y'all couldn't tell this is all sarcasm & satire)","userName":"lia_TikTok","rating":1}},{"id":"6177574631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:30:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"terrible","review":"When I saw the app I was highly interested since I figured it would give me good information about what’s going on currently in the political world especially for Donald J. Trump. As soon as I download the app though I already started to experience issues. The app was extremely slow and it asked for a lot of information but that was pretty normal I guess. I wasn’t really receiving a great amount of information that i expected sadly so the app wasn’t much of a help. Later on I noticed issues with my phone. It was extremely slow and every would keep crashing. Whatever app I was on it would crash and I never experienced this problem until i had downloaded this app. I also have a pretty new phone so it is not common for this to happen. I have an iphone XS max and no one else has really experienced problems like this. I also don’t trust this app now since i heard rumors about how it leaks your information. This is a scare to me and I want to always be insured SAFETY as you would want too. I was even getting sent tons of notifications from the app even though my settings for notifications were turned off and I tried several methods to stop this. This app also took a huge amount of storage which is not good especially for iphone users.","userName":"Jossie O.","rating":1}},{"id":"6176737479","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"My cat is dead 🆘 trump ruined my life sad story","review":"This app is really bad needs to be shut down it leaked my adress and some crazy girl came to my house screaming trump 2020 while I was trying to sleep and my cat woke up and had and ear infection it was so sad 3 days later it passed away poor baby u will be missed and the second reason  it was really bad telling me to eat cow and I am vegan really disgusting right🦗 the third is it says Hitler 2020 for me and I don’t support slavery and it also says to be strong and I am a gumbe so I can’t I’m sorry 😞 it also says that trump dose not like me so yeah it also so sad then my mom on her phone it leaked her address again and guess what it was not just a girl it way 60 people screaming by my house I thought it was a dream but I could not wake up so it was real I was really sad thinking about all the bad things that has happend while I had this app I miss my baby cat and.

First of app took a whole year to download 😠 and each month that past , I would get a big and deep hand print somewhere on my body like if I was being molested or something by the President. When the app finally downloaded, the roaches in my house started singing about how Donald Trump is a racist and rapist and many other bad things. I try to shush my roaches by putting a gun to their heads since I have a right to a gun because I’m white and a trump(et) supporter. But then they attack back by pointing out evidence and facts on how trump is the worst president ever but I’m a trump supporter so I have no brain and so i didn’t listen and ignore the facts and continue to support this big orange 🍊 dude. Now not only did that happened but more creepy things proceeded to happened, my dog turn into a human but he was black so I had to knee on him for 9 mins just like the police taught me. Of course I didn’t get in trouble because I’m white. Instead i actually got a high five for my work. Lastly the things in my house started floating and screaming lies about how black lives don’t matter and to not abolish ICE and that rapist victims are not victims and it’s their fault they got raped and that the police should not be funded. So please don’t download and support this cheeto for your own safety.","userName":"tik tok: wakeywakeybiatch","rating":1}},{"id":"6177467775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Follow redryanredryan of TikTok","review":"This app did not butter my croissant. I downloaded it to see my favorite Cheeto puff, but I was greeted with something else. Upon downloading, my phone immediately began to heat up. My screen began to get discolored. It had a slightly orange tint. My phone began to project a figure onto the wall.  It showed a sunken eyed, dementia-ridden orange. In a broken voice, it began to tell me about trumpets! It said “trumpets 2020!” I uninstalled it from my phone immediately. I ran down the block to the tree I promised my friends I would go to. But to my horror, a bunch of boys repeatedly said “are you lost baby girl” in all seriousness. Straight TikTok. Apparently if you go farther into the app it tell straight TikTok about alt TikTok. It exposes us. I ran home immediately. When I got home, I saw 3 security guards attacking my mother.  I screamed in horror. But this wasn’t the half of it. I turned around to see 3 more security guards holding back Barron trump. The kid was trying save my mother!!! I didn’t know what to do, but all of the sudden my average dog Martha came in. She took down the security guards and killed them. My mother and Barron didn’t know what to do, but I did! I took them to my little cottage where Martha guards and we all live happily ever after! \n\nIn summary: the app is ✨G✨R✨O✨S✨S but my friendship is 🌈IMMACULATE 🌈","userName":"Random Ryan","rating":1}}]}
