Until there were problems... it took about 7 whole hours to download and made my phone lag for those remaining hours while I was trying to listen to the national anthem for 7 hours but it kept lagging. when it finally downloaded I clicked on the app and it played trump’s sexist words which sent me to a seizure!!! But it was ok I got back up and had another one and then I was infuriated. So then I called the service help number in the app and they were incredibly unacceptably rude and tried to take me as a sacrifice to one of their secret ceremonies. Not so secret now THEY TRIED TO FORCE FEED ME PRUNES AND I HATE PRUNES BECAUSE THEY REMIND ME OF MY 9TH EX HUSBAND’S BALLSACKS!!! God it was a nightmare which I never want to relive but thank god other victims in the hideout helped me escape and we went running for our lives. Bad, bad, bad app."}},{"id":"6173697775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"small hands small P","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","review":"I got this app to show my support to our President, but as soon as I downloaded it, everything bad started happening. The app took DAYS to download, so I was already in a bad mood. I opened the app and it started playing “Replay” really really loudly. Because of this, I’ve lost the ability to hear anything but this horrid song. I tried to do the only sensible thing I knew of, delete the app, but it WOULD NOT DELETE. All of the sudden my phone burst into flames and my hand caught on fire. The doctor said it would take years to heal. When I left the hospital it started raining acid, which only made my hand worse. I went home to find my house split in two, a huge crack right down the middle of my house. Just when I thought this was the worst of things, the sky started playing “Replay” and I burst into tears, only for my house to crumble before my eyes. DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE CURSED FOR ALL OF ETERNITY!!!!"}},{"id":"6173686868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"iammelaniatrump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible quality app!!","review":"Listen, in my southern Indiana family we love trump!! But this app isn’t very great!! 😫This app has soooo many glitches it was very  hard to use. ☹️It was very difficult to navigate!! I wasn’t able to join team trump because of those issues, and I was devastated 😾I also think me and my daughter angela got hacked from downloading this because we used our email and phone number to sign up!! 🙀This was the only thing we used that info for and for some reason, both of our instagram feeds had those weird ray bans ads!🤨 For those who don’t know, whenever you get those ray bans ads on you’re Instagram posts feed, (w/o you posting them yourself) that is a clear sign you got hacked, this can also happen to Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and LinkDen, users so I highly recommend not downloading or you will suffer some pretty embarrassing consequences !!! 😵\n- Donna Johnson 😀"}},{"id":"6173577320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"all apps matter 😌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’M GOING TO SUE 🤬🤬🤬","review":"so one of my conservative friends told me that this app was incredibly informational and that i could learn a lot about their personal beliefs by downloading this app. being the open minded liberal young woman that i am, i decided to give this app a shot. i’m all for unity, diversity, and inclusivity! however, as SOON as the app loaded on my phone, my entire phone started to glitch! and mind you, i have an iphone 11 pro max so that isn’t the issue. like, my screen keeps flashing the same message over and over again. it says “YOU’RE A WHITE SUPREMACIST” and it literally won’t stop. it’s been going on for the past 48 hours and i’ve tried contacting the app developers, but they keep telling me that there seems to be no issue and that this is a common occurrence??? idk my phone is literally useless at this point and if i don’t get legitimate help from the app developers soon, i WILL press charges."}},{"id":"6173454437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mihilli","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:30:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app does not deserve any stars!!!!","review":"It is the worst app I have ever come across! When downloading the app it took about a week to finally be able to open up the app! DO NOT GIVE IT YOU PHONE NUMBER!!! After waiting a week to be able to open the app it asks for you phone number and as soon as I did I was spammed with naked pictures of President Donald J. Trump. MY DAUGHTER was sitting next to me when this happened. Sadly I know that this is not the first little girl that had to see that image. When I tried to delete the app it kept on asking me to vote a big fat orange corn looking thing for 2020. The type of other images I was send through my phone number were by far the most disturbing images since 2 girls and one cup!!! I would NOT RECOMMEND to anyone! Worst app in the App Store!!! I am disgusted and disappointed with how Apple still let’s such app be up!!! Just look the the other reviews!!!!UNPROFESSIONAL ON APPLES BEHALF!!!"}},{"id":"6173358822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nat4437","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:57:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🖤Ugly 🖤✨","review":"This app literally made me loose brain cells. It’s ugly❤️it took about 27 hours to upload and one episode it did I started to see mold grow from my phone. Mold everywhere! I can’t believe why anyone with a brain would get this app😭 After the mood was all over my phone I contracted black mold cancer... This sent me to the hospital where my toes started to fall off one by one. I then started having mold induced psychosis. I saw a massively obese orange monster chasing me! And this monster was so stupid! It was radical and savage with absolutely no brain at all! Whenever I got away from the monster, I would wake up and another tie was missing. The doctors tried so hard to figure out what was going on with me, but failed. One day, a doctor told me that the only explanation was that the app was horribly unattractive. I never thought that an app could be this useless and disgusting. Please don’t get the app. I almost died❤️"}},{"id":"6173154674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jduebwka","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:50:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Never downloading this app again!","review":"I am distraught. If you download this app your entire phone will glitch out. I personally downloaded this app in order to educate myself on the rotted peach yet everything that was on here was telling me to donate money to the peached campaign. It glitched my phone out so much that I had to buy a new one. I was beyond frustrated that this app would do that. I read the reviews before downloading and some of them said that it makes your phone glitch’s lot but i decided to not listen BIG MISTAKE. I also experienced cockroaches as well as someone else this app is unacceptable and should be taken off the app store. It also unforced unacceptable behavior. I saw some inappropriate images when I first downloaded the app and at that point I refused to open the app and decided to delete it. In conclusion DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APPit is horrendous and this has happened to many people not just me."}},{"id":"6173080616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cutebossy1😎","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:26:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This app is so badly done it took about five hours to download and that’s not even the worst of it. It kept on glitching to a man with an orange face I don’t know what that means but I thought Trump was white. I was trying to find a reason to vote for Donald Trump again there’s no reason because this app is so bad. He hasn’t done half of the stuff that he promised to do like build the wall and he ruined economy. \n    Since I put my personal information into the app I’ve gotten countless text of Trump begging for money. \n     I think they also sold my information to telemarketers because I cannot stop getting calls about random stuff in the middle of the night and it’s waking up me and my husband who is sick with the coronavirus. \n     I wish there was a reason I could vote for Trump again but I can’t I’m sorry but I can’t. This app so bad. I can’t vote for Trump but good luck hope you don’t win.\n    Thank you."}},{"id":"6172756841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ahaha no thanks","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:48:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏼🤡 ✨just no✨ 🤡🧚🏼","review":"𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣 our president 🤡hasn't built the wall 🧱 as he said he was, and has said countless offensive things he should be taken out of office i wish i could give this 0 stars⭐️! people who vote for trump are white supremacy and i do not agree! someone come save america. 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣 the half baked carrots 🥕 image became my background and i can't change it back!

These include a reduced ability to understand basic logic, an increase of anger every time I see a person that has more melanin than me, a lack of empathy or ability to care for anyone other than myself, an addiction to my iPhone/iPad, a sudden affinity towards cops even though I break the law on a daily basis, I believe that while I’m above the law while I have a shotgun in my truck and hunt deer in July while high on meth, that unarmed man that was shot for walking home from the gas station deserved death because he smoked weed once, or “I’m sure he did ~something~”.\nI’ve also recently bought a $10 confederate flag from a gas station in Alabama and every time I leave the house now, I get called a Karen. Please send help."}}]}
