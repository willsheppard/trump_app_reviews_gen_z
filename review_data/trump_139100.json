I don’t know if it was just me, I’ve only had the app for awhile, but am very upset by this. This is just down right awful that someone who create an app that I can’t even fully enjoy. How am I suppose to know when Trump is throwing a fit. Am I suppose to go on Twitter. No! I shine able to go on this app and watch him complain about Democrats on here. I would also like a live on this app, so when The Supreme Court makes a decision I want to watch him throw a fit as he finds out about it. I would also like a video proving he is clinically sane, If possible. I want a list of people Trump Hates on here, so I can follow them. I just want to end my review with ACAB AND BLM.","rating":1,"userName":"The only thing on earth","title":"Awful"}},{"id":"6179650310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"My ✌ name’s 💅 America 🇺🇸 My 🖐 hobbies 🙌 are 👏 guns ⭐ blowing stuff up 😌 and 👏 baseball ⚾","rating":1,"userName":"shane.ÿÂe","title":"pee pee poo poo fart"}},{"id":"6179650199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This took forever to download and it runs slow and my phone got two viruses from this app","rating":1,"userName":"Trinitip","title":"Why though"}},{"id":"6179650088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Yeah it’s just trash","rating":1,"userName":"livinlikedawg","title":"Trash"}},{"id":"6179649932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"silly orange man thought he could make a faulty app without us knowing. donald..donald..donald! cmon now, i know youre capable of more! just kidding. the man is incompetent and this app is of course an accurate representation of that. please, lets get this baby out of office and this app off the app store. tell him to rub in his rite aid quality fake tanner, and get a life instead of polluting our world with his hate speech and-as he so lovingly puts it, fake news. dont download this app, its a waste of time and energy just like our presidents life. have a great day!","rating":1,"userName":"TGIB1","title":"he thought he did something❤️"}},{"id":"6179649797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"right when I opened it, it gave me a gazillion viruses and started sending me notifications, WORST APP EVER and it MUST be took down from THE APP STORE.","rating":1,"userName":"LOSTanACCOUNT","title":"worst app ever"}},{"id":"6179649627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Stream be happy 🖤✨😽\nAfter 15688 years of it finally downloaded, I opened the app and it showed a Cheeto puff on the login or sign up thing and I didn’t want to take anymore time to make an account so I pressed the home button and deleted the app I rate it a -456377383/10 WORST CHOICE OF MY LIFE TO EVEN THINK ABT GETTING THIS APP 🤦🏽\u200D♀️ also if u support trump go choke on his dick ✨😻","rating":1,"userName":"kiwiiiiisthickkk","title":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆"}},{"id":"6179649542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Wut🖕is✨wrong🤦\u200D♀️with🧚🏻you🔪if😤you🤢support😡that🤬dumb😠looking😑cheeto🤮thing😷😷😷","rating":1,"userName":"Silverrose Hall","title":"Trump 2020🧚🏻🖕 but on a tombstone✨🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6179649459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"No","rating":1,"userName":"Samtheman03","title":"Do not download"}},{"id":"6179649422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:42:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"RIGHT when I opened the app, my phone started to vibrate😖  THEN my phone turned into an orange🍊the orange started to talking to me saying that if i didnt support trump, it would turned my whole family into oranges🍊💉🧬 i had to squash the orange for it to stop being an annoying orange!🦶when i did that a shrimp appeared🍤 i ran to different country but somehow the shrimp turned into a flying shrimp!🍤 then a plane hit the shrimp, and i finally was let in peace...
