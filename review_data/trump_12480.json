He should stick to running golf courses and casinos, not one of the most powerful countries in the world. He does not have the competence to run a country. And because of his incompetence, thousands of Americans have lost their lives and millions of people across the world are dying because this Cheeto is to selfish to care about anyone else besides him self.

App took days to download and attempted to gain access to all of my info! Even more, I felt myself morphing into a racist, sexist, xenophobic billionaire with no regard for the majority of America. So scary! I couldn’t deal with it. Overall, I regrettably and unfortunately must rate this app 0 stars out of 5","userName":"Sleepy Joe 2.0","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:22Z","title":"Unsatisfactory App","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177296924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve never downloaded a worse app before!!!! This app took almost 36 hours to download! Not only that but the first screen you see contains graph photos of some strange Cheeto man!! Truly scarring. If all of this wasn’t enough, this app is the most bigoted thing I’ve seen! Racism, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, fascist, ablist!!!!! Very disgusted and had to remove from my phone immediately... do better, apple store.

However, when I opened the app one my phone crashed( had to reboot everything), secondly when I turned my phone back on the app was still glitching like I could barely scroll!!!","userName":"Tyzeer11","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:46:04Z","title":"Okay soo","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177210777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"hello, so i downloaded this app to see the oranges campaign. i’m a huge one direction fan so i went to the “bands” feature on the app. i tapped on niall (my fav 🥰😜) and boom my dad died. so i was like what the! and then i tried it again and it took me to spencer reid’s page and i wasn’t complaining. then boom! my phone was just filled with the entire bee movie scrip! it glitched my whole phone out! and here’s the worst part! a big trump appeared on my phone! when i tried to delete the app it wouldn’t go. so i went to text my cousin and all i could text was “trump2020”. now in my family those words are a sin, so my family disowned me. now my dads dead, my phones glitched, and i’m homeless. anyway biden 2020","userName":"@artist_ bear-","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:55Z","title":"niall horan, spencer reid, bee movie  👁👄👁","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177124177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I couldn’t imagine how the great or should I say greatest orange president could have such a horrible app but the reviews are correct. First they wanted my cell phone number like some socialist scheme. Now my phone has been hacked and all my information has been sent to the Russians. I’m pretty sure those nasty democrats had something to do with it. Until he fixes it I suggest you never download it.","userName":"IAlloura","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:38Z","title":"You should listen to the reviews first.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177064610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first got this app I was really excited but as i started using it more and more it would do weird things to my phone. Got example sometimes my pictures would get deleted and then come back edited with disgusting things. And one time I was trying to text my job group chat and it kept autocorrecting to racial slurs. I definitely know that this app was the problem and NEVER DOWNLOAD THE APP \n\nALSO TRUMP 2020 ... written on a gravestone🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨✨","userName":"Sierramickay","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:02:10Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177036187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app so I could get updates about my favorite narcissist, our dear president🇺🇸.
