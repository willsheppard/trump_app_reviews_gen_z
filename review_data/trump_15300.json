After 5 minutes of having it I began to breakout into a cool sweat from the heat being generated from my phone. Things started to go wrong in my life and there was no stopping it. I began to question whether the suffering would come to an end but it wasn’t until I finally deleted the app and pledged to vote for Biden in the 2020 presidential election that everything became better.","userName":"Bethebooknerd","date":"2020-07-10T02:20:21Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst App ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178991222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Tiktok kids are leaving bad reviews, so I came here to show support for my president but I’m very disappointed. It did take a long time to download, would crash every few minutes, and drained my battery as fast as Snapchat. Sometimes it wouldn’t even load. As a republican, I feel it is my right to freedom of speech(hence first amendment), so I’m sorry but this app is terrible.","userName":"Stell Mae","date":"2020-07-10T01:52:05Z","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178950502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is one of the worst apps i’ve ever downloaded. it kept crashing and wouldn’t let me see the information i was looking for. it was very barley set up and took so long to get used to. it also constantly glitches out and/or causes my whole phone to glitch out. i’m very scared this could lead to a virus or my personal information being leaked. absolutely terrible. hands down worst app in my experience. i am extraordinarily disappointed. if only trump spent even a portion of the money on this app that he spends on the military maybe he would have a better app and better chances at winning. this seems unlikely for him.","userName":"fhdjdkwkdnd","date":"2020-07-10T01:37:14Z","rating":1,"title":"astronomically bad","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178854171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app in hopes to help my conservative bothers but instead it took DAYS to download. And kept shutting my phone down!! And all it did was campaign for pro choice, pro lbgtq+, women’s rights and no ones illegal on stolen land. Disappointed in our president!! I might have to settle for biden at this point. That’s how disgusted i was. I cant believe this. DO NOT download this app for your own sake.","userName":"lily 09876","date":"2020-07-10T01:01:59Z","rating":1,"title":"can’t believe this is on the app store","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178847279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Why do you want to take away TikTok it’s ok your mad you getting exposed but TikTok we have a army and we will stop you from this!🥱🧏🏾\u200D♀️,your going to get taking down this is going down in history first coronavirus now your trying to ban an app that is keeping us entertain!😅 your funny we all know TikTok will still be alive we going to get you taking down for what u have done!🙃🤢","userName":"Arovzn","date":"2020-07-10T00:59:22Z","rating":1,"title":"What is wrong with you😒🤢","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178810494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I could give it zero stars. First of all when I opened the screen I saw a horrifying sight. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen. A freak of nature was staring back at me and it started to appear in my dreams and around my house. It wasn’t until I turned on the news I realized it was our beloved president Trump 🤮 I haven’t slept in 3 days and I don’t think I ever will again. If u want to spare your sanity NEVER GET THIS APP!!!","userName":"amesssinadress","date":"2020-07-10T00:45:21Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE NO ONE GET THIS APP","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178684097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all right when I press download it made my whole phone crashed and I had to buy a whole new phone then it took another 37 hours just to download and then it takes another two hours just to log into it and when you’re logged into it it takes a Nother hour just for it to load all the local events","userName":"bdbdjsjhfjf","date":"2020-07-09T23:56:33Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst add ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178667564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After downloading this app, I noticed that my antidepressants stop working. It was like all the happiness was sucked away from me. This app is witchcraft and violates my religious community and beliefs. My phone was also very glitchy after downloading this app, it is safe to say that Trump is a Russian spy stealing all our information. It would be so much less of a threat if this app drowned and was removed by the App Store.","userName":"trump2gay","date":"2020-07-09T23:50:07Z","rating":1,"title":"The app","isEdited":false}}]}
