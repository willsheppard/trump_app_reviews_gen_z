It wouldn’t stop playing so my dog jumped off the roof of a 100 story apartment building to avert the horrible sound! Luckily, some dancing cockroaches who were protesting for black lives matter at the bottom of the building caught my falling doggo with one of their banners and saved his life. \n        When my grandma arrived home from the hospital, she downloaded the app to see what caused this, and her phone went into self-destruct mode and said she had 5 seconds left to live! Luckily the dancing cockroaches flew in through the window with little superhero capes and threw her phone out the window! Wouldn’t wish this app upon my worst enemy. DO NOT BUY","isEdited":false,"title":"Almost killed my dog and my grandma","date":"2020-07-08T18:07:59Z","userName":"donutdorklord"}},{"id":"6173108128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app caused my phone to glitch and freeze so i turned my phone on and off again at an attempt to perhaps fix the glitches and such. When I turned the phone back on I noticed a bunch of my other apps had been deleted and half of my contacts were gone. I tried to delete that app hoping my issues would go away however, after I deleted it i put my phone down for a few hours and did some things around the house. I returned to my phone and open up to my home screen to find this god forsaken app, once again, on my phone downloaded as if i never deleted it in the first place. This app is an absolute nightmare i think i’d rather pass a kidney stone the size of texas than ever have to deal with this app again.

They don't need to have my phone number and be texting me about the racist, sexist, homophobic president. Also, I know it's for an election, but they still could have made it so much better than it is. The sign in screen is too busy. There's too much going on and I got confused and closed out as soon as I saw it. Everyone that has dealt with websites or apps knows that you want a clean look. This is not a clean look. The picture as the background has way too much going on and there are way too many words in different sizes. Choose two font sizes at most. If I could give this zero stars, I would.","isEdited":false,"title":"I wish I could rate this with zero stars.","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:09Z","userName":"Lib-mom"}},{"id":"6172867608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was here because I really wanted to support our fellow president. Even though he is a predator , who deserves to go to jail, is racist and many other things. But that’s not the topic, I was here because I wanted to support our orange president. But the app was super glitchy, it lagged it doesn’t even load. It also doesn’t even let me even open the app any more. Their is also many pop ups. Just wanted you guys to know. And for those who support them. Remember that ‘joke’ he made during pandemic that drinking  bleach would cure the coronavirus? And how many people tried it and died? As he later announced it was “just a joke” will that joke killed many, many people. So whoever supports trump should try out that ‘joke’ he made :) just to prove your loyalty.","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump for 2020!!

I downloaded this app to support my favorite 🍊, otherwise known as Donald Trump. 😩 I love his greasy, wet hair. 🥰. It looks so smooth and yummy☺️. I bet he gets so much bussy. 👁👅👁 So anyways, I downloaded this and not even five minutes later, Donald Trump was hitting me up. 🥳 I went to my Instagram DMs and found trump saying, “Are you lost babaygorl?✨” I literally MOANED out loud. And I responded “Yes daddy,” and before I knew what was happening, the roof of my house BLEW UP. 😬I looked up and there stood Donald trump in a freaking helicopter. He grabbed me and then I immediately passed out. 😅. As soon as I woke up, Donald was like “Hey babygorl, you have 365 days to fall in love with me,” 🥺 And then he tried to recreate the boat scene and I chopped off his pp and ran away 🍆🔪 Overall, it was traumatizing","isEdited":false,"title":"This app literally ASSAULTED me","date":"2020-07-08T15:20:05Z","userName":"trumps bussy"}},{"id":"6172585638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was really excited to start using this app to get to know President Trump's agenda, but the moment I downloaded it, I was spammed with notifications of some weird guy named Donny T asking me to send feet pics! When I finally did get to open the app, it started to glitch out and in the middle of trying to fix it, I get a facetime call. I answer it, assuming it's someone I know, only for some weird old guy that looks like a cheeto to introduce himself as the previously mentioned, Donny T. When he asked me to take off my clothes for him, I told him that I am just 17, for him to just reply \"that's even better!\" It was a really weird and creepy experience. Keep your kids away from Donny T, no matter how old they are, you can never be too careful.","isEdited":false,"title":"Some Creepy Orange Guy Wouldn't Stop Hitting On Me??","date":"2020-07-08T15:00:02Z","userName":"Hope.lessly.wandering"}},{"id":"6172426065","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Each time I open this app all I see is a orange trying to take down TikTok and he is taking this too the Max so if he does he will never “make America good again” trump doesn’t care about any thing in the world he only like himself and his supporters🙄 this is the worst app take this down before he can ruin everything it is a big problem that he said be is the best president that is just NOT being the best person And That’s On That. Here are some reasons to take HIS app down: he is trying to take TikTok down, he is races, and mean, he Lies ALOT, he dose not make “America Great Again”, he touched young girls when in the 20’s gross and that is my reasons so if he dose anything worse than take apps that we go one every single day than we should take down his app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Not a good app at all","date":"2020-07-08T14:16:02Z","userName":"kittylover12345678910"}},{"id":"6172275903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Hello, so I am writing this after this app destroyed my life, shortly after downloading this app The Annoying Orange himself busted through my window screaming about he was Trump’s long lost brother who is a vigilante against his haters- I desperately tried to explain to him how I had dada Trump’s news app and even showed him- that wasn’t good enough though... he and his other friend fruits who were all painted orange too took me to the trump tower and injected me with ‘insta orange tan: Daddy Trump edition’ and I turned orange and lost all my hair.
