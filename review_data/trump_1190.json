It kept going in and out and I tried everything to get it to work because I’m such a big supported but it didn’t work. It’s almost as bad as everything else Trump as done while he has been president. I then plugged my phone into my computer to charge and it took over. My computer started being glitchy too. It then got to my smart fridge and it started walking. It went right out of my kitchen. I was so surprised but then i remembered that Trump is messing up and breaking everything so why not add a few fridges to the list. In conclusion I would not recommend this app because after I downloaded it I am now left with a glitchy phone and computer, no fridge, and i can’t even use it to show my support for our dear president that is definitely not a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic white supremacist who is the color of a Cheeto. 🧚\u200D♂️💗✨We love u Trump! 🧚\u200D♀️💕✨","title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND","rating":1,"userName":"hjjinb"}},{"id":"6174720589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:43:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Do not download this app unless you want it to seriously mess up your phone. My phone runs as well as trump can form sentences now....not very fast or coherent. The app is so hard to us in the first place with all the glitches. I would really think a better app would be created by our genius president. The formatting is god awful. God himself would be disappointed by our presidents work here. And what does this app show about America? Definitely not that our president is capable of organizing his own campaign strategy. Gosh, no wonder nobody comes to his rallies. He can’t even get the tickets right. Maybe he spilled water on his computer trying to get a drink, and that’s why we are stuck with this terrible under developed app. This would also explain why he needs two hands to drink water now. He doesn’t want his campaign to sick as bad as this app did. Oh well, too late for both of those now.","title":"Do. Not.

My pet dinosaur went to McDonald's and got me a whopper but then it got cold so I went to put it in the fridge and it was Gone! So I then went to the microwave so that I could burn it but that was gone to so I rode my pet hawk and It flew me to home depo but when I got to home depo all the microwaves and fridges were gone so I bought them and left on my pet ant and when I got home I plugged in my cabinet and went to bed I woke up to my pet tiger eating the tiger king for breakfast and the sun was getting in its eyes so I closed the blinds and went out at 2:00 AM to get some milk and then I forgot that I had to feed my pet elephant so I went back to feed it and then this app randomly opened and downloaded a virus onto my laptop so I deleted the app on my phone and rode my pet penguin all the way to Burger King to get myself a McFlurry and when I did it was hot and I went home to put it in the microwave the end.","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"userName":"bored_in_quartine"}},{"id":"6174617679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:13:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As I was about to support the presidential campaign of our dear orange fat Cheeto I was physically and mentally scarred by the horrid image I saw before me. It was he who shall not be named. His face made me cry and I dropped phone. I started rolling on the floor and then my husky came up to me and watched me as my petrified screams filled the room. My husky then inched towards my phone and saw what was on screen and too began to cry. My screams started to go down and I finally got up to exit this horrid app, but as soon as I went to my home screen, the app glitched and the orange mans face started to flash on my screen. Y’all should really put an epilepsy warning on that if that is the performance of this app. Long story short, this app is glitchy, has horrible performance and has completely hacked my phone and completely ruined my life.\nWould not recommend. If I could give this a 0 star rating...\nI would.","title":"Everyone deserves human rights ✨🧚\u200D♂️🌸 not you tho🥰💖💫","rating":1,"userName":"qazwsg"}},{"id":"6174397652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"when i opened this app i was startled by Martha the average dog 🐕 then she ate some alphabet soup 🍲 and started twerking.. my fish 🐠 was sitting on my shoulder and hes only three years old. he now has PTSD 🧠 because of it ,and i think it was very inappropriate. anyways after that traumatic moment i got up to go get apple juice 🧃 from my fridge but when i opened it trump was in my fridge DRINKING MY APPLE JUICE!!!

Next I accidentally left my phone unlocked for my puppy to come over to my phone and as soon as she saw Mr. Cheeto man’s face she went haywire like the US government when he came into office, and went to the store and bought a pet llama and the llama caught the cheetovirus so she died. This app proceded to send signals to every animal within a 10 mile radius and I woke up to rats, cockroaches, mice, owls, birds, dogs, cats, any animal you could possibly think of and there were so many animals starving in my house they ate all my food and proceded to eat my furniture. So now I am a starving woman living in a house with no furniture filled with animals with the cheetovirus. I’m conclusion, if you value your life, don’t download this app.","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"userName":"Pbedmunds"}},{"id":"6173599545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I first downloaded the app, I realized that it was giving out a lot of false information, and morally wrong ideals, but like most conservatives I looked past them. Later I figured out that my number had been leaked, and started getting death treats from other trump supporters. This app also leaked my address and people sent me roaches and rats trough mail! Termites to! I soon figured out that this app was blackmailing them and making them do these things, and someone came to my house and threatened to eat my cat! The app sends you these things and supplies others to and blackmails them by looking though your phone! They do this to anyone who they think is a fake supporter, which wasn't even true, I support idiots and racists and rapists, LIKE ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS! The termites ate my house and not even bob Duncan could save it. This is very sad because that house has been in my family for 700 years, and now it’s gone.","title":"It’s spying on you","rating":1,"userName":"PuddinPiyve"}},{"id":"6173593154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:17:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"dmwgz\nthis app would’ve been amazing has it not taken a couple of weeks to load... but considering our awesome president and his responses to major events, in surprised it happened that fast. but that’s ok. my phone almost heated up trying to load it, but Don’t worry. it might eventually stop working cause of the heat just like our planet but that’s fine because my phone’s problems and global warming are both Chinese, right?  anyways, it’s a Mess. but i’ll figure it out. i’ll be fine With some rest. i guess these problems are also a Gen thing, but i wouldn’t know cause i’m just a dumb kid who can’t vote, which automatically makes my opinion invalid and wrong, regardless of what it is. that’s fine though, because like my opinion, ‘facts’ about the world are just wrong too... anyways, read the capital letters. read right, the message will seem eZ. dmwgz.","title":"Chicken wing  Chicken wing Hot dog baloney chicken macaroni chillin with my homies","rating":1,"userName":"🍗🍗🌭😊🐔🍝❄️🕺🏽"}}]}
