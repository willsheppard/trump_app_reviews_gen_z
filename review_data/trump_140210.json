But it’ll start up again in a few minutes. I downloaded this app to support our president and after I did my phone started acting up. First I started getting texts and phone calls from foreign places. Then my phone started shutting down by itself. Now my phone glitches every five minutes to what it looks like above. I entered my card information on a the official trump website to order myself a new flag (after the terrorists antifa ruined my last one) and now money keeps disappearing from my account! I’m so scared I won’t be able to support my little Kaieytlynn and Jacob. We’re good honest people and my information is being taken from me!
