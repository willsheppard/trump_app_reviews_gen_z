Disgusting.

The design quality on it is horrible it looks like something I did as a part of my intro to computer science class. None of the buttons work and it takes five minutes for it to switch pages. Honestly Iâ€™m wondering who cleared for the release of this app because they and everyone else who had a hand in making it need to be fired.","rating":1,"title":"Atrocious"}},{"id":"6179283855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:38:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ehehdhdbhdgshs","review":"I tried downloading this app (it took 5 days) and it just wasnâ€™t worth my time. My phone was overheating, after just minutes of having it on my phone. I tried uninstalling it but every time I tried my whole phone froze. (I have a brand new phone.) I tried 6 or 7 more times and finally figured out that I have to delete it from the applications in my settings. The app in general gives NO information, yet asks to view all of my personal information. Donâ€™t download this app!","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6179283751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T03:38:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yeet chaleet","review":"When i opened the app, i think i will if it did.
