The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal *bodeboop*. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. *ding* Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark.

Since it is running in the background my phone is dying faster. Why do they need to track me while I’m on the app? Most importantly, why do they need to track me when I’m OFF the app?! Worst app ever. My small hands cause me to have issues using the app. When you look at me you would probably think “Yeah she would have big hands”, but if you look at my hands they are actually small. In conclusion this app tested positively for negative.","title":"My phone is slowly dying at a fast pace","userName":"DT's small pp","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:42:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174501142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all he’s orange and he looks like an Oompa Loompa he doesn’t deserve to be president like ever we know he cheated on the election and Hillary wouldav won.
