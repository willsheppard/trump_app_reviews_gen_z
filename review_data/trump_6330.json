They aren’t a fan. Then they took the Tv went up in flames!! Flames I tell you! And it burnt down our whole living room! So now we have to pay our money that we barely even get because we have no jobs because he forgot to put the wall up and we don’t got no money anymore because of dat. So now we have a huge hole in our house and it’s all because of Mr. 🍊 and his campaign.

Would not recommend if you value anything in life. Trump is a racist bigot who needs to be THROWN out of office, his and his entire campaign party are disgustingly close minded individuals who need to learn what it’s like to not be white in AmeriKKKa. They all need to step back and step down so someone with sense can get into the office. Also btw Trump is a little cry baby who likes to try to ban entire apps because gen Z pranked him. Stop being such a Rat bunker boy!\n\nSincerely with hate-All POC, LGBTQ+, and anyone else with half a mind.","date":"2020-07-08T13:48:53Z","title":"Yuck","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172316683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"caitlin_brianna","review":"i am soo disappointed with this app. first of all it took a whole HOUR to download. my wifi is outstanding so i know thats not the reason why. i was really hoping to be able to use this app to keep up with my beautiful preident trump. however after waiting for the app when i opened it, it was EXTREMELY glitchy and buggy. the screen kept flashing and kept closing out. i decided to restart my phone and the app still would not work. I am so disappointed in this app as i was hoping to see more and give a positive review for this app.","date":"2020-07-08T13:46:25Z","title":"EXTREMLEY DISAPPOINTING","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172232248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"An Average Black Guy","review":"So I’m a Trump supporter like the rest of us (TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸) and I downloaded the app to make sure I don’t get corrupted by the LIBERTARD MEDIA! As soon as I downloaded the app, I noticed bumps everywhere on my Johnson. Now my president told me if you don’t get tested it’s not there so I didn’t get tested for a couple of weeks. My liberal wife forced me to go to the doctor and they told me I had herpes.\n\nI thought the snowflake doctors were giving me fake news so I didn’t get the prescription. Now my wife has left me and my Johnson fell off. If you want to keep your Johnson, do not download this app.","date":"2020-07-08T13:22:52Z","title":"This app gave me the herps","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172084714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"nickea¥","review":"This app is not good, very little to none useful information about how trump wants to “make america grate again” it asked to all my personal information witch felt very unsafe to me and gave me a bad feeling, shortly after doing so i was getting about one text message every 5 minutes from this app. Also i was hacked on instagram and so was my credit card by an email that had “i vote trump 2020” in it. not only hacked on life but soon after that email found out where i lived and came to my home, this app is very DANGEROUS please i urge u Don’t get this app","date":"2020-07-08T12:41:15Z","title":"I got HACKED on this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6163134410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"username162","review":"I downloaded the app and everything was fine until I signed up. The second was signed in my phone started glitching terribly. It wasn’t very much at first, just slow internet and other small glitches. But then it started deleting my apps. It all got worse from there. After not even 12 hours of signing in, the phone was flying all over my house. It hit my in the face several times and almost took off my sister’s head. I just wanted to support our ra_ist president, but now my phone is broken😔","date":"2020-07-06T07:19:24Z","title":"Do not get!!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6142371303","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"kk🌵","review":"the instant i got this app pictures of cheeto man filled my photos, social media, and changed my wallpapers😡🧚🏼\u200D♀️ about an hour later my dog started barking and running in circles until he was so tired that he dropped dead because of this very app (rest in piece charles)✨😢 i think this app should be taken off of the app store due to hacking other things on my phone and straight up supporting the orange we call a president😫🍊 Trump is racist, homophobic, sexist, and straight up a horrible person. please delete this app it ruined my life🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨😝 in memory of charles🥰","date":"2020-07-01T03:08:50Z","title":"absolutely gross🤮✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136257819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Truthfully Unknown","review":"When I downloaded the app I thought it was going to be a great way to support our wonderful president Donald Trumparticus! But my stomach suddenly did not feel good as soon as I downloaded it! I have had red white and blue diarrhea for the past five days now!! And now every now and then I’ve been saying ‘Trumplet 2020’ or ‘Vote for Rump’ out of no where! This app is ruining my days and I don’t wish for this upon anyone else! I would not recommend this app at all 0/5 stars but since 0/5 stars is not available it’s a 1/5 DO NOT RECCOMEND!!😞😔🙈✨✨ so.. yeah❤️","date":"2020-06-29T14:55:08Z","title":"I have had diarrhea for five days now😿","isEdited":false}}]}
