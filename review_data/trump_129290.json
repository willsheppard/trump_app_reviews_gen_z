I tried to download it but it kept telling me no, so I finally punched the app, and it finally agreed to download! Then I had to wait 110089 days for the app to download!!! Ugh 😑, (totally not worth the time), once I finally got to open the app the first thing to pop up was death threat to my family 😱. I got scared so I deleted the app of course, but then my phone got back by little oompaloompas! They stole all of my information!!!! And then to make it worse they showed up at my house and kidnapped my family for 76 day! They finally came home and the were turned into robots!!! “Ahhh” is what I said when I saw them. In conclusion please don’t download this app!","title":"😡UGHHGHH🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"isidjdgtshwbdbkdlslos"}},{"id":"6175575827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:37:30Z","review":"so i downloaded this app to see what the hype was about and people HACKED my phone 😿 people literally came to my house and cut up me and family and then blended us up into soup and he ATE us ugh! i hate this app with a PASSION because now i can’t live anymore. thank you for listening. ❤️","title":"THIS APP SUCKS😡😾","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tanasiwa09"}},{"id":"6175575718","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:37:28Z","review":"🧨🧨🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤑🤕🤕🤕🤑🤑🤢🤕🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢","title":"Worse app ever 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Happyman3546"}},{"id":"6175573365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:36:35Z","review":"Do you hear the people sing?\nSinging a song of angry men?\nIt is the music of a people\nWho will not be slaves again\nWhen the beating of your heart\nEchoes the beating of the drums\nThere is a life about to start\nWhen tomorrow comes\nWill you join in our crusade?\nWho will be strong and stand with me?\nBeyond the barricade\nIs there a world you long to see?\nThen join in the fight\nThat will give you the right to be free\nDo you hear the people sing?\nSinging a song of angry men?\nIt is the music of a people\nWho will not be slaves again\nWhen the beating of your heart\nEchoes the beating of the drums\nThere is a life about to start\nWhen tomorrow comes\nWill you give all you can give\nSo that our banner may advance\nSome will fall and some will live\nWill you stand up and take your chance?\nThe blood of the martyrs\nWill water the meadows of France\nDo you hear the people sing?\nSinging a song of angry men?\nIt is the music of a people\nWho will not be slaves again\nWhen the beating of your heart\nEchoes the beating of the drums\nThere is a life about to start\nWhen tomorrow comes","title":"Unacceptable (doesn’t uphold Christian values)","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"✨life is a nightmare✨"}},{"id":"6175571273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:48Z","review":"If I can leave a -11929 rate, I would!!! I wanted to support our king Trump. It kept glitching and sending me rubbish messages. I took me 7 hours to download and once downloaded, it kept SPAMMING me. How rude?! It threatened to show me explicit images if I did not attend rallies 😡my storage was IMMEDIATELY FILLED. I sent a picture to one of the messages and the app told me that I had fat dog and my tv turned off. My dog is a blind survivor 😭 I cried all night at the thought of our handsome dictator bashing my dog. I named my dog Trumpy wumpy because of how much I loved him and thought he loved me 🥺 I went to sleep hours after being on the app and was suffocated by a demon. The demon threw my octagon couch against my tush and killed me. THIS APP WILL HARM YOU. The demon told me to reply to one of the app’s messages “❤️” or my fish would drown! My fish is allergic to WATER!!! My fish saw the message and attempted to commit sewer side 💔😞","title":"Gruesome & God Awful","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Mikal Myers 💦🙏🏽"}},{"id":"6175570803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:38Z","review":"Hi my name is Caren (with a C 🙈) and I downloaded this app hoping to support my second GOD Mr.Trump, however I was EXTREMELY disappointed to see that he wanted my phone number. Sir Trump I LOVE YOU 🥰😍❤️ but Jesus that is too personal. I did YOU a favor by downloading this app, so you need to do me a favor by making it where I can see all of your definitely non racist, misogynistic, homophobic, or transphobic words on my screen!! 😊 Until that day?
