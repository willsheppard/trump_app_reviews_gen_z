Yes I completely agree and that is exactly why I downloaded this horrible app that keeps glitching and showing me these horrible pictures although the only good thing about this app is that it tells me all of the horrible nasty disturbing things that our president does and that’s what I just love about this app because I love trump. (I am being very sarcastic if you couldn’t tell our president is horrible) And I just love the adults on here who are just being so rude and saying that kids don’t know anything about politics even though they probably know more than you do sir because you support trump and it’s just it’s just not OK so get your facts straight honey thank you","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173498447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING!","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:29Z","userName":"i saw roaches too","review":"Hello, it’s me Susan\nI thought this Subway Surfers because my kid wanted it, but now I HAVE A VIRUS ON MY PHONE!
