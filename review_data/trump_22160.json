First of all it takes up more than 50gb once the app has to update. Second, it gave my phone a virus, a lying fat orange chicken keeps popping up on my screen saying he’s my president. And worst of all, people actually believe that he’s their president. I mean the chicken is barely literate.

I was scrolling through Facebook and came upon this application, obviously I had to download but when I downloaded it... it was really inappropriate for sensitive users.
