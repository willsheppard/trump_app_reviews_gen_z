Once downloaded, you cant do anything without turning over all of your personal information. Even a text verification code is required. Screen two: they’re asking for your money! So much for free information! If you go through and read the run of talking points (nothing of actual substance) you’ll see that statements are made and the link to the reference documents taking you to his own speech! You can’t cite yourself and call it a fact! If every student did that, they’d fail — come on! On another article, which actually referenced a census report — he’s made a claim that it was the “worst ever;” when you open the report and read the document actually says, “ Between 2017 and 2018, the real median earnings of all workers increased 3.4 percent to $40,247.” — PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO READ! Do not fall victim to the appearance of fact based information.","date":"2020-07-09T23:55:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178679708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"SEHdn","isEdited":false,"title":"SAVE BARRON 2020","review":"SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020 SAVE BARRON 2020","date":"2020-07-09T23:54:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178680162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dhjebeghsdjsjsjdjjsej","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS IS STUPID","review":"Donald Trump i eatingsfhkzfjkduidfixghksyizdizdyizdyisfuizfyizdhizdhizdhkzfhkzfhozfusfhosfhdhksfhiffuodfuodgoxfuoxfhogjlcgjlgjlxfulzfhozfuosfuozfukzfjlsfdzzfhozykz vxhfhgjgfhkfskhhsfjyjadsafghdgbahsdhjfyrwjrawhtujdjrajdgjfsyrsjteutsutrysurafg","date":"2020-07-09T23:55:00Z","rating":5}},{"id":"6178677160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kungfupandz","isEdited":false,"title":"Literally the slowest app on the planet","review":"I have 2 goals in life. Making sure Trump becomes president again, and watering my pool. This app prevented me from both my goals.Firstly, because it is SO slow all I did was wait for a week to be able to even access any information on the MAGA campaign, and because of this inconvenience I had no time to water my pool. What a waste of an app.\n\nSincerely,\nDisappointed","date":"2020-07-09T23:53:51Z","rating":1}}]}
