After minutes with the app on my phone it gave me as well as my phone a virus. i have asthma so this app may have been the cause of my death since it gave me and my phone corona. my phones lungs are very weak and cant handle that.

It even deleted all my pictures and told me i am not a human being. Should be taken down before it hurts others. Also it took super duper long to download and it stole all my storage and data.

I honestly forgot about it. when I opened the app, my phone immediately started blaring Trap Queen & would not stop. it took 7 days for it to stop blaring music. It also made my phone produce a very very foul smell. smelled almost like sweaty spray tan and tiny hot dog wieners. I wouldn’t reccommend this app to anyone. gave me 4 viruses including c*rona. never download, stay safe. ✨🧚🏼💕","userName":"a cool 🤢 trmp supporter","title":"terrible app!!!!! 😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6175875610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T09:21:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app kept crashing and even when it would load it was slow as molasses.   This app single handedly changed my mind in the current administration.  I’m voting for anybody but trump.

It took 3 years to download. After waiting 3 years, the app gave my house cockroaches. The roaches then gave birth to bedbugs, which have infested my bed.
