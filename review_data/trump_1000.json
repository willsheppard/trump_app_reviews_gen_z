Now, she does have epilepsy so I know for a fact that it was the spinning icon when you first open the app that did it!🤬But it gets worse...I received a text just a few minutes later saying “BAN CURRY 2020!” Now, being South-Asian, I took this as a personal attack and went down to tell my wonderful parents that happen to be children of immigrants, but they had disappeared!! There was a note on the fridge that read “The Cheeto fights back.” So basically, my sisters and I are orphans now. 😳🥵 Thank you President Trump 😋🥰","date":"2020-07-09T16:13:54Z"}},{"id":"6176669973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The government is watching us","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"a scared citizen","review":"First of all this app took 5 hours to download and crashed my phone multiple times. Besides the fact that I now have a virus on my phone that continuously sends me pence and trumps d!ck pics, it wasn’t that large of an issue because much like the issue theirs were tiny. My phone now continuously turns on for no reason, and I can hear labored breathing whenever I plug in my earbuds. Yesterday while listening to my podcast while driving my music was suddenly cut off and a person be an to speak to me. And I can honestly say he sounded identical to the cheeto president himself. Further on my phone keeps turning on and sending me videos of myself doing things like walking around my house to even working in the garden. I am very sure that there are cameras in the birds and that they work for the bourgeoisie because it is always an eagle view. Further more I have nothing else to say than Trump is always watching.","date":"2020-07-09T13:17:32Z"}},{"id":"6176086139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scared for my life","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Karen Noname","review":"I was a very proud Trump supporter, until right after I downloaded the app. I believed in President Trump, despite the fact that he wears a toupee. My name is Karen Noname, and I was just talking to the Starbucks manager for giving me water that had 7 pieces of ice instead of 6, when I receive a text that attacked me. I was standing outside my car yelling through the drive through, when this ROBOT threatened my life. It told me that if I did not vote for Trump 2020, I would have to wear a mask! How could they say that? I know my rights, even though my state has one of the highest cases in the world, I can wear a mask even if I want too. It is way too hot in Arizona for me to have to wear a mask, and it truly won’t change anything. I do not vaccinate my kids so, we are healthier and can withstand this fake virus. But after that experience, I am scared and have deleted this app. Thank you for reading, and I truly hope that none of you have to suffer what I suffered. :)","date":"2020-07-09T10:30:05Z"}},{"id":"6175398451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"😔🇱🇷","review":"I downloaded this app because I LOVE Trump, he’s the most hardworking handsome man in the world 🥰🥰but from the very first day i downloaded it my phone started acting weird. So it was on a Monday right, I downloaded the app about around 3pm and by 5 pm my phone would randomly turn off at 100% battery weird right? Yeah I know. Then the next morning I woke up to 24 missed calls from a strange number!! I was so concerned they kept calling and calling it would not stop! So of course like any other fellow American I blocked the number 😀😃😆😁. IT DID NOT STOP THERE. By Wednesday night I noticed my bank account was down to the negatives (I only had $3 let’s be real) but now I was -$2,500 in deep. I called my bank and tried to see where all this was coming from and they think someone hacked my personal info and bought 150 dildos !?!? I tried to remember if I had done anything new when I realized it all started when I downloaded this app😭😢😓😪💔","date":"2020-07-09T06:28:54Z"}},{"id":"6175053239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨trash... but make it an app✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"✨foreigner 🤪✨","review":"I really wish I could give this app 0 stars 🤧. I downloaded this app to support my favorite Cheeto 😗. Five seconds later people showed up at my house. Saying that my dog Martha was a super secret spy 🕵🏻\u200D♀️ from the tiktok mafia. They took my dog away 😔. No worries tho. She’s back now. Martha was an average dog. She went ✨bark✨ ✨bark✨ and ✨ruff✨. Then the people that kidnapped her fed her some alphabet soup 🍜 and what happened was the following. On the way to Martha’s stomach the letters lost their way. They traveled to her brain and now she can talk. Anyways she said that if you don’t rate this app 1 star she will come for you and eat your juicy volumptious cake 🎂. So unless you wanna be flatter than a pancake 🥞 I suggest you do that. Ummm.... oompa loompa 2020 🥳 \nJk ummm.  For legal reasons that was all a joke. But if the FBI wants to come for me... make sure you send DOCTOR SPENCER REID. (Matthew Gray Gubler). Or else I won’t cooperate.😗 if you do happen to send Reid for me.... then I am willing to rate it 2 stars.","date":"2020-07-09T04:24:28Z"}},{"id":"6174693066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely Horrifying!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lmaoDOTkaiya on tiktok","review":"I discovered this app by accident. I thought it would be a great experience. Oh how was that wrong, I have never felt more disrespected in my life! This app nearly blinded me. Never in my life would I have thought to expect such pain and sorrow. The melancholy running through my veins as I watched as a orange man appear. With no excitement, nor grateful expression on my face, I began to realize how big of a mistake I just made. To begin, I was first created by terrible, racist, homophobic, sexist information. This so-called news is what now traumatizes me as a woman: to realize that the man behind this is what some may call president. I honestly wished that some type of light would shine through. I was hoping for a sweet surprise, which I was not greeted with. This is the worst app that has ever surfaced my home screen. Clearly I do not recommend, unless you’d like to support racism. I don’t associate myself with Mister Donald J. Trump. #BlackLivesMatter #YourPresidentIsIgnorant 😹💗🧚🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:53Z"}},{"id":"6174506836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is just not it 👁👄👁👎","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"🙂🙂ross jayla","review":"When I opened the app there was this scary looking orange thing it was so scary it gave me nightmares I had to get therapy for awhile then one I was walking my skateboard I saw the orange thing peaking from the corner I was scared for my life until a car pulled up and someone rolled down the window and said get I was scared for my life I hurried and jumped in the car when I got in the car I was shocked to see that the mysterious person was Barack Obama he gave me a tense look and said I will take care of stay here as I sat In the car I can here the orange thing screaming for help when a local Karen tried to call the police for help I rushed out the car and smacked the phone out her hands and wacked her in the head with my skate bored me and Obama rushed in the car and ran both over after that we went to McDonald’s to get ice scream but of course the ice cream machine was broken and that’s why this is the worst app ever I wish I can give it zero stars...👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:40Z"}},{"id":"6174162724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app is no.. just a no.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Okay...Love","review":"so the first thing that happened when I opened this app was I saw a poor quality picture of a bright orange pig rolling around in money. My toddler and I were deeply disturbed! Then a couple hours later, I was bringing my pet dinosaur gone from getting McDonald’s and I noticed my microwave, fridge, oven, and a/c unit were all gone! What was there in their places? EMPTY CHEETO BAGS! This app not only used my location without my knowledge, it allowed trump to send robbers into my home. Now my pet dinosaur has nothing to eat so he’ll have to settle for a pig. Anyone know where I can get one? Anyway, this app is just horrible. It caused my phone to start glitching really bad. Then after that, both my toddler and my pet dino started levitating almost touching my ceiling saying “𝕥𝕣𝕦𝕞𝕡 𝟚𝟘𝟚𝟘 but 𝖔𝖓 𝖆 🐚🐤  Ｇ𝕣ᗩⓋ𝒆𝐬ŤσＮⒺ  🍪.” After this incident, I was kicked off the app for being a Muslim/ Indian/ Indigenous American/ Mexican/ German. Definitely would not recommend this app at al!!! 😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T23:48:43Z"}},{"id":"6173888744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"a full blown pig pen.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Lilylol101","review":"honestly, I think saying that this app is a pig pen is an insult to pigs. but I can not describe how disgusting, irrational, and irrational this app is. make america great again? more like, make america even more racist. y’all disgust me. we all know trump is too dumb to do this all on his own, his team is the most evil white supremacist organization i’ve seen. they’re comparable to nazi’s, no, they are nazis. you guys are allowing latinx people to be killed in ice custody and you don’t even care. you guys want more of a military budget to scare neighboring and foreign countries even more. america is the manifestation of a macho guy who talks tough and acts like an idiot with their guns in order to scare and yell their way into the highest authority. we need to focus on education funds, homeless shelters, foster homes, public facilities, public transportation, but no. over 30% of our dollar goes towards the pigs and leaves crumbs for the hundreds of other things our taxes pay for. this is not my america.","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:49Z"}},{"id":"6173683436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"virgil251891","review":"The app is inconsistent gives false information that can be easily fact checked perpetuate fascist ideology and on top of all I think the worst thing is that it took more than five seconds to upload. We are constantly comparing ourselves to China and how dare Internet to them and then pretend as if we are better. I should not be able to take five breaths in between when I click to download this app and when it is on my phone. With the president wasting so much of his time on the Internet you would think that he would be able to make a faster app I am greatly disappointed. But not only was the app slow so many errors in it. It continued to spew hatred in an accuracy to the point where I started to convert to a Democrat because I was so disgusted with the representation of the Republican Party. Wish I could give a lower rating than one star this is truly only worth a quarter of a star and that is because I am a kind person","date":"2020-07-08T20:50:11Z"}}]}
