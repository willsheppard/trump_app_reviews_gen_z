That was my first mistake. The second I opened the app I received a strange phone call from an unknown number. Upon answering it like the very wise and high IQ having republican I happen to be, a scratchy voice spoke with very much malice in my ear hole. He said ‚Äúimma flush yo fam down a Japanese toilet‚Äù and I felt my body shiver in horror and fear. When I got home from Walmart in which I wore no mask because I have the right to do whatever I want even if it puts others at risk, I saw a sight I will never EVER forget.... I saw my rich white republican family..... eating chicken with 12k gold sprinkled on top while watching Fox News. Without me. Even my wife Karen broke open the special edition miller light without my permission. I vaguely remember the joke my father told me I missed... he said one of his friends was worried about fishing during the corona virus, and he responded with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry you can‚Äôt never catch anything anyway!‚Äù Disgraceful. I spit. *spits* \nWhile my family was saved from being flushed down a Japanese toilet, i felt like the devil himself was sitting on my shoulders that night.\nAnd it‚Äôs all because of this app right here. \nDownload it, and you too will be a victim of such repulsive behavior. I‚Äôll pray for all of you. Gooooood bless merca.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"bad app no one liked it SMH shaking and crying rn send help plz","date":"2020-07-09T03:40:47Z"}},{"id":"6177195586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Abrahamer<3","review":"when i downloaded this app my storage was immediately filled when it wasn't beforeüò∞.i went to settings to see what was taking up all my storageüò≥. it was the photos appü§î. i was confused because i did not have many pictures or videos before so that shouldn't have been happeningüòî . when i opened the photos app to check what was taking up my storage, i was shockedüò±. the app had downloaded THOUSANDS of photos and videos of ORANGES üçäü§Ø. i showed my mom and she passed out at the sight üòµ. all of the walls in the house then started turning orange ü§Æthe photos and videos also attracted thousands of dancing orange rats and cockroachesüòñ they started dancing all over the house and they broke everything üò®we had to call and exterminator to get rid of them but he said it was going to take longer than usual to get rid of these orange dancing rats and cockroaches üò¨ate all of our money and food those animals . we had nowhere to go so we had to live on the street and since we didn't have any food ü•¥or money, we had to survive on dirt, grass, and bugs üò≠üò≠. it has been weeks since this incident and we are still on the street eating dirt and grass because the dancing orange rats and cockroaches refuse to leave our house üò§. don't make the same mistake i did of downloading this app unless you want to end up on the street eating dirt and grassüòçüå±ü¶üüíñ","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"‚ú®üßöüèΩ\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èTRAGICüßöüèΩ\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®","date":"2020-07-09T15:38:38Z"}},{"id":"6177050774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"happyrissa","review":"The title says it all I opened the app and suddenly I felt a snake like presence so in my throat it was hard for me to breath there was an Extreme pain in my throat so as I was dying on the floor of my room I remembered what our great president suggested we do and crawled across the house to where we keep our bleach I continued to down an entire container of bleach soon after that I started to die but luckily my cousin Stuart Little found me and proceeded to call the police but since we live in a racist society they took a whole year to show up only to then abuse me but luckily they took me to the hospital and I was brought back to life anyway it was a terrible experience unless you have a pain kink I would not recommend, but in all seriousness I don‚Äôt like that we have to give our information to this app because how do we know it is truly ruin by trump and not foreign spies out to kill us and it made me really upset that our president wasn‚Äôt thinking about the greater good also when downloading this app I noticed that the number 2020 kept showing up and just by opening the app I lost track of time and then all the sounded it went from the morning to the time 2020 which I think is no coincidence also I would like for trump Barron to be saved and put into a nice supportive family just a side note that has everything to do with the app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It gave me rona","date":"2020-07-09T14:58:23Z"}},{"id":"6176085528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kanske emdlsbsn","review":"I initially downloaded this app, so I could see content and campaign updates, BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK. First of all, it took WEEKS to download onto my phone. This has never happened before. Once it did download, it took ALL the remaining storage on my phone. I estimate about several GB of data were taken. This is absolutely preposterous ! Once I opened the app I was bombarded with ads. The ads even included R rated content, which is highly inappropriate! There were sooooo many ads that I couldn‚Äôt look at the news for more than 20 seconds before a new add popped up on my screen. What I did see on the news portion was racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and utterly disgusting news. I am at a loss of words as to why Trump and his administration would post such horrible content. I felt offended and attacked by what I was reading, so much so that I went to sleep crying. I also noticed my phone started glitching once I downloaded the app. I couldn‚Äôt do normal activities like call my sick and dying grandmother because the app immensely slowed my phone down. I have reason to believe that this app gave my phone a virus!!! I now have to buy a new phone which will cost me thousands of dollars that I do not have. This app was a mistake. It should immediately be removed from the App Store! I‚Äôve noticed that other have been experiencing similar issues.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T10:29:53Z"}},{"id":"6175477863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jennn R.","review":"After I downloaded this slower-than-Eric-Trump app and completed the registration process, I decided to take a relaxing bath. Just before Calgon was about to take me away, my phone began to ring over and over. I got out of my bath to look at the phone and saw that I had 6 new notifications. 5 of them were pictures of people in my family who had the good sense to download the Biden2020 app instead of this one. The 6th one was also a pic, but it was inexplicably of my neighbor, Mrs. Dondingle, who had put a sign up in her yard this morning that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Y√© in 20twen-tay‚Äù. \nThe pictures were accompanied by text messages saying that each of these people had been kidnapped by the Trump Org. and would not be returned to me until I agreed to ‚Äústeal no fewer than 5,000 mail-in ballots out of the mailboxes of Sleepy Joe supporters and burn them in a bonfire that burns with the intensity of the self righteous anger of 1,000 racist Trump supporters.‚Äù\n5K mail-in ballots is a lot to steal and only hell has fires that hot, so I‚Äôm currently looking for other options to save my 5 Biden-supporting family members. Since Mrs. Dondingle is endorsing Kanye, still has her Christmas lights up in July, and gives out menthol cough drops at Halloween, she‚Äôs not that much of a priority right now. If anyone has any suggestions I‚Äôd love to hear them, and in the meantime DO NOT download this app!üíÄüíÄüíÄ","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Downloader Beware","date":"2020-07-09T07:00:07Z"}},{"id":"6177356165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"RileyJoslin1234","review":"Hi y‚Äôall, Karen here. I downloaded this app hoping to be able to support the best president (that‚Äôs you Donald!) but I am so so SO disappointed in the quality. Everything on this sight is so unholy! I was venturing into different tabs when I found that he‚Äôd put up n*ked mirror pictures! Even worse, I told my kids, Caleb, Mary, and Joseph, that they should download this app on their iPads, prior to me finding the photos. They are children of Jesus, and I do NOT want their pure virgin brains exposed to such vile content! How disgusting, Mr. President. Even worse, there was a FULL NUDE PHOTOSHOOT. I‚Äôm warning you; you cannot unsee it. Luckily, he doesn‚Äôt have much to show off. However, my daughter Mary found the photos on accident and do you know what she told me? She said that she‚Äôs a l*sbian! Mr. President, you made my daughter into a l*sbian! Even worse, I thought that I could at least use your app to find a conversion camp nearby, but you don‚Äôt have any listed. I know Mr. Pence works with them often, so I was hoping I could contact one, but you don‚Äôt have any contact information on your app! Overall, this app has released so much unholy energy I had to have my priest set up holy water stations throughout my home. Also, how come you haven‚Äôt backed holy water as a cure for the Kung Flu? God will protect us all! In the end though, you are still the greatest president in history!

But it automatically glitches and sent me into another dimension where the Cheeto man and his followers were playing golf and riding unicorns while wearing white hoods screaming in pig latin. Then I forgot that I had to feed my pet statue and left the app open on my phone. And a bunch of ads started popping up harassing me to donate money to his campaign. I felt very threatened and so I decided to hide in the bunker but I was startled to find the Cheeto man there. From there he chased me down the street but tripped and and rolled like humpdy dumpy down the wall. I restarted my phone but then the app ran so slow it took me hours to access anything. I wanted to see the fabulous merch he was selling but it wouldn‚Äôt let me see it. I think it was like camouflaged but said something about not caring about our veterans. I was infuriated how could he be so disrespectful? How could normal people with normal brains and that educated support this. So then I went on a rollercoaster to space and talked to my friend in mars and he said that unicorns weren‚Äôt real and I wouldn‚Äôt believe it. The fairies will let them know the way. If you are thinking about downloading this app. DONT. you will lose your soul and ability to think. Don‚Äôt be a sheep. Ba ha ba ha .
