Luckily I was able to distract him by throwing it back. Then I ran away as fast as I could!! I’m lucky to still be alive 😔.

Please leave a bad review on this. I was not at all pleased with anything about this app. From the format to the constant glitches, this app gave me a headache.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174727534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The app itself is awful.","date":"2020-07-09T02:45:16Z","userName":"Schnei_guy92","review":"This app is clunky, ridden with code errors, and terrible. \n\nIt’s also filled with lies and misinformation","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174727347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is BROKEN AND DISGUSTING","date":"2020-07-09T02:45:13Z","userName":"oton663","review":"I downloaded this app to see updates about trump and all his speeches only to be met with a part where it says to put my phone number in. When I put mine in it didn’t even do anything and I spent an entire hour on YouTube trying to figure out why! When I “found” a solution it glitched the ENTIRE app! Kicking me out and lagging my phone everytime I got in! Then my phone overheated and I had to pay 200 DOLLARS TO REPARE IT! I DO NOT! AND I REPEAT DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP TO ANY PEOPLE WANTING TO DOWNLOAD IT! IT WILL BREAK YOUR PHONE AND LEAVE YOU NO CHOICE TO BUY A REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS! I am SO dissatisfied with my purchase. The app is atrocious! DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR PHONE TO BREAK!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174727290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ል̂ዪቿ̂ ሃ̈ዐ̀ሁ̄ ር̧ዐ̃ጠጎ̈ክ́ኗ ፕዐ̈ ዕል̊ ፕዪቿ̂🌳🌲","date":"2020-07-09T02:45:11Z","userName":"TBW_lover","review":"but ya know you guys are all ya guys in on ya i is the one last night i was my birthday yesterday. ya my birthday was yesterday. that was cool. but my dog ate my pink wing. \nr-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️\n\n𝓻𝓮𝓶𝓮𝓶𝓫𝓮𝓻 🤔𝓽𝓱𝓮 ✨𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮𝓼⌛️𝔀𝓮🤞🏾𝓱𝓪𝓭😪𝓽𝓱𝓮 😭 𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮𝓼 ⏰ 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽🤥𝔂𝓸𝓾 👧 𝓪𝓷𝓭😴𝓶𝓮👦 𝓱𝓪𝓭😰 \n\nwhy❓don't⌛we🔪just👽relax😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅radio📻 would👿you😼like💕EMMMM👹or🤪 FMMMM👺\n\nWell🌙you🤡can😎tell🤣by👻the💩way😸i😶use😪my😵walk😱im😓a🤠cheeseball🐦man🦂no🦖time🐢to🙈talk\n\n🅸🅼 🅵🅸🅻🅼🅸🅽🅶😡🅰 🆅🅸🅳🅴🅾 🎬🅼🅰🅼🅰👩\u200D👦🅸🅻🅻 🅱🅴 🆃🅷🅴🆁🅴 🅸🅽 🅰 🅼🅸🅽🆄🆃🅴 ⚠️✨\n\ni🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫\n\nhave🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄\n\nshe 🙈 is 🥰 like 🥳 papi 👹 i 🦚 adore 🪐 you 🍣 im ⛷ like 🚤 baby 🛸 i 🎢 aint 💾 normal ⏳ grr 💸\n\n👽⟟⏁⋉⟒👽⟒⋔⍜⊑👽⍀⏃⏁⏃⌿⏃⍀⏃⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⎍⋔⎍👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍀⏃⏁⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⌰⏃⏁⟒⟒⎅⏃⟒👽⋔⍜⟒👽⎅⍜⍀⟟⋔⟒👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽⍜⌰⋔⟒⋏⏃👽⎅⟒⌿⏃⎅⏃⍀⟟👽⏃⋔⟒⋏⍜👽 ⎅⟟⋔⟒⎅⏃⟒👽\n\nbütthœlês🕳 are🤯nøthïng😡to🙂be🤣łàughed🤬at💅they’re 📈just😻part🤠of😱the👩\u200D🦱human🦶body 🧠\n\nand🤭make🤩a🤥video👺with🗿screenshots🧿exposing😈my👹BULLIES 👻these🥴are🤡BULLIES☠️these👾are👽HIGH🙀SCHOOL📝FŪÇKÎÑG BÜŁŁÍĘŠ\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆\n\nꫝꫀꪶꪶꪮ😴𝓲 👻like👄ŔÛśțý🥄Şpűñş🥄i🧠 like🥊to🗾 t҈o҈u҈c҈h҈🤘 t҈h҈e҈m҈ ✨the😲 feeling👅of👁️ꋪꀎꌚ꓄🥄against🎐my👣ነልረልጋ🥗f҉i҉n҉g҉e҉r҉s҉👈\n\nmy👑names💫eMiLy💓and🥳i’m🤩FiVeEeE😳i🧚\u200D♀️like😌playing❣️roblox😱and🥺i💝like🌸going🌲oUtSiDeEeE🍄\n\nIf😡you😴Ever😆see😱me🥰fighting👍🏾in💖a🍯forest🥺with✌🏾a😠grizzly🥴bear🐔HELP💔🥴THE😔BEAR💯","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174725780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Tik tok","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:45Z","userName":"Ben dover jack goff","review":"Trump is a dumb ass","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174725084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:33Z","userName":"Astrid Marbile","review":"he👽has🧚\u200D♂️no😜lips\uFFFC😇how😒will😤he😌get😺a😹kiss👿kiss😼very🤢ugly😿no👨🏻\u200D🦳kiss🤠for🥱him💩","isEdited":false}}]}
