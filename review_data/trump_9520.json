I thought I had fixed it but the second I got a notification, my\nphone would turn off and not turn back on!!! I tried to go back and delete the stupid app once I got it working again, but everytime I try, it closes right after I open it!! MAJOR issues with this app; I might have to get an entirely new phone if this keeps happening!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:42:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jbradley27","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174873476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolute ✨T R A S H✨","review":"A few moments after downloading the app I kept on getting tons of unwanted notifications. I tried to turn it off in the app settings, but even then I kept on getting harassed by the notifications from this app😡 Shortly after that my phone started glitching. I’m honestly not even surprised with the quality of this app considering the quality of the way the people are being treated by the man this app is about is disgustingly low😒","date":"2020-07-09T03:28:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"damons_stubble","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174869623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST. APP. EVER.","review":"I downloaded this app to support the love of my life💍👰🏻 and let’s just say I was more than disappointed😡. I was under the impression that I would be able to contact my ex-lover Donny🌈💖 at any time; however, that was not the case🤬. I am EXTREMELY insulted and will be writing some very strongly worded emails to the Trump Administration💗💗.  If Don Don really wanted to be President again I think he would have gone to greater lengths to connect with his subjects🥰🤍✌🏻. A total scam if you ask me🎅🏻🎅🏻.","date":"2020-07-09T03:27:46Z","rating":1,"userName":"eac2448","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174853864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Everything is just wrong","review":"This app is the worst thing to ever exist. One day I was on it and then a pop up came on and told me that I’m ugly. And that I should drop kick myself off a couch. And I know that may sound silly but get this. I was walking past this person and they saw the app on my phone and they sprayed me with Lysol. And I’ll do it again if I have too. But anyways, this app caused my phone to have a virus. And now it’s glitching. Donald J trump you better buy me a new phone.","date":"2020-07-09T03:23:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"bobthebuilder(girl)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174826652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Make My Phone Work Again (MMPWA)","review":"This app BRICKED my phone. As soon as I downloaded said app, I was greeted by notifications, hundreds of them, this app is honestly too much and has made my phone lag. As I tried to access some of the features on the app, my phone was slow, afterwards when I left the app IT BRICKED MY PHONE. Terrible app, the developers and president should be ashamed at how terrible they are at everything. Thank you for listening to my 2 cents;)","date":"2020-07-09T03:15:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"Dallas.xi","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174746983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App of All Time!!!!!!","review":"Wow, this app has to be the worst ever. I opened the app and I immediately got hacked😭 They stole all my information! They later sent a bunch of angry two year olds to my house😒 The two year olds were causing a rampage. They ripped my pictures and destroyed my furniture. I watched in horror as they threw tantrums😫They eventually left, but I had to enroll in therapy🤬 I still stay awake at night terrified of the trauma I experienced. Do not under any circumstances download this horrendous app😡😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T02:51:12Z","rating":1,"userName":"Rachel The Star","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174702883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤏🤏🍤🍤🖕🖕","review":"As soon as I got the app I received multiple texts from the app demanding that I give them my address. One hour later trump and all of his sidekicks threw tomatoes and raw fish at me on my own doorstep!! I am deathly allergic to fish and I started chocking and intensely wobbling on the floor! Trump and his sidekicks continued to throw more fish at me and laugh. Luckily the ambulance showed up on time as trump continued to chase the ambulance throwing more raw fish! 1 star I don’t recommend getting this app unless you like fish and rapists!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:37:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"grace4455332211","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174700473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP","review":"I would rate this app a -100 if it was possible, I downloaded this and as soon as I got it, my phone starting glitching like I couldn’t type text it even appeared on my lock screen, I was horrified!\nI kept trying to close the tab but everytime I did the SAME THING KEPT HAPPENING!!!! this is a horrible app and I cannot believe that this app messes up my phone! IF YOU DONT WANT YOUR PHONE GLITCHING DO NOT GET THIS APP I REPEAT! Save your self the time and patience because I didn’t and I’m annoyed with this app!","date":"2020-07-09T02:37:07Z","rating":1,"userName":"bsjabfisnansfmwdnfj","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174688990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bugs Everywhere","review":"This app is terrible, it keeps glitching and freezing up and kicking me off. There are also other bugs where they have a bunch of republicans out here that they need to fix and get rid of. Too many cockroaches for my taste and I come from a rural area. Please don’t download if you value social media and freedom of speech. Also it seriously does have a terrible bug issue with the app itself and not the republican thing.","date":"2020-07-09T02:33:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"Multiple game","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174688550","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"100% WOULD NOT RECOMMEND","review":"i downloaded this app to see my favorite bag of m&ms but got something worse!!! When i opened the app a 40 foot demogorgon slide out of my closet yelling chicken wing chicken wing hot dog and baloney chillen with my homies. It was honestly so terrifying! i can’t even sleep at night anymore because there’s someone named steve who apparently works for some dude named Notch at my window not to mention the rancid smell that omits from cloud of dust that omits from my phone every time i open the app! It’s truly disgusting.☃️","date":"2020-07-09T02:33:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"a.vanilla","isEdited":false}}]}
