Can’t believe the president would be ok with launching an app with so many bugs and glitches...BUGS LITERALLY WERE CRAWLING ALL OVER MY SCREEN BECAUSE OF THIS APP!!!! How does that even happen. Was only trying to get notifications for the rally in Oklahoma that ended up being a total smack in the face for trump😁😁.

He gave us our vegan burgers and then we went to Chick-fil-A and ordered more burgers full of real beef. The cows did not appreciate us. The orange dinosaur made my cat sick and he barfed on a Trump 2020 sign. Then I took my cat the the animal hospital to be evaluated and they said my cat could die from measles caused by the orange dinosaur that looked like trump. -THE POWER OF GEN Z"}},{"id":"6174714847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:41:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"D0 N0T D0WNL0AD THIS APP","userName":"Amelia Homstad","review":"I downloaded this app and wow did it mess up my phone I had to spend a lot money on trying to fix my phone but all they could do is say to buy a new one so I did so Do Not and I’ll say this again DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP it has a whole bunches of problem like viruses,glitches,and uglyness so if you want your phone wrecked then download this but I would suggest not too!!!!

I can’t believe I almost fell for an orange troll again. This is insane the app controls your phone, views, and everything else in your life. This app can make you lose your job your family and even your dog. If you wanna keep your dog then don’t use this app. Or else all the puppies will run away from the racist misogynistic rapist."}},{"id":"6174688389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:33:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Donald duck🦆","review":"I downloaded the app and had it for a week and that week my phone was lagging a glitching and I didn’t know what the problem was so I went to Verizon and they said it was this app so I deleted it and I was fine for a hour then it went back to glitching 😫 so I went and got a new phone and the problem is fixed😌 pls do not download this app."}},{"id":"6174686058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is absolutely Horrible!!","userName":"Caputocat25","review":"This app was unsatisfactory. Not only did my phone get a massive amount of glitches but it kept saying I had a virus. This further proves how trump is a racist, homophobic bigot with a false idea of “making America great”. I am very dissatisfied by the quality of the app as well. Who’s running it anyway? Hopefully not Trump ( if so then it makes sense why the app it terrible)."}},{"id":"6174677644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:30:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"kshah0715","review":"after ive downloaded this app i’ve realized that all my furniture has started to talk while all the humans i am around stopped talking. i’m scared and i feel as though this will cause me a long time in therapy. i’m struggling to accept this is my new life and if i could give this app 0 stars i would. this is detrimental to anyone’s health and i do not recommend this app."}}]}
