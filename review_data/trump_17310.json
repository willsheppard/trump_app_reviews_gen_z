I was hoping to be able to help my community and inform myself with this app but all it did was confuse me and make my phone slower which I find completely unacceptable. The app lacked creativity and balance which honestly reminds me of my parents marriage."}},{"id":"6178364235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:51:16Z","title":"app stinky","isEdited":false,"userName":"girly pop 2007","rating":1,"review":"this app made my phone run slower and made me feel a little icky having it downloaded. I would really love to see it taken off of the app store because i’m pretty sure it gives your phone a virus? kinda gives off a racist vibe and we need to leave that in the last century. overall would not recommend to anyone 💖👄🙈🧚"}},{"id":"6178359556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:49:28Z","title":"terrible.","isEdited":false,"userName":"user309676548","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded the app to stay updated on donny but every time i opened it it would glitch, i restarted my phone but now it’s at the point where i cant even go on the app because if i do my phone freezes.  i KNOW it’s not my phone because i have an iphone 11, this app does not work!! at all!  please fix it or delete it."}},{"id":"6178341624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:42:34Z","title":"Lags","isEdited":false,"userName":"KierstynEmber","rating":1,"review":"I’m not a supporter of the whole gen z thing going around on TikTok, but this app was extremely laggy and stopped me from getting into any other of my games, it’s not a good app and it takes up too much space for me, I hardly have any photos or apps and this definitely didn’t happen before I downloaded this.

A Virus?","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nomarbosox5","rating":1,"review":"What’s going on with this app? It keeps crashing.  It’s like my phone got a Chinese Virus from this app. My phone is running out of energy way quicker now.  I need to keep it charging on the iHome all the time. Ever since I downloaded this app my phone won’t change to dark mode. All the notifications were in CAPS anyway. I’m voting it out and downloading a new app."}},{"id":"6178257579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T21:11:31Z","title":"THE worst app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"tinerlo","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of seeing and keeping up with what our president Donald Trump has been up to during the re-elections and what he plans on doing prior to all of that.

I was looking forward to what bunker boy put out for us but this app has destroyed my home and finances🤧. When I opened the app up for the first time the plant next to me died from the pure stench of ignorance bunker boy spews. Not to mention my microwave explodes every time I even look at the app icon. 0/5 stars😾🦶 #settleforbiden"}}]}
