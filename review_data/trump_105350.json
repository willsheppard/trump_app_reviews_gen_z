I looked in the mirror. My sapphire blue eyes sparkled with fear. I was so scared, but of what? Nothing really happened...all I did was...download an app? An app for my my daddy dearest Donald. But something was wrong. The app wasn’t like any other I’d ever seen before with my beautiful, glistening gems one would call my eyes. The instant it downloaded, my phone shook, more like vibrated violently, before settling again into my supple flesh carrots one might call my hands.\n\nBut then, I heard three knocks on the door, echoing from the hallway all the way into my room, and finally into the cute little waxy wells one night call my ears. I couldn’t imagine who might be there, but I could feel the diabolical energy radiating throughout my body. I wrapped my new Brandy Melville cardigan around me (this was getting serious) and exited my room into the hallway. Three knocks...exactly three. Could it be Chad? No, he never knocks before breaking down my door and spilling his freshly caught fish all over the coffee table. I blushed at the thought, but Chad wasn’t here to save me now. Could it be...oh no. I shuddered at the thought in my little hard jelly bean one might call my head and pulled my cardigan tighter around me. \n\nDown the stairs, I descended toward the front door. Everything inside me was screaming not to do what I was about to do...and perhaps I should have listened. But right now, I didn’t care. I took a deep breath into my pink puffy flesh clouds one might call my lungs. Mustering all the courage I had, I opened the door. \n\nOh...oh god. The black yogurt bowls one might call my pupils dilated at what was in front of me. My body could only freeze at the sight. It was...a....a black teenager. \n\nI could only begin to process what I was seeing with my now giant glowing blue orbs. I could only hear tidbits of “excuse me” and “would you like to learn about Jesus Christ” before I immediately exploded and died. Don’t download this app.","userName":"Mckaeighla 💕✨","date":"2020-07-09T13:48:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY","rating":1}},{"id":"6176757225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"that’s all i have to say. yeah ❤️","userName":"sienanna.na","date":"2020-07-09T13:40:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is terrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6176599452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app blew up my house","userName":"IMsbehe","date":"2020-07-09T12:58:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"trash","rating":1}},{"id":"6176593659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is terrible!!","userName":"Ais Raine","date":"2020-07-09T12:57:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TRASH","rating":1}},{"id":"6176554035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"hated every second of it","userName":"lbnot","date":"2020-07-09T12:46:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"ew","rating":1}}]}
