disappointed!","userName":"i.z.z.yyyyysjdjs","review":"Like one of my peers I was expecting “great” things such as Spencer Reid coming to my poolside. I sat outside for 17 hours waiting for him to show up. After 2 whole days I finally went back inside. A week later I get a knock on the door. My mother yells “y/n get off of your lazy butt up and go get the door! I’m busy doing other things! Stop being selfish”. I quickly threw my brunette hair into a messy bun and stared at my crystal blue orbs in the mirror. I’m walked downstairs thinking “it’s probably just a package”. When I opened the door I was shocked to find 6 boys standing there. The one in the front being boyband hair Spencer Reid himself. “Are you y/n” he asked with his deep voice. “Who wants to know” I quickly said back. Something flashed in his eyes. Anger. “Don’t test him” a boy with brown hair said in the back. “I’m Reid. This is Harry” he pointed to the boy who had warned me before. “That’s Niall” he said pointing to the blond “ and that’s Zayn” he said looking at the one with black hair “and that’s Louis and Liam” he said pointing to the boys furthest from me. He looked back to me and said “we’ve come to Collect you”.  “Mom!!” I screamed while trying to shut the door but it was no use, Reid used his arm to keep the door open. My mother comes down stairs stumbling as she walks towards me. “Oh mr. Reid. Do you have the stuff?” She asked. What stuff? He handed her something  and pushed me towards him. “Y/n I sold you to them. Go” I stumbled into his chest. Be wraps his big strong arms around me. I felt comfort... weird. “Mom how could you do this to me?” I asked shocked. “I never cared about you. Leave. What they’re giving me is better” and then we left. My future is unclear but there maybe a certain boy who makes it better. An ex profiler turned criminal named Spencer Reid. \n\nAnyways this app got me kidnapped by Spencer Reid and one direction. 🧚\u200D♀️❤️✨🌸"}},{"id":"6178116440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:22:18Z","title":"Disgusting","userName":"icetothisd!ck","review":"If I could give this app -10000 stars I would 🥰 Donald Trump is a white supremacist ✨🧚🏽 if you vote for him you’re a white supremacist ✨🧚🏽🌚🥰 BLM pro choice babyyyy"}},{"id":"6178116262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:22:14Z","title":"The worst app ever mad in history!","userName":"𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑒","review":"First when I open the app I felt threatened to vote for Trump.
