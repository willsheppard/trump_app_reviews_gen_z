She was talking about how much she loved trump. I overheard her saying this and i SCREAMED in horror of what this boomer had become. It was a very loud scream. So loud that I broke my vocal cords and everyone in the room went deaf. Then I saw him, D*nald J. Tr*mp on the app. When I saw his face i barfed and went blind. I barfed so hard that my head turned purple. After about 2 minutes everyone could hear now. My mother rushed me to the ER. Once we were there I had surgery to fix my vocal cords. Then my father walked in. He said \"sweetie i have a surprise for you\" and in walk Barron Trump. 😍 I was immensely excited to meet him. Me and barron spent hours talking. After I was released from the hospital Barron asked me if i would like to stay at the White House with him. What do you think i said? I OBVIOUSLY said yes 🙄. I got to ride on Barrons private jet. It was filled with the most extraordinary chocolates. The plane landed and we were at the White House. In i walked and i must say it was quite cold in there. As barron showed me to my room i could smell the horrible smell of sweat, grease, and a BIGMAC. \"Barron what is that stench?\" I said. But barron was no where to be found. I stumbled upon Melania who politely asked why i was in the house. I explained how barron had invited me. With a frown she said \" Have fun\" and went down the elevator. I walked in the room where the horrible stench was coming from. That is where i saw the orange thing. He screamed at me. Asked why i was in his office. I couldn’t answer him because i don’t speak racist transphobe. He threw me out and i landed on the hard concrete. Barron rushed me into the hospital. The orange thing took barron away from me while i was still unconscious in the hospital. I can’t find him. And now i’m lost in the woods after i left the hospital. I don’t know where my family is or barron. So i advise you please don’t download this app. \n\nXOXO \nAnonymous","title":"🤡","rating":1,"userName":"Lauv 😍 Lauv 😡 Lauv 😭","date":"2020-07-08T19:51:17Z","isEdited":false}}]}
