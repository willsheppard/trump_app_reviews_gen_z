If he bans tick tock I swear I will spray some disinfectant in his brain. Maybe that would clear his head of all that bull shirt. BLM and to anyone reading this (unless your a trump supporter... or a racist... or homophobic) have a wonderful day. Duck this app and the man himself."}},{"id":"6179736365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:13:39Z","userName":"taytaybloom","title":"Honestly Trash","review":"I honestly feel so bad for the Cheetos brand because this man is doing them a disservice. Actually he is the disservice to America. But also are we not gonna talk about how this Cheeto puff is basically a realtor so all he does is buy and sell. Therefore he is selling America to the highest bidder. Not to mention that his OWN MOTHER said that she hopes he didnâ€™t get into politics. Need I say more."}},{"id":"6179736037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T06:13:32Z","userName":"mysterious_scarlett","title":"WORST APP EVER DONT GET ITðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®","review":"So I downloaded this app to see what all the fuss was all about.

A few days went by and I heard loud banging on my front door, not knowing what to expect I opened the door only to be drop kicked by President Trump. I fell to the ground screaming in pain while he started laughing hysterically and spraying silly sting all over me. As I pleaded for help he had his babysitter Kayleigh McEnany bring his afternoon snack for him. As He munched on his lunchable Cheese and crackers I laid on the floor covered in silly string with my whole body aching after taking a blow to the stomach from a 439 pound President. Just as I thought this nightmare was over my 6 year old brother arrived home from school and as soon as President Trump caught sight of him he started calling him names teasing him and making fun of him. My brother started crying feeling helpless and that is when President Trump ordered his staff to silly string my brother along with me. The two of us suffered as President Trump skipped thought my house (denting the wooden floors and staining the walls orange) and headed back to the White House. My brother and I are still trying to recover from that traumatic experience."}}]}
