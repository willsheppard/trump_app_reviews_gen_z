But then *CRASH* confused, I looked outside my window and to my surprise I saw a flag, it was blue and red and it read ‘Vote Trump 2020’. I thought about that message for a few hours and decided I needed more details so naturally I looked it up on the internet and I saw this app. I decided “Hey what could go wrong” and let me tell you it was like Murphy’s Law... everything that could go wrong DID go wrong! I saw a weird spectacle on my arm (being an anti-vaxxer this was normal but this was like no other little scare) I look in the mirror and saw THAT THE MIRROR NOT ONLY WAS IT BROKEN (that’s 7 years of bad luck) BUT I WAS BROKE MYSELF! And worst of all I was a female  🤢🤮. I can’t stress this enough if you don’t want to become a poor female do not get this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176880155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sji211","date":"2020-07-09T14:12:54Z","title":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of helping out with the Trump campaign, but not even minutes after downloading, I received what seemed like a thousand calls all at once. I would pick up the phone, but there would be another incoming call; then I’d pick up that call, and my phone would continue buzzing from another incoming call, and so on so forth, making my phone completely unusable. This went on for HOURS. Actually, it might have gone on for even longer because it was still buzzing when I decided to burn my phone. I was INCREDIBLY fed up with the calls, and I thought my phone was broken. Turns out, NOPE! It was just this app. My good friend Karen received call after call after call after downloading this app as well! Terrible thing for Trump to force his supporters to go through. I am now voting for Joe Biden.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176313982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"poopyface7363","date":"2020-07-09T11:39:54Z","title":"HORRIBLE","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because i fully support trump obviously, (TRUMP 2020) and as soon as i did it took over an hour to load and kicked me off the app everytime i tried to go on it. as soon as i did it asked me for my phone number to get notifications so i did and from there i got over 300 spam text messages asking for my credit card number and ss number. i didn’t give it and typed STOP but it didn’t stop. it asked for my email so i gave it and from there they hacked all my other social media’s and my bank was completely drained of all the money i had in there! ($420) which was all my money. they then found my address and came to my house and actually killed me and then when i asked for an apology they left me on seen!!! terrible app and i will be voting for biden this coming election. terrible app do NOT download🧚🏼\u200D♂️🤬😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176027916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"changed mh life","date":"2020-07-09T10:11:18Z","title":"No❤️","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to come more in connection with my non-ra)cist and non-ra9ist president. And in this I found that this app was HORRIBLE!!! It asked for my INFO !! If TIKTOK doesn’t ask for my info why should I give it to my “lovely” president i call Donald Duck.  I found the sign up page very insensitive, what if people don’t like Trump why should they have to see his face?! He can’t force that on us and we won’t let him. On a real note, trump has done absolutely NOTHING to gain my respect and never will. He is taking the freedom away from our country, and in no way will I ever support that. I hope one day all you donald duck supports come in the right mind, he is not my president and never will be. Anyways, the sign up sheet only showed people of the Caucasian descent, HOW RUDE!!! Do not download this app. Goodie🤗✨🧚 without the goo🧏\u200D♂️ no hearts because he doesn’t deserve any.👨\u200D🦲","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175826803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Rachels420","date":"2020-07-09T09:05:04Z","title":"Hi","rating":1,"review":"Hi. I was eager to download this app to help support another four years of trumps amerikkka. But then the app literally took 69 weeks to download, thats not even the best part. Once I opened the app, I was greeted with a message saying that all of my information has been taken and that I no longer had rights to myself, body and mind. Then I got a ransom email telling me that trump kidnapped my dog and will kill him if I don’t stop researching pizza gate because of course he is involved. He admits to being involved in this app!! Wow what a great guy. Then the real Donald trump sent me 420 texts that consist of homophobic remarks, racial slurs, and sexist comments, as well as him trying to get me to “Netflix and chill” a term he said he saw on Twitter. THEN Donald showed up to my home demanding my phone, as I questioned why, he grabbed me with one hand and stabbed me with another. Then my phone blew up killing us both.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175775728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Usopp from One Piece👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-09T08:47:39Z","title":"Ruined  my phone ⚰️","rating":1,"review":"i wanted to download this app because i wanted to support our non racist, non rapist, president who values black lives and makes America better place, for every person (no matter which race they are from).

Right after I downloaded it, a group of ninjas broke into my house and stole basically all of my kitchen appliances. Right after they left with my kitchen stuff, a mutant orangutan broke through the walls of my room and had explosive diarrhea all over my bedroom. IT SMELLED SO BAD! And that’s not all... it was bad enough that my room already smelled like manure, but then all of my technology played this video of Will Schuester rapping and then proceeded to explode! Upset and exhausted from all of the catastrophic events, I decided to go look for a solution: DELETE THIS APP! I tapped the app to delete it but then a tornado destroyed my entire neighborhood and rabid opossums started attacking me! What kind of app causes this much destruction? I can’t imagine all of the other horrendous tragedies everyone else has been through with this chaotic app... this needs to be put to a stop!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174745527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lauren Hagen","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:46Z","title":"this app is so scary!","rating":1,"review":"the SECOND i opened the app i was greeted with a HUGH picture of trumps face and the message “all lives matter” flashing across the screen. once i got past that horrendous title screen, i was locked into the app. i cant escape it. it won’t let me leave. if i turn my volume all the way up i can hear trump whispering things like “trump 2020”, “all lives matter”, and “let’s build that wall”. is he trying to subliminally turn me into a republican? even when my phone’s volume is all the way off i can still hear the whispering. i managed to get out of the app for a couple of seconds so i can delete it. please don’t use this app if you cause about your life and your loved ones. i’ve lost many friends to this horrible app. they all became hypnotized by trumps voice. i repeat, DONT USE THIS APP IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES. stay safe out there y’all✨","isEdited":false}}]}
