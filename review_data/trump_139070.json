Against the popular vote my family downloaded this on my phone. I guess that’s what happens when you have the electoral college. Then I had to deal with all the lies and tweets that it sends as notifications for 4 years. Do not recommend, hopefully won’t need it for another 4 years.","userName":"yikesno2020","date":"2020-07-10T05:43:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The absolute worst","rating":1}},{"id":"6179653433","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app didn’t really have that “wow” factor to me. I’ve seen better made apps that are more useful. Worse yet, it took FOUR years to finally delete and I’ve felt so ashamed to have it on my phone for that long of a time. Really didn’t do anything that whole time too, was just a waste of energy and room. Do not recommend.","userName":"such a discgrace","date":"2020-07-10T05:43:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Took four years to delete","rating":1}},{"id":"6179653427","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hear me outtttt \n\nthe app has the audacity to say the FILTHY SENTENCE “trump 2020”","userName":"Debbie nashsa","date":"2020-07-10T05:43:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"What a bad app don’t waste your time unless you want scoliosis 👁👄👁","rating":1}},{"id":"6179653387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i am an independent and know mr trump is the best candidate for this years election. you’re upset bc bernie dripped out😭😢😭😢","userName":"cheasdd","date":"2020-07-10T05:43:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"donnie","rating":5}},{"id":"6179653294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open this app and I was horrified by the Oompa Loompa guy I was so scared my fake tan came off","userName":"hbbuggbhub","date":"2020-07-10T05:43:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Scared","rating":1}},{"id":"6179653158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took 3 years to load!
