Even as someone who is younger and have experience navigating apps for years this app just put me off by just even the apps logo, its inherently disgusting and if you support trump then you’re a white supremacist.","isEdited":false,"userName":"wompstompy","rating":1,"title":"Blasphemy"}},{"id":"6177939794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T19:24:25Z","review":"I was excited 😊 at first but then I NOTICED THIS WAS NOT A TACO 🌮 BELL APP  .....My friend BIG BOOTY JUDY told me that TRUMP IS TAKING TIK TOK DOWN so I sat in a lawn chair 🪑 for the rest of the day.....

I now have to get surgical treatment to fix my skin color. I would not recommend this for anyone ever. It’s absolutely horrible. I’m mocked walking the street as a mini trump. I even tried therapy and the therapists would laugh at me.

I would also like to say that it was quite disgusting how the first image I was presented when opening it was a t*rd. I hope that this app improves or if not, deleted. Overall I believe that this app is deserving of less than one star but regrettably that is not an option. Do better Trump. 😢","isEdited":false,"userName":"caroline.xiv","rating":1,"title":"Disappointing"}},{"id":"6177664250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:59:29Z","review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP. My young son was playing with my phone when he accidentally launched the app. Normally, I would be proud of him for seeking out information on our current political climate. However, when he opened the application, he saw THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST in the phone screen. The ghost proceeded to possess him and now I have to deal with exorcist bills. Thanks a lot.","isEdited":false,"userName":"😅😔😎😔😎🧐😳😔😃😢😳😂😁","rating":1,"title":"Heart been broke so many times 👁👄👁 🦗🦟🦗🦟"}},{"id":"6177550742","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:23:02Z","review":"this app took like a week to download and it would crash my phone text random people and the app isn’t worth anyone’s time so don’t get it 🥰","isEdited":false,"userName":"eggs and chips","rating":5,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP"}}]}
