It needs to be off the app store for good. The app was just horribly designed and the colors made my eyes hurt. Also, the pictures of clown made my eyes bleed. Plus, you’re already rich, why are you asking the people you tax to donate to you? So selfish. Everything about this app is just plain wrong. Take it down. I would give it 0 stars if I could.","title":"Absolutely horrid.","userName":"zaynghk","rating":1}},{"id":"6137190372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T20:14:58Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to keep up to date with our wonderful and amazing president, but I am greatly disappointed in our president. When trying to log onto the app it takes centuries for the screen to appear. Not only that, the app asks for to much information, to the point where it’s breaking boundaries. Honestly don’t get this app. \nrather your should ✨Stream blackpink ✨","title":"Laggy","userName":"shsjenskabenenwkqbs","rating":1}},{"id":"6136457167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T15:56:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded as soon as i opened it, it completely took over my phone. every time i clicked any other app it would take me straight to this one this app gave my device 37 different viruses and it even went as far to give ME the STOMACH VIRUS!!!!! I feared for my life because of this terrible app and I am absolutely disgusted don’t ever get it!!!","title":"Dangerous and exceedingly horrible!!!","userName":"Phegina Ralange","rating":1}},{"id":"6135013117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T08:23:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was more than happy to support my president as much as I can. But I have to admit I have not been more fearful of my life . I’ve been hearing what seems like Donald j trumps voice everywhere. When I would go to where I hear it coming from, a single Cheeto would be on the floor. And when I wake up there’s always a chunky oompa loompa man shaped marking on my sheets. Do not, I REPEAT! .. do not get this app! You were warned.","title":"Disturbing","userName":"vivssss_","rating":1}},{"id":"6134839786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T07:16:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I AM FURIOUS!!! I am a mother of four and of course a woman of god and lover of our lord and savior Donald J. Trump, or at least I was! As soon as I opened the application on my device Donald contacted me personally to tell me I should vaccinate my kids and that I would be excommunicated from the church!!!! ON TOP OF THIS HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS MUCH TO BIG TO FIT INTO ANY OF HIS MERCHANDISE!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Needless to say I will be returning all of the Trump memorabilia and deleting the app! I encourage all to do the same! \n\nPs.

I put a bandaid on it so it stopped but then out of nowhere my dog threw up after having a picture of Trump-kun pop up. After comforting my dog I realized that I left my cookies in the oven for too long. They’re basically charcoal now, so I had to deal with this app AND burnt cookies. In conclusion this app made my cookies taste like the presiden– I mean clownery 👻👻👻🐷🤠👌😈😁🤪😯🤡","title":"So Basically It‘s Doodoo 💩😚💅","userName":"Sam🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗","rating":1}},{"id":"6134409717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T04:22:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hate this app!

It kept going off nonstop telling me to vote for Trump. I’m not even eligible to vote 🙈. Anywhoooo, I kept getting random calls to go donate, but I haven’t even received my paycheck. My boss got mad at me because it kept going off, so now I lost my job. 😔. Hopefully this app gets the fix it needs, because it needs it, along with the fixing of our government, so go vote 🧚\u200D♀️🥰!

The liberals will tell you he isn’t trustworthy, but they’re WORNG! You can go look up his tax returns right now because and trustworthy president would release their tax returns. Anyways Trump 2020!

I know nothing about designing apps but I bet I could make a better app than whoever made this garbage. I spent 6 years of school using a Lenovo think pad which is by far the slowest computer I have ever used and yet Lenovo has better programming than this app.","title":"The app is the equivalent to a Lenovo thinkpad","userName":"voku19","rating":1}}]}
