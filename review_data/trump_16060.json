A children’s app caused your rally to be empty (which it would have been anyway, did you see his inauguration 💀) and now you wanna throw a fit and ban it? Well say bye-bye to your precious campaign app you Bunker B*TCH!!! Ha ha ha loser. I hope you lose the election. Go cry in your “Trump tower” ya big baby!

I had to reset my phone a good 6 times for it to stop. Then as the next few days go by ever time I click on an app it takes me straight off it.
