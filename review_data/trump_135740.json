First, my skin started to get a strange orange hue. Then, I noticed that I started to stand in odd positions, and no matter what I did I couldn’t remember how to stand properly. Then, I noticed that my words started coming out stranger and stranger. It’s almost as if I forgot the proper pronunciation of words. I also started combining words and making up my own. Then, I noticed that I started becoming more and more narcissistic. I thought I knew everything. I knew more than anyone. I’ve studied greatly. The experts know nothing. It’s FAKE NEWS. Then I started noticing I felt the urge to become very sexually inappropriate with women. Then, I noticed my hair started to fall out, so I started doing a very odd combover type thing. Slowly, my brain has started becoming larger and larger. I’m now a stable genius, and I’m capable of doing anything! Next, I set a bunch of cops and National Guard on peaceful protesters so I could take photos. Next I felt a very strong urge to cut taxes for the rich while increasing taxes for the poor. Then I decided I should take away healthcare for everyone I know, but especially for transgender people. Then I decided I should run a bunch of scams, like a fake school, and take millions of dollars from kids and young adults. Then I decided to praise white supremacists a good people while calling black people thugs and violent people. This is because all of a sudden I had a really strong urge to become racist af. I refuse to rent to people of color or hire them for jobs. This app has ruined my life.. Does all of this sound very bad and odd, and make me sound like an awful person?.. well if you think so, then you’d also know that these are all perfect examples of what Donald Trump does on a daily basis 😂😂 ACAB. Defund the police. F**k Trump. Vote him out. Vote out every single republican that enables him too. 🤷🏻"}},{"id":"6132636109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"AliciaHollywood","title":"This app tracks you and everything you do!","date":"2020-06-28T16:47:30Z","review":"This app puts something on your phone that tracks you! I went to an office building that had a Starbucks attached and after I got a notification that said that if I donated the money I spent at Starbucks to Trump I could help make America great again. Then after I went to Ralph’s supermarket, it did the same thing! I ordered lawn chairs on Amazon and it gave me a list of books to read while I’m relaxing on my new lawn chairs! So it’s tracking me online too!  I turned off notifications on my phone and now it is texting me. It knows EVERYWHERE I go and every website I visit and even suggested I recommend the app to a personal friend I had been texting! This app is nefarious! DELETING!"}},{"id":"6132628975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"peggy 👁👄👁","title":"shrimp 🍤","date":"2020-06-28T16:45:07Z","review":"When i downloaded this app it asked me for my phone number. For what? And it made me put in my zip code. When I got into the app there was a lot of trash talking going on and it was so unprofessional for our president to do that. Also to make matters worse when I downloaded the app I got a call from my dad that my mom died... then later as I was looking around the app my dog went missing, but I found him In my oven. This app is cursed!!! And to make matters even MORE worse the app had a adult section! ugh I would’ve expected better out of our president 😒"}},{"id":"6132382996","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"de trè","title":"antichrist👺","date":"2020-06-28T15:25:04Z","review":"if you guys want the antichrist in office, this is perfect for you\n\nbunker boy💞🤩💅🏼homophobic little piss boy. little bunker boy. small cheeto man🧚\u200D♂️✨🦋😚\n\n#blm #1312 #themannywillnotbetelevised\n👁👄👁🖕"}},{"id":"6132345180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"shawtyslikeayuhhgetintoittt","title":"Disgusting 🤢🤮","date":"2020-06-28T15:12:58Z","review":"This app is TERRIBLE I hate it sooo much it always glitches and I hate it so yea also I hate Trump.
