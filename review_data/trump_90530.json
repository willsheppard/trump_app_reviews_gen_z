App. Ever.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to get information about my BEAUTIFUL President Trump's re-election plans, but instead the app started glitching and crashing. Every so often the app would flash to a picture of some hideous orange man. That man will now be in my nightmares. After the app stopped glitching, I entered my phone number to sign up for the app, but when I did, I kept receiving texts filled with this emoji: 🍊, along with texts that said: \"👮🏻\u200D♂️🔪🩸🤬--->🧑🏿\u200D🦱\" I couldn't quite decode the message of the second text 🤔💭 but anyways, after I received a spam of  those messages, I received a text that stated \"Text STOP to unsubscribe from these messages. TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸\" So, I sent \"STOP\" but when I did my phone started glitching with the face of that horrid orange man again, who looked angry because I wanted to stop receiving texts. Then my phone EXPLODED! 💣🧨 The smell of orange that came from my ruined phone attracted a pack of rats. I didn't know that rats liked oranges. They started to eat my Trump 2020 shirts, signs, and posters that had been all over my house. The rats started to dance and chant \"Biden 2020.\" I can't believe they support that horrible LIBTARD. Anyways, I called the police to report the horrible invasion of those THUG, LIBTARD rats, but they said that they could not help me, and had to go shoot some black people and not be held accountable. Of course I started to have a tantrum because I am a white woman who should always get what I want. But the officers still left. I decided to try to go into the app again on my conservative, white dad's phone to see if I could still find information on President Trump ❤️ I found a link that said \"click here to support President Trump.\" Of course I clicked it because I LOVE Donald Jenius Trump, but it directed me to a page filled with videos of some horrible orange man, who was dancing naked on a photo of former-president LIBTARD Barack Obama. Then, the website gave the phone a VIRUS that spread to my house, turning it ORANGE. So, of course I called the White House to try and reverse these effects and President Trump came to the phone! How amazing. He told me that he could not help me because I sounded like black person, and he hates the blacks. I pleaded with him, telling him that I am not black, but he didn't believe me. In conclusion, please DO NOT download this app. The rats are still living in my house...I'm scared...","date":"2020-07-08T15:31:43Z"}}]}
