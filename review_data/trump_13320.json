So i come to the reviews and i think everyone is having the same problems and I as a parent would not like this app on the app store, totally inappropriate and disrespectful towards anyone that supports the great ✨orange. Thank you for listening to my feedback."}},{"id":"6177826778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:48:40Z","userName":"stan bts:))","rating":1,"title":"#tiktoklivesmatter this app is a no ❤️","review":"\"네 손님\"\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지\n까치까지 까마귀들까지\nCooking a sauce 입맛대로 털어\n음미하고 lick it 말해 bon\nTaste so good 반응은 모두 쩔어\nBut 모두 자극적인 거\nI want it till 다 먹일 때까지\n연구하지 cross boundaries\n경계 따위 없어 마치 창조하듯 소리를 만들지\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\n지금 바로 눈에 불을 켜\nI just wanna taste it, make it hot\n새로운 불판 위에 track을 달궈\n메뉴 골라 call me up\n원하는 걸로 다 serve\nDu du du du du du\nCookin' like a chef, I'm a five star 미슐랭\n\"미\"의 정점을 찍고 눈에 보여 illusion\nWhoo 첨 느꼈지 이런 감정\n놀랄 거야 gonna shock 바로 감전\n자물쇠 따 싹 다 (다) unlock (lock)\nIdea bank 머릿속을 털어 털어\n비밀재료가 궁금하다면 (하다면)\n사실 우린 그딴 거 안 써\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n뭐든 그냥 집어넣어\n눈치 보지 말고 더\n망설이지 말고 부어\n비벼 비벼\n\"네 손님\"\nDu du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지 까치까지\nDu du du du du du"}},{"id":"6177805310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:42:23Z","userName":"Thankful user😍","rating":1,"title":"Not doing this for the trend","review":"I downloaded this app to see what our president had planned for the upcoming election, but I could not be more disappointed. It was slow, made my phone glitch, and spammed me with push notifications and emails, even after I deleted it. It was confusing to use and didn’t give the information promised. It seemed to leave out a lot of important details regarding mr trump. I do not recommend this app."}},{"id":"6177787959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:37:10Z","userName":"obamathecat'sowner","rating":1,"title":"I threw my cat out the window","review":"I downloaded this hoping I would have a chance to save the beloved Barron trump #savebarron2020, but all of a sudden I got a surge of bad vibes that came directly from our pedo orange president HIMSELF!😾😾😡😭😭😢😢 I suddenly had absolutely 🙅\u200D♀️🧚🏼no control 🧚🏼✨✨over my body and violently threw my cat 🐱🐱out the window of my five story building!! ❤️My cat Obama is currently in good condition but I myself do not know how I will get through this trauma of the notorious orange man.🙀🙀🙀😡😡🍊"}},{"id":"6177786229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:36:39Z","userName":"melanininimin trump","rating":1,"title":"don’t delete tiktok.","review":"DONALD TRUMP CAME TO MY TOWN AND MY GRANDMA AND I WENT TO SEE HIM.

I tried deleting and redownloading but that just made my phone crash so bad that the battery short circuited and ended up needing to be replaced (a $475 fix!!!). I just got this phone and never had issues before downloading this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP unless you want a similar fate 😩"}}]}
