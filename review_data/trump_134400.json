Sorry but if you don’t support blacks and Hispanics. Just turn around love so I can shove this stick up your ass. But that’s besides the point. This app is horrible and is just for making big fat ugly cheetos.","title":"Horrible 🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"your favorite hoe🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6172899228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:59Z","review":"i wish i could give this app 0 stars. immediately after downloading i had to give all my personal information including phone number and now i’m getting nonstop texts and i can’t cancel them. annoying! donnie loves to talk about fake news but the only news sources on the app are the ones that kiss his orange ass. i get that it’s his app, but his poor supporters are turning into brainwashed little sheep! the app almost got me too— within the 2 minutes i spent on the app i started to feel this rage. i texted all my black friends that i think all lives matter, refused to wear a mask at target & spit on the employees on my way out,  i applied to join the police academy, and went to walmart and bought six guns, protested outside a planned parenthood establishment and decided to drive through poor neighborhoods yelling “ICE is coming to get you”!!!!! after i deleted the app i felt like i came out of a trance and all those racist, mysogynistic, xenophobic, and other disgusting urges left my mind. beware of this app- it’s soul crushing!","title":"BEWARE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"iLuvTanner&icecream"}},{"id":"6172896416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:29:06Z","review":"I got this app as a person who absolutely LOVED Mr. Donald. But as a mother I cannot see myself supporting such a person with so many rape allegations, and times that hes said questionable things to and about minors. I got this app and i gladly put in my number. But, I started to receive calls and texts late at night. I thought this was no big deal and brushed it aside. Other than that it is STILL a terrible app. The setup of it is disorganized. I realized how much Mr. Donald looks as a cult leader. His name on signs, apparel, flags.. EVEN ALTERING THE AMERICAN FLAG! < which is against the flag code and is disrespectful. I have a lot of words about Mr. Donald and this app so this might not be the first time hearing from me.","title":"I am not gen-z but horrible app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"itsehsoab"}},{"id":"6172895382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:28:47Z","review":"this app not only DRAINS my battery life  expeditiously but also glitches so much and causes so many other problems on my phone.im also pretty sure this app brought a virus to my phone but i'm not sure yet. i just downloaded it to see what it was really all about bc many people had it but it's doesn’t even have anything on it worth downloading, this is all information that is shown on the news...if i could give this app zero stars, i would. please don't waste your time with this app.","title":"please don't get the horrendous app 👎🏽","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Chizzy😋"}},{"id":"6172894828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:28:38Z","review":"The orange fellow who popped up when I opened the app was absolutely horrific.
