Trump repeatedly made explicitly racist remarks, from calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, to proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the US. Most recently, Trump has called coronavirus the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”. “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control” (Trump 1991) At least 12 women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault. He’s embraced the nation’s most odious anti-LGBTQ law, North Carolina’s HB2, and put on the ticket Mike Pence, who’s become the face of anti-LGBTQ discrimination after signing a bill to allow businesses to discriminate and deny service to LGBTQ people. the list goes on people. don’t download this app. don’t support Trump. be on the right side of history. Always remember: Trump doesn’t want to make America great again, he wants to make it racist again!","rating":1,"title":"don’t download 🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:21Z","userName":"Khalia (BLM)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179779061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is horrible on its own, the cover... disgusting. it has a horrible mans name on the front. it is for an orange that wants to keep running our country. don’t download this app.","rating":1,"title":"worst app ever🤮","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:20Z","userName":"behn dhs","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible app it took 420 days to download and 69 years to let acces in the app 👁👄👁 my phone caught fire and my cat is in the oven because of this app","rating":1,"title":"Muffin","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:11Z","userName":"repi the beare Ed d","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Obviously the best app on the App Store","rating":5,"title":"Trump 2020","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:16Z","userName":"owen420420","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app, but I haven’t opened it yet and I already don’t like it😌 yeah that’s all I don’t like trump😘😘😘😘😘","rating":1,"title":"#swag🥰😛✌🏼","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:10Z","userName":"CHICKEN IS BETTER 🐓🐓🐓","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app gave me nightmares and i had sleep paralysis of a very extraordinarily orange cheeto because of this app. i keep getting annoying homophobic, xenophobic, racist, and just stupid notifications that are annoying me while im trying to watch netflix. the whole app is tragic. highly don’t recommend and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont get this app. still gives me trauma thinking about this app. ok have a good day! :)","rating":1,"title":"😍🧚\u200D♀️ n i g h t m a r e s🧚\u200D♀️😍","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:10Z","userName":"annie senpai","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778666","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i opened the app and the first thing they ask me for is my phone number. it was to recieve texts so i have it a try. well get this! it asked me for my FULL NAME, EMAIL, AND ZIPCODE. i think donald trump and the government are trying to take over all of our lives and steal all of our information. please don’t download this app if you car about your own safety.","rating":1,"title":"i am absolutely terrified","date":"2020-07-10T06:30:10Z","userName":"adelaa.13","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179778585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app doesn’t work AT ALL.
