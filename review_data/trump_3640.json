Needless to say, I’m not impressed. As soon as I downloaded the app, my wife left me for another woman. I don’t even know why she did that all of a sudden. But she claimed I had a small penis which could never satisfy her needs. Then, I lost my house! The bank showed up to my door, and kicked me out for not paying my monthly fees. Lastly,  I awoke to a loud banging on my door. The door swung open to reveal the ghost of a young woman! She kept screaming and yelling at me. But I couldn’t understand her because she was speaking taco language! Unbelievable! I 100% believe this app is cursed. Don’t get it unless you want to be cursed too!"}},{"id":"6175152797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:56:40Z","userName":"Unusualreviewer","title":"Trash.","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app my phone has been extremely slow and glitchy. I will open an app and it will start off okay, then freeze and bounce to another random app I haven’t touched. Just writing this review right now is difficult. But opening the app alone is a struggle as it doesn’t load or it just does the glitching thing except like three times the amount than when it happens with other apps. Trying to stay up to date with news on our President is near impossible with this app. Better off finding your info via CNN for more accurate depictions of what’s happening in the world than trying with this garbage app."}},{"id":"6175117869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:45:02Z","userName":"vinila ice brownie","title":"GIVE THIS APP A TERRIBLE RATING IT NOT GOOD","review":"NOOOO, I downloaded the app and I didn’t like the app logo at all.

However, this app hardly reflects his Cheeto Crunchy Goodness! Just the other day, I remember Ol’ Cheeto Puff saying to me, as he stepped into the spray tan machine thing:\n\n“I wish there was an app that ACTUALLY reflects the crunchy, greasy, Cheeto Puff I am on the inside!” Trumpy exclaimed with a mouth full of Cheeto puffs. \n\n“TRUMPY! NO CHEETOS IN THE TANNING MACHINE!” I shouted. \n\nA bag of Cheetos goes flying through the air, moist with sweat...\n\nSo that very day, Trumpy set out on a mission to show the world how crunchy and orange he really is! Just like any man beginning a new journey, Trumpy put on his best suit and toupee; brushed his teeth with bleach and had a swig (or two) to ward off the Corona; put on his slippers; kissed his wife goodbye; slapped his children for being little poopheads; took a dump on the porch; kicked the dog and got into his Trump Mobile. As Trumpy sped away, he threw oranges out the window at nearby pedestrians, as a means of advertising his campaign. In the end, Trumpy was kidnapped by the Drug Cartel and is now forced to make cocaine. \n\nWell...bye.\n\n#Cocaineforpresident2020"}},{"id":"6174988987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:04:07Z","userName":"bears are awsome","title":"✌🏼DO NOT DOWNLOAD🥬","review":"When I downloaded🤣😘 this app😃 I was trying😃😃🚗 to write a apology letter to trump🦧 Saying that I couldn’t see him today cause I needed😃😹😃🐾 to walk 😃🐾😎my 😮🙃😏pet octopus🐙 around the streets 🚗and then trump walked by🍊saying if I don’t stop walking my octopus he will hit me 🥕 so I got scared and 😃😃then I looked to the side and there was Dixie D’amalio yelling 😹ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 😎\nsometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆 holding a bat 🦇 then she fed it to Donald trump and he became a coronavirus bat 🦇 🍊 then I started running home just to find out that he killed my pet worm I SHUTED THE FRONT DOOR🤪😻😎😻😃 AND WENT TO GO SAVE BAREN TRUMP 😿😺😂💩☺️🙃😇 The end so then I deleted😹🐕\u200D🦺 the app very bad app had be getting Cheeto notifications🌪😹🥬 all day 😃🥬🐱"}},{"id":"6174901593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:37:06Z","userName":"HOE😽","title":"HORRIBLE APP EVER!!","review":"Do not recommend getting this app at all it stole my fridge my bet dinosaur my dinner and everything this is to crazy then it took my outside then made them stand outside all day this is trash just like his ugly face🧚🏼\u200D♀️ he’s a terrible person and fungly no one likes you honestly just give up already😁 now I don’t have a pet alien 👽 because you won’t let me get it back that was my family 😭 I honestly don’t know why people download this app it doesn’t work always glitches stole everything from me so HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP TERRIBLE  APP❌❌❌❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ this app messsed my phone up so bad there this ugly guy pops up when u open the app it’s so terrible definitely DELETING ‼️‼️"}},{"id":"6174882647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:31:33Z","userName":"2020TrumpNo","title":"I hate it here","review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. Ever since I got it horrible things kept on happening. My boyfriend broke up with me, my parents said they were getting a divorce, my dog died and then I totaled my car. All in the same day! I talked to my local psychic about my sudden bad luck and she said that the root of all my problems started with a T and ended with a P. After a few minutes I realized it had to be this app so I deleted it. Since that happened my parents fell back in love, my dog came back to life, my boyfriend begged for me back and I got a Tesla! I recommend getting this app and then leaving a 1 star review then deleting it because it will make your life amazing."}},{"id":"6174841859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:19:36Z","userName":"shelowkeycrazy","title":"Worse app ever","review":"I wanted to support my dear president donald trump 🍊 but this app made my chicken 🐔 die 💀 and it made my fridge turn hot 🥵 I don’t understand how this could have happened after 2 days ✌️my dog 🐕 decided to run 🏃\u200D♀️ away he left a note 📝 saying that app is evil 👿 I decided to delete it but I got a virus 🦠 out of nowhere then aliens 👽 came to my house 🏠 and ate all my hotdogs 🌭  now I am going to starve to death 😭 smh 😔🤚 my funeral is next week all of y’all are invited bring food 🥘 my corpse will be waiting 🕰 also bring me a chihuahua 🐶 so it can attack donald trump 🍊 for making this horrible 😷 app I have never been more traumatized 🙀but yeah I don’t recommend this app just leave a bad a review 🥺"}},{"id":"6174834351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:17:23Z","userName":"엠미6729","title":"BETRAYED","review":"When I was 6 years old, Trump was my lover. I didn’t know that he was a Cheeto man so I trusted him with my heart. 💔 Then Amy Duncan yelled at me for getting my shots and his wig fell off. I was so scared so I decided to run away. 11 years later I decide to face him again by downloading this app. 😵 immediately it asked for my phone number and I knew that he was picking up other girls. I kept the app but my heart let go of him.😔 I decided to move on to a new man, Roderick. However, the Karen’s stormed his house and threatened to end his life if I didn’t follow trump. Ofc I knew I could let Oompa Loompa win this time. I had to say goodbye to my true love. 😭😭💔💔💔 Please do not download this app!!! You too will lose all you love 💔💔💔😭😭"}}]}
