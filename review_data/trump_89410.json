I was kinda confused cus idk how one direction would go to all the houses who bought premium anddd they only got back together this week, but nevertheless was excited. I entered all my info to purchase premium, and it asked for multiple credit cards, the terms and conditions said it was for safety of all my money. Later that day i got my confirmation email with proof of Harry😱on his way to my house. I sat on the doorstep for many hours\n\nbut no one came. I started to get emails from wells fargo saying there’s purchases on my credit card. i assumed it was just another premium confirmation about One D😘, but the emails were actually from Wells Fargo. when i checked there was 4,000 DOLLARS BEING CHARGED TO MY CARD FOR SPRAY TANS!!! I also had emails from the spray tan place saying i completed getting my 10 spray tans and earned a free butthole bleaching. I dont think spray tans are that expensive, UNLESS YOU GET 69 COATS!!! obviously it was our fat cheeto of a president using MY card to flood his wrinkly oompa loompa body with tans and bleaching. Along with that they asked for a butthole picture to know how much bleach they needed and HIS SECRETARY CC’ed ME ON THE EMAIL😭!!! I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS😡!! Not only does this man steal money to feed his addiction, he traumatized me, and NOT TO MENTION THE (TW) little girls he raped. even after all this ✨One D✨ still has not shown up at my house yet. In conclusion i will be cancelling more than my subscription Mr. 🍊😤","title":"SCAM😡","userName":"xkatethegreatx","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178194818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:49:06Z","review":"Thank you very much, everyone. It’s a nice hot day to put it mildly, so we’ll make this quick, but it’s all very positive, that I can say. It’s my tremendous pleasure to welcome everyone to the White House with my good friend President López Obrador of Mexico. We’ve had a very outstanding relationship. Mr. President, we’re truly moved that you chose to make your first foreign visit since taking office very successfully, taking office, I might add, to be with us at the White House.\nPresident Donald Trump: (00:43)\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico has never been closer than it is right now, and as the president said a little while ago, people were betting against that. They were actually betting against that, but it’s never been stronger, never been closer. We’re doing tremendous job together. We’re cherished friends, partners, and neighbors. Our cooperation is founded on mutual trust and mutual respect between the two of us and between our two countries, and we honor the great dignity of both nations.\nPresident Donald Trump: (01:16)\nWith this visit, President López Obrador and I have the opportunity to strengthen the bond we afford since his impressive election victory more than two years ago, a victory the vice president and Ivanka joined in celebrating at the swearing in. That was a very exciting day for them. Each of us was elected on the pledge to fight corruption, return power to the people, and put the interest of our countries first. I do that, and you do that, Mr. President.","title":"Horrible app","userName":"sbautista937","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178190908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:47:45Z","review":"I was gonna try and educate my self but the mf app keeps crashing:’( MY BALLS 2020 tho","title":"Fat juicy CACK 🚨🚨🇺🇸","userName":"mightycock","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178182570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:44:49Z","review":"So if twenty apples are divided by 37.8 oranges how many pigs are there in the graveyard?

I almost fainted. I thought, “wow, this couldn’t possibly get worse, right?” But then I looked down past his flappy nipples and his stretched out stomach, and saw his one inch wonder if a penis that’s surprisingly smaller than his itty bitty hands. After seeing that, I threw up all over my room, exorcist style, and I could feel my eyes bulging out of my skull. “Could this be?” I thought. “Is this the way that I die?” I could feel my body start to give up, but strangely enough my phone started to shake and tremble, and turn as orange as Donald trumps skin. It started to levitate into the air, while my body is trying to fight off this curse he set upon me. And then BOOM.... a hunchback figure with wet lips that were shaped like a butthole stood before me, and then I quickly realized, it was Donald j. Trump himself, chanting his racist, sexist, homophobic spell on me. I could see my vision turning orange and I could feel my body turning frail. “That’s it...that’s the end of me...” I thought. But all of the sudden my door whooshed open and I saw a handsome man with common sense and good morals standing so heroically. I could barely see who it was since my vision was still orange, but I quickly realized... “it’s OBAMA HERE TO SAVE ME!” Obama, In an instant, banished the horrid parasite from this earth and set me free of this ugly demons curse and he deleted the app off my phone so I wouldn’t have to suffer like that again. So, thank you Obama for your bravery 🧚\u200D♀️✨🧚\u200D♀️✨😌","title":"This orange man likes to touch no no squares ✨🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"tehe 🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178160104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:37:07Z","review":"this app is horrible. it keeps crashing. not to mention the orange cheeto man that popped up on my screen. take this off the app store","title":"yuck","userName":"anc2000","isEdited":false}}]}
