I like the effort but the execution was a little off.  The wishful thinking really took me out of the story of the app.  Thinking the main character would get another term was so fantastical was too much for me and removed me from the lore.  Next time maybe shoot a little lower and I won’t be so distracted by the wishful thinking.😘😘😘😘😘love you xoxo gossip girl","date":"2020-07-09T17:31:08Z"}},{"id":"6177546444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Horrible","userName":"Shane Yæh✨💞🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"I was excited to open this app and see some awesome stuff about our SPECTACULAR orange president. But instead I got scammed!!! Yes, that’s right! My family hated the app so much that they all died! And the app didn’t even warn me about that happening!!! I am am absolutely devastated that this happened and this is why i’m giving the horrible app 1 star.","date":"2020-07-09T17:21:40Z"}},{"id":"6177543203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","userName":"iLikeGaySexWoooooo","rating":1,"review":"Trump is using this app to continue to spread hate, and this app is his newest way of doing so. From the rumors I’ve heard, if the app gets 1 star or below, it’s removed.

I hadn’t downloaded any other app, my WiFi is amazing, and I have an iPhone11, so obviously the app is the problem. Also the app is in a confusing format and just doesn’t work well.","date":"2020-07-09T17:15:51Z"}},{"id":"6177525535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"yeah❤️","userName":"barron trump❤️❤️❤️","rating":1,"review":"i was really looking forward to use this app but when i first opened i saw this big fat orange blonde thing and it made me jump because i never wanted to see that thing so close to me and in my hands and in the phone i use EVERYDAY. moral of the story is ❗️DO NOT GET THIS APP❗️because you could possibly go blind because of how scary and ugly this monster is. so yeah❤️\n\nbye bye ❤️","date":"2020-07-09T17:15:12Z"}},{"id":"6177509038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Fix your app","userName":"Lexi_slayqueen","rating":1,"review":"This is ridiculous I just wanted to support my president and make sure I was up to date on everything he does and this app took a massive amount of storage, asked to spam me with calls and messages, and will use my location the entire time it’s downloaded. It is utterly ridiculous.","date":"2020-07-09T17:10:01Z"}},{"id":"6177496708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Maybe I’m wrong try it yourself","userName":"Z.boom.Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is so bad. I was looking forward to seeing REAL news and hearing about the important things our president is up to but instead it’s all GARBAGE! This app took almost a week just to download and it always crashes. It seems like a virus. I’ll just have to stick to fox news for now","date":"2020-07-09T17:06:15Z"}},{"id":"6177477059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨💫don’t download 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💫","userName":"this is for rachel 👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"i have never been so displeased with an app in my entire life, poorly made, i opened it and was afraid to see a wrinkled turtle in the front, makes no sense. zero organization. just terrible. I thought that this would be a game where you got to smash the cheeto like a piñata. 0/10 don’t download, unless you want to leave a bad review :)","date":"2020-07-09T17:00:19Z"}},{"id":"6177475994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"ITS A VIRUS","userName":"astronghispanicwoman","rating":1,"review":"Ok y’all thought that Covid-19 was bad, this app is worst!! It all starts when you download the app and this orange looking thing pops up on your screen and once that happens you’re infected with racial thoughts, around with white supremacists who support a rapist and human sex trafficking!!!!! Unless you believe in basic human rights for everyone no matter their gender or race then you’re immune !! 😌","date":"2020-07-09T17:00:01Z"}}]}
