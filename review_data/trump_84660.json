I almost chucked my phone at the wall cause it had been 64 hours 🕓 before it completely downloaded then as I went to open the app my phone crashed and when I looked out my window I saw a strange  🦎salamander 🦎outside watching me and I went outside and the salamander only spoke of few words “they know you’re Mexican🇲🇽... and a female👩🏽” i went back inside only to find the salamander and his pet chicken 🐓 Reggie. My dog 🐶 did not like 🐔Reggie. and then all of a sudden me every speaker 🔊 in my house started playing ❣️“🌈🌟🪐real women vote for trump🌈🌟🪐”❣️for 4 hours straight 🥴 the only thing that could drown out the noise was listening to Friday by Rebecca black on full volume 😰 finally once I got it to stop and my phone was finally working again I said hi to my FBI agent Phil 🕵🏾 as usual but then I get a text from an unknown number that my family was being held for ransom and that they will strip my families citizenship away from us even tho I was born in the US and force us to revert back to our roots in Mexico unless we vote for the orangutans in the 2020 election (even tho We are part Native American... but it’s not like they care about indigenous women who are always going missing anyways) but then my FBI agent Phil 🕵🏾 informed me that they had kidnapped my dog 🐕 as well. I could not let any harm come to her 😡😡😡 so using my hacker skills I found the IP address of where they were being held. Then they ambushed me and I thought it was the end of the line until out of no where the salamander and his per chicken 🐓 Reggie along with Phil 🕵🏾 (my FBI agent) came kicking through doors with Phil’s lover Greg 👨🏻\u200D🌾their buddy Juanita 👩🏽\u200D🎨 and set us free. Now Phil 🕵🏾, Greg👨🏻\u200D🌾, Juanita👩🏽\u200D🎨, Reggie 🐔 and my family are on the road as fugitives. Unfortunately the salamander 🦎 was lost in battle ⚔️ 😔 I do not recommend this app. It is terrible and I will forever be traumatized. 🧚🏼✨🤧💕✨🧚🏼 I demand justice for 💕✨🦎 the salamander 🦎💕✨"}},{"id":"6178759375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:25:34Z","title":"Atrocious !!!","userName":"NdjdjelskqlKaoahd","review":"This app is extremely glitchy and absolutely atrocious"}},{"id":"6178740847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:18:23Z","title":"ABSOLUTE HELL","userName":"sherflei6","review":"Ok so I downloaded this app because I love American you know but I don’t like Trump and I wanted to keep an open mind tho and see what all the fuss with the Trump supporter was all about but as soon as I opened the app I felt this weird tingling sensation on my skin and I looked down and saw that my hand has begun to turn orange. I screamed in horror and tried to rub it off but it just kept spreading. Then racist and homophobic thoughts began to fill my head. I screamed and clutched and pulled out my hair to try to distract myself from these awful horrid thoughts. I threw my phone so I wouldn’t have to see that god awful screen anymore as it was beginning to burn my eyes and that I had a permanent squint as well. I rushed to my bathroom mirror and saw that my skin was completely orange. I stared at myself in horror and suddenly I had the sudden urge to have sex with children as well. I couldn’t live like this so I grabbed all the bleach I had and poured it all out in my bathtub and bathed in it in hopes my skin would no longer be that disgusting orange shade. I also got a syringe and injected some into my brain. Now this seems to be a temporary fix as the orange skin and the thoughts come back after about two days but the bleach does have some negative effects as I am not mentally disabled. I have to now do this for the rest of my life slowly becoming more and more braindead otherwise I’d become the female version of trump himself. The world cannot handle two of him it would be absolutely destroyed so please i’m begging you do not download this app."}},{"id":"6178740195","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:18:08Z","title":"Trump out","userName":"lio.gustin15830","review":"This app is dangerous and detrimental to the mental health of all educated children and should not be allowed"}},{"id":"6178716218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:08:58Z","title":"Awful app!","userName":"puppy1242","review":"This app is worse than the orange bunker boy himself.
