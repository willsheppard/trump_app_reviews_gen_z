My stomach ached with pain and had a large amount of gas. I runeth over to the toilet as fast as I could , but it was too late, my bathroom walls were engulfed in a sea of feces. I could not handle such a sight and horrible smell so I began to vomit and continually empty out my stomach and it’s contents. Only later was it that I realized that this was all because of the app and this has emotionally affected me in a great manner.","title":"It gave me explosive diarrhea 🤢","rating":1}},{"id":"6175674029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"shababez","date":"2020-07-09T08:13:01Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app hoping to have access to trump content and rally info. But it completely messed up my phone! I opened it and immediately my phone exited out. I tried it again and my phone froze. I had to restart my phone because it wasn’t working! The app isn’t worth it, messed up my phone, took too much time, and gave my phone a bug. Extremely disappointing. Never again.","title":"Weird Problems with the App","rating":1}},{"id":"6175657316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sarsartiffin","date":"2020-07-09T08:07:13Z","isEdited":false,"review":"If i could give this app 0 stars I would. It takes hours to load and often crashes. It has crashed on me at least 50 times now. It is ridiculous. I have never had such trouble using an app. It is extremely hard to navigate and is extremely confusing. The second I started to actually do something on the app it would crash. It is practically impossible to use","title":"Worst app i have ever seen","rating":1}},{"id":"6175652349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Wooorrrsssttt","date":"2020-07-09T08:05:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First off I downloaded this app thinking that it would download like any other app but instead it directed me to a virus my phone then started smoking and blew up I got a new phone and it was still there, I attempted to deal with it and eventually it downloaded.

The notifications don’t make any sense and Trump took it upon himself to contact me personally 😱🤬 I said no and to never talk to me again because ✨ew✨ I had such high standards that I expected this app to meet 😌💅 but was incredibly disappointed and dissatisfied with the service 😔😭 so in conclusion this app is 🧚🏻not it🧚🏻 and overall ❣️disgusting❣️","title":"TERRIBLE APP!!

This may be the worst app i. The history of app stores. When they were designing this app, I bet the coders put 🤡 all throughout the script—because this app is a joke. How long should I download take? Not to mention, the aesthetics were so distasteful, they should consider a different cover model. If I could give it zero stars, you know I would. I can’t believe I even allowed this app to occupy my home screen.","title":"Should Be Deleted from the App Store","rating":1}},{"id":"6175607105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"olivia 🧟\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T07:49:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"First of all when I downloaded this app it gave my phone all kinds of bugs, and made my phone super slow. This will mess up all your other apps and obviously that would make anyone mad 😂\nThis app also has very inappropriate things. I thought as our “president” he’d be more responsible/respectful to what is in his own app. Yes it says it’s for 17+ but oh boy this is not appropriate. If I could give this zero stars I would it’s not even worthy of one start 🤦🏽\u200D♀️😡","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6175562232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"swaggy.c 👉🏽👈🏽","date":"2020-07-09T07:32:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i cannot stress enough that this is the WORST app ever!!! for starters, it took 3 days to even download! once it finally did, the app wouldn’t even open. when i clicked on it, it kept sending me back to my home menu. the WORST part is, after trying several times, it finally opened up and there was a picture of a MONSTER, trump 🤮 it scared me so much that i had a heart attack and am now in the hospital! this app should definitely be rated SA for stay away!!!!!!","title":"BEWARE ⚠️‼️","rating":1}},{"id":"6175558889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"santosdeadd","date":"2020-07-09T07:31:18Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app took 6969 weeks to download then, deleted everything on my phone. This app can not and should not be be trusted on any mobile device, i've heard several complaints of people having their phones wiped leaving only this app after downloading this app. I wish I could give it -10 stars, this app does not work and has wiped every device i downloaded it on. in conclusion, DONT DOWNLOAD!\n\nsincerely, \n                 \n                       iPhone user of 2020 💅🏼😌✨","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175539261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jsjabbajbchssj","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support my completely respectful, not mysogynistic, not homophobic president but I was thorough disappointed. It took 3 days to download which was extremely upsetting. Then, I was spammed with notifications and texts from the app which ruined my day and caused unwanted notifications. Finally, the app wiped all the data off of my phone so I did not have anything left!!!  The only app that was still on my phone was this one!!! Ridiculous!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1}}]}
