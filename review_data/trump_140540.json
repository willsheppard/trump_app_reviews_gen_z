I then proceeded to run around my house several times before falling into a deep sleep and then woke up 100 years later in a different dimension 🌌 then after several years of exploring I came across a megalodon that wanted to eat me but then it turned out that it would only eat babies so then we became best friends and lived happily ever after. Then all of a sudden a man with orange 🍊 sunscreen and a yellow cotton candy 🍬 like wig approached me and asked me to download this app. I said no and then forced into downloading it and writing a review so I decided to tell my whole life story and that is how I save 15% or more on car insurance LIBERTY LIBERTY LIBERTY, LIBERTY 🗽","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179497574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-10T04:50:13Z","userName":"fir🥵anne😤earl🤩","review":"r-r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️But 🥰 I 😛 can’t 🥳 get ☹️through 😭 the 🤯 door 🥺 cause 😑 my 😪 booties 👹 too 🥴 big 😤one1️⃣person✨is🖤human😝99👀is😽plastic🙈jŭ̈s҉t👀 卂 😸 se̾c ☝️i 👩\u200D🍳 g𝑜Tᴛ𝚊 ❤️fɪ𝑥 😹 Ⓜ︎🆈 👩\u200D🍳 l𝙞p̆̈丂 👄these 🤚 høe$ 🥵 are 😳 jealous💅🏻 cuz 🤷🏻\u200D♀️their😯 mans 🤪 want🙌 me💁🏻\u200D♀️I👁can’t🖐be👌lieve👀it🤡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179497568","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ew","date":"2020-07-10T04:50:13Z","userName":"trump is a cheetoh","review":"This is the WORST app ever 🐂🦒💅🏽🥺🚢💀🐧🤷🏽\u200D♀️❤️❤️😞😛😭😳😭🌛🐕\u200D🦺😞😞💀🐑💀","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179497522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Please read this, you’ll want to know what happened ❤️","date":"2020-07-10T04:50:12Z","userName":"majdhbdidjdndjejdnd","review":"So basically I tried downloading this app all day, but I would let me download.
