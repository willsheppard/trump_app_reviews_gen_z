What was I to do, pretend it’s all okay? Vote for someone who is actually competent? No, of course not! I tried again and again but sadly, at the end of the day, it just- didn’t happen.

If you are thinking about downloading this app then do t waste your time or your storage because it is pointless and should not even be on the App Store.
