I started getting ads on my phone for the trump campaign and I heard one of my favorite apps might get banned because it’s connected to China but it’s very ironic because the Trump app also has ties with China and has sold my information to other companies. I’ve gotten a zillion of calls from telemarketers saying that they got my phone number from this app. It’s horrendous. I’ve also seen Karen’s everywhere I go now which I think the app attracts close minded people. Do not download it. It will ruin your 2020 and of download it could possibly even ruin the next four years of your life. 🙈🥰🤡✨","userName":"Concha001","title":"the worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6176249627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:20:39Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app ever, followed by the worst creators ever. First when you open the app it is literally so glitchy. Then you’ll see a ugly fat book shaped boy (can’t say man, he doesn’t event have enough balls to be a man.) with his fists up. Fists are not meant to be for president photography, it’s meant for justice. This app should be deleted. This app is an abomination. It should be flicked out of the surface and nobody with the human eye should see this. Also my friend said this: He can fall off a bridge backwards, ty. I’m currently enjoying my knock trump out game \n-Oliver the great. Anyway the developers of this app need to fix this, it wouldn’t even let me delete it until a couple minutes later.

Very laggy, took forever to download and had many difficulties loading. Had many horrible messages on the app that was written by the president that left me IN SHOOK.

So I click on the link and it sends me to the App Store. I download the app and the first thing I see is trump’s face🤢 and then it told me to add my phone number. I refused to do so and I exited out of the app. 😤 No sooner than 15 minutes later, I get an anonymous text saying, “add your phone number to trump’s app or you shall pay!!” 📱I was terrified, but I still didn’t add it. The next day I get the same text from a different number, 📱I ignore it again. On the third day I was so busy making a TikTok💃🏾, I forget to feed my goldfish🐟 and it dies.⚰️And that’s how this app killed my goldfish.

This app was awful and utterly disgusting. As soon as I downloaded it, I felt uncomfortable with all the private info I had to disclose. I was spammed with messages that made me feel that my freedom was being violated👎The app made my phone overheat so many times that my hand got burnt🤕. This is ridiculous utterly ridiculous. I thought our awf-wonderful president would have more consideration making this app for his people. The point system made me feel like I’m being graded for my support and as an adult, I am traumatized. I feel degraded and unvalued by this campaign. The app uses up so much of my storage I had to delete photos of my children, my cat with diabetes, and other memorable pictures.","userName":"AnOnyMOoos 👁👄👁","title":"DISAPPOINTING😰 🤢","rating":1}},{"id":"6175559756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:31:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was forced to subscribe to this app for the past 4 years and I’ve hated every moment of it. It got a virus that impacted the entire world and did literally everything EXCEPT solve the problem (including but not limited to: golfing, attacking women’s rights & LGBTQ+ rights, “building a wall”, keeping immigrant children in cages, fueling white supremacist ideologies, ignoring the country’s issue with systemic racism and police brutality, ranting about ‘voter fraud’ and ‘fake news’, ignoring the recommendations of basically the entire scientific community, filing to withdraw from an organization designed to look out for global public health, and trying to ban an entire app because he got trolled by teenagers).
