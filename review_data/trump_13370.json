It glitches like crazy and it was very complicated to manage throughout the process of using it. I usually am able to get used to an app pretty quickly but I just couldn’t do that with this one. It was a horrible experience for me and people who tried to help me manage it. I ended up deleting it a minute after downloading it. It’s just a really bad app.","date":"2020-07-09T03:40:32Z"}},{"id":"6174901230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"okgotchaa","review":"while i was happy to see annoying orange was making a comeback, i couldn’t help but notice that my sleep paralysis demon was not visiting anymore and that upset me. overall the app is trash and i can no longer fold my dishes or put away my grass without having flashbacks of when my tv lost it’s first tooth, so i then deleted the app and my vibrater started working again and my cat came back from the dead. cancel trump 2020🙅🏿","date":"2020-07-09T03:36:59Z"}},{"id":"6174875954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible","userName":"1454445665((","review":"When I downloaded this app a random tiger came kn my house had a usb and plunged it to my pc and then friend it but right after he took a dump in my bathroom and left then I went to the store and three penguins came in and yelled we are armed and dangerous and proceeded to rob the store and left and I saw three pigeons robbing my car so don’t download this or stuff like this will happen to   you like it did to me.\n                              The End","date":"2020-07-09T03:29:38Z"}},{"id":"6174825544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"aubri lalalalalalala","review":"It was awful my family and k went her and they took or shark the wound let us jump of the roof and even told us that we couldn’t throw jokes at people just because we were under 5’6 this is awful it even started to scream at me and it was the worst would totally recommend to all spotters of trum it will be your dream world since people can’t even be nice to each other or smile over all ahhhhhhhhh hate it 🤬🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:51Z"}},{"id":"6174805023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Trump killed the truffula trees","userName":"Zeusdaking","review":"You’ve all heard the story of they Lorax, who speaks for the trees, but something you may not know, is that Donald Trump is the creator of Thneed™️. He single-handedly killed off all of the trees and created a very thick smog over all of the town. The brown bar-ba-loots and the swine-swans, and even the Lorax were forced to relocated. I, for one, will not stand by and allow him to use this app as a platform to destroy thneedville. I hope you will all join me in my cause. #lorax2020","date":"2020-07-09T03:08:49Z"}},{"id":"6174787290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"⚠️ TRIGGER WARNING⚠️- SAD❗️","userName":"eat mu toes666","review":"i...i downloaded this app with the intentions of just wondering what was on the app. i wanted to see what people where doing on the app, etc. i was had none to think about the thing first cake cupcake ice cream cereal that had combined into diarrhea that then made the jello to the burn in the fire but it was just so juicy and voluptuous, and gorilla grip but it started bleeding and then was so bad that i farted so big and wide and low that it fell down upon my mouth and taste good too bad","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:30Z"}},{"id":"6174776035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app 🤢🤮 best at being the worst 🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"rikbok","review":"This app will make your phone glitch right after I downloaded it I tried to order a pizza but it sent me to the store where I found a fish swimming in a car that was tied to a tree with 3 legs but couldn’t walk to get me my hair clip that I left at the zoo next to the milk isle with a side of ranch and I still didn’t end up getting my pizza please don’t download it if there was a way I’d put 0 stars","date":"2020-07-09T03:00:01Z"}},{"id":"6174760904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"mangodragonfruit123peach","review":"This app is literally the worst. It stole my phone battery so it wouldn’t charge. I was left w a dead phone that couldn’t charge anymore so I decided to order a new one. While trying to set it up I realized that the trump app had taken over everything. His face was on my lock screen, home screen, and all my apps had his face or the american flag. Even worse my ringtone was his voice. Do not purchase this app","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:25Z"}},{"id":"6174691611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE I ADVISE YOU TO NOT GET IT","userName":"berniesminion","review":"i downloaded this app and it gave me so many viruses like to the point where I needed to get a new phone. It kept asking me if I was interested in a private meet and greet with the president. But for personal reasons, I rather jump off a cliff, get eaten by a lion,bear, and a piranha all at once, and rot than go face to face with the ugly and weird president. anyways free the children in cages. pro choice is pro women. Defund the police ❤️. And Donald trump is a white supremacist. Thank you","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:29Z"}},{"id":"6174678200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT USE","userName":"Jimallen_14","review":"This is the worst app on this App Store. It crashes, restarts my phone, and actually overheated my phone once. I don’t know if it was because of the fake news or just the overwhelming amount of idiocy but I’m scared to ever use it again. I also don’t know how this app is #1 on news, I would rather watch a children’s television show for my source of news than this awful app. We need a new president. This one is unfit to be in office.","date":"2020-07-09T02:30:29Z"}}]}
