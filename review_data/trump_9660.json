Trump is not a “jenius”","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-22T02:40:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nfdnnfkfnenxh","review":"In Donald J. Trump’s name, he said the J stands for “jenius” not Jewish. But, with this app he’s nothing short of an imbecile. The app is so faulty. It’s not user friendly. My elderly parents can’t use it let alone me. How did he expect anyone to interact with it? \nAll this app does is talk about Trump’s plans to become a better leader. Too bad he can’t accomplish that. I’m very disappointed in the fact that the Orange Man can’t even make a good app for his supporters... let alone be a good president😢😢"}},{"id":"6177875230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"really wish i could give a 0 star","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:03:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"PytThedog12","review":"i planned on downloading the app so i could follow what our ✨glorious✨ president has planned to make our country gReAt AgAiN... but the app doesn’t even work. as soon as you open the app your phone crashes. deletes the app, and TiK tOk too.

Kept. Crashing! such poor quality! It’s a shame. Additionally all I keep getting from the trump hotline number are advertisements for Trump signs, doormats hats, you name it! I had to hide alerts on my text messages because you can’t even block the number! Honestly the worst app experience ever and I’ve seen some bad apps!"}},{"id":"6177749828","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Unsatisfied person","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:25:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"apeuctwndfaiql","review":"I absolutely hate this app. It was supposed to give me reasons to vote but as soon as I opened the app I had to sign a contract to vote for trump and it wouldn’t let me exit out. It also made my phone glitch really bad and it overpowered my phone and caused a horrible stench to come out of my phone which led skunks into my house and now I have to move out and I have no money so I’m forced to live with my skunks. And I also learned that trump smells like booty juice"}},{"id":"6177694331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🎂🎁🤣🤣🎂😷🌙🤗chair, make it electric🧤🥺😎🍾🕊🏇🏿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:08:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Phillys H.","review":"This app killed my houseplants!  Is there some 5G conspiracy?  As soon as I opened this app I could feel an electric charge throughout my body. It made me nauseous and I couldn’t stop barfing for 17 hours. I thought it was a fluke so I went back into the app. Not only did the symptoms begin again, that’s when I noticed that my houseplants were growing wispy white hairs and were turning orange. I’m deleting as soon as I finish this review!  You’ve been warned!!"}},{"id":"6177648652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"We want Obama back","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"obama pls come back","review":"The FBI is currently investigating this app and it’s deal w releasing personal information to different sources but it’s okay we have anonymous to save us all and now the BAU is going to profile and decide that this orange Cheeto is unfit and bad for the job so they give a one star rating and daddy hotch and Reid do not approve and same w queen Emily and kJ and Penelope and even Haley hotchner and foyer are quaking in their graves and Tara and Blake and Kate and everyone else do NOT approve and same w papa Rossi and Matt and Derek and Luke and evening strauss and Barnes"}},{"id":"6177570835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful overall.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"fucktrump6969","review":"This took 7 days to download, which I am very angry at. When I opened the app, the app froze my screen and I couldn’t go to another app. I believe this app is hacking my information while it’s frozen. I tried to delete it once I finally got off the screen, then it said “failed to uninstall”. It took 7.32 GB of storage on my phone, all for some blobfish’s app. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GETTING THIS APP! IT IS HORRIBLE AND IT IS NOT FULFILLING MY NEEDS. Thank you for your time,\n-your fellow trump hater ❤️"}},{"id":"6177545888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dear Mr. Orange","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:21:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"LindseyJoW","review":"I don’t tend to keep apps that ask for my number that’s just creepy man. I just wanted to download to see when his events are so it can be shared to make sure there is a BLACK LIVES MATTER protest there 24-7. It’s not phase it’s not going to disappear it’s a movement it’s going to stay until things change. No matter how much Mr. Orange try’s it’s not going to just disappear. There is more of us then there are of him. As well as on TicTok there are more of us then there are of him."}},{"id":"6177519477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oomph Loompa","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Bob99b","review":"This orange Cheeto is so dry their is nothing to see all he does is make us mad him and the government want to get rid of tik tok but tik tok is the only place where I hear stuff and tik tok is a whole army so we can find you and destroy you guys because you don't know what happened but one thing is we will save Barron Trump people actually simp over him unlike me but we will save him and get our tik tok back also your nudes were leaked were not afraid to show more people"}}]}
