The Dementia, the Narcissism, the anger-management issues and psychopathic tendencies.... but this app just says Donald is “great!!!”, America is “great!!!”, Covid is “great!!!”. Anytime I tried to interact with the app, it called me names and grabbed my ass. I demand this app be removed from the store.","title":"Mental Health Check","userName":"Skootmouse","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:37:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177787408","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i got this app because i wanted to see his plans and all of the elections but apparently the app kept on kicking me off and making my phone overheat, therefore it was making my whole phone lag, i couldn’t go on youtube, messages, ect. i wasn't getting notifications and it drains my battery.","title":"kicks me off.","userName":"HisQueen(:","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:37:00Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177786729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Everyone is beautiful 🥰😻✨ Except you Trumpy Poo 💩 😘🦶.

It took maybe at least 52 weeks to download. Anyways I wasn’t expecting a lot from this app considering the reviews on it. Once I opened it I got a knock on my door. It turned out to be a hoard of rats wearing top hats. They invaded my kitchen and took all of my food. You would think that them having fancy hats that they would have more manners. After trying to clean up my toilets started to act up, spewing raw sewage and trash everywhere. Then I walking in my bedroom just to see that Trumps nudes were leaked onto the news. I went to the store to get some bleach for my eyeballs and got my butt kicked but the rats in top hats. Anyways don’t download this app or you’ll be the rats next victim. 🐀😌💅","title":"Rats in Top Hats 🐀","userName":"💪👁👄👁👉","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:35:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177781639","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Horrible","title":"Horrible","userName":"shxhhdd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:35:16Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177780254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was interested in getting this app because I wanted to see what’s on it.HOWEVER... once I downloaded it my phone shut off (even at 85% battery). After I turned it on the app froze and then my front screen kept glitching. I turned my phone off and on again and then when I went into my other apps the screen froze THIS TIME I COULDN'T even TURN IT OFF. My power button stop working and got worried that my phone was going to stay glitching. Not until about 20 minutes later my phone just shut off and waited a little bit to log in again. I then delete the app and everything was fine. fix your app","title":"Glitches your phone and freezes your screen","userName":"santa clause 25","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:34:50Z","isEdited":false}}]}
