As soon as i opened the app, a million ads started popping up!! they were all either for weight loss or p0rn0graphy!!! how absolutely ridiculous. trumpy has NOO business addressing my weight😭🤬. i’ve contacted the FBI (that’s right i said it) to understand why trumpy knows i need to loose weight. very disappointed with this app— especially since it was created by SUCH an inspirational man. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!","date":"2020-06-26T17:00:29Z"}},{"id":"6122810500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"A Disappointment","userName":"Myranda Wilson","review":"This app signed me up for emails and other notifications that you have to agree to in order to even make a profile. The app is also full of pop ups and is annoying to try to navigate. Also, I don’t understand why the Trump campaign tells you to “upgrade to VIP” by donating. I thought this was a campaign for the president of the United States not some smart shoppers membership club, seems very unprofessional. I’d expect this advertisement from Costco, not the president.","date":"2020-06-26T05:19:35Z"}},{"id":"6177871496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"weeeeeehi 69","review":"At first I was really excited to get it but it took a month to download and during that time my room and iPad kept saying Trump 2020 and then I threw up cuz of how ugly it was and then I started turning orange and couldn’t stop saying Trump 2020 and then I had go to the doctors for 100k dollars then when I came back home there was cockroaches everywhere and snakes I got this sickness call Trumpania very deadly I almost died and another medical bill worth 100k would never buy again as James Charles says bye sisters💅💅🧚🧚🧚🧚💋","date":"2020-07-09T19:02:11Z"}},{"id":"6177844158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no💞✨🧚","userName":"the moody pudding cup","review":"I downloaded this app because I felt it was only right to keep up on our Cheeto but once I have got everything downloaded after 2 weeks I was show horrific photos and homophobic things and people going against BLM which Is sad because black lives do matter and lgbtq+ are also humans there just like the rest of us but worst of all was the photos I’ve seen I needed to was my eyes out after that it was terrible I do not recommend downloading this app","date":"2020-07-09T18:53:51Z"}},{"id":"6177819905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️ORANGE GLOB FOLLOWING ME 🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"Jenny😘😍","review":"Downloaded the app and was greeted by a Cheeto. A Cheeto is the nice way to put it more like an orange glob with a birds nest. Now everywhere I went all I’d see was the orange glob. I turned on my TV I would see the orange glob. I would go to twitter and see the orange glob. Don’t get the app so you don’t get followed by the orange glob. Until I deleted the app I stopped seeing the orange glob. Also downloading the app made my phone work slower. If I could I would give the app 0 stars because of the orange glob with a birds nest showing up everywhere. 🍊","date":"2020-07-09T18:46:41Z"}},{"id":"6177767783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TRUMP IS TRASH","userName":"SCAM THAT HATES TRUMP 21","review":"It’s trash I hate the he has all the power. He has to stop. He is letting these police kill these people with color to there skin. I don’t get how police are allow to kill people that are innocent and they still get to keep there job. Trump knows what he is doing and it hurts me that he is letting all of this happen. His job is to keep out country but he is putting our country and the people that live here in danger. I PRAY TO JESUS CHRIST THAT TRUMP ISN’T PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR. I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAT IS BLACK AND THAT WILL  KEEP US AND THE PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T18:31:04Z"}},{"id":"6177676390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Glitches and spam 🤮","userName":"Skyta Zel","review":"I had to get this app just because trump could actually end up being our president for 2020...when I got the app it kept glitching and the second time I got into the app it glitched me back out all I wanted to see is what trump planed for us but no this app is disgusting and won’t even let me go in I know I’m not the only one trying to get in the app and see because I’ve seen other rating like mine do  it get this app because it’s not worth your time.","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:23Z"}},{"id":"6177613979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Awful","userName":"lindsaydavies","review":"This is by far the worst app I’ve ever had in my life. It’s full of disgusting racist false information that I wish I never read. I had to delete it just so I could stop seeing disgraceful notifications every five minutes. Please take this app off of the App Store so that more people don’t have to suffer the way I did by seeing the things I saw on this app. The fact that this app is even allowed to be on the App Store is a disgrace to this country as well as the president. I am apalled!","date":"2020-07-09T17:43:16Z"}},{"id":"6177589841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Bad","userName":"FFF TRUMP","review":"I’m voting this app a one we all should we know trump don’t like the blacks there’s no reason to lie hers taking kids live away tell them to drink bleach no u will kill kids we all wanna do what’s right where not gonna lie he’s trying to take TikTok where kids have fun and be normal and feel comfortable we should not take away apps our kids feel good doing things that’s right I think we should get this app took down so our kids can enjoy there time and be them :) have a awesome day","date":"2020-07-09T17:35:32Z"}},{"id":"6177580752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🌸🌸🌝🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️😞🌚","userName":"ZoeTr","review":"This just makes me frustrated!
