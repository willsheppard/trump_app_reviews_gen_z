As time went on I noticed a strange orange color begin to slowly grow all over my skin😟. Before I knew it, I was shrinking and my skin became coarse. I HAD BECOME AN ORANGE. So here I am rolling back and forth on the ground trying to type out this review in hopes that someone will come help me delete this app and reverse the curse✨🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"hosoekworld","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-15T15:36:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HELP🆘"}},{"id":"6075115551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I read so many negative comments, I was so confused. I downloaded to see what everyone was talking about. Holy cow everyone is right! Everything from the font, the bad quality photos, this app seems fake. I downloaded this morning, and please take it from me. If you are confused like i was this morning, trust me and don’t waste your time on this app.","userName":"trumpsupporter1955","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-14T15:14:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Please listen"}},{"id":"6073748631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got onto the app to support our beloved president and when I got on it gave me a VIRUS!!!!!!

But when I opened the app my screen was filled with nazi signs and in the center was a video of the Cheeto and Kim Jong-un making love. And I suppose that is something he did while in office, I am still upset because they did not show the entire film.","userName":"Barron222","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-11T23:18:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Very bad"}},{"id":"6057593644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Downloaded to stay informed on how to make America great again but as soon as I set up my text message a government drone  broke in through my window and sprayed me with a suspicious substance. I am now dead and reviewing from the after life. I must say, the food here is good, but getting here was just awful.

Turns out it’s actually full of lies, racism, homophobia, and transphobia! Didn’t realize trump was so scared of people! Yikes! Also I heard that this man who promised America a wall recently decided to instead put up a wall to protect himself from the American people! I guess we should have expected this from such an Oompa Loompa, orange, rapist like trump!","userName":"biden2020$$$$$","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-09T21:25:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"America is NOT great again🙁"}},{"id":"6179187969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hate it!
