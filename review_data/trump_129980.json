This app is terrible, I will never buy it again. it uses all my battery & doesn’t even give me good news on this orange chum. try putting it in rice, maybe the app will do better 😘 I do NOT recommend this app, my dog was acting up, my doors started swinging open & shut, my things started going missing. I thought I was bout to die, scary shi havin this app. do not get this app, I am warning you now. don’t even support the orange bald headed scaly wagon who it’s for either.

After that I heard a knock on my door and found a cheeto that was waiting with ice to deport me back to mexico while screaming “this is white man’s land”.\n\nI HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174862860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible and revolting","userName":"ndjdnw d","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174862906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","userName":"_bOmi","review":"Chiken🐣wing🦋chiken🍅wing🥉hotdog🥨and🚔baloni🌃chiken🧲and🗂macaronni🈚️chillin🎻with🌱my🐙hommies👨🏼\u200D🦼","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174862174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The ghetto","userName":"Sxwarmed","review":"Yes she was just sent that she didn’t know what to say to me and I didn’t mean she didn’t know what to do she just sent you the message she was gonna she didn’t know she didn’t get it bruh bruh I wanna get that I was finna was next year I was finna was a great time with you and your kids I gotta is your time of your time I know I wanna get it bruh was the day you got your message and you send it back and you get to know your name on the phone you know you can see what I can do for your birthday party and you can get your phone number to send your message and I","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174861412","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible!

This app made my wig fly to the nearest gas station to blow itself up. Trust me I have tried calling the manager multiple times but he won’t answer. That is SUPER sketchy since my manager calling phone NEVER fails unless the manager is a fruit. My sweet little Chihuahua got yeeted into my child’s happy meal and my son ate our chihuahua. To add to this mystery my husband is sleeping with me and doesn’t cheat, what a world. Now who am I supposed to complain about my Caucasian problems? Anyways what I’m trying to say is DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS U ARE COMMITTING SELF HARM IN THAT CASE GO RIGHT AWAY. \n\nWorst condolences, Karen Smith","date":"2020-07-09T03:24:58Z","isEdited":false}}]}
