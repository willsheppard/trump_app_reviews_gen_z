This app is a waste of time. First, I see an orange man doing weird fornite dancing 🤮 and then watched a short video of someone being a racist and having a rapping battle with anti-racists. 🤪🤪🤪 As I was trying to fill in the survey all I found were dead memes and minion Facebook posts, which were not funny at all. Lastly, I saw a Dorito jumping up and down saying “Hola niños” and then started to scream.

Just horrible, the most horrific app I’ve used. And I’ve used many apps before. Many. I think the person running this has no idea what they’re doing, i blame it all on them. All of it.
