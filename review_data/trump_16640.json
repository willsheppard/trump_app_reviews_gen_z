That this is a terrible, racist, and unreliable platform that should never have existed in the first place. I actually thought that we had a chance with Trump, but after seeing his app and his Twitter, and actually— anything Trump says, I was convinced. Trump is not a rightful President, and never will be.","title":"Worst App Ever!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"WingedSoul36","date":"2020-07-08T15:57:06Z"}},{"id":"6172738207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I hate this app because when I opened it my phone shocked my little brother and he passed out 😡😡😡 and it did it again and again then random phone numbers stared calling over and over like every minute  then I deleted the app A huge sirens are going from my phone IM GOING TO HALF TO GET A NEW PHONE IT WONT STOP😡😡🤬🤕🤕🚨🚨and it’s shouting Donald trump 2020 Donald trump 2020 it won’t stop 🛑","title":"This app is horrible I half to get a new phone now","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤪🤪🤪🤪😋😋😋🤓","date":"2020-07-08T15:42:55Z"}},{"id":"6172699915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this like almost a month ago and until now, it decides to let me use the app. i don’t know what’s going on, everything seems fake and out of no where it started playing the national anthem. it attracted many many infected bugs into my house making me throw up every where. it got to the point where it started sending me constant messages stating that i’m a disgrace to my family if i don’t vote trump 2020. i’m genuinely scared, i tried to uninstall it but it wouldn’t let me, saying that no one could ever do that once you download it. now i’m stuck with- whatever this disgrace of an app this is. very much terrible.","title":"horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur mom tee hee","date":"2020-07-08T15:32:01Z"}},{"id":"6172684921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app cause I thought don don was doing sum then boom!!!

But a 1 will have to do to express my disappointment in the app. I seriously cannot think of one good thing about this app. It was so hard to use, always glitched, used up battery percentage like CRAZY!
