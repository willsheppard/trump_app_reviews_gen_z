After realizing it was just our ✨beautiful✨ Cheeto president I was able to move on from the emotional scarring the image left😥. Then the app asked me for all of my private information! I think China may have hacked into this app😱. Time to shut it down once and for all! China can’t control us! Make the App Store American again!!!🧚🏼✨🇺🇸","rating":1,"userName":"Melania and Barron😄","title":"Bunker Boy😭"}},{"id":"6176842492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:03:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I genuinely wanted to see what Trumps plans were for the upcoming election. I was curious. But then the app kept crashing and I wasn’t able to open it ever after i deleted and re-downloaded it. Then all of a sudden legs and arms grew out from my phone and started attacking me and my family. Definitely do not recommend if you have family.

It then proceeded to steal all of my information and inform me that if I wanted it back, I had to vote for Donald Trump. I am truly disappointed","rating":1,"userName":"Stephanie and Christopher","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6176741691","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:36:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The very second i opened the app i was taken by surprise; i had to enter my phone number to continue!!!
