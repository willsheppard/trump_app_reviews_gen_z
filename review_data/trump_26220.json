All it did was refer me to some guy named Donald? He seems like a real joke. Why would anyone want him as a president? Not to mention he looks like a Cheeto puff mixed with an overly racist, chubby, small wee weed, dumb, white male. I’m honestly surprised the app is still up in the App Store. Apple should take it down IMMEDIATELY.","isEdited":false,"title":"SO BAD","userName":"Barack Obama🙈","date":"2020-07-10T03:05:45Z"}},{"id":"6179181861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The quality of this app is awful.
