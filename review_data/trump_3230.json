When I entered the kitchen I saw an absolutely horrifying creature eating what remained of my glorious fridge. An ASTRONOMICAL scream of terror erupted from my butthole and the pig man looked over and only then I realized that the creature man was none other than the CHEETO MAN!!!! I was in absolute udder horror. This was my face 🙀and this what the Cheeto man/creatures face 👺👹🤡🤢. He slowly stumbled over to me because he doesn’t know how to walk and then he tried to throw a glass of water at my face but sadly he couldn’t even lift that. I then made my escape and am here to tell my story. what a bully. The end.🤯🥳🤪😗🤕👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌👁👄👁👨\u200D🦯🧍\u200D♀️🧍🙈🐥🍒"}},{"id":"6174403235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:06Z","title":"stream more and more","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"barbz✨💅🏽","review":"I know I want it\n입에 바른 소린 이제 그만할게\n'Cause I deserve it, deserve it\n혹시 잠깐 내가 미워지더라도 걱정 안 할게\n'Cause I know you, I know you\n내 눈을 자꾸 피해봐\n네 맘을 자꾸 숨겨봐\n\n나에게서 도망쳐봐 no no\n감았던 눈을 떴을 때\n문득 내가 떠오를 때\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more more more more more and more\n멈추기 싫어 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\nDo you feel me\n니가 날 위한 사람이라고 믿니\nOnly for me, only for me\n간지러운 말은 굳이 하지 않아도 넌\n'Cause you know me, you know me\n네 귀를 자꾸 막아도\n나를 멀리 밀어내도\n나에게서 멀어져도 (저 멀리) no no\n내가 다시 널 부르면\n나의 목소릴 들으면\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYeah 한 번 더\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more more more more more and more\n멈추기 싫어 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n난 원래 욕심쟁이 몰랐다면 미안\n사과는 미리 할게 'cause I want you more more\n의견은 필요 없어 훔칠 거야 네 맘\n내게 홀리게 될걸 you can't say no no\n난 도둑고양이 오늘만은 널\n꼭 잡으러 왔으니까 딱 기다려 너 \n멀리 가지 말고 다시 내게 come come\nYeah 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n\nISTG CHEETOH OF YOU DELTE TOKTOK .. anyways stan twice"}},{"id":"6174147046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:48Z","title":"horror movie💔","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Superior human being","review":"Usually I like horror movies, but not in this case. This is truly disturbing and right after i opened the app I wanted to gauge my eyes out. I choked on my water and almost died thanks to this app. Also, “#1 in news” ? FAKE NEWS. Thank you but I will no longer tolerate this app on the app store. pls delete or I’m going to expose that we are all living in a simulation❤️ Anyways... this fool asked for my number, like sorry but i don’t give my number to creepy old men and it’s actually very inappropriate sir. If you ever ask me such a personal question again, I won’t hesitate to leak your 🥜 even more so the American people will all become blind and very sick!

But anyways whenever I opened up this app it showed me a picture of a crusty old Cheeto and I didn’t want to see anything like that bc crusty Cheetos give me heart attacks especially old ones and thank the good lord that my sister was wearing a blindfold and was able to get the phone out of my hand and throw it out the window and we waited for it to die so we could get it and not have our eyes burnt out actually I think I’m gonna go bleach my eyes and my brain bc I’m feeling kinda funn- dsdgcbxnfjfhururifnn btw this is my ghost now speaking I have sadly passed away due to old crusty Cheeto syndrome😡😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6173702608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:57:09Z","title":"HORRENDOUS","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"aurorasaysstuff","review":"if I could rate this app zero stars I would. ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS and the app quality was that of 1970s animation for children. For as much money as Mr. 🍊has I am BEYOND disappointed in this. FIRST: when it came to downloading the app HUNDREDS of HUNDREDS of pictures of President 🍊downloaded to my photo album. It was like living in Florida and going through the fields of orange farms. SECOND: the app CONTINUOUSLY glitched out of control to the point where the app was useless:(( I showed my dear daughter and she was FRIGHTENED at the sight of how terribly the app was performing. LASTLY: I am truly disgraced to say that such a man as put out such a horrible app. I hope he is given a lesson and is never given another opportunity on the internet or technology in general. \nThank You- Justin Cider"}},{"id":"6173644677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:36:19Z","title":"Horrible app crashed many times and I got spied on when I signed in and my stuff deleted","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"POV community","review":"This app is horrible I can’t believe I believed Karen into downloading it, this app took so long to download and once I opened it some random guy was on my screen DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP if you make an account/if you sign up the government has all your information they track you and they can see anything you do through the camera my camera kept flashing and I kept getting random notifications, this app crashed many times and once I downloaded this app I signed in and out of nowhere all my apps deleted and so did my photos I wouldn’t suggest to download this app unless you would want that to happen🤷🏻\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6173625409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:27Z","title":"Horrible app do not download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Taylor374771388","review":"When I tried downloading it it took a very long time and it was not my phone being slow it was the app because I tried downloading another app to see if it was my phone or app and the other app downloaded much quicker also once I finally got it downloaded a bunch of animals broke through my house and they all started to break and eat my phone and my family even got caught up in the mess and 3 of them got killed while the other 3 all kicked me out of the house for destruction and now I’m homeless and it also attracted a bunch of roaches which lend to my family having to move out .i hate this app with all of my heart and do not recommend at all😡"}},{"id":"6173561256","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:06:56Z","title":"what a shame","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"parenrs","review":"overall this app is a burden to my own electronic device. Downloading this app took about 1,869 minutes in total (i counted). i felt totally disregarded and mistreated. i downloaded this app with the idea of seeing what 🍊 was all about. After finally downloading on my device, i opened the app. I thought since the app took an extreme amount of time to download it would at least work properly, but that was not the case. Glitching and lagging, this app never loaded or showed important information. I have never downloaded such a slow app in my 69 years of living. I hope other people see this as a warning to never download a burden such as this app. thank you for your time!\nyours,\nKaren 😂❤️🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6173553994","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:04:29Z","title":"No","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Moisterious.....","review":"So when I opened the app immediately the screen was just bright orange and then I turned up the volume and my racist neighbors started dancing along chanting racist things even the rats and roaches started dancing I was out of my life a few moments later the app crashed and I opened it back up and it told me I had been selected to go to White House so I went I met this man who’s face looked like the color of the screen when I opened the app so he took me to his basement where i saw a bunch of girl ages 13-18 all in a circle saying the name Donald trump I swear I was in a cult and I ran away just too be greeted by the dancing rats and roaches they chased me all the way to my house and then I deleted the app and i never saw any of them again"}},{"id":"6173549730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:03Z","title":"Absolutely horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"aliba 🚗","review":"When i first downloaded it, it took SOOO long to open up. It started to glitch and make weird noises that hurt my ears (i was wearing ear buds.) they hurt my ears so bad that i went deaf in my right ear and i can BARELY hear in my left ear. Now we're going broke because of hospital bills, we were already not too great with money. Thanks to this app i alerted all my acquaintances of the dangers. Now, all my 50,000 friends are telling everyone else they know NOT to vote for this man or else they will go deaf!! Also, apparently only ugly people support this app. I am not ugly at all, neither are any of my acquaintances. So if you download AND support this app, you're uglier than the cockroach in your bed.\n\nTrump 2020 💕💎✨🦋 but on a grave 🧚\u200D♀️🦄❤️🎀"}}]}
