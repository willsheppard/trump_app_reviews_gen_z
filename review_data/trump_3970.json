The background picture when I opened it was very ugly, he had no lips... Anyway, the app kept crashing every five minutes, it reminded me of the economy during Trump’s administration.🇺🇸🇺🇸💸💸  Also, this app made my phone glitch a lot, and it was like it had a weird virus, good thing I’m wearing my face mask!!😷🦠 I would not recommend this app to ANYONE that has a high IQ, good morals, ethics and wants equality for everyone. This app was a 0/10 and will never download it again!!! The app store should seriously consider taking it down, just like Gen Z is going to take down the current administration✨"}},{"id":"6173556148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:05:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"c00chie c0nn0iseur","review":"This app caused my aunt, uncle, sister, great grandmother twice removed, and my hedgehog to go into cardiac arrest. Not to mention the fact that it somehow turned my southern. I can’t stop saying things like “Y’all” and “howdy partner” this is my worst nightmare. It is FAKE NEWS do not trust what you are getting spoon fed to you by Fox News you ignorant scum. Yeah that’s fair enough to get you right you can get a better job and get that it out of the way and then you get it that’s what I do when you do that you have a lot to say that’s why you don’t know how much you have been to me and you have to get it that’s what you want me and you don’t know how to get you to. Thank you for reading"}},{"id":"6173512847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:50:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁 this app is trash","userName":"👁⭕️👁","review":"I’m here from an amazing TikTok and I just want to do my part in taking down trump and embarrassing him and his supporters and I am not ashamed because part of my family is a trump supporter so I tell them what’s wrong from right and how he should have never been our President 😘. I just don’t understand how idiotic a person could be, he was saying if we don’t do any tests for corona then there won’t be any more cases Whoa trump really and I have no respect for him so I never call him by President trump because he is not my president! Also if your a trump supporter I recommend that you think twice before defending such an idiot man. Thank you all ❤️❤️❤️ trump in jail hopefully"}},{"id":"6173454843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:30:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"terrible app a🤢🤮","userName":"remember😩the😢times⏰we😔had👈","review":"This is by far the worst app I have ever downloaded in my entire life. Just within the first minutes of using it, it crashes my phone and almost gets it shut down. It also uses up your battery like crazy (10% in 5 minutes). My friend had a literal ANXIETY ATTACK after opening the app for the first time. It was one of the scariest moments in both of our lives, as neither of us knew what to do. The images and videos displayed on here are NOT FOR EVERYONE. There were no warnings left for anyone to brace themselves for what they were about to see. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, especially if you are easily triggered. This app needs to be taken down."}},{"id":"6173437293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:24:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"piano keys","userName":"jasmineevarghese","review":"the day was young so i decided to invert my mashed potatoes 🥔like every other sane person does. i opened my trump 2020 app just to learn that TRUMP👹👹 was the culprit engraving satanic readings into my dogs toenails.😱😱😱 i ran as fast as i could to try to escape but the orange bowling☢️🎳ball used his spray tan to lift himself up like a rocket and catch up to me😥😥i dodged the hair balls🦁🦁being thrown at me which stemmed from his luscious locks of hair💇\u200D♂️and hid under barrons feet🤩🤩. when i woke up💤💤, trump was holding a piano key 🎹to my head and was chanting some hideous sound that rhymed with bake bamerica bate bagain. never heard it in my life but i think it’s some demonic ritual?? anyways this app almost killed me so i cant stan sorry bonald brump🙈🙈"}},{"id":"6173207969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:07:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"do not download","userName":"marisaa chalen","review":"i started getting calls after i put in my information for the app- he sold my info to telemarketers. this app takes up all of my data, slows down my phone, and glitches in and out of the app. all the news on the app is the only news he wants you to see. if you want to become uneducated and for your phone to crash and slow down, then i 10/10 recommend it. if not, please don’t. also, it DRAINS MY BATTERY! if you actually read about this app, you will see that is uses your location EVEN WHEN ITS NOT OPEN! i just wanted to support our great orange president, but UNFORTUNATELY, this made my view of the president go way way way down."}},{"id":"6173173647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:56:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not recommend","userName":"MANNY2020🟡⚫️","review":"I had high expectations for this app considering that it’s the official app for 🍊supporters! My first complaint is that the app took ages to download and took up much of my phone space! Also, upon finally entering the app, I got a warning that a virus had entered my poor phone! Now, I can’t do anything on the dang thing without it bugging out or completely shutting down! As if it couldn’t get any worse, I got heart breaking news that people are actually voting for this 🍊 for president! What has America come to 😔. 10/10 DO NOT recommend this app for ANYONE! And if you already have it, delete it, the viruses will only get worse! It gets a 👎 from me."}},{"id":"6173028808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:10:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App I’ve ever come across ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕","userName":"beepbop😌✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕","review":"To start off I thought it would be a wonderful idea to come closer to America and download the ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️disgusting✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️president’s app to maybe make me feel better but no❤️.
