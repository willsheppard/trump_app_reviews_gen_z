Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth. BARRY (CONT'D) Hello? His best friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, is on the other end. ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs?

First of all it took 45 days to download. Yes 45 days. And when it was finally ready to open my phone started glitching terribly and playing some of the strangest music I’ve ever heard. It sounded like a bunch of old men singing Donald Trump is great, he’s got cake, let him run the world he can’t make mistakes to the tune of old Mac Donald has a farm. but it didn’t end there. Every the I tried to use the app I got a slew of unsolicited dick pics. I’m talking thousands upon thousand of dick pics every single time. So naturally I called the provided help line to see if there was something I could do but they said they couldn’t help me because they were too busy sacrificing goats to make a cursed stew for Trump to feed to all of gen z at a huge banquet next month, and when I questioned this statement they immediately hung up. So I did the only thing i could think of which was delete the app. Everything appeared to be working fine until the next mornings when I woke up surrounded but rats that appeared to be worshiped at tiny donald Trump shrines and threatening to kill me and my loved ones for not supporting the president. This was a horrifying experience. I rate it -1000/10","date":"2020-07-08T20:25:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173613231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Martha🙀👺🐒","userName":"foreigner<3","review":"Martha😁was🥰an🙃average🐕dog.
