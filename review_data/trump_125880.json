I heard knocking on my front door, followed by someone yelling “FBI OPEN UP”. I quickly gathered my rock collection and a couple of moldy cheese sticks. I ran to the door, prepared to give them cheese touch, but I was attacked by Alvin and the Chipmonks!! 🐿 Their annoying, squeaky auto tuned voices exploded my house and destroyed my ear drums. All my information was hacked and sent to the Chinese Government in efforts to bring back Micheal Jackson with cloning technology. I never even got to create my account...very disappointed with this app. Doesn’t even deserve 1 ⭐️.","userName":"John Smith from Alabama"}},{"id":"6178965100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i miss obama","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:42:34Z","rating":1,"review":"ive had this app for a week to track our presidents childlike behavior and i am severly upset wuth the turnout. found out hes racist homophobic sexist and a pedophile😔 jk already knew 🥂","userName":"Gracie 12 29 2003"}},{"id":"6178962548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolute trash!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:41:37Z","rating":1,"review":"Took 42 hours to download then 24 more hours to get a confirmation code!

But I tried to reopen the app again because I’m determined and I had lied shoved into my Brain, it was like I was talking to Kokichi (a liar). So I had to close the app again to read some actual real news and not that fake stuff. I opened the app again and was immediately assaulted by a all lives matter Karen, so that wasn’t very fun. I tried to delete the app but a notification popped up on my screen saying I can’t, so I restarted my phone and tried again. This time no notification popped up all that happened was a Karen came right at me and Body slammer me to the ground, killing me on spot, so now I have the app on my phone forever, since I am dead and can’t delete the app myself. All in all horrible experience -1000/10 WOULDNT recommend.","userName":"Kokichi Ouma 💜💞"}},{"id":"6178955575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Peen","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:39:07Z","rating":2,"review":"Dsjsjsksk","userName":"xxxtentacion17"}},{"id":"6178954386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"#Drake2020","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:38:41Z","rating":1,"review":"🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐳🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🕸🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙","userName":"THE BIGGEST RAT 🐀✌🏽"}},{"id":"6178952382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Complete waste of time","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:37:57Z","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app, I was a bit skeptical already. It took 12 hours to download. It was a pain. After the app finally downloaded, It asked me to put my phone number and email address in. It kept telling me that both my phone number and email address were invalid. I had to create a new email address. After putting the email in, it took me another 3 hours to receive the verification code. By then, the verification code was invalid. I had to call tech support to help me. They said that everything with my phone was perfectly normal. I have to try to send the verification code 4 more times in order to actually receive it on time. When I was finally done filling out all my information, it kicked me out of the app. I just went back on the app and I had to fill out all the information AGAIN. At this point, I was just getting sick and tired. I filled out all the information again. After 5 more hours, I was finally in the app. within 15 seconds of using it, I got kicked out of the app AGAIN. I kept clicking the app to try to use it, but it kept kicking me out. I watched an entire movie while clicking the app over and over again until it let me. 5 minutes after I finished my movie, the app finally stopped kicking me out. When I started to navigate my way around the app, I got a notification saying a virus was on my phone. I was super tired at this point so I just went to sleep and hoped the virus was fake or that it would go away. In the morning, I couldn’t open my phone anymore. It would let turn on. I had to call Apple to help me fix it. I ended up having to pay $1,100 for a new phone. I think I will sue you guys. I spent 27 hours trying to use this app and I couldn’t even use it, AND it cost me $1,100. Complete waste of time.","userName":"B@nana777"}},{"id":"6178952160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gg gaveta dazfCfacsfa","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:37:52Z","rating":1,"review":"Zfattscgagsyafstagsgafsgafsfsgaga","userName":"stanbtsandtxtforsuperclearskin"}}]}
