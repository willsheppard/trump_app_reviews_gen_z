It shuts down my brand new iPhone XR and force restarts it. It has basically turned my phone into a brick. While the app is not functional in any way shape or form, the notification system is working almost too well. I get a notification from this app at least every 10 minutes, and even though I’ve turned the notifications off in settings, it still somehow doesn’t turn off. This is a TERRIBLE app and I recommend NEVER purchasing it."}},{"id":"6172018616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DISMANTLE EVIL","date":"2020-07-08T12:22:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is CURSED IT SPREADS TRUE EVIL IT MUST BE DESTROYED NOW!!!!","review":"From the moment of opening this app a portal emerged, in which contained the worst of Hells demons. These demons were grotesque and pure evil, they immediately started spreading hate, bigotry, racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, greed and gluten throughout the country. This led to years of battle between the good and evil. The good are more powerful in numbers but the evil have weaponry which can kill several good people at once. I am one with the good but need your help to shut down this portal and dismantle the evil once and for all. Together we will defeat them. Destroy this app to conquer the evil."}},{"id":"6171956134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AubreyB37","date":"2020-07-08T12:03:50Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible Formatting...","review":"Whoever decided an app meant to inform voters on the president’s policies and events needed a rewards system and a way to connect with friends does not deserve their job. It made it almost impossible to find any real information about the president and just felt like pushy marketing. Additionally, if I have the app why should I have to consent to text messages and phone calls instead? Why can’t you just send me messages through the app? Pushy and invasive, unhelpful, and overall a waste of phone storage space. Will be deleting."}},{"id":"6157838929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"urmomisamann","date":"2020-07-04T21:17:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app will make you IRATE🔥🔥💥☄️💀☠️😡😡😡😡","review":"Honestly this is app is HORRIBLE😷🤮😡like I was expecting to have the picture of our ✨amazing✨ president TRUMP🤭 but instead I received an grotesque and horrendous picture of a rotting orange🍊🍊🍊🎃HOW DARE THEY😵🤬🤬🤬😡😡🖕🖕🖕 I WAS OUTRAGED.

However, when I opened the app there was a knock on my door. The aliens I opened the door to immediately took me to a spacecraft and probed me. They said that it was for the good of America so I eagerly consented (they obviously weren’t used to that response) but I knew I had to be willing so I could prove my loyalty to daddy Cheeto. It wasn’t enjoyable however so I have to rate this app one star 😔"}},{"id":"6149632082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"offical chimpa","date":"2020-07-02T20:05:31Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DISGUSTING AND DISTURBING APP","review":"from the moment i opened the app i started getting very severe diarrhea, this was very strange because the diarrhea was bright orange, just like the face of mr. trumpus himself. i went to the doctor to get diagnosed and he told me that i was infected with maga-itis, a very rare disease that comes from being exposed to donald trump. i was doubtful at first until i came home and both my dog and my son had the same thing happening to them. please DO NOT get this app, my buttocks will not stretch back to its usual size but at least it went away once i deleted the app. god bless ✝️🙈💫✨😍"}},{"id":"6145665402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stromberg-share","date":"2020-07-01T20:42:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"CHILD PORN?!","review":"When I first saw this app I thought it was a normal app that My secrete crush, Trump sempai had set up. But little did I know that when I opened it, CHILD PORN CAME UP! I am appalled that daddy trump would do something like this! I bet it was those scoundrel liberals! Them wanting equal rights and all 🙄 EW and I bet they drink tap water and believe in vaccines! It may have been trump... but I wouldn’t want to disrespect my god. My one and only love.

As soon as i opened the app it started YELLING and SCREAMING “FAKE NEWS, ITS A HAUX”. I couldn't get it to stop! Before I knew it my ears started to bleed and my tongue had fallen out of my mouth! Then it stopped I thought it was over BUT NO! An ARM reached through the screen and proceeded to CHOKE me!! My face was turning purple before I finally broke free, but the force from getting away threw me off my balcony. I am CURRENTLY in the hospital wearing a full body cast. I do NOT recommend this app!"}},{"id":"6141242702","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"my daddy is anon😘","date":"2020-06-30T19:53:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"CHEETO APP","review":"10/10 do NOT recommend this app. All I wanted to do was support our lovely🥰president but when I downloaded⬇️ the app some really weird things started happening around my house. Like furniture in my house was moved and they always fingerprints with Cheeto dust on it🤢. After A few days my furniture started turning into Cheetos and after a week my whole house was made of Cheetos!! But luckily some anonymous guy with a really hot🥵mask on came and helped me renovate my house back🥰😘. Anyways, me and my anonymous bf are happily NOT supporting this app or the president with a Cheeto free house💖🥰💞."}},{"id":"6136921421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"IFHSOLEVDIDP","date":"2020-06-29T18:30:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Don’t download","review":"At first when I read the reviews I thought they were just doing another one of those terrible gen z pranks like what happened in  Tulsa so I downloaded this app anyways to support my 🧚\u200D♂️wonderful president🧚\u200D♂️ but when it got onto my phone it made my whole face orange!!! I tried to wash it off but it wouldn’t come off!! Then when I tried to delete the app it threatened to blow my phone up if i did!!!
