Once loaded my messages became flooded with hate for trump and FAKE NEWS! 🙄 It told me to drink bleach to prevent myself from getting covid😭 plus after downloading this app my phone became extremely slower and it even started glitching. I was then kicked out of the app and now it refuses to open. Obviously this app is poorly made and meant to trick trump supporters. Would not recommend. 👎🏼","userName":"fatassbetty","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:44Z","rating":1,"title":"Awful, just awful","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173536908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Okay I Downloaded This App To “SuPpOrT” The Fat Orange President, And Took A Week To Download, And When It Finally Downloaded I Opened It An All Of A Sudden I See Roaches And Flies Everywhere Around My House, Then They Were Screeching Very Screechy Noises, Then My House Burnt Down Because Of The Screeching Roaches, And They Were Dancing Everywhere🦗🦟\nThen I Deleted The App And Everything Went Back To Normal.\nI Don’t Recommend.

My phone was running super slow and the batter ran out within an hour after being fully charged. I also think this app gave my phone a virus because there has been a ton of viruses detected after downloading and I had to go the the apple store to fix the problem. The app itself was also very confusing and did not work well.","userName":"riefjxvuf","date":"2020-07-08T19:55:56Z","rating":1,"title":"Do not download","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173481299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As soon as I opened the app I was greeted with a very scary image of his corn flaky orange hair. It was then engraved  in my brain I have had nightmares for weeks and have had to go to therapy . I am suing. Not to mention during my therapy sessions I have seen many adds of trump that were so insanely stupid I passed out multiple times and started having panic attacks no medication can cure . Sis popped off .... the face of the earth.... I wish😒. Also I hope the Cheeto factory stops sending u concealer.","userName":"Dec gm","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:36Z","rating":1,"title":"you dropped this 🔴 put it back on your nose 🤡💞🧚\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173469819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE. first of all it literally took a week to download and wen I got on it kept glitching lying to me about how trump is such a good president like I feel attacked. If you get this app be warned bc it will ruin your life like it did to mine. Now I know that they actually made a whole app for a rapist and racist and every bad thing you can think of. Every night now I have night terrors about trump being in my room staring at me for hours and I have to go to therapy for it. Pls help me do not get this app and leave a 1 star review.

UNBELIEVABLE!!

My whole family were then reborn as spiders and chased me down so I had to move to a different country which is honestly better than living in america with a 🍊 as a president. Then my phone turned back on and it turned into a little trump and tried to attack me and send me back to China 😢. I'm still running away from the mini trump and am making this review from a phone at an apple store.","userName":"a2gibbons","date":"2020-07-08T18:40:18Z","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP","isEdited":false}}]}
