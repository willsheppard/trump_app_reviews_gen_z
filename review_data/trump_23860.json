The president won’t make America great again. He will ruin it. It will burn to the ground and he will be there on top watching everyone burn. If you support this human being then I’m sorry but you’re the worst. Right next to him. Make America great again by not supporting him","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:54:05Z"}},{"id":"6172772115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im disappointed in you","title":"Not mad just disappointed","rating":1,"review":"I am fully astonished ASSTONISHED how you the AppStore can let this horrid app be given to the people. I would rate it a -5 OUT OF 5 if I could but I can’t. The app system is really racist and everytime I use it my skin gets orange my eyes go blind. Definitely would not recommend this app to anyone with a functioning brain.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:52:38Z"}},{"id":"6172765631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"somebody🤫🤮","title":"Somebody🤫","rating":1,"review":"This is such a bad app when I got it I thought I was gonna vote for him but when I tried it didn’t let me and my phone started to glitch a lot and it wasn’t letting me go into other apps.

The sheer quality makes me want to barf. It’s so slow and drains my phone battery. A complete waste of time. I regret downloading. Also- as soon as I downloaded this app, I lost my socks.
