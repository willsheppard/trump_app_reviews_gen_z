So now I‚Äôm having an allergic reaction to this GIANT CHEETO and I had to go to the HOSPITAL and my hospital bills were hundreds of dollars that mr Cheeto man refuses to pay me because it was his orange Cheeto balls that caused me to have this allergic reaction. And NOW I have to wear a minimum of THREE MASKS cause my lungs have been EXPOSED to the CHEETOS that I‚Äôm ALLERGIC TO so I‚Äôm vulnerable to CORONA now!!!!!! I rightfully blame it all on this horrible horrible app. And that‚Äôs just from opening the app once! Can I tell you, the second time I opened the app, I saw a GIANT ORANGE PIG with I‚Äôm also ALLERGIC to! So I had to go to the hospital AGAIN for the SECOND TIME due to this app! I should be refunded. I am a VEGETARIAN you should not be displaying pigs like this right on the app! If I keep having allergic reactions I WILL SUE.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:33:41Z"}},{"id":"6173916330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no‚ù§Ô∏è","userName":"toots mcfarts","rating":1,"review":"Oof-er Gang x7\nSpent 2 robux on a new chain,\nMinecraft players stay in ya' lane!\nWhy did the guests have to go away,\nshout out to the guests who got\nthrown away!

Once I download the app because I was looking for something fun to do I opened it and I found pictures of nude cord and let me tell you I say I was mortified I was really mortified I had to exit out of the The app immediately oh boy how disappointed my kids would be if they had learned that how to install an app as appropriate as this one. I am a woman of morals and I‚Äôll tell you just destroyed my whole family we need to get this app take it off right now. You won‚Äôt believe what happen next when I got home I was going to cook some corn for my kids and I saw there was none in the fridge so I searched and I couldn‚Äôt find any so I decided to go take a nap and I saw a naked piece of corn on my bed and that‚Äôs how I knew that I would never live same life again.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:07:26Z"}},{"id":"6173791470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","userName":"IsolatedWeedLady","rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible! Not only did it take hours upon hours to download, it also ended up killing my phone battery. Now, I can barely go on my phone for a couple minutes before it shuts down. This app also started making my phone sprout weeds, and I‚Äôm not about to put weed killer on my phone. The weeds ended up growing so long that I needed to plant my phone in the ground, and then the weeds took over my whole garden! My squashes, tomatoes, lettuce...all of them were gone. I had a funeral for each of the plants as they died. Now, my whole house is covered in the Trump weed, and I can‚Äôt get rid of it. Gardeners refuse to touch my house and the surrounding area out of fear that the weed will end up on them and will go to their house. Now I just sit in isolation in my weed-covered house, longing for friends and a sense of belonging. Thanks (no thanks) Trump app!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:29:51Z"}},{"id":"6173775257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","userName":"JUSTICE FOF BREONNA","rating":1,"review":"As I installed it it started getting all my data!!!

I can‚Äôt believe the apple App Store would let such an ugly model pose for the pictures. My kid was looking through my phone trying to download games to play, then he though this app was a game and he installed it. After this happened he dropped my phone and ran to me screaming ‚Äúmommy‚Äù at the top of his lungs. He the the ugly orange boogie man was in my phone. I went to go see and the horror in our eyes were unreal. I covered my kids eyes and said to go to daddy. When my husband came he was risking his life to touch my phone and not catch anything from such ugly monster. I have to know use my kids iPad which I will be monitoring. This app did not only cost me a new phone but new eyes for my whole family, to unsee, the unseeable. I‚Äôd rate this app a 0 start review but I can‚Äôt so. -5 stars.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:06:46Z"}},{"id":"6173537751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"wish i could rate it less","userName":"~momma~bear<","rating":1,"review":"this app was just so much garbage. he shared videos of dogs and cats eating ACTUAL garbage. why would he fill his app with this? after weeks he started to send free \"care packages\" to people.
