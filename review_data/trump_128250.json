😘","review":"i was trying to start the app and nudes kept popping up like geez i’m a minor (that’s what she said). anyways they kept popping up and when they stopped i saw the “president’s” dried out orange ugly dirty neck ass. i screamed, tossed my phone, i saw heaven and hell at the same time, lord have mercy on my innocent soul. i did not need to have such a rude awakening, like when i see THAT face it makes me more scared and nauseous than using a public bathroom. um so yea that was my experience horrifying i know. haven’t had nightmares in a while but i didn’t even need to sleep to have cause of his burnt sweet potato looking self.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177065251","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:02:20Z","userName":"ababshsushdnrjrjdjdjsj","title":"rolling in the DEEEAAAEAP","review":"There's a fire starting in my heart\nReaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark\nFinally I can see you crystal clear\nGo 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare\nSee how I leave with every piece of you\nDon't underestimate the things that I will do\nThere's a fire starting in my heart\nReaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark\nThe scars of your love remind me of us\nThey keep me thinking that we almost had it all\nThe scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling\nWe could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nYou had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nBaby I have no story to be told\nBut I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn\nThink of me in the depths of your despair\nMaking a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared\nThe scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nThey keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nThe scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling\nWe could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nYou had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nWe could've had it all\nRolling in the deep\nYou had my heart inside your hand\nBut you played it with a beating\nThrow your soul through every open door\nCount your blessings to find what you look for\nTurned my sorrow into treasured gold\nYou pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow\nwe could've had it all\nWe could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nIt all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nWe could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nYou had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nAnd you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nWe could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nRolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\nYou had my heart inside your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)\nBut you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it\nTo the beat\nSource: LyricFind\nSongwriters: Adele Laurie Blue Adkins / Paul Richard Epworth\nRolling in the Deep lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Universal Music Publishing Group, BMG Rights

Leaked?","review":"Hi Apple, I just got thIs app because I wanted to see if there were any rallies close by. I Had Already tried to sign up for two of them but those stupid Gen Zers Took all the tickEts AND DID NOT GO? (PS for anyone worrying, I heard that President Dump is going to be banning the terrorisT app “Tok Tik” soon, so this problem should stop!) Anyways, as soon as I opened the app I had to give my phone numbeR? Which seems strange, as I try not to give that oUt because my son is always watching these YouTube scaMming videos, where people call you and tell you a lie to get your information. But I did it, because I was our country to b̷̨͈̳̖̖̪̫̖́͊̆̕͜͝ẻ̷̢̨̡͓͔̼̜̅̃̽̍̎̕͠ ̶̢̩̈̓̓̈̍̓̚͝ġ̵͍̫̮̘̗̅̒̄͋͘r̵͕͉͊͊̐͋̃́͘e̷̼̬̬̬̬̿̎́͒ȧ̴̭͖̫͔̠͔̒̊t̵̪̭͂̾̎̀͜ ̶̣̮͑̾̂͂̓̐͛͒̃̂a̴͙̺̔̒͗͑̂̒̍̊͝͝ǧ̶̲͇̋̈́̿̊́́͒a̵̡̨̜͎̖͇̳͆̊̚͜į̸̩̝̞͔̜̫̀́̋̔̔̈̔̂͝ͅn̷̢̯̜̳͉̔͗͌̀̃́̃͂̔͘ (1965 and before)! BUT THEN they asked me to enter my full name and my email and zip code! I got the aPp so I wouldn’t have to enter any of this information! So I could just go on there instead of Signing up through my phOne or email. Then they asked for my zip code? AND asked to use My location! I find this ridicUlous and I am planning on deleting the app as soon as I post this. I am scared that they have hacked my Camera. Also all of the pages took forever to load. I don’t have forever to wait! I am 46 years young and it feels like I might die of old age before it loads sometimes...\nAnyways, Have a good day! As I know Apple isn’t in control of this app!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177062434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:01:33Z","userName":"Chrissy33333","title":"Absolute worst app ever","review":"We all know he wants to get rid of TikTok cause he’s butt hurt it took down his Tulsa show.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177062206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:01:30Z","userName":"emilyvang6","title":"tiktok","review":"get this sh*t outta here 🥳","rating":1}},{"id":"6177061624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:01:20Z","userName":"toallthetrumpets","title":"No recommended","review":"This app is terrible and no I’m not a gen Z I’m actually 22 and I’m genuinely concerned for our presidents choice in apps or companies that control these apps because I wanted to know everything about what he is up to and I just can’t get the grip of it I mean my phone crashed the minute after I opened the app and it caught a bug and it has taken over my phone and now I need a new phone. I am very disappointed especially in the president I expected this app to have top notch royalty data expect in reality it was a bootleg cheap data app. Sorry not sorry I’m not the only one experiencing this. -2322/10","rating":1}}]}
