I have stood w trump since I seen the photo of him getting a spray tan w no towel and instantly fell in love. But anyways when the app finally downloaded after abt 30 minutes it only informed me about a Roomba? In the picture was a circular vacuum cleaner. I scrolled down the page abt vacuum cleaners but there was no way to get out of it. I tried to then report a problem but my phone froze. It took an hour before my phone unfroze and then I deleted the app. Or at least tried too BUT IT WONT LET ME. Then, this is the weirdest part, he spoke to me. Trump himself spoke to me. And the things he has said to me I can not repeat. I am only 15 and he was telling me about what he does to his dog when they are alone. I didn’t even know trump had a dog. So please for your own sake DO NOT GET THIS APP!!","rating":1,"title":"Not what u think","date":"2020-07-09T18:40:23Z","userName":"WOOD DRWGON LOVER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177613651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Upon opening the app I was horrified. Who the hell is that man and why does he look so scary!? Now I’m not one to start conspiracy theories or anything but I’m sure I’ve seen this pedo before. On the app I watched \nthis movie that took place on a space ship where Michael Jackson was the pilot. The aliens went to a planet where the only supply of food were carrots, yams, and Cheetos. Everyone there was orange. When Michael Jackson abducted Donald Trump, they did not get along. Although Michael Jackson m0lested little boys, Donald Trump was *in the movie~...and in real life* a homophobe so he disliked Michael Jackson. Because they kept arguing, Michael Jackson and his fleet of aliens dropped Donald off on earth. \nMy bad for going off on a tangent, but I think it is ridiculous of that type of film to be displayed on this app. The movie was absolutely horrible and whoever directed it should be fired immediately. Also I’m allergic to Cheetos.","rating":1,"title":"I’m allergic to Cheetos","date":"2020-07-09T17:43:10Z","userName":"Melaniuh","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177460068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is completely worthless. Despite the numerous glitches when does trying to perform basic ask it was incredibly hard to use. I myself a Republican woman of color trying to support our marvelous president would like a better app than this. It’s completely disgusts me how worthless this app is. Upstanding people shouldn’t have to deal with this type of tomfoolery we’re trying to support the president. How are we as a people ever supposed to get better if we can’t even rely on the resources given to us. This app is sad and makes me want to throw up. Not only did it not work but it took information off my phone. I started to get multiple emails and calls from numerous companies that I didn’t sign up for. I cannot believe how bad this app is reading the reviews I thought it was fake but getting the app I now know it’s real so sad.","rating":1,"title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","date":"2020-07-09T16:55:23Z","userName":"ollive5567","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177416338","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support our “wonderful” president 😇 and not only did it take FOREVER to download it gave my phone a virus!!!

I know people might not believe now that this whole thing is happening, but I’m just trying to warn people and let people know before this happens to them. I do not enjoy this at all and I got very frustrated and confused but I soon realized it was this app. I kept trying to make it start that way I could keep the app but after trying so many times with the outcome of falling each time, I knew I had to stop and had to face delete if the app. \n I would like to keep this short that way I do not waste your time. \n                           \n                             Thank you.","rating":1,"title":"Don’t Get It!","date":"2020-07-09T14:38:59Z","userName":"Anonymous ⏳","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176603907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I installed the app to support our beloved president that is supported by everyone and definitely did not almost get arrested by Iraq☺️✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️. Anyways I realized that the app required my phone number and I think this is unexceptional because he already has a family plus all his side chicks so what more could he want. But naturally I put my phone number in and well…👁👄👁. Soon I was texting the president. He was being really dry and just asking me wyd?? So naturally I blocked the number and we’ll I should not have done that.😐. He sent all the birds to spy on me. They were all filming me with their camera eyes. But I convinced them that what they were doing was creepy. So I helped them gave them a little advice and we became homies. 😝. In conclusion I would not get this app because it cause me not to vote for Donald trump anymore. Thank you for your time. 😗✌🏽.
