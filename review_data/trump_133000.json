I was motivated to get this app so after sticking my phone in some rice I came right back here. Sadly as the app was opening some horrid ear rape started playing so I had to go to the hospital. As I was sitting in the hospital I was thinking about my intense longing for this app. I couldn’t take not having this app created for our racist, homophobic, sexist, fascist, incompetent, narcissistic, ignorant and unfit (and ugly) president on my phone. Once I left the hospital I realized... if all this stuff was happening so I couldn’t get the app it’s probably for a reason. Don’t get this app I’m pretty sure it’s cursed.","date":"2020-07-08T20:47:10Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173675204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gen Z 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚🏾\u200D♀️F trumppppppop🧚🏾\u200D♀️","review":"This app so racist it killed my family🎊🤮.Now I’m an orphaned and all alone🥱.🧚🏾\u200D♀️DON’T get this app it will turn also turn you permanently orange.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬\nBunker Boy is a Bi?!@.Save Barron 2020🤯🤬😱💩.Trump 2020 on a grave stone☠️💀👽.My family is back from the dead 👻👻.Oh my gosh Trump just molly whopped my grandma 👵🏽 helppppp😁😁😁😁😁.rip grandma.He kills people grandmas don’t get this or ya grandma gone meet Jesus 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽.","date":"2020-07-08T20:47:09Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173674699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Papi.cacho","isEdited":false,"title":"🤬🤬🤬🤬👉👌🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","review":"🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤧🤮🤮🤧🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤑🤮🤕🤢🤕🤕🤕🤑🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤑🤮🤮🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T20:46:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173673678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lickthesetoes","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible, ugly, trash.","review":"someone told you that you were fly hour sexy and beautiful but ur nothing like that ur nothing of the sort.

Once it FINALLY downloaded after 6 hours of the screeching music, my phone suddenly stopped working. Then it got really bad. Rats infested my home, my power went out, and then the worst thing of all, the moths. Thousands of moths swarmed my house! This made no sense to me because I had no lights on due to the power outage, then I realized it was the app. I tried to delete it but my phone was on fire, I had to put it in my neighbors freezer to cool it down ( my freezer was down due to the power outage) when I finally deleted it. Everything went back to normal as my favorite song Replay, by Jason Derulo played. Do not download this app unless you wish to bring terror into your house. If I could give this app a lower rating I would, -1000/10. It’s a no from me. \nXoxo,\nGossip girl","date":"2020-07-08T20:46:24Z","rating":1}}]}
