This app gave such a big glitch to my phone. I tried to power off my phone, re-download the app, reset a few things in my settings, and clear space even though it wasn’t needed. The third time around that I downloaded the app, my phone started glitching again about two hours later. I then got frustrated and went to sleep deciding that I would just try it the next day. The next day came around and my phone was moving so slow and apps would disappear and then reappear hours later. Apps were moving so slow it was almost as if you were on your computer clicking the “ Google” app over and over again waiting for it to pop up and then once it popped up, plenty of tabs appeared. Not to mention how truly irritating phone calls were because of this app. Every time someone would call me, the answer button wouldn’t pop up until about 3 rings in, and every time I tried to call someone, it would take about 2 minutes just to press call. I then proceeded to go on the app to see how it would work but it was moving too slow and I finally decided to delete the app for good. I was so disappointed within this week span of phone glitching this app caused me. I was also embarrassed due to the fact that I told my Husband and my family members about the app and about how excited I was to be using it, but here I am deleting the app because of glitching. I called one of my closest friends, that I told the app about, a few hours before I decided to write this review. She explained to me how she deleted the app the same day she downloaded it because of issues it caused her phone. My Husband never ended up downloading the app because he has actually been busy with work and trying to be extremely safe during this terrible virus. I did end up telling him about my experience and he was glad that he never downloaded it and he encouraged me to write a review.","rating":1}}]}
