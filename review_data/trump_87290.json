But as soon as the downloaded the app packages with trump T-shirts, hats, stickers, pins, and everything that he sells on his website started to show up in boxes in front of my house, before I could burn the boxes with the stuff inside I realized that every single window from my 3 story house was blocked by these packages, I got my professionally trained box eating snail army to come eat us out, but after hours of eating, it became obvious that there was no escape. When I went to grab a drink of water because I was tired of the dry boxes, all that came out was liquified box. I picked up my phone to call 911 because me and my box eating snail army could not escape now, but when someone picked up the phone it was DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF! He started hysterically laughing and telling me that I could live in that house forever, and eat the boxes, or die. I could live a life like that, so I went downstairs to break it to the children in my basement, that they were free to roam the house, but soon all of the furniture, and everything in between would turn into boxes with trump T-shirts’ and flags. But I knew u couldn’t live a life like that, so I grabbed the blood and went to my sacrificing room, but it was only me that would be next. Right now I’m in hell, and satan in typing this because my fingers turned into boxes and I can’t type anymore. But this app the terrible and I do not recommend. 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😠😠😠","isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING","rating":1,"userName":"DaKangaroo06"}},{"id":"6172982538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:55:57Z","review":"Overall I hate this president and I want this app gone 🥰","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"userName":"best_bi"}},{"id":"6172943981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:44:00Z","review":"This app made my dog run away and killed my fish I hate ittttttt.🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮DON’T GET IT 🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢if y’all get y’all are clowns 🤡🤡🤡","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst","rating":1,"userName":"gohetie"}},{"id":"6172904478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:31:38Z","review":"It always took forever to load and crashed every second.
