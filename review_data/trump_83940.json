First the app look 49 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD. In doing so it left my phone practically completely useless and used up ALL 64 Gigabytes of my data!!!! When it finally downloaded I went into the app and it started asking to use my face id, for my location, my social security number, my credit card number, AND permission to charge my card whenever they wanted 🙄.  When I said no, it would not let me close the app until I said yes. When I said yes, it made me sign a terms of agreement that stated I agreed for CHINA, RUSSIA, AND NORTH KOREA to use all of my information and data as they pleased.  This morning I woke up to the fact that 48 PEOPLE HAD STOLEN MY IDENTITY😭😭😭😭. Anyway, using the app was a nightmare. Super user unfriendly. i was skeptical of some of the reviews on here saying the news on the app burned their eyes but ITS TRUE!!!! reading the news legit made my eyes start heating up. Like others, I thought this was a fluke until I looked again and my EYEBALLS ERUPTED INTO FLAMES!!!! 0/10 for safety. By this time I had enough and I tried to delete the app. However, when I would try to delete it, the app would just pop back up. Every time it popped back up, I would get a notification that says “you will not be free of me” Upon getting the notification every cupboard in my house opened and then shut violently. In the corner of my eye I would keep seeing the same large shadow lurking. After a few days of doors randomly shutting, walls building themselves seemingly out of nowhere where they weren’t there before and the message cryptic message “covfefe” written in blood on my walls and mirrors, donald trump himself appeared in my bedroom and just stared at my for hours, deciding whom in the house to possess. \n\nif i could give this app a 0/10 so would. I am fearful for my life and this ghost will not leave me alone. I am so scared that I will never get this app off my phone. If anyone knows a good priest or apple repairman please let a girl know 😭"}},{"id":"6178656588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:45:49Z","userName":"luisavq","rating":1,"title":"Trouble","review":"The application took 2 days to download... nonsense!!"}},{"id":"6178654608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:45:03Z","userName":"Hahsyshehshehehrrhbr","rating":1,"title":"Penis","review":"First of all this app starts off with nude phots of trump being spray tanned and ends with him singing lil nas x. So inappropriate."}}]}
