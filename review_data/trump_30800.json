The text read on my screen became scrambled and came out as fake news \n2.  I suddenly became incapable of thinking for myself \n3. I lost all empathy for other human beings\n4. Every time I try to type or speak the words come out all jumbled?? (Ex. “covfefe”)???\n5. I think the images got hacked? Looking for an image of my president but all I can see is a raging narcissist \n6. My IQ dropped 100 points upon download.
