I’m broke so Trump was about to pay for my new phone because he caused this mess and sometimes when I turn my phone off the App appears and I’m kinda scared that Trump is watching me😰, but yes I would  not download this app from all the problems they are causing on my phone\n\n-Your favorite Gen Z","userName":"Jared Wilis","date":"2020-07-08T15:35:55Z","title":"Never again 😑","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171872518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app is so crazy and horrible i'm still in shock at what happened 😱😱 i downloaded the app to support the annoying orange that invaded the white house and then when i opened the app my phone screen shattered 😖😖 not only did it completely shatter but when i tried to go into the app again it glitched out 😾 so i tried one more time and his nudes showed up on the screen 😟 so i tried shutting off my phone to get the deformed rotten cantaloupe off of my screen but it didn't work 💔💔💔💔 so then when i tried to switch apps i seen the most DISGUSTING LOOKING orange sticks fly out of my screen and slap me and pinch my dog 🙄 then i realized they were sticks they were fingers 😓 in fact they were HIS fingers 🤯🤯 i would've given it 0 stars if that was an option 😠 so disappointed ☹️☹️☹️","userName":"Animal girl 264","date":"2020-07-08T11:38:11Z","title":"my terrible experience","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177857767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app is very inappropriate. the things the president has said to citizens of the US of America is very truly threatening and disrespectful and the things that go on in this app is absolutely disgusting . this app has completely ruined my brand new iPhone 8 Plus and now we have to get it fixed . my phone has been doing weird things after a day of this app and I have heard that it’s been happening to a lot of my friends too after launching this app on their device 😢😢 . it was so hard to find your way through the app . it is so glitchy and laggy and and it is a waste of time . no one wants to use this app in the first place anyways , i don’t know why this app is a thing but i just have to say one more thing ..... mr. ✨orange ✨ ... watch out . 👸🏿😚💋💋💋","userName":"Musicllyuser","date":"2020-07-09T18:57:55Z","title":"absolutely terrifying 😖","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177802141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i mean the title literally says it all this app is garbage. i’m not with these kids from tik tok but i do believe and agree that the app is still terrible. First of all it is slow and clunky, apps like this should not exist on this app store, it tarnishes the good name of apple. second of all it spreads fake news, why would you let an app like this be on here?!?!? honestly it shows how little respect and how little you care about the users on this platform if you are going to let this app on here! please apple do the right thing and remove this app for all of its idiotic qualities or aleast make it easier and better to use! and it would be nice if you could control the news being put out because it’s just not right to feed people of america (or anywhere tbh) fake news","userName":"matt12436744","date":"2020-07-09T18:41:27Z","title":"terrible","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177774081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i got this app to follow up with the politics and stuff i know no knowledge about. i was so disgusted by what i opened the app up to. i can’t believe they would design an app like this. i don’t want to see orange mans ding dong. i went straight to take the app off my phone because i don’t want to see that small again. but then shortly there was a man in all black that knocked on my door demanding to see me. i yelled out my door asking what he wanted. he said 🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸 as he flashed me. then i ran upstairs to my dog laying there missing a paw. before i went downstairs it was there. i blame trump and his app on this. luckily i found a vet that only will make me pay 20 billion dollars. i would like it if trump pays for what he has done. don’t get this app if you don’t want to go through this also. pray for my dog","userName":"Whjoha.","date":"2020-07-09T18:32:57Z","title":"honey no✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177732157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Hello, I download this app thinking that I’ll be finally meeting the orange Cheeto ✨✨ but unfortunately once I enter the app it started to glitch and call me names like fatty and ugly hurting my nonexistent feelings 🙃 so I decided to delete it and downloaded once again having faith that this time I will get to see the orange Oompa Loompa 🧚🏼\u200D♂️🥰 but NO, I enter the app and the first thing I saw was lot of writing and to my disadvantage I can’t even read not only that but the app made my grandmother pass out and I had to go to the hospital and stay with her for weeks but that is not all not only did it make my grandmother have a seizure it also made my math teacher forget how to do equation.

I could not be concerned with this low life  so I continued my journey for my toe and suddenly trumps stomach turned blue and he had a vasectomy which spat out my toe which I grabbed and told him he was a rude man for eating my toe. I told him his hairline looks like the low tide when he started pouting the alarm clock behind him turned green and blew out the giraffes eardrums which fell on the ground and trump ate them I would tell the rest but that’s the giraffe story to tell","userName":"creepy pasta11110000","date":"2020-07-09T18:01:03Z","title":"It bit my toe off","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177636624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Terrible. My phone will not stop crashing, and the viruses it gave me rendered my phone unusable, and I can’t afford to replace it. I had to go to great lengths just to leave this review in hopes that I reach someone so they don’t make the same mistakes! I was hoping for compensation, however upon reading into the terms of use and the terms and conditions of this app, DJTFP cannot be held accountable for the loss I have suffered by their hands. :( Although that statement is not unfamiliar to me, as he is often not held accountable for his actions (the children he raped and molested, the women he harassed and raped, etc. etc.), I have decided to just delete the app and leave a review in its place. I hope I reach someone! I believe this app should be taken off the app store.

Second, as soon as I downloaded it Gru and his Minions appeared outside of my house and stalked me for three days. They followed me to my work and my boss fired me for Gru and his minions solicited outside my job and didn’t let costumers in. They were threading to eat their cat food and shave their cats. Then, on the third day they broke into my house, neutered my cat, shaved his legs, and ate all his cat food. They also stole all my mail and locked my little sister in the basement. They keep me locked up in the attic and killed my mother and father using the fart gun. I 100% do think ANYBODY SHOULD download this app.  I do not recommended this app at all!!!!!","userName":"Isabel Orellana","date":"2020-07-09T17:28:23Z","title":"This app killed my family","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177409941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app was an absolute MESS. i wanted to see what the orange is trying to mess up today, and in fact it was everything!! wow what a surprise... not really i expected nothing less. anyways when i opened it it had an LGBTQ+ flag... we all know he is definitely an advocate for the community... oh wait that was me! silly me actually the flag had a big X on it. i'm not sure what he meant by that maybe he is against it? anyways, he also had a title above saying \"all lives matter\" hmmm, if they did we wouldn't have to say black lives matter! if 2+2=4 then why do you say \"all lives matter\" in relation to BLM? oh yeah! because your racist!! to be honest i don't think willy wonka would want this oompa loompa in his factory and we stan willy wonka. the stupidity on this app is ASTRONOMICAL. we should ban this app, you know?","userName":"Lizzie_Elizabeth","date":"2020-07-09T16:40:20Z","title":"just dont","isEdited":false}}]}
