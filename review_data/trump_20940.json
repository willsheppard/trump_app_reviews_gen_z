I was wrong. As soon as my friend showed me the picture of this app, I hurled all over my phone. I’m 69 years old, I shouldn’t have to through this!

I knew from there I was in for a bumpy ride. I opened the app to a completely unprofessional layout with pictures of some Cheeto everywhere. I was so confused. I now know why it said age restricted.

The app kept on crashing and I decided to delete it instead, when I heard noises coming from outside my window. It was him, he was building a wall outside my house while hissing at me! “TTHHHH” before I noticed he threw a brick at my window and it knocked me unconscious. I awoke to realize he stole all my Cheetos from the pantry."}},{"id":"6174402034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fairylux","title":"Unexceptional","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:10:45Z","review":"I cant believe this app is even allowed on the app store! I was just minding my business, trying to keep up with the Trump news and rally events.
