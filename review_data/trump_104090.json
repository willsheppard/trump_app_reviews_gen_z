I was expecting a 5 star app, simply because it was made for and from our president, Donald Cheeto Trump. What I was meet with took me back completely. As I am typing this a singular tear drop runs down my cold, rosy, face. When I open the app I saw a toolbar with the word artisan crafted  fan fictions written on it. As a 48 year-old anime lover I immediately clicked on it. What I was met with completely took me back and utter and complete shock the fan fiction is as follows;\n\n  ‚ÄúToday I went to the bakery by my house. Just like every day. Except this time I saw HIM. The person I suspect to be my sole mate. His long wispy yellow hair was blowing from the ceiling fans, his pot belliedStomach was flopping over his belt. I have never seen anything more attractive in my life. I never expected to see him again never in my life. But then at noon today at work I saw him enter. He was the new hire. And he shared a desk cluster with me. As it turns out his personality was just distracted as his looks.  He love to get a pointless arguments about human rights, and when else failed he just started talking about economics. Everything about him was so attractive. I never expected him, at the end of the day, to ask me out to golfing game. As. A. Date. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I had only known this man for less than a day. And he too, loved me. So I picked up the prettiest golfing skirt tank top visor and shoes I could find and when I met him thereHe was wearing a sweat stained white polo with sweat stained matching white shirt socks shoes and visor. Little did I know he was so rich that he had for the people to play for him. I was able to talk to him. I did end of the day right when the sun was about to say over the mountains in the background, he leaned over to kiss me when I asked for his name he said Donald Cheeto TrumpI‚Äôve never heard of a name more attractive than that. As I leaned in to kiss him he whispered into my ear. ‚ÄúI...am.... a white suprematist...‚Äù The end‚Äù \n\nnow I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt know why this liberal propaganda was on my president‚Äôs 2020 campaign app. These liberals must be stopped before they can do real damage. These liberals are ridiculous I cannot believe they decided to hack into Donald Cheeto trumps campaign app and leave this sentence: he is a white supremacist at the end of a disgusting fanfiction it should not be for any man‚Äôs eyes although that sentence is true it‚Äôs still repulsed me. And for this reason I had to delete the app burn my phone and throw the ashes into a nearby river IThen had a funeral for it because all of my nieces nephews and grandchildren‚Äôs photos were on it. I am typing this from my 2002 silver premium Nintendo refrigerator.I do not recommend this app for any sane human. it disgusted me. \n\nAnyways Trump 2020 (not really though eww)\n\nOh and it crashed my phone over night (for real) so yah that‚Äôs it","rating":1,"userName":"OFFENSIVE FANFICTION","isEdited":false,"title":"Distasteful fanfiction","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:08Z"}},{"id":"6177539285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"a racist person does not deserve their own app.","rating":1,"userName":"Sadie1122","isEdited":false,"title":"eww","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:28Z"}},{"id":"6177524268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"worst app ever.
