This has never happened before and I think it was because of the app. But other than that gen-z  kids are the best they are always finding out ways to put smart the president. And about the app the kept saying it wouldn’t work because it had crashed while trying to fix it I realized I don’t care about trump and stupid ideas he is just Desperate Cheeto as Randy Rainbow would call him."}},{"id":"6172269507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:33:07Z","userName":"moooo02Z","rating":1,"title":"I went blind","review":"I thought it would be a good idea to download this app to say updated with my king. As i was opening this app it took FOREVER to load. but i was just so excited and i wanted to wait for it to load. well...2 days passed and it still wasn’t loading. and yes...i looked at my screen the whole 2 hours. now i am currently at the hospital getting my eyes checks because i am temporary (or permanently) BLIND in both eyes. i also have a very painful migraine and i want to cry. and it was al because of this app. DONT DOWNLOAD IT!!!"}},{"id":"6172247786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:27:08Z","userName":"Molly Guinan","rating":1,"title":"Icky 🦦","review":"One day on the beach there was a sand crab that I named Sally. I loved that sand crab so much. But my mom said I couldn’t take him home so I cried and I cried. This other time there was a bird who pooped on my dad’s head at the beach and I cried bc I was in the bathroom when it happened and i didn’t get to see it happen. Now I am afraid of pelicans bc that’s what type of bird it was. But I am a fan of the New Orleans Pelicans so I’m in quite the pickle. I thought this app would help me with that and it didn’t. (Also if we can’t have TikTok, you can’t have your app) 😘😘"}},{"id":"6171332523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T08:32:42Z","userName":"WutuWant1","rating":1,"title":"No❤️","review":"Honestly I wanted orange man to leave me alone but this app quickened the pace of my dogs death and it was very concerning because he was doing fine but all of a sudden after downloading this app he came down with an illness and started saying weird stuff like ra-ra-ra-roll 🛹 🤯up⬆️👨\u200D🦼to😭😩the😳🧎\u200D♂️party🎉😡🌸with👨🏻\u200D🦳😻my🤸🏾\u200D♀️👍crazy🤪🪑pink🌸wig😱😱and I don’t know what this means but it seems to have stemmed from this app so I would definitely not get it because apparently it tracks u too so overall this app is bad now imma go walk my fish"}},{"id":"6166000311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-07T00:20:21Z","userName":"gloomyleena","rating":1,"title":"✨ Terrible ✨","review":"TW // Trump \n\nI downloaded this app to show my ever present and unconditional support of Trump.

After many flirtatious texts from him such as “For your eyes only, friend” and “I’ve selected you specially” I thought I had finally wiggled my way into the White House, but apparently those are automated messages from his campaign and I’m the bad guy for sending a couple saucy things! But overall, this app is horrendous and I wouldn’t wish the use of it upon my worst enemy."}},{"id":"6145381002","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T18:58:33Z","userName":"i hate cheetos 😤👊🏼","rating":1,"title":"No 🤪to 🧚🏼✨Cheeto ✨💫puff 😤👊🏼","review":"I love this app but something strange happened, as I was trying it a big Cheeto puff arrived at my screen and I screamed in agony as I saw the Cheeto puffs wig 🤮fly out the screen and hit me, I fell to the floor and told him to get away, I woke up screaming and now I have nightmares about the big Cheeto that haunts my dreams with a cult of kyles and Karen’s surrounding me saying horrid things like “ all lives matter” it was too much and then one day I died🤪👻 but they still haunt me and now I can’t see oranges, Cheetos and trash the same without remembering."}},{"id":"6141368334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T20:41:46Z","userName":"Cutekitten24","rating":1,"title":"Very unprofessional and ghetto","review":"Whew chile where do I even start with this one🤢🤮.

I tried walking into a store but the woman stopped me because I wasnt wearing a mask! I tried pushing the lady but someone near me coughed. A week later my house burned down and my dog died. UNBELIEVABLE. This app gave me such bad luck. I thought it was a coincidence but after I kept the app I got diarrhea and internal bleeding! As soon as I deleted this app I was in perfect health. I now stand with Gen Z and the liberals. Trump gives you diarrhea, it burns your bum hole..

I don’t like the president anymore after this horrid app he released💖"}}]}
