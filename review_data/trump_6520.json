I can’t believe that any good minded person would be subjugated to this sort of mental torture that is the orang clown. I feel that my entire existence is tarnished just by the very fact that this app ever graced my phone and beautiful mind. I have never whisked so harshly for my eyes to be gouged for the sake to unsee the misleading information given in this app. Very bad! Do not recommend!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:16:19Z"}},{"id":"6173992780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Madgirl800","rating":1,"title":"My oranges came to life 😱","review":"So as soon as I downloaded the app to honor my beloved sexy Cheeto president, I got hungry, so I went downstairs to my kitchen to get an orange, but I couldn’t find any. I was looking everywhere, and I went to my sisters room to ask if she knew where they where, and I saw she was getting killed by the oranges! I screamed and ran downstairs and called the police, but I found that the police station near my house was taken over by the oranges! So now my town is being ruled by oranges and we are all terrified. So because of this I do not recommend this app. 0/10 😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:45:31Z"}},{"id":"6173946205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sid tbe science kid","rating":1,"title":"Lemme just start with 🤮🤮🤮🤮","review":"This app is one of the most disgusting revolting horrifying aggravating stupid app that I have ever come across in my reviewing days I am overly horrified to have come across this app and hope that my words can protect another from downloading this app. 🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️you tried hard🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️ but it wasn’t enough❤️🧚\u200D♂️Eiffel heartedly recommend any other person who download this app to not get too horrified by the content or the soul man that this app is supporting,Along with the weird orange visage of his skin tone that can actually be horrifying to many people around","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:27:54Z"}},{"id":"6173895995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"1littlefluffer","rating":1,"title":"Not worth the hype😤","review":"So I got this app because I wanted to support our lovely Cheeto leader🥰😊💫 but then it took so long to download, almost an entire hour and by that time it just wasn’t worth it. The app itself is SOOOOOO hard to navigate, and I get so many stupid notification that I didn’t sign up for?!? \n\nIt also asked for my social security number and my phone number which I do not give out no ma’am. Over all, so not worth the wait time, and now I can’t seem to support the racial idiot that runs our country😭😢 it’s horrible and I’m so upset about this.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:09:30Z"}},{"id":"6173878401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"oompaloompa body","rating":1,"title":"✨worst of the vibes😡✨","review":"i downloaded this app to show support for the trumpkin oompaloompa but it’s an outrage😡it was full of pictures of this pumpkin with a wig i don’t understand🍊 some guys moved in and said i had to bow down🙇and join the cult😎 after taking days to download the app started yelling racial slurs at my cat😿 worst of all my fbi guy was replaced with a pickle, this day could not get worse. i even ordered tickets to the racist rally✨ but unfortunately 😢i had to walk my brother and pet my lonely cactus. \nyikes chille n e ways ✌️\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:03:04Z"}},{"id":"6173703382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AleGrande!","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever 👁👄👁","review":"This app is absolutely poorly designed. It took many hours to actually download it. The app makes my phone really glitchy and it acts up out of nowhere. I also kept on seeing an ugly orange face on my screen for some reason. 🍊 Most people want this app deleted off of the App Store. I thought that this app would benefit my family and I about politics, but it was the whole opposite of that.  I’ve seen many reviews like these and they are all 100% accurate ! Do not use this app because it’s just not worth your time. :)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:57:27Z"}},{"id":"6173693011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"justine666333","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP MADE MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER DEAF AND MADE MY DOG DIE","review":"I wish there was a way to leave a zero star review but since there is not I guess I’ll give it a one star. When I opened the app it let out a high pitch screeching sound that I could not get to stop, even after uninstalling it. The sound was so loud and disturbing that when I took my dog on a walk he, leapt over the nearest bridge. I still am hearing this sound to this day and I uninstalled it FOUR WEEKS AGO 😡😤 The sound also caused my great grandmother to go deaf and she doesn’t even know ASL so thanks a lot you big 🍊. Say hi to Willy Wonka at the factory for me sweet heart ❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:35Z"}},{"id":"6173669879","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ken (/^o^)/","rating":1,"title":"NEVER download this","review":"I downloaded this because I wanted to show support for our country’s own orange gremlin 🍊🧚🏻🍊 but am TERRIBLY disappointed 😡. It took 5 hours to download, I can’t even keep the app open for 1 second before it crashes, and NO manager is coming to give me a refund when I yell for them 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻. My Karen spirit is QUAKING with rage 🤬🤬. All I wanted was a platform where I could have the FREEDOM (because this is a free country, snowflakes🇺🇸) be RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, and dehumanize all MINORITIES without being ATTACKED for my lack of basic human decency. This app is a DISGRACE to all of MY president’s fascist ideals, and I DEMAND a manager.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:45:16Z"}},{"id":"6173662801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jzjsushabjd","rating":1,"title":"i almost died because of this app😾😱","review":"i almost died downloading this app!😡 it put a curse on my whole family.😨 i downloaded it yesterday and immediately afterward big orange god trump summoned in my room and started chanting, “maga, maga, MAGA.

I wanted a safe place to hear all the necessary information about Mr. Orange. But when I downloaded it, i was shocked to see it utterly kill my phone. I am typing this up on my computer because my phone is smoking on the floor! Not only did it kill my phone, it also killed my dear mother who was holding the phone at the time. I am in mourning. I am horrified. And I am stricken with sadness. Please, for your own safety, and the safety of those around you, do not download this app. People are dying!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:42:04Z"}}]}
