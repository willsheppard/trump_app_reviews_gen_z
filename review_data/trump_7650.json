When I got on the app I say a giant squirrel standing on top of the Eiffel Tower chanting “orange for president”. I have horrible memories of it and I keep dreaming about. I deciding to keep exploring to supporting our amazing president. Then my phone crashed. Nobody got hurt but it was a three way crash and took a lot of insurance money. So therefore I would totally not recommend downloading this app unless you are a racist pedo such as someone else I know. ✨🧚","userName":"i wrote a review yay","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I died","date":"2020-07-09T15:41:14Z"}},{"id":"6177154584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has crashed my phone, stolen my data, made my dad go to the store for “milk” and he hasn’t come back, and made my dog pee on my bed five times in the past half hour. I opened the app and was met with a scary man who bought children from Jeffery Epstein and it made me feel like I was next. I hope no one has to experience this app ever again. Also, don’t delete tik tok becuase that’s where my serotonin comes from and if he takes that we will find away to bring him down.

All of my friends had different horror stories about it. Some people had their phones shut down, others started glitching and for some reason one persons phone started playing the gummy bear album. My wasn’t that exciting. At first it was normal then it froze up and kept shutting me out of the app and eventually it started turning my phone off. It made me so frustrated!! DO NOT GET THIS APP ITS DISGUSTING!!","userName":"Are you my water?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting app","date":"2020-07-09T14:29:36Z"}},{"id":"6176912633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app I was thinking ‘what a great way to be a “true american”. Then when I opened it i found a HISSING RACIST CHEETO PUFF on my screen. I threw up numerous times and cried 15 times. My eyes started bleeding and i watched some my little pony to calm my mind. After that I was scrolling through my phone and got a notification from the app saying they are coming for me. Apparently they want an army of children. I politely declined them when the came, with a broomstick in their butts. THE ANNOYING ORANGE IS REAL SAVE YOURSELVES HE IS COMING FOR YOU!!!!🤬🤬🤬","userName":"ronaldochavez","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app gave me A.I.D.s🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-09T14:21:27Z"}},{"id":"6176909072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to see the hype. The hype, just not it. It’s just such a boring icon just sitting on my home screen not to mention what it looks like when you actually open the app. DISGRACEFUL. Anyway it keeps crashing my phone and now I have 5 new contacts that keep texting and calling me. So this app has put a virus in my phone and now there’s really nothing I can do. All in all, do not download this app it is worthless and with just ruin your device.

I don’t know what happened, but as soon as this app somehow loaded itself on my phone (I didn’t want it, but I guess the racist electoral college did?) the app started taking away human rights and making a mockery of my phone! All the other phones think my phone is bad now. This app in an embarrassment! And it constantly makes fun of everyone who isn’t a straight white man. The app is so bad that twitter deleted itself off my phone! DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!!","userName":"bananasam24","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible!","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:19Z"}},{"id":"6176852205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought it was a joke when everyone said it took days or even weeks to download but really took 169 hours to download! Nonetheless I started scrolling through the app and quickly noticed that it kept glitching. Not only that, but once I closed the app my phone died when it was at 100%. After I finally got it to turn back on my wallpaper was changed to a picture of a moldy Cheeto with come highlighter colored wig on. I almost puked it looked so gross! If I could rate it negative stars I would","userName":"✨anyone else✨💕🎉💞","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET","date":"2020-07-09T14:05:35Z"}},{"id":"6176787310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I could rate this zero stars because as soon as I download it or open it up it shut down.I tried to open it up again and it shut right back down and then all of a sudden my Xbox turned off and my water heater went out and my air conditioner! It also started playing infinite reruns of the Muppets and clowns on my TV! I’m terrified of muppets and clowns!🤬🤬0/10 Would not recommend. The app is absolutely terrible and horrendous! Even managed to get mud on my dog After I washed it!","userName":"Morray Grey","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible!! Do Not get!","date":"2020-07-09T13:48:29Z"}}]}
