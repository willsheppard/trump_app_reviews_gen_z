The battery went low, my phone froze, and shortly after my phone completely shut down. After numerous attempts to restart my phone the signal that my phone was dead appeared as well as an iTunes symbol. I tried everything to fix my phone but nothing worked. I finally took it to the Verizon store and they said there was no way to fix my phone and I had to buy a new one. It wasn’t like my phone had been old and was bound to break, I had recently purchased my phone less than a year before. If you are still reading this, please do not vote for trump in the 2020 presidential election. Trump is a racist and sexist man who only cares for himself and not the well being of his people. Need an example? He is literally holding rally’s during a pandemic, a pandemic! No one was social  distancing at his rally and some of his staff who visited the rally tested positive for the virus. Why are his rally’s so important that he is willing to risk the health of his own people. Don’t get me started on how oblivious and racist he is. A quick example of this is how he called a mural for the blm protest a “symbol of hate”. Seriously! How is this our president, his dream of “making America great again” is   making it white people country where minorities are treated as less, women are viewed as objects, and members of the lgbtq community are made to feel that there is something wrong with them?! It’s 2020, there’s no excuse for this crap. And please vote! If you are not voting at all, you are part of the problem! If you are able to vote, you have to vote! I understand that Biden might not be everyone’s first choice but trump cannot be re-elected. So yeah this app is awful.","userName":"wfhrbhqlqpwoncmammakfhd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:58:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP!!
