First off, I don’t appreciate that there is no “continue as a guest” option. I don’t want to commit to anything blindly!! \nSecondly, who made this app and who is in charge of running it? Because it’s awful. My thirteen year old dog could have made a more functional app. Also it looks like a child designed it. Speaking of children, it says this is for ages 17+ but last I checked, you have to be 18 to vote? By the time these kids can vote, trump won’t be up for election so????? Listen, at the end of the day, I just need a more cohesive experience. AND I should be able to try it out before being forced to commit and provide my phone number. Think of all the rogues (is that spelled right?) why have access to it now!!! If zero stars was a rating. I’d give it zero.","userName":"PhantomGir","title":"This ain’t it chief","rating":1}},{"id":"6174894265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:34:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was on the app and I was enjoying myself because I am such a Trump supporter but then I got scared because it started glitching and show me this orange man and I got very scared is very disturbing and I honestly think I am going to need therapy because of it it caused a decline in my mental stability so I deleted the app but then I continued to get notifications from it which was very annoying and disruptive to my day filled with many important activities the app is completely terrible to use you can never find what you want and do what you want it is the most disgusting app I’ve ever downloaded I would never recommend it needs to be taken off of all devices and deleted for good no one should have to go through what I and many others have went through AOC 2020 ✨🥰😽❤️🥺😍👅🤑🇺🇸","userName":"nshckandicj","title":"Absolutely horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6174583848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:03:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Honestly, I’m shocked at the sub-par, unbelievably horrific design of this app. After downloading and opening the app, I was met with the image of a racist Cheeto, dishonoring our flag. I was mortified. I actually went BLIND from using this app. Not to mention the fact that it glitches constantly, and there are never ending inconsistencies between his policies on the app, and his actions in real life! Like, come on, Trump 2020 app! Obviously the President is against free speech, or he wouldn’t attempt to ban apps! And of course the president is against human rights, or he wouldn’t attempt to revoke women’s reproductive rights. 0 stars, disgusting. Fake news. I say we build a wall around this app, and I want the trump administration to pay for it. Please remove this app from the App Store so I don’t have to be reminded of the orange Cheeto of a president that haunts my nightmares.","userName":"Dyxyxfjxhx","title":"Racist Cheeto Man","rating":1}},{"id":"6174579856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"so first i downaloaded this app to catch up since elections are coming up, then out of no where my cat starts to levatate, and i promise you i’m not joking.

I was laying in bed next to my Grandmother and she got a glimpse of this app and went into cardiac arrest. Luckily, I know cpr. We get to the hospital, and she was out for a few hours. The doctors did a few tests on her and told me the cause of her heart attack was due to visual exposure of an orange, racist, joke of a “being”. The doctors laughed at me when I told them that i believed the cause of her heart attack was because of this app. We transferred hospitals and ran more in depth tests on her. The doctors put her in a soundproof room.... like the ones in mental hospitals, ya know? They opened up this app in front of dear old grand-mama... she SHRIEKED. So loud that the room was no longer soundproof. Shattered every window of the hospital. Made patients go deaf. They said this\napp was extremely dangerous to my dear old mee maw.","userName":"melfromtwit","title":"DANGEROUS, HORRIBLE APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6174252029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:21:08Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i’d like to start off by sharing the first few seconds of my experience after opening this app. after i downloaded this app i was excited to click on it to witness the sheer extent of Mr. Bunker Boy’s foolishness. and sure enough when you open the app you are greeted by a picture of the Cheeto himself; a picture so terrifying that my sister, who had the misfortune of her eyes landing on the picture in question, has gone blind. fortunately for me, i was waring my glasses at the time of the crime, so my eyes didn’t melt off from the horrifying picture. \nanyways this app is horrible🤢✨ i would never in a million years use this. furthermore, the fact that the first thing you have to see is the face of a disgrace to all decent human life on this earth is truly disturbing✨💅\npls take this off the app store.","userName":"Nerdy chick 34","title":"absolutely not 🛑🤚🏾","rating":1}},{"id":"6174072175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:15:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app and immediately my phone started to get hot. When I clicked on the app I was met with an ugly looking demon that sort of resembled a Cheeto, it was orange and fat with lots of wrinkles. I started to scroll despite being traumatized by the horrifying image, then a chanting started to come from my phone speaker, it was saying “Make America White Again” I was disgusted by this but ignored it. My fingers started to turn into an ugly Cheeto dust color and the more I tapped on the screen while the app was open the more the color would spread. I immediately got off the app but the when I tried to delete it my phone started shaking and turning into an orange color, the chanting that I heard before came back and it was saying the same thing. TERRIBLE APP!!! Must be taken down immediately because it’s dangerous.","userName":"Yoongi_x on amino;)","title":"TERRIBLE😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6174049803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I’m so sad to say but this app is trouble, as soon as I opened it I saw this weird Cheeto guy and I was super freaked out. I clicked out of the app and went on my daily run and then his guy came up to me and told me to vote for Cheeto man or else he would lick earlobes. I told him that I wasn’t sure who to vote for, then he pushed me down and stole my left shoe and my right sock!!! That’s not all, he grabbed my bag and put a toothbrush in it and gave it back to me! So weird! Then I got home and my family was dancing around in a circle with a Cheeto man poster is the middle( it looked like they were doing some type of ritual) and then my phone started playing music out of nowhere. I knew it had to be this app. My family is still dancing around in a circle it’s been 6 days!!!
