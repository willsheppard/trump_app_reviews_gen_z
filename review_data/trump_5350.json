Beware every this app is dangerous.","isEdited":false,"title":"NASTY 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6175571193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:35:46Z","userName":"caroline2174","review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP. i wish i could rate this a -1000 but i can’t ugh.  it finally finished downloading after 69 days and i was VERY disappointed to say the least. after i opened the app THE NATIONAL ANTHEM started blasting from all the speakers in my house.

I got the app because I love orange things so this definitely drew my attention. when the app finally downloaded it was pretty much fine everything was working until I went to my text messages and saw a message from the one and only bunker boy himself. the text read “ get off of my app you no neck lizard”. As you can tell by my tone I was very  distraught. anyways I just brushed passed it until today. this app hacked all of my social media’s and started posting “trump 2020” all over my feed. this app made me very unsettled.

They seriously need to update it. Or better yet, remove it off the app store, it would be for the best. I used to be a Trump supporter, but after seeing how he's handling the pandemic (childishly!) and the reinvigorated civil rights movement (poorly!), it's a wonder how I ever saw that poor excuse of a man to be fit for anything other than a washed up business man. Not to mention the numerous allegations brought up against him. Shameful! All he does is blame the Democratic party while virtue signaling with weak and insubstative policies.","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed"}},{"id":"6175262114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:36:17Z","userName":"hiiii 🙂🙃","review":"This app is an ABOMINATION too society❌🙅\u200D♂️!!!!
