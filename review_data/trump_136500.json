The app kept crashing over and over again and couldn’t even use it properly. Anyway the stuff on it was absolute garbage. It seems like the app is based around an ignorant self centered selfish child who we could do without. I uninstalled it immediately because it was basically trash on my phone. Would not recommend for anyone who has common sense."}},{"id":"6180209980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T09:09:39Z","title":"🤮🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"⌛️⏳🔌","review":"Cause"}},{"id":"6180209268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T09:09:23Z","title":"IVE BEEN CURSED!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"avocado🥑soup✨is😱superior","review":"SO I GOT THIS APP AND GUESS WHAT???
