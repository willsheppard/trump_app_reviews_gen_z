Trump VIOLATES that!! He has destroyed my trust. I suggest all old people get off this app, too. Many are spreading LIBERAL propaganda! Just last week, I saw something promoting a woman's right to choose... Disgusting. Please do not download this wretched app.. God bless 🙏🏻.\nEdit - This app is SECRETLY being run by LIBERALS! They have HACKED IT! \nPlease.. Don't ever download. I'm warning you, I have read TOO many articles promoting the liberal left media."}},{"id":"6177492940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I hoped for better","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:05:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"E-Money W.","review":"Considering it was an app made for the president, I had really high hopes for the quality. Unfortunately, it kept crashing and forcing me out, wouldn’t accept my email in the beginning, and just had a really bad and distracting design. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone. It was just really crappy and needed a bunch of bugs fixed. Definitely a one star review for me. I wouldn’t recommend this crap to anyone unfortunately."}},{"id":"6177479544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"«BÜ¥€u§»","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:01:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dont hold it against me😔","review":"I downloaded this app expecting to be wowed by MY President, Daveed Diggs, and instead a giant Cheeto popped up on the screen. He told me he wasn’t gonna show me the facts and the evidence because he is 74 years old but that there were BULLIES, GEN Z BULLIES. And then he started singing, ✨point the finger 🦋pull the trigger 🧚\u200D♀️ throw them off your trail😽 you’ll get yours £\\/€ńłûæl|ÿ👺 He sang in such a high pitch that all the glass in my house shattered and one piece went straight into my sisters head and now she’s dead!

There was a very scary verse that the app kept chanting? It made my phone crash and my phone kept freezing. Then I would finally get my phone unfrozen and would go back onto the app and then my phone crashed again and I could get on my phone for a solid 3 minutes. OVERALL the app is no good I do not recommend getting, its wastes your time and the person is scary.

I wanted to sign up, but when I went to join, the app required me to allow automated calls and texts from Donald trump... I refused and deleted the app right away. My reason for downloading the app was to get updated information on Donald trump and his election WITHOUT receiving text messages from him since I do not like him. You can’t even sign into this app without having issues."}},{"id":"6177352886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Super sad I couldn’t make America Great again 😿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:23:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"gasmine776","review":"Hello, I recently downloaded this app just to find out how trash it is. Come on Donald, your rich, use some money. Anyways let me explain, as a Donald trump supporter I was super excited to download this app and make America great again. Little do you know, this app does not make American great again. WHAT?!? I know right. I thought the same thing. It is so poorly designed that it makes Trump look bad. But don’t worry my sweetie pie Trump I’m all for you 🧡"}},{"id":"6177342778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨horrible✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"!!!!(!/&!","review":"I got this app with a lot of hope that it would give me info about what our 🍊president🍊 was promising for our country. I was horribly disappointed after the many days it took for the app to download, but that was just the start of it. Soon after I started getting these odd calls from unknown numbers that were basically threatening me to vote for Trump or I would lose many of my basic human rights. ✨Don’t get this app✨"}},{"id":"6177304032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"trash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:09:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"1246:,?&85;!&@99","review":"this app is absolutely terrible. ya the good one i to my new favorite park in my life and my favorite song in my head to the song i to my life and i to be epic i to be one day it would make my best year ever so much for me and to the one i and the stream ioioo was a good one lol what do ya mean lol bruh is a bad app i to all my new favorite song is to the stream of the stream and the opportunity for a real one year soon to get a good work out app is the good work and the good app i to the new favorite app i to the new year new is to my new post and new app is a great way of thinking and i to the stream has a good one on my fyp app lol i to be a real good app to be able and play with my friends on the stream of my new app i to the stream is the best waste of time ever and i the tccs eedc tug lol"}},{"id":"6177234253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hard to use.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:49:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"nahhhhh✨🤢","review":"Not only did the app take forever to download. It also was very hard to manage. Wouldn’t recommend. Very bad. Bad bad bad. Bad little app. Should be put down for the problems it’s caused. I just wanted better access to my president and his plans. But this stupid app did non of that. Just show me a bunch of propaganda and racist agendas. Whoever made this I hope your collage is proud (if you went). Cause this is the worst app I have used in my entire life."}}]}
