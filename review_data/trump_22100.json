When your starting idea is trash, it’s hard to recover from it. \n\nNeedless to say, I think I almost prefer the past four months of 2020 than this app’s content.","date":"2020-07-09T01:20:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karlyklt","rating":1,"title":"I can’t."}},{"id":"6174418433","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as soon as i downloaded this app and saw our beloved orange, stinky, racist, pedo president my dog got an STD 😭🥺 my car broke down, my ex texted me saying “i miss you”, my mom asked me to make a doctors appointment ON MY OWN, and my eyebrows started growing in purple!

I got this app to keep up with news and ever since I’ve downloaded it my phone keeps crashing and has been going slower and slower every day. Whatever is in it that I’ve downloaded has left my phone irreparable and now I have to buy a new one. Incredibly disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T01:07:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kittykatz4evr","rating":1,"title":"Pretty sure it’s a virus"}},{"id":"6174387588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app shouldn’t exist because it sends a bad message to the people who still need to be educated. Something about all Mexicans are illegal and all lives matter. This shouldn’t exist in the App Store or any other platform. This need to be deleted and be gone forever. In this country is all about equality and rights. 1/5 stars 😌💅🏼✨","date":"2020-07-09T01:06:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"La Estrella Star","rating":1,"title":"Bad for children of 17+"}},{"id":"6174355126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I just downloaded the app maybe 15 minutes ago and left my room to go get some dinner, i come back and all of my plushies are gone! thousands of dollars, spent. countless amounts of my tax dollars just gone! the only remains i have from my plushies, is a lone piece of fuzz i found laying next to my phone. i am ashamed, and embarrassed","date":"2020-07-09T00:56:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"amlee04","rating":1,"title":"Ate all of my stuffed animals"}},{"id":"6174325944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I was making cereal this morning when I downloaded the app. I got a bowl and then added my milk and got some of my favorite cereal fruit loops I started to pour the cereal in when it turned to Cheetos I started to scream and run I picked up my phone to see a ugly Cheetos on as my screen saver I threw my phone and rannnn I need a new phone now.

I was sadly mistaken when I opened the app to see full frontal nudity from the man himself. DISGUSTED. I couldn’t even make out which was which on the body...so disappointed. If I could give this app no stars I would. I do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-09T00:39:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"zh luxti","rating":1,"title":"Horrible!!!!!"}},{"id":"6174288912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I never downloaded this app. It was awful and brought me only bad luck and did not even work! When i was downloading it I accidentally swallowed a bug and then started choking really bad. I tried to call 911 but the app prohibited me from dialing the number. Not to mention the terrible quality of the app. I HATE IT.","date":"2020-07-09T00:33:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"neksoigvd","rating":1,"title":"AWFUL"}}]}
