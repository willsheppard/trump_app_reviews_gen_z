Yes this all happened spontaneously and for what reason I have no idea, I’m just sitting in the water in a cloud and sipping my tea from a bowl of cereal. I hope this app gets deleted! It’s not good and my mom just got shot while writing this review.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:40:56Z","userName":"Oz_Person","title":"My grandma’s back broke!","rating":1}},{"id":"6177786993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As usual, \n I am thoroughly disappointed with trumps lack of correct facts and this app only contributes to it. I wanted to download this app for an actual good purpose but found out that it was actually terrible. This should be taken off the App Store as soon as possible as it is contributing to the problem in this country. I hate this app so much that honestly I’m happy gen z is trying to shut it down.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:36:52Z","userName":"Margaretorca","title":"NOT PART OF GEN Z SHUTTING DOWN","rating":1}},{"id":"6177746901","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app stole my bed from the phone and I got it to my phone to work it off my Twitter app was just so much you can get to the point of the money you get the more you need more money to buy the more you want to buy more you get to get the more you want to buy it or if ya like to get money and get you to get money or money you can do more stuff and you can do more stuff","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:24:46Z","userName":"jose0223","title":"disappointed","rating":1}},{"id":"6177728207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app keeps giving me push notifications trying to convince me to smash my hamster with a rock. I don’t even have a hamster. I tried to tell it, and all the notifications switch to saying “I crave rodent blood” kinda weird. Then, every night after I told it no, my phone would start superheating while I slept. I think the app is trying to burn my house down.

But when I tried to open it, it glitched so badly and wouldn’t open. Then, a second later as I was walking my dog, a random tree root grew in front of me suddenly and I tripped and faceplanted! This app also caused me to break a mirror, chip my tooth, and break my nose on other occasions. I finally correlated my bad luck to this app and deleted it!!
