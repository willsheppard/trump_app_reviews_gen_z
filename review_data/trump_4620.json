This later got him attacked and he has been paralyzed ever since. I heard this happened to my cousin as well. People this app is not safe it can get u into so much danger!! Or worse! Dead 💀. We need to protect our world, our family, and  friends from this app. And this is just having it for 5 seconds! Who knows what will happen if you have it longer?! Minutes! Hours!!?? DAYS!?! Please consider my warning and do not put yourself and your loved ones into great danger!!","title":"Not safe  ❗️DANGER❗️","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur gardian","date":"2020-07-09T00:04:05Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174146515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My ✌ name’s 💅 America 🇺🇸 My 🖐 hobbies 🙌 are 👏 guns ⭐ blowing stuff up 😌 and 👏 baseball ⚾\nAnyways, I opened up the app to see my Lord and savior Daddy Trump. but when I opened the app, I was FLASHED with an image of some big-thighed Korean man named Kim Namjoon?!? He was singing some weird song that went like, \"take it off now girllll\" with a \"Kim 2020\" sign over him! 😡😡 only cheeto man is worthy of president! Not some increadibly thicc handsome hunk of a man Namjoon!!! Disgrace!! Less than one star! Another reason, some brown haired brown eyes HUNK was on the opening screen WITHOUT A SHIRT ON on a horse screaming \"I'm the hero not Trump!\" I believe his name was Allen Jones. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN!!!! I have RABIES and DIABETES now! This definitely deserves a one star!","title":"Alfred F Jones","isEdited":false,"userName":"Terrym1","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:35Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174139110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok I don’t even know where to start. OK OK SO. I opened this app because I was super excited to see a cheeto. 😄👁👄👁but then something terrible happened. WHEN I OPENED UP THE APP THE CHEETO POPPED OUT OF MY PHONE. 😑 IT LITERALLY BROKE MY PHONE 👺😡🤬AND IT GAVE ME A PHONE ERASER. which is how I’m typing this right now. I was super traumatized when the Cheeto started default dancing. And it started playing fortnite. I was so scared. I think I had a heart attack 🤭💔I was immediately rushed to the hospital 🏥😵I was pronounced dead. It was so scary. And then the Cheeto came into my hospital room and started singing señorita 🥶😧 He also killed poor squidward who was suffering from a broken leg. 😢 I DONT RECOMMEND THIS APP 😒🤬😭","title":"Disgusting And Traumatizing 😨😥😰🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nelly Catano","date":"2020-07-08T23:39:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174080656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I wanted to see what the hype was about on this app so I downloaded while I was on the toilet( Don’t mind me lol) anyways I opened it up to see if it worked. At first it was glitching and I thought it maybe it was my phone because my phone is hella old🤬 so I didn’t think anything of it. I ended up closing the tab and clicking back on it but I was mentally unprepared to see a picture of a The Cheeto man!😱✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️👁👄👁Anyways this caused me to scream and fall off the toilet now I’m in the hospital with a concussion so if you’re wondering whether to get this app I advise you don’t unless you want an expensive hospital bill with your name on it!!! 🤮😤🤕","title":"🚽 💃","isEdited":false,"userName":"a ball of sunshine","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:34Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174018710","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have been using this app for a week now. I started feeling weird the other day so I went to the doctor urgently on the way there I thought I saw a purple chicken( which is weird there are only green chickens in my state) then when I got there the doctor gave me devastating news, I was diagnosed with a horrible disease. Brain cell loss, being on this app and hearing him talk made me dumb from loosing all those brain cells!! The doctor told me that I lost most brain cells and if I didn’t urgently get a brain cell transplant I could possibly stay stupid forever. This app literally made me loose brain cells therefore that’s a 1 from me luv 😘😘","title":"Worst app out there","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kadeni","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:16Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173971368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I must say, I was skeptical at first. When one goes to download the Cheeto King’s App themselves they don’t expect to see a Black Lives Matter Queen. I was delighted to see the 🧚🏿\u200D♀️👑 herself acknowledging Black Lives Matter. In an age of Bigots and Pedophiles for World Leaders it is reassuring to see a true HERo! 💁🏿\u200D♀️ Now sadly the warm welcome was the only thing this app has going for it. Upon further inspection it rerouted me to racist and homophobic information. It offered specific dates of hate group meetings and ways to donate to a fascist state. I was SHOOK to say the least. I hope Apple will choose to stand on the side of freedom, as opposed to enslavement. Y’all need Khaleesi up in this Mother! 🔥🦖","title":"We STAN a BLM Queen ✊🏿👑","isEdited":false,"userName":"Unto sdkmd","date":"2020-07-08T22:37:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173944814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what was going on ofc...but as I was opening the app.... my sisters boyfriends sidechics husbands fathers grandparents dogs hamsters carrots house address was leaked. I can’t believe they did this. now they killed both the hamster and carrots :( we went to the vet and unfortunately they didn’t survive. Also, this app had this strong scent of dead armadillo and I won’t accept it. I had on my face mask on so it didn’t affect me that much, but I showed this app to my great grand mother that was in a hospital bed, and the fumes got to her and unfortunately she had passed away from this horrific scent. thanks a lot for this terrifying experience:(","title":"this app is trash 🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"yourdrunkddad","date":"2020-07-08T22:27:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173941437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app and I got a little hungry, maybe for some Cheetos🙀 so I opened the app and boom a saw Donald’s trumps Cheeto!!!🤢 so I throw my phone at the wall which made a loud sound thinking I cracked the wall but no, Donald trump broke through my wall like the KOOLAID MAN!!🤬I tell him to leave but I’m a women so he doesn’t listen to what I have to say bc he’s sexist. So I run back to my phone to try and delete the app but all these red necks from Texas come through my door sprinting at me trying to take my phone so I RUNNNN. I soon lost them and deleted the app and everything went back to normal and in conclusion I will never eat Cheetos again and get this app!!💩","title":"I hate this app!!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"donald trumps cheeto","date":"2020-07-08T22:26:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173873887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To start off the app took forever to download... Then after finally downloading I couldn't open the app, because it kept glitching me out.. Could have just been my phone, but I saw other reviews with my same problem. I was really hoping to stay involved with the news. I ended up having to restart my phone and re-download  the app (took longer than last time 🙄) even after all that when I finally made my account the colors glitched and the president looked like Shrek who had ate to many carrots!  Please fix the problem and I will \"think\" about downloading your content again.","title":"Yikes","isEdited":false,"userName":"Joanie JN","date":"2020-07-08T22:01:25Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173809803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app it started to glitch and kicked me out several times. The app made my battery run down in record time, and caused problems to arise in other apps on my phone. I believe there is now a bug on my phone because of this app. I downloaded the app to learn more about our president, but I am now unable to do that because I can't get into the app for more than a few seconds before it kicks me out. In conclusion I feel this app is absolutely horrid and I won't be recommending it to anyone. Don't download this app if you don't want to buy a new phone because of bugs.","title":"Absolutely horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pika puff","date":"2020-07-08T21:36:52Z","rating":1}}]}
