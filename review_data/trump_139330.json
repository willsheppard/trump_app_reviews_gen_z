But it took 8 days to download and took up all my storage!! Once I got it downloaded it kept freezing and made my phone glitch😡 I took my phone to Apple and they said I have a virus but I don’t believe that bc I’ve stayed in quarantine so there’s no way I have a virus😷  the signup for the app is even worse than the virus I got! It wanted my phone number! It could at least buy me a soda first😤🙄 I just hope y’all learn from my mistake by not downloading this app, I’m surprised it’s considered #1 idk ab y’all but that sounds like #FAKENEWS"}},{"id":"6179622358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Alykattzz","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:32Z","review":"terrible app it fried my phone and gave it tons of viruses"}},{"id":"6179622238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gen z , love🏳️\u200D🌈✨😌✋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Yeah,no❤️","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:29Z","review":"Look idk what to say besides this....

NOT HELPFUL IN THE SLIGHTEST. If there were such things as apps in the 1800s that catered to the needs of white supremacists who felt that they were better than everyone else based on the color of their skin, this would be that app. Let’s do the math shall we- App for Donald Trump = App for White Supremacist therefore given the Transitive Property of Equality (ironic since Donald doesn’t understand such a word)... Donald Trump = White Supremacist. Thank you for coming to this math lesson."}},{"id":"6179622039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cactus_can","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Why does this app exist","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:25Z","review":"The app is so useless I guess the name matches the quality (trash) every time I open it I just get confronted with misogyny and racism I’m not sure how this is even allowed on the App Store it’s so vile"}},{"id":"6179622018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"appanobrim1738","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Glitches","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:24Z","review":"This app is terrible, I was simply trying to support America; however, after 5 mins of using this app my phone began to glitch. What I mean is that my phone would randomly turn off and even stay locked on the lock screen. Then yesterday I took a trip out of the country and found that my user info had been stolen: my address, vote stance, and what I’ve eaten for my last 3 meals has been sold to a foreign database. I saw them in a foreign grocery with my user info in their shopping cart bc we were in the same check out line. 0/10 please remove this app from the AppStore in order to protect users."}},{"id":"6179621841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mickey 😜😜😜","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Dear Americans.","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:20Z","review":"donald trump is human and he has made mistakes but he has also had time to fix them but he just keeps repeating his bad actions and for those of you who are so blinded by his words i am truly sorry, he has said disgusting things about people even his own daughter i was never a supporter of him and never will be there are people who will follow what their parents say and nor educate themselves on politics i can tell you that Gen Z will win  so you can either be on the right side of history or you can be on the wrong side."}},{"id":"6179621723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"renegade😓🧚\u200D♀️💋","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"it doesn’t work","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:18Z","review":"i got this app and it literally made my whole phone freeze like it takes up so much data and storage it’s so stupid it’s always sending me notifications and makes me phone so slow and glitchy i hate it i can’t believe it also my freezer started melting everything and my fridge started freezing everything and a potato game over my house and it started raining bc of this app 0/10 idek how this happened my 9273 year old grandma got this app when she was born and it’s still downloading till this day. don’t get this app."}},{"id":"6179621701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vote no for joe and trump","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:17Z","review":"Wouldn’t download, it took up so much data that I had to pay $1,000,000 then when it finally downloaded months later I realized I’m liberal and had no use for the app since it would be supporting a pedo who raped a 13 year old girl with evidence that he did and that he’s racist that’s not even half of it."}},{"id":"6179621633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ihatetrumpy","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-10T05:32:16Z","review":"Rapists don’t get apps."}}]}
