It was supposed to be a perfect app.  It is perfect.  Perfectly stupid.    It is very very terrible. People are saying it is a Democrat hoax and not a real app. Maybe it would be a good app if people stop using it.  I think the ratings will go up if people stop using it.","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:05Z","userName":"iloveprojects","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174770842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I want to talk to the manager","review":"To my complete and utter disappointment, this app was very glitchy.

I will be calling the manager.","date":"2020-07-09T02:58:25Z","userName":"Karen Jessica Smith","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174761037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Male Supervision","review":"One of the first apps I was given permission to download but it won‚Äôt let me use it without my husband‚Äôs supervision :/ I know women shouldn‚Äôt have this much freedom but i was excited to use it while my husband worked and when I finished my cleaning duties :(","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:28Z","userName":"Miss Ogyny","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174750207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App to Exist","review":"Completely ruined my life and caused irreparable change.

He claimed this app could solve all problems in the world. Boy was he wrong. Just like the rate of unemployment, funding for public schools, and human rights in this country, the app kept CRASHING!! SO SAD! I feel harassed, violated, and lied to. The same emotions that are associated with the man in charge of it!","date":"2020-07-09T02:46:41Z","userName":"HannahBanana112","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174727493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","review":"I was on the app just now thought it was going to be good but it didn‚Äôt work because they knew I was Mexican and restricted Mexicans from using.

Last night, one of the demons (I named him fluffy) tried to grab me by my toes and pull me off my bed and down to h*ll. Another demon tried to kill my pet pterodactyl named peaches.
