Not only did it give my 420 year old grandmother a heart attack, KILLING HER, but it also gave my dog explosive diarrhea! She completely crapped all over my grandmother’s ashes so now her urn is stinking up the entire house! So logically I threw it out the window cause I don’t want my house to smell how Donald Trump’s nudes look✨🌸🧚\u200D♀️✨!  And than the urn hit my neighbor on the head! He stopped breathing and got really cold so I put him in a fire to heat him up, as one does. Now I am on the run from the police for premeditated manslaughter! ACAB! Do not download this app!!!","userName":"Timothee Shablagoo","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179301035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not working","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:57Z","review":"This app took forever to download onto my potato of a phone like what the heck it makes me so frustrated","userName":"xc.jonathan","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179300976","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful App","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:56Z","review":"This should be banned- this is an awful app, for an awful candidate who doesn’t deserve to run.","userName":"nini fontini","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179300945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My iPad has never been slower","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:55Z","review":"WARNING!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! I bought my iPad to receive photos of my new granddaughter. My son takes sweet photos of her in her little MAGA hat and shares them With me via iMessage. HOWEVER!!!! Ever since I downloaded the Trump 2020 app, I can’t access anything. Everything on my iPad has slowed down. It uses so much digital storage space apparently that I’m unable to watch any videos of my sweet grand baby rolling over for the first time 💔 MY IPAD MAY AS WELL BE IN THE TRASH CAN!!!!!! Trump promised to make this country great, but my experience with his app demonstrates otherwise. 🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 but STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!!!!!!","userName":"nick & iPod","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179300799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Screw trump","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:52Z","review":"For the Tik tok","userName":"JUMMPINGPANDA","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6179300878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Leftists hate it so it must be great!!","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:53Z","review":"🖕🏻","userName":"JLP147","isEdited":false,"rating":5}},{"id":"6179300824","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-10T03:43:52Z","review":"hated it. i had high hopes for the app of donald trump, our only president resembling a fruit. however, i was disappointed. very slow. very complicated. and very racist. sorry bout it. \n😌❤️🤪🤑🥵🤡💞🥰","userName":"2006mea","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
