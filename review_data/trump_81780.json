It was old and wrinkly, and the sight was so horrific that I had to throw my phone across the room to refrain from throwing up. Anyway, I wanted to get this app to receive some completely non-biased news about the election, and I have to admit that the quality of this app was horrible. It was very slow, and it forced me to enter all of my personal information. Once I did, I started receiving so much spam through text, email, and phone calls. As soon as I unsubscribed, I started getting death threats through the mail saying that if I don’t subscribe again, I’ll become yet another victim of police brutality that will not receive justice. Lucky, I knew that my white privilege would protect me from that. I strongly recommend this app for my fellow white supremacists that wish to continue to deny systematic racism. It’s completely your fault if a cop murders you. Continuing with my review, this app forced me to join a cult. They kept on sending me reminders to comment “🇺🇸Trump 2020🇺🇸” on every single comment section of every post that I see. The reminders were very annoying, so I eventually turned them off. But I did follow through with their requests. In fact, I even added something a little extra to the chant. It went a little something like “💅✨🧚\u200D♂️Trump 2020✨🧚\u200D♂️🍊 But make it an expiration date✨🧚\u200D♂️💖.” It’s a beautiful quote and everyone seemed to enjoy my comments. Thank you for listening to my ted talk.","title":"This app made me break my phone","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Read meeeee..."}},{"id":"6147209711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T06:41:40Z","review":"Heart ❤️ has been broketh 💔 so many times 🕰 I do not know 🤷🏽\u200D♀️ what to believe~💭, Mother 👩🏾\u200D🦱 said ‘tis my fault 👎🏽, ‘tis my fault 👎🏽, I wear 🧥 my heart ❤️ on my sleeve~👕","title":"Heart ‘Tis On Ice 💔","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Not Rod Wave"}},{"id":"6146455579","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-02T02:01:47Z","review":"It scared my dog he screamed and cried like crazy I thought the app was ✨~cool~✨ but no it is a danger","title":"He wants my number","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"mx. nicknamewizard"}},{"id":"6145910807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-01T22:22:07Z","review":"This app is just trash, Kinda like who runs it.
