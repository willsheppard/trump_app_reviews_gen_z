All it does is change all of my pictures to images of trump and his tiny croissant. Im just trying to post images of me and my lesbian chines girlfriend and it almost deleted all of my photos.

Just opening the app caused myself and my family to violently convulse \n\nAs well as the weird ambient noise that can be heard the entire time you’re on the app. Absolutely terrifying, sounds like breathing. \n\nAnd then to top everything off I find out it’s actively accessing my camera and viewing me without my permission. Like if you wanted to see me that bad you’re gonna have to give up some coin. \n\nBut seriously do not ever get this app. It causes virus’ and generational trauma","date":"2020-06-29T10:48:01Z","userName":"hooe you slip"}}]}
