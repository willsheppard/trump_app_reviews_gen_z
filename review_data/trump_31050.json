I would rather pluck out all of my public hairs, one by one, than use this app ever again.","title":"TERRIBLE!!!"}},{"id":"6174837143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:18:12Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"392629192773919193738292","review":"when i opened the app it asked me to list my gender. when i wrote that i was a woman, i immediately got a call from trump himself. he called me a wh0re and said that i had no rights, then hung up. after that, my phone shut down and i was unable to turn it back on. it also took all the money from my bank account so i guess i’ll just starve😔🤟. i’m currently typing this from my fridge. don’t download this app, and especially don’t vote for this man😹","title":"so terrible❤️"}},{"id":"6174823616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:14:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"this is NOT it chief","review":"If only I could give this app a 0 star I would but a one star would do I guess.
