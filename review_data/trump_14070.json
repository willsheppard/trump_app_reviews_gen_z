It took SIX HOURS to download, and when I open it, it just calls me a clown 🤡. I can’t believe how rude this app is! It’s not worth your time, do not download it!!!

After a week of having it on my phone, my phone became very slow and laggy. On top of that, it shuts down every hour, forcing me to restart it up to 12 times a day. This is an hUGE problem. I blame it on fake news media and those gosh darn generation z kids. Also women of course they are the worst.","date":"2020-07-09T03:43:40Z","title":"Enraged"}},{"id":"6174892802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"WorldIsAMess","isEdited":false,"review":"This app makes terrible sandwiches!! I told my cow that I wanted a sandwich but he said he wouldn’t allow himself to make sandwiches for me anymore so I went to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza to complain but when I got there the night guard wasn’t even there, only a Freddy suit!( awful work support!) And if my day wasn’t already bad my cow went back home to shoot a laser from the moon. And now I’m the only human being left, all thanks to this app!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:34:29Z","title":"WORSE APP EVER"}},{"id":"6174873574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Easton Duffy","isEdited":false,"review":"This app makes me wanna step in a puddle with socks on. Makes me wanna listen to lil pump. I’d rather jump off a twenty foot building to belly flop on legos. Makes me wanna eat eggs with the shell on. As soon as I opened the app I lost half of my braincells, my whole house fell down, and my thumbs dislocated. It immediately made me like Arby’s sandwiches. After I downloaded it I  permanently now were no clothes in Antarctica like temp while in a freezer drinking cold milk and eat raw shrimp. Do not buy","date":"2020-07-09T03:28:56Z","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6174857695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"basketweaver1897","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app and it ruined my life. I  had sudden dizzy spells, my head was always hurting and I have hot flashes. I get nightmares where a horse curb stomps a meerkat. After I downloaded this app my dodo bird died, as I was harboring the last one alive. Her name was Chichi and she’s been watching over my family for years now😔😔. My piranha ate my favorite wicker basket and my black mamba went into epileptic shock. Do not download this app!! It’s dangerous!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:24:17Z","title":"I hate this app with a passion"}},{"id":"6174854186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"10cansofbouncedatass","isEdited":false,"review":"I couldn’t wait to download this app! I heard amazing things about it from all of the country folk at my racist school!🥰 as soon as I opened up the app, a wrinkly, ugly, old, orange ogre popped up on my screen. I already have PTSD from past traumas and now I can’t sleep at night! It’s been 4 nights in a row where this creature has popped up in my nightmares. Never again.
