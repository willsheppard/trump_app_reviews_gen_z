All I crave and eat is Cheetos and oranges. And people keep telling me to make America great again. They keep repeating “Trump 2020” and I think that’s a chant to summon some sort of negative entity. Definitely DO NOT recommend this app to anyone who I like. This literally has to be cult related. I can’t think of any other reason for it. Anyway this is horrible and I swear it’s coming after me. I’m deleting ASAP!!!","userName":"savvyFelicia","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:25:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I think it’s haunting me."}},{"id":"6179244963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"No 🧚💖💅🌸🌈🧚","userName":"🧚💖🌸🌈","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:24:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Thanks!
