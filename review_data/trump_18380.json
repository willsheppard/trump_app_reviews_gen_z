Lots of people are saying it. Haven't you heard? It’s a plot and a hoax by the evil, do nothing Democrat’s. It’s loaded with every single black person trump has ever met, even the shoplifter. His sons wives and gf are on too. What a rack on those, am I right? I think Kimberly looks like a transvestite. Once, I ate a price of chocolate cake that was so delicious. Do chickens have lips?

It makes me feel like I don’t have a sense of security. Now, I’m not too sure how to stop getting messages😳. I also don’t like how we had to put in a lot of information. Everything seems sketch.

It took 37 millenia to download and then when it finally did, it didn’t open for another 10 weeks.

And I would know. I download a lot of apps. But this one is terrible. Absolutely terrible. You know who knows good apps? Me. And this isn’t it. Took forever to download.

Then as downloaded it kept glitching when I opened it and it was very racist and homophobic which I did not like at all.
