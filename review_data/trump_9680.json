If you support him for this election you’re in my prays and lord help us.. :))"}},{"id":"6177138156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No, just no","rating":1,"userName":"sidadoodle","date":"2020-07-09T15:22:29Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app completely wiped out my phone. My contacts, messages, and photos were all gone. My wallpaper changed to a picture of this annoying orange we call our president. I feel as if trump is staring through my camera. At least my screen time has gone down sense the fat man has taken over my phone. I would definitely prefer that he made a wall between me and this app. Who made this Oompa Loompa a app. We gave him Twitter💕"}},{"id":"6177087159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I am so frustrated with this app!","rating":1,"userName":"AL77244","date":"2020-07-09T15:08:24Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I actually downloaded the app and the moment I tried to open it, it kept crashing over and over. I had to re-download THREE TIMES just to be able to use the app. Then the app design was not user friendly by any means and I couldn’t figure out how to find what I was looking for! I just wanted to get information on Trumps plans for 2020 so that I can stay informed. Deleted and never downloading again!"}},{"id":"6177036865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash app","rating":1,"userName":"mayyyyyyuuy","date":"2020-07-09T14:54:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so I could be informed about the president’s campaign and can I just say I have NEVER been more disappointed with an app before in my life. This thing was slow, glitchy, and just all over the place. The content on it was lower than subpar and honestly just embarrassing. I recommend Apple delete this garbage app since it’s my understanding that  MANY others have had issues similar to mine or even worse."}},{"id":"6176910663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible","rating":1,"userName":"juicyavacsdo","date":"2020-07-09T14:20:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I tried opening the app and my phone crashed. it took multiple tries to get the app open and when it finally did i couldn't tap anything. Once it downloaded it took up a lot of space on my phone and i couldn’t take anymore pictures. The app overall isn’t good. It also wanted my phone number which i think is very rude bc i don’t want this app to know my information. Just don’t download this app."}},{"id":"6176898644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DANGEROUS😬👿✨","rating":1,"userName":"nia💛","date":"2020-07-09T14:17:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"when i downloaded this app it took 153 days for me to open. as soon as i opened it i saw a very spooky orange man posing as someone important. i looked into his deformed eyes and began to have thoughts of caging children, destroying families, and brutalizing poc. it was non stop i only wanted to care ab myself. it was terrifying, at one point i actually almost called the kkkops on a little brown kid at the park😔. idk what is coming over me but once i deleted the app it all went away. FOR YOUR SAFETY just PLEASE be careful! im begging u!"}},{"id":"6176888522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"CURSED ME","rating":1,"userName":"Cardinal712","date":"2020-07-09T14:15:06Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So I just wanted to get the app because why not, like sure.  BUT, I downloaded it while I was on the toilet, and when I finished pooping, I tried to stand up but I TRIPPED and hit my forehead on the thing that holds towels!!  I thought, ugh, whatever, but a few seconds later, I dropped my phone in the sink.  Again, possibly a mistake on my part, but I went on the app to check it out and then went to read one of my fanfictions on ao3, but IT SHUT CHROME DOWN.  I LOST MY FANFICTION AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT."}},{"id":"6176857698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m really disappointed ☹️","rating":1,"userName":"i love trump❤️😌","date":"2020-07-09T14:07:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is beyond terrible!!😩 i downloaded it because i loarv my little trumpy wumpy poo❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ but it made my whole phone crash! 😭😭😭😭😭 i gotta keep up woth my FAVORTITE presidents wonderful amazing plans for our wonder beyond amazing america 💍💩🌭 but it kicked me out everytime i tried to get in 🙀😩💩 it also made my phone super glitchy 🥘💍😡 also i was BEYOND disappointed that my favorite trump, barron 🙉💖😛 wasn’t on this app at all!!!! 😡😡😡😡 \n\nstay orange 🍊🧡📙⛺️🦐🦁🥻🩳\n-#1 trump supporter😩😝❤️"}},{"id":"6176300174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE APP","rating":1,"userName":"emi 😝😍😹","date":"2020-07-09T11:35:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as i opened the app my phone glitched and now every time i open an app it glitches to THIS TRUMP APP. There is no point to this app. And i don’t want to see his face on my phone. I showed my little sister the app and she started to cry! She has an ugly phobia and it is ALWAYS spot on and she has never found an app ugly before... until THIS ONE. This app is a DISGRACE to apple and it will only drag business DOWN! TRUMP IS RACIST, SEXIST, AND A HORRIBLE EXAMPLE for every single person in America. This app being here is PROMOTING THAT."}},{"id":"6176583292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Great app no issues","rating":5,"userName":"jd1ww","date":"2020-07-09T12:54:21Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This downloaded in seconds and works great, no glitches no issues.
