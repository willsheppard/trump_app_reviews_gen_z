This app lets statues run about the country wearing whatever they want all nilly silly. Where is the quality control? I miss the old days when everyone lived in Mesopotamia and statues didn’t exist or at least people wouldn’t talk about them. Ever HEARD of seen not heard. It seems there aren’t any standards anymore. Anywhoo.
