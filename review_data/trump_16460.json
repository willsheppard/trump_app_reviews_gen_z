Every time I open the app it crashes and I get random pop ups on my home screen that tells me things like \"You have 30 seconds before the virus steals your info!\" And the ONLY way to get rid of it is to completely hard reset your phone.

I thought it would be more from him and less media coverage to call “fake news” so it would be a better image of him. I was wrong. Even on his own app he is a narcissist and not a good fit for the 2020 election. I don’t understand why people keep this app on their phone. Rather...unfortunate."}},{"id":"6176965512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:35:20Z","title":"Awful - glitchy","userName":"NIC_750","review":"As an American, I wanted to make an informed decision on who to vote for in November. I gotta say, this app didn’t help at all! Once I downloaded it, it asked me to allow notifications. I accepted. But then the app kept crashing and closing on me. But it would spam me with notifications! How can I make an informed decision with an app that won’t open but fills my Notification Center with spam?!"}},{"id":"6176930354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:00Z","title":"This app made my dog viscously vomit everywhere","userName":"yaybaby1963","review":"I came across this app and was like hm why not and as soon as I hit “Get” my dog just came in my room, stared me in the eyes, and vomit EVERYWHERE. I mean there was vomit in the floorboards, under the bed, in my pillow. I guess he did not like the fact that I had downloaded this app, so I guess if you don’t want to have your dog puke up their large intestine, stay away from this app😇"}}]}
