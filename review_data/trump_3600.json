WHAT? i didn’t even know that was possible. i am even currently writing this from my friends phone because mine DOES NOT WORK. absolutely disgusting. my next topic is the fact that there’s an age restriction. like, i shouldn’t have to tell you my age to support this AMAZING president. in fact, i might vote for biden. just because i had to say how old i was. like i feel that breaks a barrier that i’m not ready to break. i honestly could go on, but i’ll save you the time. anyway, have a horrible day!","title":"waste of space.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:49:14Z","userName":"lovetrump2020lovetrump2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173611058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Since downloading the app and adding my info, it’s been riddling my text and emails with ad copies.  The wording is off putting, very fear based biased wording like ‘Sleepy Joe Biden’ and ‘do you believe the radical left unfairly demonizing local law enforcement?’\n\nIt sounds as if he is speaking to a 4 year old trying to get them to agree with him. I get 5 emails a day and it’s all just too much. The wording needs to be more neutral, rather than extreme right, so factual information is being communicated. But doesn’t seem to be any actual supported facts on here. Would not rely on this app for solid information.  And do not trust someone who talks to his supporters in this way. It’s condescending and belittling.","title":"The wording is offputting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:24:18Z","userName":"Lopez88a","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173603005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support my president!! But I couldn’t because the app took 5 hours to load! And my internet works just fine here! As soon as the app downloaded the first thing that popped up was the presidents tanning cream! I love my president but I most certainly don’t not want tanning cream!! and every time I clicked on an article about our dear president, an orange popped up and kicked me out! even turned my keyboard into oranges for a day!! It was simply outrages!!! This app is awful in all shapes and form! I want to speak to the ceo of this app ASAP! It’s junk and awful and I do not recommend it to anyone! Anyways sorry daddy trump 😍😍 This review just HAD to be done for this non-working app 🥺🥺✨","title":"daddy trumps app don’t work 🥺","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:21:24Z","userName":"✨TRUMPY-KUN✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173585914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app the other day because i am a big Trump supporter and wanted to support our amazing president. When i opened the app, though, it immediately crashed and restarted my phone. When my phone turned back on, all of my contacts were hacked, my personal information including my credit cards was stolen, and the phone was practically unusable. After a while my phone finally bricked and wouldn’t turn back on. It baffles me that an app on the app store would do such a thing. and it’s even worse that it’s PRESIDENT TRUMP’S app. Because of this, i will NOT be voting for trump in the upcoming election. He had to have planned this. DO NOT download this app. DO. NOT.","title":"This app gave my phone a virus","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:15:25Z","userName":"colesucksalotahhhh","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173577977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and it was all going fine but once it fully downloaded a white male with a southern accent broke into my house and stabbed my dad eight times repeatedly and then shot my mom in the gut a couple times and then strangled my brother until he died. and we’re a non white, poc family so I’m pretty sure this was a hate crime. I managed to sneak out my window but then a mob of white women with bleached bobs surrounded my house and screamed at me and started hitting me with signs that read “I want a haircut!” then a truck driven by a white teenage boy wearing a maga hat and vineyard vines with some loafers ran over my two dogs multiple times. this app has brought me unmeasurable trauma. so, don’t download it because it’s terrible.❤️","title":"no","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:38Z","userName":"6.21.3.11.1.2","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173541888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i suggest that this app is taken off all app stores my friend told me to download it and give it a great review but i can not allow that. it made me scream and almost cry. i was so scared because there was a big man that hurt my eyes. it also caused many roaches in my household and i am terrified this app is not ok. my mom had to take me to the ER to make sure i was ok and did not hurt my vision. and when i looked into the app the app told me i was fat and ugly. it made my confidence go down 😔. i am very self conscious 😔🥺i hate this app. get it off the app store please 🥺 i also was scared because i saw a 🤡 at first sight opening it. i think that apple needs to take it down immediately. thank you for your time.

This trash is a racist, rapist homophobic,etc(I can go all day long) and has the audacity to say my people are rapists and drug dealer. On top of it all you say we steal your jobs. First of all we make jobs and I’m sorry you don’t have any creativity to do it your self. Mexicans so the jobs your people don’t want to do. This country is the way it is because of all the mix of culture yet you think we are here to destroy it. If all of the colored  and hard working people left this country would be nothing. In case you forgot your wife is an immigrant herself so don’t be dissing any other immigrants.","title":"This app is wack","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:34:54Z","userName":"y4milet2006","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173446964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app to support my daddy trump 😻but when it was done downloading i heard my dogs barking, when i went to go look for them i found them in a sacrifice ceremony! and u will not believe who was standing right in front of them with a meat clover 🌚it was my fhat orange skinned daddy trump 😞 i told him to stop but he said “NO U MUST BUMP MY RUMP” i said “i most certainly will not bump ur rump” then he chopped my dogs heads off and ate them. when he was done he bit my arm off and fed it to his 3rd wife 🙈 i quickly deleted the app from my phone and my arm grew back then all of a sudden i heard a knock on my door, i opened the door and saw king barron 😋 i started to bow down to him and he said don’t vote for trump and i said yes king","title":"😝👁👄👁😼","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:50Z","userName":"👶👁👅👁👶","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173424827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is simply REVOLTING ✨💕🧚🏾 Despite all the controversy I made it my mission to support our beloved cookie cream Cheeto dust Parmesan president sir daddy trump💅🏽🥵🤰. I just wanted to fulfill my part and indeed help in the process of making America great 😍😍😍😍however Barron warned me that there would be downsides to this.😴🙄😔 As soon as I installed the app the sky began to rain blood and hail, earthquakes shook the earth, and my house was completely destroyed in the aftermath. 😫😫😫And just when things couldn’t get any worst my father sends me a video of our beloved president breaking into my grandmothers house and twerking naked on her kitchen table in front of all of my underaged  cousins.

It had the thinnest hair I’ve ever seen, it might as well been one of the zombies from the walking dead but fatter. Second, my grandmother was behind me when I opened the app and when she saw the image she went into shock and had stopped functioning, we took her to the hospital and we my whole family got corona virus while there because trump wasn’t wearing a mask so we didn’t. My whole family died because of the virus. Now I escaped America and I live in Zimbabwe in a cave hidden away from civilization.
