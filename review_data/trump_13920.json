Also keeps Trump’s supporters supporting out of fear over losing their power and privileges in White America. Content displays Fascist ideologies and could potentially become a threat to the entire world. Black Lives Matter. It’s time to be on the right side of history and not regress back to before the Civil Rights Era."}},{"id":"6173444844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why😤","userName":"little sis 10987","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:06Z","review":"This is a horrible app. They want my information to enter the app. And it is making my dog fart.

I have great WiFi and it took a few days to download. I even deleted a few apps to have enough storage for this. Opening the app was such a pain because my phone started bugging out. Later realized my phone had a virus and had to reset my entire phone. I still couldn’t remove it so I had to replace the phone. It cost me $150 to replace it. Soo much for a free app. -44 out of 5 stars. DO NOT GET THE APP!!!"}},{"id":"6173293312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"✨no name✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:35:22Z","review":"I wish I could give it 0 stars! The app took hours to download and when it finally came up and I made and account it said my email was invalid!!!! So I made a new email and FINALLY got in. But when I got in this god awful music started to play and it made my dog cry. I turned down my volume and started looking around the app. The app had racist and homophobic slander all over it!! I’m very disturbed the USA president would post such nasty things :("}}]}
