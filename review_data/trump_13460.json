Like wth why.  Also it kept crashing. When it work it kept showing me ads of why I shouldn’t vote for Trump. Kinda crazy but don’t tell him 🤡🤡🤡. Also I got terrified because I saw a clown face 🤡 but then I realized it was our president oops. My bad ✨. Ngl that face is my sleep paralysis demon 🤡🤡 I wouldn’t get this app if your afraid of clowns cuz your going to see a lot of them 🤡🤡. Over all the worst app I have ever downloaded.","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:59Z"}},{"id":"6173024768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"i am reading","review":"This app took forever to download and when it did finally download it was very glitchy!! And every time I tried to go on the app, after like five to ten minutes it would freeze my phone. It did this multiple times!! It would even kick me out of the app for no reason!! I was just trying to educate myself about American’s so called President, but I guess I will never know. Overall this app sucked.","date":"2020-07-08T17:08:51Z"}},{"id":"6173024462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"awful app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"asexual rat","review":"when i went to download this app it took 7 weeks! don’t even get me started on the loading screen. it took HOURS to load. then when it finally DID load, the music attracted a bunch of bugs and rodents! do you know how long it took to get rid of all the bugs?! i STILL have rats crawling up my walls. then when i tried to look for reasons to vote for trump it gave me no valid reasons. don’t download this app!!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:08:45Z"}},{"id":"6173010114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Fairey from Tigitty","review":"I didnt like this app in any way. I was scrolling through it and exploring it to see all the ways that President Trump should be re-elected, but instead of that, there was a bunch of fake propaganda about Biden as well. That is not acceptable. The app also required me to put in my phone number to access it. Why do we need to give information away to an app, which might use our information against us?

It took 2 months to download and whenever I open it my phone glitches so badly. Donald Trump appears on my screen singing “Barbie girl” and he’s the worst singer I’ve ever heard!!! Also whenever I open the app, rats start gathering towards my phone dancing. The worst part is that the rats have the same horrible haircut as Trump! Do not recommend to anybody. Not even rat lovers. Very disappointed to say the least.","date":"2020-07-08T16:57:07Z"}},{"id":"6172979917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I don’t know this man.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"YourFavoriteKaren","review":"I thought this app was created to get in touch with my favorite comedian and popular circus animal, Donald Trump, but instead it’s centered around some racist, sexist, demented, hideous scum of the earth of the same name. I am horrified and disappointed at this error. I understand that the two people get confused for one another often, especially online, but confusion by the app developers themselves? Shameful. Highly do not recommend this disappointing app.","date":"2020-07-08T16:55:08Z"}},{"id":"6172977269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"floravelas","review":"I downloaded this app after trying to see reason to vote for President Trump 2020. This app has made me had even more of a reason to dislike Trump. This app is terrible and constantly contradicts itself. This app doesn’t even serve a purpose to be in the App Store. I believe that politics should be separated from the social media/gaming industry. So this app does NOT belong on the App Store. If anyone wants information on President Orange they can look it up on google.","date":"2020-07-08T16:54:19Z"}}]}
