So guess what i happens i trip and accedently go down up the stairs, and wait for it as i got there i saw that i was at the bottom of the stairs so i walked back down to my cat and he barked at me (he’s bilingual) so after she decided to walk away towards me at a rapid rate of slow mo, then even after that, i downloaded this app and instally blew up my entire house and my phone so i got on my phone and wrote the review🙄","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173940818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrifying pictures!","userName":"save yourself!!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:25:53Z","review":"This app is absolutely disgusting. I have no words first I open the app to see a Cheeto, turkey looking man and that was probably the most horrifying thing. Who would make an app that has a pictures that would TRAUMATIZE any rational person! Huh?!? I’m upset and scared! I do not think that I will be able to sleep any more and I will have to go therapy for weeks! I’m sorry! I can’t have anything on my phone that would scare anyone in sight and likely break my phone!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173919003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gigantic Orange Racist Killed My Family??? (NOT CLICKBAIT)","userName":"aev205","date":"2020-07-08T22:17:54Z","review":"I opened this app and I was disgusted by what I saw. A big orange man was staring me in the face, almost taunting me. Within three minutes of entering the app, my phone completely glitches and a live video feed of my house pops up. There’s a sniper beam located directly on my forehead. It then shifts and took out my whole family in one shot, including our two hamsters, Bernie and Barack. Worst of all, their blood splatters on the wall spelled out “TRUMP 2020”. Anyways, wasn’t really a fan :/","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173829053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just no","userName":"Rãtęr","date":"2020-07-08T21:44:22Z","review":"The app is absolutely horrible as soon as I opened it I heard a white male screaming racial slurs at the top of his lungs, and I know for a fact it wasnt my neighbor. So I proceeded to delete the app but when I did it gave my phone a virus, the ones you get from the hub so I panicked. It gave me a line of instructions but the instructions were unclear so I am now being sacrificed as an offering to a god of some sort. So in short, the app is poorly designed and managed thank you for your time.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173759581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download","userName":"addie2847","date":"2020-07-08T21:18:03Z","review":"This app is very very very glitchy every time I try to open the app it kicks me out and it took like 1 hour  to download and My Wi-Fi is perfectly good and my cellular data is really good it’s not my Wi-Fi it’s the appif I can open it I can’t even open it for more than 10 minutes I don’t know why this is still on the App Store it’s basically just taking up space do not download it will just take up too much space on your phone.

Next it asked for so many personal things, please guys DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. I read another review and thought they exaggerated but there was a song that also attracted roaches into my home..THE FLYING ONES chilee when i tell you i jumped too high uh uhn i had to be rushed to the hospital you wouldn’t even believe it thanks for listening. #makeamericagreatagain🤡🍊","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173621807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The volume in this PRESIDENCY is astronomical😤🤩","userName":"megsphotography","date":"2020-07-08T20:28:10Z","review":"While I love oranges as much as the next person, I would like to say that they are quite illiterate, and shouldn’t be allowed to have Twitter. Oranges should also not be allowed to run for president in 2020 because well....look where we are now☹️. This app supports golfing, the color orange, and racism 🤭. It crashed when I tried to download it😢 and the vibe was completely off🥺✌🏼. Do not download or actively use because it may cause a rapid decline in brain cells😔.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173560095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"useless garbage.","userName":"fgf610","date":"2020-07-08T20:06:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I care about what the president has to say. His nuanced, coherent insight is what gives me hope for the future of this country. If it weren’t for him—a beacon of hope and reason—my family would certainly have gotten shot by rogue radical communist protestors that have started a reprehensible farmer’s market-inspired autonomous zone, forcing people to respect and love each other, only a few yards from my house. They make me sick. Gen Z will ruin this country. >:)","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173502208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","userName":"good/wonderful","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:47Z","review":"The app is so bad I don’t know what the older generation loved it for. It took forever to download and it glitches so bad. Every time id go on the app it would take me right out even when I refreshed my phone. I think the app as a whole should be deleted, gone, and not be put back up on the App Store ever again. Such an ugly app that made my phone wanna cry itself to sleep and never wake up again. This app is just disgusting to look at or even download. Nasty.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173501560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app EVER!!!!","userName":"Lilly_loves_to_laugh","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:35Z","review":"Works for iPhone. Haha what a joke. App took forever to download and when I did try to use it nothing worked. It play some dumb music that wouldn’t shut off even after I closed the app. I have to completely restart my phone for it to stop. I even tried deleting and reinstalling the app and it did the same thing AGAIN!!! Took forever to download, the dumb music played again, and I had to restart my phone AGAIN!!! Waste of your time.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
