You are a horrible president, and you’re sketchy af! Could you please stop worrying about Tiktok and worry about the children in cages who are getting sprayed with poison and coming up missing/ murdered... You care more about pets suffering than children you sick bastard. #trumpinacage2020 \nAlso if you care about everyone in your country you would care about BLM and about the LGBTQ+ community."}},{"id":"6176990649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"AWFUL AND SCARY!! 😭😭","userName":"Doodle Bunny 02","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:42:11Z","review":"I downloaded the app because I saw people saying Trump 2020 so I decided let’s see what the hype is about. Well, I opened the app, JUST TO SEE A DRIED UP PRUNE WITH CHEETO DUST IN IT. I swore that would never happen again because it was just awful and terrifying. I could see Trump saying the word China wrong in my mind. I was TERRIFIED! I tried to run but he was on the television. He looked like he had drank way too much Sunkist 😭😭 This is not for people under the age of 50!!"}},{"id":"6176973590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Buggy with Large Storage.","userName":"illegalmemes","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:37:30Z","review":"I genuinely went on this app, and it’s not good so I’m going to keep my review simple. The app is all bugs, nothing functions properly. It’s a headache to use, and it’s impossible to understand what’s on the screen. Also, the amount of storage space it takes up it ridiculous, and I’m not going to upgrade my storage plan for this app. Won’t be downloading ever again."}},{"id":"6176968270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Stinky","userName":"juliahdzz","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:36:04Z","review":"Downloaded this app to possibly learn more about our racist homophobic president’s plans for this upcoming election. Was disappointed because the app gave me a virus and these pop up ads would always show up. They always insulted me in these ads telling me to go back to my country. Leaving one star because the app stole all my information and data. This app is worse than at China for stealing info."}},{"id":"6176938460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Whoopies","userName":"12301851","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:28:10Z","review":"This app really confused me because when I opened it I saw a sweet potato with a wig on and then I got scared. Like how can that sweet potato walk around with his stubby legs and his fat head on his shoulders? I think we should cook that sweet potato and make him into something useful for once. At a Thanks Giving dinner and having people stab it until it’s ready to eat. I think the kids with no food would love to have something for a change."}},{"id":"6176933389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m serious and not doing the gen z thing.","userName":"Justinahh","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:51Z","review":"This app made my phone freeze up and didn’t load any information for me to see when I opened the app before it would eventually freeze up. I would have to power off my phone and then power it back up again and I tried twice but still kept doing it. Either fix the app or take it down."}},{"id":"6176899718","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP CRASHED MY PHONE!!!!😡🤬","userName":"12Aria35","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:18:03Z","review":"I got the app cause Trump Is a orange and that’s my fav color anyways, It then started CRASHING MY PHONE even when I wasn’t using the app!!!

Slowly after, all of my memories were wiped out from every app. The app also promised me that Dylan O’brien would show up at my house with a pet dog if I downloaded it, so obviously I would! But all i got was my phone crashing, just like how out country is. 😻😝💕🧚🏽\u200D♂️🤩🙌😈😏😌😎🔥"}}]}
