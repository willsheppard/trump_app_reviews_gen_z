THIS APP IS HORRIBLE.","userName":"onnisty","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:38:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible app"}},{"id":"6173966548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app for my little sister so she can catch up on mr Donald and his shenanigans only to open up the app to see that this women named peaches was twerking on camera.🥵😡me and my sis are now traumatized and are going to see a shrink.

I downloaded it and not only were the fundamental functions of the app both slow and unresponsive, but after I downloaded, a virus also took hold of my phone and deleted a bunch of my information. I'm missing contacts, apps, calls, and text messages that were here before I downloaded the app. Super disappointed, would absolutely give 0 stars if I could. 😡😡😡","userName":"Kwynn K.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:20:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gave my phone a VIRUS"}},{"id":"6173917677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This was just a couple waste of my time and storage. There was a glitch every 5 seconds and everything I could see was just a Cheeto. Like boy even a flaming hot Cheeto it was CHEESE😭😭 anyway there was very disturbing pictures which isn’t good for anyone to see. Luckly I did have eye protection so there was little to no damage. This app is very low quality and just not good at all. There are better options in the App Store but this is NOT where it’s at.","userName":"oo oh vvgs","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:17:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"never again..."}}]}
