DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! All I have learnt from this is that he is more racist then I thought uses fake articles and clickbait If you do some research and is not a Christian as he claims in case that is why you are standing with him it was a mistake to elect him but it will not be when he is impeached and kicked out of our government we stand together and Black Lives Matter ✊🏾✊🏿","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:20:41Z"}},{"id":"6173028667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Heart attack","userName":"173)3?:8:?:","review":"When my grandfather told me download this app I was so down for it, until he saw the chetto man on my screen and screamed like a 14 year old kpop fan. He got so excited to see that chetto man that he died from a heart attack. My grandfather would talk about Trump 24/7. He also showed us the time Trump was sex trafficking minors and also how his one incher got leaked. He also had all his merch. I feel so betrayed knowing this app killed my grandfather. This caused a family death and I wish to leave a one star review since it’s the reason my grandfather had passed.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:10:04Z"}},{"id":"6173002852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"💀⚡️✨✊🤚🐶🤪","review":"This app took 2 whole days to download and while it was downloading it started playing some really weird music that caused mosquitos to to start barging into my house it was awful. The next day I opened the app and all it showed me was this really weird picture of Donald trump picking his nose. It also kept on sending me so much annoying notifications and then when I opened the app  it would stop but the there was this one notification that said if I wanted them to stop I’d have to PayPal them $50. Definitely don’t recommend","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:09Z"}},{"id":"6172863983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY DOG","userName":"amelioith","review":"It all started when i downloaded this app to see what our beloved racist cheeto 🟠was up to. After taking 72 hours to download🙄 I finally opened the app and when I did my dog, FuFu started levitating and saying trump 2020. I was confused not because he was flying but because I most certainly did not raise him to be a blind, mindless trump supporter???! Then I chased him around my house with a broom and then he shot his laser eyes at me. The laser hit a mirror and shot back at him. Unfortunately FuFu was unable to recover from this. This is horrific and very traumatic. Why did Trump possess and kill my dog 😔","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:17Z"}},{"id":"6172831635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"Mia alverano","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes to find reason to support trump, BUT IT GAVE MY PHONE A VIRUS. Ever since I downloaded the app my phone has been glitching and won’t stop playing country music🤢. It’s had a white screen ever since! DONT DOWNLOAD THIS HORRID APP!! It will give your phone a virus. I went to the Apple store and they said there was nothing they could do, so I threw away my 1200 dollar phone !!! I’m never downloading this app again! I had bad luck ever since I downloaded it. My house became infested with cockroaches and my dog ran away.
