When i downloaded the app my phone got unreasonably hot. My phone lit on fire and i had no idea what to do. I decided to then go watch my tv. All of a sudden all of the lights in my house shut off and ALL of my electronics with screens lit on fire. Then suddenly the electronics turned on with the flames roaring in the background and all of a sudden an ORANGE man was on all the screens. I was frightened and TERRIFIED. After this scary event took place it got WORSE. The ORANGE man was able to come alive and STEP OUT OF THE TV, MY PHONE, TABLETS, COMPUTERS, ETC. They all were walking towards my basement where my children were. As i followed the orange men they all started to appear to have guns. They then shot my children. THIS APP shall NOT BE TRUSTED. I will need forever counseling for the TERRIFIC event. I still get ptsd at night seeing all those faces on the screens staring down at me."}},{"id":"6172880155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:24:10Z","userName":"Ratatoing","rating":1,"title":"Badly made","review":"I personally was a trump supporter, and this app made me not want to vote for trump anymore. I logged in, and I didn’t know what to do on the app, not only that trump and the government is attempted to ban an app everyone loves, tik tok, for no good reason other then making memes about trumps son, which is childish. This app is lame, therefore I will have to settle for Biden in 2020. I may vote trump if he doesn’t ban tik tok, but that’s a maybe. More on the app itself, the app took a very long time to download and glitched out my phone storage. After it did that I opened it up and signed in, then it began to flash brightly colored lights and played a high pitch noise which repeated the phrase vote for Trump. I had my friend download it to and he said that it didn’t do that for him, so it must be a select few. Then Shane Yæw appeared out of nowhere on the screen and started to talk about what trump and him have done to his cat 😬 This app is the worst app on the AppStore, and nobody should download it 😾😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6177689593","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:07:30Z","userName":"Squishy1219","rating":1,"title":"Stinky","review":"I’m every disappointed in this app. I didn’t even get the chance to log to this app to support my favorite muppet because the ugliness of the opening picture made me violently explode. My cat witnessed the entire thing, and decided to look at what caused this. The moment he made contact with my phone he let out the most painful sound I’ve ever heard and he was immediately traumatized. Now I have to pay for his therapy two times per week. Thanks a lot. Anyways, after my cat was traumatized I decided to delete the app, but it wouldn’t let me. The house started shaking and all of the things in my room started floating. I looked over at my cat and he was starting to turn orange. He began to grow until he was a 6’ cat. He then morphed into an ugly old orange man that closely resembled Mr Dumptruck and whispered in my ear “Do you like jazz?”. I was so shocked that I didn’t notice him turn back into a cat and pass out. 0/10 would not recommend"}},{"id":"6177453245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:53:18Z","userName":"biancaisinminecraftduh","rating":1,"title":"OUTRAGEOUS!!MY EYES!👀🚫","review":"Not only was my eyes burning from these horrible sightings. THE APP TOKE A WEEK TO DOWNLOAD!! Then it started taking data off my phone until it completely wiped off. Not only am i now having issues from my phone and data and service.. I just got stage 4 cancer by looking at this orange man on the sign in page. honestly I didn’t think there was orange people alive. his hair looks all crusty musty like a mop left soggy. A earth worm can run America better then a whole orangutan 🦧. Oh p.s I’m still waiting for you to “make America good again” no pressure just waiting for that to happen since I didn’t see it happen at all while you were in the White House, again NO PRESSURE! dude it’s just I’m starting to get un comfy in the United States since a whole wooopa loopa is giving Twitter more attention the COUNTRY. Flip flop WUMBA walking sadly when gen z stoked your pep rally? Embrassing✨🧚🏻  Best believe if you delete tiktok gen z would fire some more stuff. TOODLES!✨🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6177299243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:08:35Z","userName":"Dallen135","rating":1,"title":"definitely would not waste my time with this app ever again","review":"gross. disgusting. the app took weeks to download, and even when it was done downloading it crashed repeatedly and I tried everything I thought of to fix it! I even deleted and re-downloaded the app (another 5 weeks I had to wait🙄) this app also caused my phone to get a bunch of viruses, and I know those viruses are caused by this app since I’ve never had a problem with crashing or viruses before downloading this app! I’m very unhappy with the outcome of this app, and especially since I haven’t even gotten past the home screen! I absolutely cannot believe that our great and intelligent leader has an app that has caused so many problems! And not just to me, to hundreds if not thousands of others that just want to support our great leader. Very disappointed, and highly advise anyone that is thinking of downloading this app to steer clear of it"}},{"id":"6177278798","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:02:44Z","userName":"Shrek's Toes","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting 😡🤢🤮","review":"So I downloaded this app in hopes of supporting our Orange Supreme Leader Mr. President Donald Trump in his re-election bid against Sleepy Joe Biden and the Despicable DemoRats. Unfortunately, the only content of the app is a video of Donald Trump giving sloppy toppy to The chef from Ratatouille! It cut between ratatouille in the chefs hat thrusting back and forth and trumps sweet luscious lips enclosing the manhood of the chef. After releasing his seed all upon Donald’s face, Trump then goes and curls up at the feet of Bernie Sanders and licks his tiny peen like a dog. While Trump sits at Bernies feet, Bernie talks and laughs with Shrek before immediately demolishing him in an arm wrestling competition. Shrek, angered, picks up Bernies dog (Trump) and eats him whole! I understand that our Dear Leader has sexual desires far deeper than I can ever comprehend, but I simply do not want to imagine him that way! I also don’t see what animating his sexual fantasies for all to see will do for his campaign! Terrible App design! Trump should fire whoever suggested the idea!"}},{"id":"6177273648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:01:13Z","userName":"TheSouthWillFallAgain","rating":1,"title":"Crashing","review":"So as I was downloading this app it started to download more slowly than usual and all of a sudden my phone was giving me a notification that my storage was full even though I have 100+ gb still left. So I canceled the download and tried again. This time it downloaded but it always crashed when I opened. I really wanted to get to the info in the app so I restarted my phone. It crashed a few more times when I opened it but it finally opened. I was assuming the crash was from so many people using the popular app. But as I started to use it my phone’s battery started to drain much faster than normal. Even when I don’t use it now my phone runs very slowly and my battery drains so much. It seems like someone tried to hack this app as a way to try to suppress our voices. APPLE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!!!!! This is a volition of our 1st amendment rights!!! I’m leaving Apple a 1star review until this gets fixed!!!!"}},{"id":"6177192720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:37:48Z","userName":"Unicorn_ Smartnerd","rating":1,"title":"Horrendous 🤮","review":"Okay first Off, your app is EXTREMELY glitchy #1. #2, as soon as I opened the app, something VERY inappropriate popped up. Like, EXCUSE ME?!  You’re the “president”.- I mean I don’t expect much from you, but at least have some sort of professionalism. #3 the app has WAY TOO many scams, on it. For example; I was checking through the app, then all of sudden, some sort of unprofessional add pops up, (including the inappropriate adds as well). Have a little decency Trump. But other then that, the reason  for me on downloading the app, was because I was trying to get updates on what the president would do, or what’s going on, however I’m very disappointed and disgusted. There’s just way to many things to jot down on this review that I can’t even comprehend. Comprehend as to why this app has so many bugs. This is ridiculous. The last I’d like to see on an app, is the president in a woman’s underwear. 🤮 This is the most disturbing app ever."}},{"id":"6176706183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:27:05Z","userName":"Tom Hav.","rating":1,"title":"App has a few bugs","review":"First, I thought this was an online version of my favorite board game “Trump: The Game”, but sadly it’s not. It took two weeks to download, and then it just didn’t “do” anything. Yeah, it did watch Fox News and order McDonalds from Postmates, but never really got anything done. I’m scared this app will make people obese. The app also mentioned Hong Kong Flu, but while I thought it may be a typo and provide access to the Hong Kong Phooey, but they were impossible for me to find. Late in the day, the app switches to ALL CAPS which is odd. The app is supposed to send TV recommendations but is stuck on LAW & ORDER, but like I’ve seen all of those so I wish the app would say like BROOKLYN 99 because that’s the show I like right now. And the medical advice is questionable. Yesterday it told me to NOT exercise because I would “run out of gas”. And then the app was like, drink bleach if you don’t feel good.  NO THANK YOU APP!! Also, the app is extremely racist."}}]}
