It made my phone have many issues and run slow. It also sends you so many unnecessary notifications and blows up your phone. The app takes forever to load and has so many ads that pop up. This app is disgusting and a waste of time. It will mess up your phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.","date":"2020-07-09T02:24:46Z"}},{"id":"6174644844","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app stinks","isEdited":false,"userName":"gjekfnjflwnd","rating":1,"review":"Hi my name is Karen and I’m very disappointed. I got this app because I love my lord and savior Donald j trump but all I got were glitches and found out within the app that he doesn’t care about the spread of the coronavirus with all these rallies!! My son has TYPE 1 DIABETES AND FOR MY PRECIOUS LORD AND SAVIOR TO DO NOTHING TO STOP THE SPREAD SHOWS HOW MUCH HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT MY SON!!

Trump is the orange hubby I wished I had. But, this app ain't it. I got it to support my dream man but every time I see Donald’s name, I am reminded of how I can’t be with him. It hurts too much to open and scroll through. Not to mention this app is insanely glitchy and problematic. This app also doesn’t support human rights and doesn’t respect me as a user. \nI will have to delete, goodbye Donald xoxo.\nSincerely,\na woman poc in America","date":"2020-07-09T02:18:44Z"}},{"id":"6174552616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Parakeet possession","isEdited":false,"userName":"marie.z8","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support trump (who by the way has the best words and highest IQ out of anyone) but upon opening the app it became incredibly glitchy and therefore I couldn’t use it \nalso when I opened it my parakeet started chanting “build that wall” and \n“lock her up” which I found disturbing it left my phone very glitchy. They should just remove it. Wouldn’t recommend.

My dog starts going crazy!! As if it were emitting some weird noise as some sort of mind control game 😭 my dog pulled me down the street as a desperate attempt to escape the horrible sounds.
