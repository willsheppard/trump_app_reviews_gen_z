I got a phone call right after from a donkey telling me that my boyfriend just tripped over a trump poster and did a quadruple flip off a cliff. Very sad. I ordered a triple flip not a quadruple. Also it was supposed to be Jessica who did the flips so very disappointing. We all hate Jessica. Horrible customer support. They accidentally pressed the build a wall button instead of the refund order and then threw me over it. I found my cousin da cow. She‚Äôs doing very well but then got corona from a trump supporter cussing her off. Poor Sabrina, she was a very good cow. Penguins are interesting creatures. My dinosaur ate my sister in her wedding while I was roller skating next to a do not roller skate here sign. I went to jail and found a man name peter. We broke out of prison. I cried at the movies after watching brave. Very sad. We are the winx we are the winx we are the winx come join the club we are the winx. Barbie life in the dream house??? Pop off trivago!
