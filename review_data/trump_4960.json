It had me put my phone number in which i saw no problem with but it seems as though the second i did i started receiving numerous calls from numbers I did not know. I finally answered and instantly was trying to get sold stuff so I am completely under the belief that they sold my information to telemarketers. All i wanted was to learn more about my president, and the more i learned the more i realized how he was worse than the libtards!! I am still a committed republican but have decided to stop supporting this ugly orange man.","rating":1,"title":"facist!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173213116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:09:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"keyla_duhhh","review":"I recently got this app just because I’m a adventurous soul🧚\u200D♀️ so I wanted to see the hype and it was the WORST mistake of my life actually my cat actually started to choke on an orange I don’t even know where it came from and suddenly there was oranges all over my house I was surrounded by oranges I felt like I was drowning I was surrounded by idiots who were wearing very disgusting maga hats fighting for their Oompa Loompa looking President I was scared for my life they were throwing their president colored oranges while shouting out there racist nonsense I feel like this app is extremely bad luck and is haunted by the his fellow in orange followers ~ Sincerely a person with common decency ❤️ BLM💕","rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP!ORANGEY INVASION!"}},{"id":"6173149959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:48:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"spidertrey","review":"This app took like a whole month to download and when I opened it I had to give them personal information and my phone has been ringing ever since. This app also had a very specific ringtone for when you got a notification and trust me it was not good my dogs would go crazy and my fish started to jump out of its water bowl I have been through 15 goldfish already.

I jack off to him and his🍤 every night. But when I downloaded the app I was very disappointed because it took about 4 hours to download even though I have perfect WiFi and a new phone. After it finally downloaded the screen kept flashing images OF THE RUSSIAN FLAG. I was shocked in tears almost. Like Donny baby what is this app. I tried to ignore it but when I went to buy a hat one of them showed a black lives matter symbol. THAT IS COMPLETELY UNEXCEPTIONABLE. We all know it’s ALL LIVES MATTER. I don’t recommend getting this app it is horrible. But anyways Stan anonymous for clear skin💅🏻.","rating":1,"title":"Glitching Out"}},{"id":"6173097246","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:31:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"djdnnfdkdkddn","review":"This app took so long to download and i had perfectly good wifi. Also trying to get into the app was complicated. The app kept closing out, every single time i tried opening the app. This problem lasted about an hour or so then i gave up. Then i just got frustrated and deleted the app. It made me sad that i couldn’t get into the app that’s the whole reason i got the app in the first place. Not being able to open it was just a waste of my time. It’ll probably waste your time too, i don’t recommend getting this app unless u wanna have difficulties getting into the app.","rating":1,"title":"App gave me difficulties"}},{"id":"6173000654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:01:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Barringer is here","review":"I’m not one of these children messing around but the app doesn’t even work it opens then crashes and that is the least I expect from a app from are lord and savior Donald J trump. It makes me sad that the programmers of this app had to do him like that. The thing I hate about trump is that he probebly smalls like hot dog water😒. Also why would you make an app that runs off of racism and hate the others like you need to stop. The old people defending this app are the bad one on here because you are the ones that are trying to protect a white supremacist and rapist because you like his beliefs 🤨","rating":1,"title":"The actual worst app I have ever seen!!!!!"}},{"id":"6172963510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:50:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"daddydonaldtrump2283","review":"i was SO excited to get this app because i absolutely LOVE daddy trumpet, but right when i opened it all my hopes and dreams were crushed. i am APPLED at this behavior. absolutely APPLES. or should i say oranges? anyway, very stinky app 😡🤬🤢😡🤬. after i opened it, i tried to exit, but it wouldn’t let me!!! my entire cell phone was being spammed by donald’s itsy bitsy pp, which i have been permanently traumatized with. not to mention the endless rows of ninjas wielding oranges at me. i go to therapy now. it doesn’t help the nightmares. please for the love of, well, your own personal dignity, do NOT get this stinky application 😡😡😡😡. chile anyways stan queen nicki and stream spring day 😛","rating":1,"title":"stinky 😡😡🤬🤢🤢😡🤬😡🤢"}}]}
