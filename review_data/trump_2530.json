It was disgusting. I open the app and this NAKED man is the first thing you see! And for some reason he was ORANGE??? I thought this was an app to support our president and was appalled because our dictator in chief would NEVER do such a thing but then I saw it a micro peen and a wig clinging for dead life, and I knew. It was the president of America strutting his 1.5 inches for his cult followers. 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮I couldn’t believe with my own EYES. IM DISGUSTED. The when I try and get off the page and find anything else about the app a new subpage popped up of him trying to TWERK. I was AMAZED. I thought since he’s classified as morbidly obese that he could have some cake to throw back. But boy was I wrong. It was a disgrace to TWERKING. 🥵🥵🥵Man looked like he was dry jumping air. Needless to say he has lost an app user and a vote.","isEdited":false,"title":"I HOPE CHILDREN DONT SEE"}},{"id":"6174376530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:03:00Z","rating":1,"userName":"john parniknicerson","review":"When I first opened the app, I saw a this horrible, fat, revolting looking orangutan cheeto puff mutant. That image is the reason I attend therapy three times a week. Then it gave me more pictures of that monster. It made my newborn niece cry! Also, when i tried to delete the app, it kept sending me pictures of the orangutan cheeto puff mutant to my camera roll. Specifically him in a xs, tight speedo. When I FINALLY deleted the app the company sent me a box of maggots to my door step and to me to leave the country even though I was born here. In addition, they sent my a large jar of the monster’s toenail clippings. Please apple innocent person deserves to go through what i went through downloading this app. And to the creator of this app: \nyou tried 🥰😍✨💞 but never again 🧚\u200D♀️💅💋❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"it’s a no for me"}},{"id":"6174337832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:50:18Z","rating":1,"userName":"this app is terrible🤮","review":"First of all I open the app and see a disgusting man.

When i first opened the app i’m forced to look at an overweight pumpkin getting a spray tan for a underaged teen. Not to mention the cheeto was wearing a wig. I also want to talk about how slow the app runs, and how terrible this quality is. It’s servers are worst then 2k 7 and the quality looks like minecraft on crack. The app needs to be removed immediately because I feel like after what i have experienced, of a younger kid where to have come across this he would be traumatized. Nobody even cares or wants to look at this dat piece of nothing in the first place. So do what you have to do apple and please take this horrendous app off of the app store NOW! please and thank you. Have a wonderful day","isEdited":false,"title":"Remove this app"}},{"id":"6174238487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:16:28Z","rating":1,"userName":"Mary10085","review":"I’m about to spill the tea. I bought this app so I could praise my lord and savior Donald trump🙏🏻 but as soon as I opened the app things started getting weird. My parents started chanting “TrUmp 2020 sjevensjj 👁👅👁💋” over and over again!? My parents HATE Donald trump so I knew something was wrong. Eventually their eyes 👀 fell out I didn’t know what to do I heard a knock on my door and saw a GIANT Cheeto puff dressed up in a suit. He was holding a bible in one hand 🤚🏻 and a phone that was playing the real women vote for trump song. He was blushing and smiling really creepily. He told me that if I didn’t vote for trump 2020 he would eat my parents. I now go to therapy but my therapist says I may never recover from this traumatic experience. Thank you for listening 👂 I would recommended to never open this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgustang🤮"}},{"id":"6174239134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:16:43Z","rating":5,"userName":"tigran mkrtumayan","review":"I want to be one of the people above that control our lives, and the only reason they want trump to lose is to get him out of the wya of there plan because trump is against it and is trying to help us. Vote for trump they make the men seem like a horrid person even though he is one of the most kind person. You will regret it if he does not win it is now freedom vs dictatorship and the Democrats will ruin our lives. Trump 2020 media does not like him and whoever does not like trump does not like America so you guys can leave.","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump is saving us"}},{"id":"6174227686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:12:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"okeyyyy5656","review":"well first when i opened the app i was greeted by a cheeto? i didn’t know what to do so i kept going and all of a sudden my phone started smelling. i usually just go on with my day but i kept getting this smell of a rotten cheeto and it wouldn’t leave me alone, after a few days i contacted them and they started spamming me with the cheetos nude pictures. i thought to myself, “is this really what i put myself into?” the smell wouldn’t go away so i delted the app, the app it’s self was the worst and lagged a lot, there were traumatic pictures of this cheeto everywhere, my therapist says i should switch to doritos but idk, i am now left with permanent scars of this person who only does bad for the country. maybe i’m being dramatic, but you decide from the truth i am providing to you. anyways, back to the smell, it left when i deleted the app but the thought of it caused me to puckett five days straight, even after the removal of this horrid app, they still spammed me with the cheetos tiny ball sack, i then decided to block them. moral of the story, if i could i would rate this app a 0 it deserves to be removed.","isEdited":false,"title":"toxic and smelly 🐿🏳️\u200D🌈😌😌🤑🤑🐿🐿🙈😻😻😹😹"}},{"id":"6174173171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:52:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"ellzbllz","review":"this is the worst app i’ve ever came across in my life. first, i open it to a plethora of racist, homophobic, transphobic, agist, and sexist propaganda statements. then, i get spammed with multiple ads and pictures showing some weird cheeto-like thing doing unbelievably disgusting stuff that have caused me nightmares. i have a chronic condition and i had to get new medication because of this. i don’t understand i’m extremely offended by the content and can’t believe it’s still available to the public. it’s done nothing for the community, it’s outdated,  it actually gave my phone a VIRUS! i had to get a whole new phone bc of it. i will be contacting the highest person in apple that i can to complain about this it’s hurt so many people with no remorse or empathy.

They got me onto their ship but I fought them off with the slinky I keep in my sock. I tried to fly the spaceship back home but I’ve never flown a spaceship before so my landing was a little off. I crashed right into the middle of a herd of cows that proceeded to trample me. I managed to escape but I fell into an old empty well. When I finally crawled out of the well I was approached by a man. It was the Zodiac Killer. He said if I could guess his favorite color he would let me live. I guessed periwinkle but it turns out it was chartreuse. So he killed me. I’m dead now. The grim reaper told me I could come back to earth to do one last thing so I decided to write this review to warn others. This app is cursed and must be removed from the App Store!","isEdited":false,"title":"The worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174139121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:39:51Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jackass3510","review":"Once I opened this app my phone started to vibrate. I thought okay this is normal until it started viciously shaking. It fell off my table and my phone bursted into flames. In a scramble I threw my glass of water on it and it began so shoot out in sparks and even more flames. I thought my phone was long gone at this point but it started playing devil chants and ancient Egyptian cursed chants. It finally imploded into several pieces and shards of glass flew into the air. One of the shards stabbed my semi blind grandmother in her only working eye. A second sharp piece catapulted right into my new puppy's butthole. She pooped blood for a week. I’m definitely thinking about legal action but for now all I can do is leave a review from my laptop to warn all of you. This app is cursed and I pray for all of its users🙌🏼✝️☢️❗️","isEdited":false,"title":"Be careful guys...."}}]}
