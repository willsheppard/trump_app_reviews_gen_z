The layout is horrible to look at and is difficult to understand, and on top of that, it gave my phone a virus! I couldn’t believe how bad this app was, but the final straw was when it changed my phone screen to a close up of Donald Trumps ears. Dreadful. I don’t recommend this app to anyone and i wish i could give it a lower rating.","userName":"bunnyslimereposts","rating":1}},{"id":"6174214908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:07:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT GET!!","review":"there are MANY problems with this app, first this app TRACKS YOU.

I started seeing weird pop ups for the episode app that featured only Ivanka trump as a co star to Donald trump himself. It made me super uncomfortable. After the pop up exited, it was only full of trump selfies and it was a complete waste of a download app for me. 1 Star all the way. Please delete- no one deserves to see this crap.","userName":"barron trump🥰","rating":1}},{"id":"6174089729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:21:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app .. no thank you","review":"so i went to download the app and then i see donald trump getting a SPRAY TAN , i always knew he was orange but i never knew it .. was fake 😔🖐🏼 . so then i go to tiktok to take my mind off of it , and then .. i see a picture of donald’s TINY CHODE PP , i was baffled and left paralyzed . my pet cacaroach has to pick me up off the ground and take me to the ER , since then i was left with $100,000,000,000 hospital bill , and i’ve been recovering but i still have to go to","userName":"Stephany645Stephany","rating":1}},{"id":"6174057313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i literally am scarred for life....","review":"if i was held at gun point and was given the option of having this app or jumping off a cliff into a tank of boiling water id literally DIVE into that water so fast. getting this app (even though i havent even opened it yet nor plan to open it) has truly become the worst decision iv ever made and i dont think ill ever be able to recover. if this app has any relation to how trump runs America, i dont want him anywhere near us.","userName":"amazin lol","rating":1}},{"id":"6174040637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️","review":"this app is honestly one of the worst apps to ever exist. first of all, the name “trump” makes me want to gag 🤢🤢 like couldn’t you pick a better name like “bernie” or “sanders” or even “AOC” 🥰 second of all, this app is just so stupid. no point in it. i DEMAND it to be deleted so i don’t have to SMELL it’s horrible AROMA everytime i go to the app store 😾 \nin conclusion, PLEASE DON’T DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!

Opened the app to find HORRIFIC images of Cheeto man himself that has now scared my whole family and I! This app is terrible and should not be in the app store! No one should have to see Cheeto man in such circumstances let alone at all. Sorry to all of the people who are now blind and writing reviews with their voice and hearing this instead of reading it with eyes! Unbelievable!!!","userName":"News Specialist","rating":1}}]}
