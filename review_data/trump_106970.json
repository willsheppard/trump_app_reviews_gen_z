So following her advice, I drove to the nearest Burger King (for my daily complaining ritual to the manager) and used their bathroom. As I gracefully squated down to drop the kids off at the pool, I opened the App Store on my cellular device. I downloaded the app mid-crap (like Sandy recommended), and to my shock the bathroom door flung wide open. Shrek (wearing makeup and a weird blonde toupee) started crawling underneath the stall, and stood right in front of me. He then proceeded to flush me down the toilet, where I was greeted with children dressed in orange costumes. They proceeded to chant around in a circle saying ‚Äúrate us 5 stars, rate us 5 stars‚Äù, and that‚Äôs when I knew that this was all happening because of the app that I downloaded. I stood up, and said ‚ÄúENOUGH. I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER‚Äù. The children, startled, stopped chanting and brought me to their leader/manager. Standing there, the great Orange Man turned around to talk to me. I took out my phone to start recording, but suddenly I was transported back to Burger King with an orange in one hand and my doodoo in another. I was very confused.\n\nAnyway, I do not recommend this app to anyone. I am thoroughly traumatized and my hands are permanently stained orange and brown.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKaren","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:14:50Z"}},{"id":"6178565741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible","userName":"Taaylorrosee","rating":1,"review":"terrible app for a terrible president","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:10:23Z"}},{"id":"6178505103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","userName":"SuperCris345","rating":1,"review":"This app is pure trash","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:46:10Z"}},{"id":"6178485110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NASTY","userName":"morgan5872&3","rating":1,"review":"trump was asking me for nudes and i saw his orange bean sprout pp","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:38:12Z"}},{"id":"6178477510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ruined my phone","userName":"Aw3someaj10","rating":1,"review":"RODRICK:\n(WHISPERING) Greg?\n\nGREG:\n(GROGGILY) Mmm.\n\n- (IN SINGSONG) Greg?\n\n- What?\n\n- Greg!\n\n- Huh?
