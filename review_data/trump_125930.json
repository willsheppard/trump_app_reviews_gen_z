As soon as I opened this app some strange voice greeted me and told me of all the horrible things that would happen to me if I deleted the app. I was scared out of my mind, and out of faith in my oh so great President Donald Trump🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸I decided that he would never ever do anything g to violate my rights ever💖 so I deleted the app trusting that nothing would happen. Only one day later I got the word that the very Trump himself came to my mothers home and murdered her in cold blood, then hours later my three dogs left me for the streets and got run over before my very eyes. Lastly, all of my power cut off and a broadcast full of pornographic images flooded my television. So out of good citizenship, I come here to warn you of the atrocities this app will cause you.DO.NOT.DOWNLOAD","userName":"Joe McShans Jonas","title":"SATANIC*DO NOT DOWNLOAD*"}},{"id":"6178889933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T01:15:01Z","review":"(Coughs) sorry just all the bad air had to come out.anywayyyy this app was horrible the catholic in me wanted to die bc of this😌.i don’t support any of this especially what you did to those kids like seriously it disgusting and horrible.
