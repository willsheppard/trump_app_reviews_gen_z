I’d give this app zero out of five stars. I seriously wish I could give this less than one star. \n\nThis app was absolutely horrible. Within minutes of downloading this app, I had issues. This awful app destroyed my home on Jupiter, made my iPhone 21 catch fire, caused my dog to suddenly levitate and accidentally fly away, and made me lose even more faith in humanity. I would not recommend this app to anyone."}},{"id":"6179438941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"not worth ur time","date":"2020-07-10T04:30:46Z","userName":"RCM249","review":"I can't believe this app, so poorly made, is on the app store.
