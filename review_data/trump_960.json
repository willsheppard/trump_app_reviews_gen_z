I thought it was a delivery service for food. Turned out it is some guy that kills POC and has a croissant as his downstairs area. I don’t fw that so off the bat it wasn’t good. It asked for my phone number so I put it in and DONALD TRUMP HIMSLEF CAME TO MY HOUSE! He told me that I have to be apart of a mission to stop these EVIL BLACK PEOPLE! He sang me a song to make me go to bed and when I woke up I had orange paint all over me!!! I punched him in the face and twisted the end of his croissant. Luckily baron saved me from the evil man. We lived a happy life together and ran away from the evil orange man! 😃🤠. 20 years later I have a baby. He still knows where I live but I thought he was dead! Apparently not sis!!! He came to my house and tried to KILL MY CHILD! He used his stench to suffocate my baby but I luckily got out of there and trapped him in a cage for the monkeys to eat him and now we live happily without a Cheeto man 😌🖐 no need to thank me.","date":"2020-07-09T16:08:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bandoobladoink"}},{"id":"6175933403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!","review":"So I downloaded this app. Wanted to check it out, seemed nice at first but then suddenly the worst possible scenario you could think of actually happened! This app pinged my location to thousands (if not millions) of others and essentially compromised my phone and my exact location. Not only that, but the phone I downloaded the app on originally, actually CAUGHT FIRE! I called up the government, cause I got them on speed dial, and asked them why this happened... you won’t believe what they said... they said “please hold” and I was put on hold for 4 hours!!! After finally being taken off hold, without even asking what was wrong, they said “sorry can’t help you, goodbye”. I was so confused by this and then suddenly I got a notification that money from my bank account was actually WIRED to a few FBI agents. When I asked why, I was told it was to pay for their salaries!!! Can you believe this?! Absolutely ridiculous. Worst experience ever.","date":"2020-07-09T09:40:37Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Scarydogo"}},{"id":"6175688042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very upset.","review":"Where should I even start? This app took 4 hours to download onto my phone, and upon opening it they asked for my social security number, my address, my credit card number, my phone number, and many other personal details. Of course I trust my ✨lovely President, so I inputted the information only to instantly be spammed with phone calls! I answered and a man by the name of Mr. Epstein told me he had all my information and was coming for me when I go to sleep, but I know my president would never let that happen! I haven’t seen my 7 year old daughter since, but she loves to play hide and seek so I’m sure she will show up. After these phone calls, the app gave me an election countdown and threatened to sell my information if I didn’t vote for Donald trump, which luckily I was gonna do in November anyway so I didn’t even have to worry about my information being sold! The app called me fat and ugly as well, and told me to get a spray tan.

My phone has been glitching non-stop since downloading. My apps have been crashing my battery has been dying unusually fast and even many of my pictures and videos were deleted out of nowhere. Important videos of my daughter walking and talking were deleted forever because of this virus so I am very upset. Because of this app my information and my phone number has been taken and given to many other companies (which is a complete invasion of privacy). I have recently been informed by the police that my information has been leaked on the black market and I am being put on the witness protection program. I hold the Trump administration fully responsible for these tragic events. This app should be taken off the app store immediately and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS !!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:17:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"473782882682"}},{"id":"6174522199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁 no❤️✨💅","review":"I can’t believe this app, I literally just looked up “Cheeto game” because I am a fan of “Cheetos” and I wanted to play a game, little did I know this “game” was actually of A REAL LIFE CHEETO MAN!!!! I couldn’t believe my eyes, it was horrible, as I opened the app my phone screen revealed a picture of a Cheeto getting a spray tan, it was completely NAKED! Disgusting, I believe this app is related to the “pizza gate” and the Cheeto looking mad wants to get KIDS to download this app to I guess yk... KIDNAP THEM!!! What do you think would happen if a kid saw that picture?🤢 anyways I tried to ignore the picture because I’m used to disgusting stuff, when I closed and reopened the app it was normal I guess... or so I thought😮. This app seemed to have a lot of jokes in it, it’s full of stupid funny/not accurate “information”... it was fun at first but then I figured it out!😨😱 THE CHEETO MAN IS GIVING ALL IF THAT FAKE INFO BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!🍊🌎 this app is the end of humanity and Cheetos, it must get taken down now!!!!.","date":"2020-07-09T01:45:58Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cheeto man is REAL!"}},{"id":"6174508051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MY MAMA SAID NO🥰✨","review":"This app is for clowns who’s brains are smaller than that one raisin that’s been ran over 10 times by Karen’s white surburban being driven out of the 7/11 parking after she just finished arguing with an employee for forgetting to give her the 1 cent change from her nutrition bar. I cannot tell you enough this is the WORST app I’ve EVER downloaded I’m disgusted, mortified, disturbed, and not enough words can describe how horrible this app is😢. I had to witness looking at clowns and for some reason I keep seeing this orange Cheeto puff which is odd and weird for an app made by someone who is apparently the “President” named Donald Trash🤮. Even a babies app is better than whatever this nonsense is!! Even my lamp jasmine agrees she said “💡” and I strongly disagree🥰. I was even checking out the app on the toilet and the app was so bad my toilet started hyperventilating and she broke🥺. So I’m conclusion my Netflix trial just ended and I DESPISE this app😈!!

All I see is something ugly racist child moles**ng Cheeto that is hated by most of the people in America. No one needs to see that face in office ever again. Trump, you need to pull your head out of your a*s! No one is going to let you win this year. That’s why we aren’t going down until without a fight. And hunny, this is not a fight you will win. This is a fight the people will win. Start packing, b**ch. you ain’t winning the 2020 election. And on  another note, We want to keep TikTok. You literally are one of America’s biggest problems. And the WORST president in history. This app is useless and it won’t help you 🤢🤮. All those pictures make we want to puke and just straight up DIE. We not going to let you keep this up any longer. Please delete this app. It has the most horrifying pictures of a Cheeto you will ever see in your life 🤢🤮\nThis is way to graphic for any viewers of any age to see!
