My great dictator of the unfree world has disappointed me once again. Also it causes side effects such as casual racism, sexism and Islamophobia. Also now am having an urge to file bankruptcy and start another failed casino. Weird app."}},{"id":"6137717297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Linda \"Linny\" Green","date":"2020-06-29T23:58:28Z","review":"I honestly downloaded this app to support my president, but when I opened it up, it just crashed!! It also made my phone create a high pitches noise that played very loudly, and it terrified my kids. There were listening to Kidz Bop, and they still heard it!! Absolutely terrible; I do not recommend. Get this off the App Store!!"}},{"id":"6136768574","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting horrible man!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🥱🐯🕷","date":"2020-06-29T17:37:03Z","review":"I don’t know what to say to this anymore. I mean, I feel like we’ve been saying everything that needs to be said for the longest time but he’s not listening. We need him to stop his reign of terror so we can actually enjoy 2020. All I’m saying is this man needs to be stopped before more people get hurt."}},{"id":"6135549334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gisselle Z","date":"2020-06-29T11:30:04Z","review":"It caused my phone to glitch out as soon as I opened it! I didn’t know downloading it would automatically sign me up for a cult that I don’t want to be a part of. Also, the information on it is absurd! i’ve never been fed such propaganda and biased content and I can’t believe this is considered “news”."}},{"id":"6135464862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"zxc bnngfv","date":"2020-06-29T11:03:06Z","review":"The quality on this app is low. The loading in general takes forever, even on different devices. The app contains false information and contradicts everything he says in person, plus the news. There was no point in buying this app!"}},{"id":"6135105577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dont get it twisted, this is a 0/5 review","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Weeb413👾😽👌💖","date":"2020-06-29T08:59:26Z","review":"So unfortunate the passing of our cheeto, toupee wearing president. This campaign is an insult to his dying memory, quotes like ‘grab em by the p***y’ ‘if we inject alcohol into out system, it will fight off the virus’ and his ventures into his bunker, use of ‘chinese virus’ as an actual term. But i digress, we should all respect and pay tribute to the man who put children in cages 💕💕💕👁👅👁🧚🧚🧚🧚\u200D♂️🧚🧚\u200D♂️💗💓💞💖💖"}},{"id":"6134836782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"a member of gen z🧚🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-06-29T07:14:52Z","review":"This app is horrible.😡I can’t believe this, this is outrageous!!! When using this app it began glitching, and the glitches kept saying false information on how trump was going to supposedly “keep america great”!! I believe this use of false information is absolutely disgusting and I hope that this app is reviewed and taken down!!!😡"}}]}
