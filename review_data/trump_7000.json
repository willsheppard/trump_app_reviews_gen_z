Unfortunately when I opened the app I was disturbingly shown a picture of Annoying Orange wearing a mop on his head. I was slightly confused so I continued to look through the app. This was a mistake. Somehow the app went through my headphones and confiscated all of my earwax. This makes me very angry because I was going to use that to make my special face cream. I am leaving this review to make sure nobody else gets their earwax taken. Do not recommend.","userName":"GOSIGXOHDIGSTIWOTSOYDPHCOHX","title":"Very disappointed"}},{"id":"6174441589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:41Z","rating":1,"review":"When it opens it immediately tries to steal you private information like an app from a third rate dictatorial nation (but unlike those apps it offers absolutely no entertainment).  If you’re not willing to provide them with information the app does absolutely nothing.  So unless you start off by signing your soul away this app is nothing but a waste of space...in fact it’s just a waste of space much like the person it attempts to hype.  To the trash with both of them as they are all useless.","userName":"CrisAP444","title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6174430837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:19:28Z","rating":1,"review":"Honestly this is just a crappy app once you open it you see a login and sign up option in the back you see a Chido holding up a fist and I first I was scared and confused and now I have dizziness nausea and I’m throwing up all over the place I am disgusted and so confused and don’t even get me started on the mental pain I’m receiving as soon as I open the app I immediately started crying I don’t know what came over me but I just started crying and and I’ve been physically and mentally suffering ever since I’ve open this app.","userName":"jjrkrnekf","title":"Horrible👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"}},{"id":"6174410920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:13:24Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app with hopes to get more information about our country. As soon as I opened the app harmful radiation began to leak from my phone. My pet hamster that was running on its wheel began to screech in hysteria. He stopped breathing and collapsed in its cage. The radio began to turn to a country station and the volume increase to the point were my ears began to bleed. I’m currently in the hospital with a high bill from erupted eardrums. I won’t be able to pay my medical bills and my hamster sadly passed away. All thanks to this horrible app.","userName":"strawberry_ragdollx","title":"Absurd. Fake news.

It was a trauma inducing event. I was in the hospital for weeks and now I have to attend therapy. Not only was the Cheeto attack traumatic, but so was the things I saw on the app. I don’t think I will ever be the same again. This is completely unacceptable, I feel like I have been deprived of my childhood. I don’t want to go into detail about what I saw because that isn’t fair to anyone but I’m warning you not to download this app, it is terrifying.","userName":"🏳️\u200D🌈✌️🥺","title":"I have to go to therapy now"}},{"id":"6174352827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:55:22Z","rating":1,"review":"Once I got this app I opened it and I was shocked to find out that I got a call from boss baby at 3am!!! 😮😮😮😧😧😧😧😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😦😧😧😧😧😦😦😧😧😦😧😧😦😦😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨 and the next day I noticed my 344mil.

I have many things to say. The app took away my pet elephant while I was in the pool with my pajamas. I cried and demanded him back but, he was gone. This app is exceeding, trifling considering ranting criticizing concerning adopting fitting wording being exhibiting was displaying, notwithstanding ridiculing, surpassing boasting swelling reasoning, respecting correcting erring writing, and deceiving arguing during debating.

Somehow the bag of orange Cheetos was on the app inside my phone🤭🤬 The app stole my hot Cheetos. There is clearly only one explanation the government hacked me and took control of my pet monkey 🐒 making clusho (my monkey) take my Cheetos give them to the government and crush them up for The Big Cheeto’s (trump🤢) foundation. TBC could have just gone to the store and gotten Cheeto tanner but no he took control of clusho. This is animal abuse, theft, and hacking.👺🤬 \n                                                            Clusho 2020🐒🇱🇷","userName":"clusho 2020","title":"👺✍🏼🍤🔫🧡"}}]}
