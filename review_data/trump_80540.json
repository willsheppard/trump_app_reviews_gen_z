But little did i know that was a bad idea. So it was around 4:45 pm when i downloaded this and then it asked me for my information (which i found kinda personal). But I thought nothing of the such after i thought about our loving Cheeto Puff. After I put my information in i started getting all these text asking for toe and hair line pics. I found that extremely weird of the such and kept saying wrong number and blocking them 😌. But after a few days passed by i then got an email by an unknown sender, and so I clicked on it. but when I clicked on it it asked me for toe nail clippings🤔. I found that really weird and then I decided to chill and watch some Netflix. But I kept seeing these figures over and over again, I thought it was just my imagination. But then I swear I heard something whisper behind my ear saying “are you lost baby gorl”. At that moment I started freaking out and looked around shaking. But I then went to the kitchen to make me some pizza rolls, after I heated them up I went back to my room and heard something in my closet. so I went and opened it and saw the teletubies in a circle saying “ooga shacka” repeatedly over a doll that looked like me. So I ran and got my phone and deleted the app and then boom they disappeared and I haven’t seen them since 😶. So I figure they were some of the Cheetos puff minions coming to get me 🤬","rating":1,"userName":"🧚\u200D♀️✨ tehe 🧚\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6176600776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do Not Get The App!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:59:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app wants to take private information","rating":1,"userName":"avecov"}},{"id":"6176576704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m done","date":"2020-07-09T12:52:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Honestly I’m just here to get rid of this app","rating":1,"userName":"Games hhhhh"}},{"id":"6176574536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:58Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hate the app terrible quality 🤮","rating":1,"userName":"😠😡🤬😢😳😡😓"}}]}
