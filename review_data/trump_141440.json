I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.","rating":1,"title":"full of racist, white supremacist, and ignorant content"}},{"id":"6179423730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:25:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"i like daisies","review":"i love america but this app gave me so many viruses!! my whole phone crashed im so sad :((","rating":1,"title":":("}}]}
