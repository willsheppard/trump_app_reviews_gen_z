Why is there a double crunchwrap supreme with cheeto dust on top starring at the two people in the audience but waving like he’s starring at two million. I experienced extreme physical and emotional trauma from viewing this double wide crunch wrap supreme that is so sweaty it seems like he was dumped in a vat of cooking grease.

It tracks where you live and sends strangers to your house to bother you about Trump. I rarely download apps and i am very disappointed on how this app operates. A rat can develop a better app than this crap. Anyways, I wish i can rate this 0 stars, but i have to rate it 1 star. And i feel as if this 1 star is too nice."}},{"id":"6174386071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GiveMyAlienBack","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"#R.I.PKELPYG","date":"2020-07-09T01:05:57Z","review":"This app caused me physical pain.

Now random pop up ads will show up on my home screen. I would never recommend this app to someone.m, maybe my enemy. But yeah, my eyes didn’t enjoy seeing a Cheeto so many times.
