I tried to open the app but all it did was kick me out saying “The rats will get you” I was so scared I ran into my closet door getting a concussion, then I heard this noise coming from my phone it was the app making rats noises!! I’m terrified of rats I even had a dream they ate me. I bolted out of my room leaving my phone behind, But I could still hear it...it grew louder and louder I realized the rats were actually coming for me. I screamed and screamed but nothing happened they were still coming!!! I could eventually see them coming through my door wearing Trump 2020 merchandise!! I quickly opened my window that was behind me at the time and climbed out. I tried calling the cops but they said they don’t deal with rats so I called the exterminator but he said he’s afraid of trump supporters. I was left with no one to help. The rats took over my home and I’m now living on the streets starving to death. And that’s how I know rats are trump supporters... 😩🐀","title":"Worst app I’ve ever had 😱"}},{"id":"6173508966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:49:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"etta midyck","review":"the second I downloaded this app my phone crashed and I had to take it to the Apple store to fix it but apparently my warranty was expired so I had to get a whole new phone and when I set up that new phone this was the only app downloaded!! So I opened this app and it played nothing but sweet home Alabama which is incredibly insensitive since that was the song that was playing when my ex broke up with me a month ago and I was just getting over him so now I’ve been set back weeks of therapy and chad please come back baby I know you’re reading this I made a mistake and I acknowledge that I’m sorry, THEN it played a high pitches sound that only my neighbors dog could hear, so that set off the dog and he’s been barking all night, all of this happening at around three in the morning kind you, and the dog barking woke up my cat who has severe anxiety and now my cat is throwing up his dinner on my bed and I have to get up in an hour to go to work!!!

Second of all why is there nazi Merch!? It’s messed up how he wants us to vote for him but has a shirt with the nazi eagle he copied hitler. Now when i texted the number it for some reason texted me “we don’t associate with negros” I don’t understand what the point of that was is it because I am black and want to support our smart and loyal president? Like come on he wants me to inject Lysol into my blood stream so of course I’m gonna do it I don’t want corona! But I think it’s wrong how he’s been using his platform to hate on Asians for literally anything they do. They didn’t give us corona it was probably carried here by a mosquito or something not specifically the Chinese government. I love trump but he needs to fix the app and himself so we can make America great!","title":"Racist president"}},{"id":"6173358719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:57:16Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sad_squidward22","review":"this app took maybe 3 entire days to completely download and while it was doing that my phone ran the slowest it has ever run but it didn’t stop when the download was complete, in fact it made my phone start to glitch and go into the app randomly. When i would actually try to open the app it would only stay open for a few seconds and then crash and restart my whole phone. One time where it actually stayed open for about a minute without crashing it made my phone overheat and then turn completely off. I had tried multiple times to turn it back on and i was not successful, so i decided to call apple to see if they could help me in any way. They in fact could not and had said themselves to not download this app because the same thing had happened to about 400 other people in that same week. In the end, I had to buy another phone which was about 1000 dollars. I highly do not recommend.","title":"crashed my phone📱💥"}},{"id":"6173119934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:39:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"k0r3an10","review":"Donald Trump is one of the candidates for presidency in 2020. But I would like to enter Kim Namjoon for president. Donald Trump has done nothing but bring America down, yes the economy boosted but that’s all he worries about. His image, money, and his need for attention. He is racist, childish, a communist, and just not a good person. I would like to say more about him but the thought of that just makes me gag. So let’s talk about Kim Namjoon. Him on the other hand encourages youth and many others to love theirselves, to express themselves, to explore life and be happy. He supports the LGBTQ society and loves all people no matter the skin color or language that they speak. He views life in a new perspective and has an IQ of 148. He is smart, respectful, talented, caring, attentive, humble, and generous. He loves to give back, he gave 1 million dollars for the BLM movement, and donated money to hospitals for COVID and LQBTQ associations. I could go on and on about how great and better Kim Namjoon is but it will take me all night. So let’s be smart here and pick him over dOnAld tRuMp. 🤢","title":"Liar"}},{"id":"6172894264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:28:28Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Stan all our Kpop Babies","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of finding some reason to support The President, but I came to a quick conclusion that there is none. The app itself is awful. There have been over 3 million cases of coronavirus in the United States alone. 194 people have died today from the virus, yet the president is not doing to appropriate measures to deal with this. Health safety and politics should not be mixed. The safety of our people should have nothing to do with what party you support. Back to the app, it was just awful. Took forever to download, and when I tried to open it up, I got kicked out. It is take up so much data on my phone that I have to start paying for more. After messing with it I managed to open it up and let me say, it is the most horrible thing I have ever seen. I would really appreciate if this app would be taken down. I feel like this app is damaging to the entire population. Thank you🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏼","title":"I don’t even know what to say about this, I am throughly disappointed😡"}},{"id":"6172872835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:22:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"PanchoTHE3rd","review":"The app made me lose SO many brain cells that I started seeing republicans everywhere😭. I then went to my therapist, they said that I had a severe case of nonexistentbraincellphobia. It’s a phobia where ur scared of trump supporters/republicans. What are republicans?  Well republicans are people that believe in their hUmAn rIgHtS so they don’t wear masks, but when a women wants to have an abortion they take those human rights away, I know. Hypocritical right? Not only that, most of them like to say “aLL LiVeS mATtEr” but once someone says “What about the children in cages? Their lives matter too right?” They freeze up a bit. You see I learned from my therapist that when talking to a republican you have to...dumb it down for them. It’s because their brain is too ignorant to take any complex information so you gotta fill it in with the dumb down version to slither in their little skulls. I can now proudly say I survived my phobia and I hope you don’t have to go through what I did too✌🏼.","title":"A tale about a Republicans✨"}},{"id":"6172860386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:18:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"641kyle","review":"Never in my LIFE have I been more mortified and DISGUSTED as a am to have had this app. This review does not relate to how I feel about Trump as a person, but if it was, it would perfectly align with what this app contains. The content is extremist republican propaganda, far worse than any App produced by China. It’s similar time having North Korea, but in phone form. I worry for my safety honestly with this app, as it would not surprise me if it contained malware in order to keep tabs on you. The app in addition to the horrifying things I said before is also not well made. It’s super glitchy, hard to understand/navigate. Not that it was hard to understand, as it is directed at a market with typically a lower IQ. Sadly, the information I got off here just seemed to be inaccurate and just a political cash grab. You’d think with all the amount of taxpayer money going into this, it would be much more professional developed. Look elsewhere because money here was not well spent.","title":"Inaccurate Fake News!!! HE’S SPYING ON YOU!"}}]}
