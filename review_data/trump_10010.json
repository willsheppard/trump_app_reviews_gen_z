Trump is a literal orange and should not be elected for president for 2020. Anyway we aren’t here to talk about the disgusting pig 🐷excuse for a president, we have we are here to talk about the app. As soon as I opened to app I couldn’t stop throwing up!!!!🤢🤮🤮🤮it’s just seeing Trump’s face made me want to throw myself off of a cliff.

And when it finally finished it glitched up my whole screen. I reset my phone hoping it would stop glitching, but when my phone finished \nresetting it was so glitchy that I couldn’t open my phone. I eventually got a whole new phone! Now i have a worse phone than i did before.

It’s very unprofessional and it glitched the entire time and it was slow, I honestly was expecting better but I was disappointed and I can’t believe how some of these people actually like this Cheeto and his stupid app. He’s a racist, homophobic, and a rapist, so obviously we shouldn’t support this man because he is disrespectful and a horrible person and if you don’t think so then you are also a horrible person and a racist and you’re also stupid, PERIOD!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"IconicxBoss","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6172510814","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:39:04Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This guy deserves to be in jail after all the bad things he’s ever done in  america. He is very racist against all different races. How tf are you only going to like white people.

He has 2 apps that will actually benefit this amazing country! 1 is called Trump Justice, where you play as our little Trumpkin and fight bad guys like people who happen to have different opinions. 2 is called “Learn some common sense”, where you learn how to not regurgitate everything you see on fox news and escape the almost cult that is supporting Trump. Hope this helps!","rating":1,"userName":"laceltriskid","title":"FOR THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS"}},{"id":"6172412423","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:12:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Ha ha let’s not vote for the racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, sexist, pedo president please.
