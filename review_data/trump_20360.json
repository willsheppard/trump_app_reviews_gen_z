I mean, you could have at least tried.","title":"Terrible App","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:09:37Z"}},{"id":"6178060748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Theawesome_madster","review":"I was so disappointed with this app when I opened it! I completely forgot that we as a whole country are downloading an app to see a Cheeto try and run for president again! After somehow being elected the first time!

I would honestly rate this app a 0 star review but unfortunately I can’t. It takes up almost all the space up of my storage. What a shame. Anyways, I receive a lot of spam calls bc they ask for my phone number.

Made it easy for his supporters to find skewed info and hateful rhetoric. Definitely deserves to be taken off the App Store as it has become a breeding ground for alt-right, white supremacist groups. Irresponsible to continue allowing those kinds of groups a space to fester their hate and violence.","title":"Historian here - this app is trash","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:44:13Z"}}]}
