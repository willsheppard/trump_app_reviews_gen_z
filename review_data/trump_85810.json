To say the least... I’m thoroughly disappointed and disgusted by what happened. First off, the app took ages to download - probably the reason why everybody who uses it is a boomer! I think I aged 5x quicker while waiting for this app to download. Also, when waiting, I had this strange urge to yell racial and homophobic slurs, along with sexist name calling like “dishwasher” and “maid”. So weird because I’m a girl! I also had this thought to pepper spray peaceful protesters just to get a photo with the Bible... but I’m not religious... so strange. When I finally downloaded it, i go to open the app and was not happy with what happened. I’m met with a disgusting, wrinkly, orange faced Cheeto. I could practically hear the racism through the screen. I was so scared... I thought I downloaded a boomer app, not The Conjuring. After I realized that I was in fact not playing 5 nights at Freddie’s (I actually thought trump was one of those robots - specifically the chicken) I go to sign up. I suspect that my phone couldn’t handle the homophobic vibes the app was giving off, so it started to overheat. I thought nothing of it until the heat that radiated off my phone caused my bed to catch on fire. I think it’s because of the white supremacy. You know how light (light is white just so uneducated people know) can be so strong that it can cause things to heat up. Yeah, well this is the same case. The thought of White supremacy causes many white people to not see what is really happening around them. They only see problems of white people and are blind to many racial issues around the world. White supremacy blinds people Kinda like light. Anyway, the white supremacy vibe was so strong that it created a fire. Eventually, the fire grew just like the amount of children that trump rapes everyday. Now I’m homeless. I do not recommend this app. I also heard that trump wants to ban tiktok...

The second i downloaded this app, loud sirens started blaring throughout my house. My lights even began flickering and turned to the color RED! After i sat on my bed in shock for about 30 seconds, i heard the screams of my family downstairs and knew i had made a grave mistake. I jumped up to see what was happening and as I rounded the corner at the bottom of the stairs I saw something with jaundiced, orange skin and a look of pure madness and peace on his face. I’ve never been more terrified in my life. I felt that if I stared into its eyes something unimaginably gruesome would happen to me. My whole family was laying flat on their stomachs on the ground who seemed to be humming a song I’d never heard before. As i looked up, tears soundlessly running down my face, I asked him the only question I could imagine asking. “What have you done?” I said, my voice shaking, not allowing me to sound brave like I wanted. It stared at me with cold, empty eyes and gravelly said, “Why wouldn’t I? You all have such a beautiful home and I would like to have it” \nIt was then I realized, that when evil decides to do what it does, it either has everything or nothing to lose. I believe everyone could agree that it’s not the latter. This means when this disgusting creature is torn apart for its crimes, there will hopefully be a moment where it feels the grief of everyone and everything that he is wronged. And, if if violence is not the thing that kills him, it will be his own mind that does."}},{"id":"6173695302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The worst 👎🏼","date":"2020-07-08T20:54:26Z","userName":"SHINee2020","review":"直感した all stop 君はきっと知ってる\n斬新なトリック読み解く 本当の鍵 始めようか mystery\nシャーロック気取って 追いつめてく oh\nIt's true? 些細なヒントも見逃さない\n狙っているんだろう? treasure in my mind\nIt's you? 不安そうなその目がたまらない\n隠さないでちゃんと 見せてごらん freeze!\n真実が明かされるまでは 後には引けないルール\nBlack or white\n火花散らす 何度だって\nOh I'm curious yeah 探してた ずっと君だけ yeah\nOh I'm so curious yeah, yeah, I'm so curious yeah\nHide-and-Seekしよう girl さあ応えて I'm in doubt ah\n企んでる気分はどう? girl ねえ聞かせて I'm in doubt\n逃げないで これからさお楽しみは\n分かるだろう?"}}]}
