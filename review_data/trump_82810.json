DO NOT get this app!","date":"2020-07-09T02:41:59Z","rating":1,"userName":"emaeahah","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174703546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😘✨💖","review":"This app is so bad it makes me want to throw my phone away🤮","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:02Z","rating":1,"userName":"😘✨💖","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174699573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"debby ryan","review":"🙈🐁😍🧿👨🏿\u200D🦳😪👺🙆😹😻🦃🤧\nsometimes... u just gotta$$$ GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀 GO🐀GO🐀👀👀 watch out 🙆🙆🧑\u200D🏫 im a teacher and u dont wanna mess with me👩\u200D🎤also a pop 💫 SO SHOOT FOR THE STARS LUV👨\u200D🌾","date":"2020-07-09T02:36:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"viennareil_","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174691736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NO DONT GET","review":"FIRST Zidane a orange RIP like what and they killed my dog and stole my money do not get LIKE WTH also did you know that oikawa has no 🎂 anyway IS RLLY BAD DO NOT GET","date":"2020-07-09T02:34:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"REEEE IT GOOD","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174680055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do NOT get this app","review":"There are so many things wrong with this app istg😤","date":"2020-07-09T02:31:01Z","rating":1,"userName":"Pandabritgal","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174660170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!!!","review":"The absolute worst app I’ve ever downloaded","date":"2020-07-09T02:25:15Z","rating":1,"userName":"luv🍒","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174653656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GARBAGE","review":"I download the app and my chicken nuggets got cold from this trash of an app and my soda got warm and it’s very laggy TRASH","date":"2020-07-09T02:23:24Z","rating":1,"userName":"JrnSpooky","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174650719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible!","review":"just horrible.","date":"2020-07-09T02:22:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"allyson.p","isEdited":false}}]}
