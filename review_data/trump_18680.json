And everything was glitching. ALL my freaking information was STOLEN. AND the app was very unorganized, all over the place. Also my friends whose black downloaded the same app and the same thing happened to her. She emailed the app creators and they wouldn’t help her get back her information because of her skin color. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

I downloaded this app so that I could see what our “non fascist, non homophobic, non racist, and non misogynistic” president had to offer as an app. But it took YEARS to download and set a virus on my phone the minute I opened it. I later got a text message stating that if I wanted to keep me and my family in this country I would have to vote for trump 2020. I deleted the app IMMEDIATELY"}},{"id":"6176289152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:32:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Nasty","userName":"Dream2020","review":"Worse app I have ever downloaded in my life.
