It took days for it to actually download and when it finally did it wasn’t even in English, everything was in Russian. I tried to change the language but no luck! It wouldn’t allow me to take my location off sharing and I am pretty sure it is sharing my location and gathering data on me!","rating":1}},{"id":"6178342478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:42:55Z","userName":"squashgirl123","title":"Disappointed beware","review":"I downloaded this app with hopeful wishes but to my dismay this app was not what I expected it to be. Firstly my phone turns off whenever I open the     app and I have the newest iPhone, so it’s not my phones problem. Secondly I noticed that my voice thing is on when trying to access the app, I fear my phone is being tapped into and I am being listened to. I don’t suggest you download this app, beware.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178255837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:10:52Z","userName":"justiss g","title":"crap","review":"i downloaded this app to support our 🍊✨president✨🍊 but then all of a sudden i heard noises coming from my closet. i didn’t think much about it until i opened the app. i started to get a headache and next thing i knew i woke up on my floor. everything around me was trump related. i also wanted to rip apart families who are trying to make a living, and i wanted to hurt and kill innocent ppl because of their skin color, and stop children from being adopted to same sex couples. with the little common sense i had left in my brain, i finally was able to delete the app, and have everything back to normal. i’m finally back to a human being, i highly do not recommend this app if you’re human","rating":1}},{"id":"6178219005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:57:38Z","userName":"ilovesummer🌞","title":"difficult to use and understand","review":"The app downloaded fine and all, but the UI is horrible! Since Trump’s demographic is mostly older people, they are definitely not going to be able to use this absolutely abysmal app! It’s so difficult to see his election points and I believe that this app is pointless because the whole point is to show us why to elect him. If anything, it just makes me angry at him.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178209122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:54:09Z","userName":"_jupes","title":"gross","review":"yeah it’s good but that’s what happened last year i is a a little too long and a a lot of time and time to time and time but you gotta was the day i i is the day we get home and we can y’all do anything we want to talk about it and i just don’t wanna call now you know how to get my back on there anything i was a a way to get better i is that one day you get a a lot of people to you and i was a good night you had a a little hard time bruh bruh was fun but you too have fun and i is a fun game to play you can get it and it’s you too bruh was it fun to get it to get your stuff and you don’t know it but you don’t want anything else to do it bruh is it like you know it’s nothing gonna it was","rating":1}},{"id":"6178171759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:41:08Z","userName":"Icey.Aiya","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This app failed to accommodate my needs and the precision I needed to u see the ✨greatest president donald trump ✨🍊 as we all know he will be competitions in this years election and I would dearly love to understand his campaign strategy however this app does not want to work its slow and freezes every 10 second I open it. How incredibly sad tht our ✨Senior Pres✨ would fail accommodate us with the news we need so sad","rating":1}},{"id":"6178171318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:40:58Z","userName":"😌 eye out for selener 👁","title":"No ❤️","review":"I decided to download this app in order to try and see from the trumpets point of view, but as I thought, nothing but Idiocy came out of this experience. The app was not helpful, and when my dog saw it she devolved into a chipmunk. I do not recommend this unless you yearn to lose brain cells, or identify as a Karen. App making is not for everyone 🌸🥰🧚😌 especially not trump supporters. Stop it and enter yourselves into a mental hospital for all of our sakes.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178156586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:35:53Z","userName":"🏔baguette boy 🏔","title":"absolutely awful","review":"Once I downloaded this app I instantly wanted to delete it. I normally don’t leave reviews on apps but this one was simply AWFUL and I need others who really want to see this to understand how terrible It is. The app was extremely slow and it supported a racist, sexist, homophobe. Is this what we want for our country? Not only does it support a racist but it was just laggy and unclear. Absolutely terrible. - sincerely, me.","rating":1}},{"id":"6178149783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:33:34Z","userName":"DazzleBerry GoGoGirl","title":"Absolutely Disgraceful","review":"If I could give this app 0 stars I would. As soon as I downloaded the app, it started crashing, my phone would freeze every few seconds, and at one point I had to completely take apart my phone to replace the battery because this app overheated it. I fully supported President Trump and his racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic, disgusting ideals and policies but now I am going to have to change my vote. Biden 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸","rating":1}}]}
