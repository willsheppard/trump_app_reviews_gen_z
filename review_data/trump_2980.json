However, once the app finished downloading to my phone I heard my baby screaming from the other roommate. Of course being the loving pet mother I am, ran towards my screeching baby, only to discover that my poor child-dragon has mysteriously set on fire. I had my phone in my hand while approaching them and still had the app open, mind you. That poor baby kept running from me until I closed the app and deleted it, right before writing a strong reviews on how toxic this app is to dragons. These developers need to fix this weird bug because we both live in fear of this app and the capabilities of it!","title":"My pet dragon mysteriously set on fire","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"startoratetoreview123"}},{"id":"6173071885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:23:41Z","review":"i just wanted to get this app to support our LOVELY president 😻 but i opened the app AND- AND THERE WAS A JUMP SCARE  WHEN I OPENED THE APPLICATION 🙀 IT WAS SO SCARY!

When I pick some of them up I either hear some sort of Ukrainian or Russian or what sounds like an a East Asian language. I don’t know why my info is getting sold to untrustworthy people or companies but it quite frankly scared me. I decided to uninstall the app because I really don’t want people who could be dangerous to know my information and keep digging for more. For me this app was a giant scam that sold some of my private information to unreliable, uncredible, and dangerous sources...I don’t recommend.","title":"Sold personal information","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Abe Jameson"}},{"id":"6172558749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:36Z","review":"I’m going to be honest, it’s just a waste of storage space. If I need to see any news about the president or what he’s doing as of right now, I can just look it up. I don’t really see why there needs to be a separate app just for this specific type of news. I don’t like it because when I want to learn what’s going on in the world I can’t see everything and only news about trump. Since I look at a different resource before looking at this app, most of the information reoccurs and I don’t even have a use for it. Now that I think about it, it just seems like an extra hassle. Also it makes my phone act extremely slow and always glitches me out of the app. Hope this helped someone.","title":"Waste of time","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"saMMY-1028"}},{"id":"6171790127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T11:11:05Z","review":"I thought this was app where I could spread love for cheese and Cheetos, but as soon as I logged on is said Chile…anyways no❤️. Later I found it was for life size Cheeto named Donald trump. I hate this man so much. I don’t know how he’s our president I’m appalled by the fact he told people to inject themselves with lysol. I am disgusted by the fact he would a call serious pandemic the Chinese virus. He’s a fascist and white supremacists. And all I have to say is dumb trump 2020 ( ◠‿◠ ).\n\nI later found out the he has kids……… I. Who would reproduce with that I mean I hope Barron is better than his dad. Donald drinks his water the same way his mind works like a baby. And then he calls people names like sleepy joe what is he 5. Chile anyways in conclusion don’t instal this app","title":"Ummmm chile no❤️ 🧚🏾🦄🔥gross 🌸⚡️🍄","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ok spp"}},{"id":"6177855619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:57:16Z","review":"If I could give this app 0 stars, I WOULD!!! It doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to, the “features” of it are glitchy as all hell, not to mention how incredibly slow the app functions. Every time I open the app it crashes, whether it be immediately or a few minutes into browsing the app. But the worse part of this app is it keeps displaying lewd photos of an orange cryptid getting a spray tan!! All I want to do is to simply browse the app, not be exposed to a most horrid baby brine shrimp! Whoever made this app should not only be ashamed of themselves, but should be fired. You can clearly tell this app was made by the alt right conservatives because it is completely devoid of sense and intelligence just like them!","title":"Awful!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Madi b."}},{"id":"6177778751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:34:22Z","review":"I downloaded this app, which took a while, but when I opened it it asked for my private personal information so as most people should do, I went to the terms and service and the privacy policy. While I was there, my phone kept crashing which makes it seem like either the app is sucky and can’t function properly or the homophobic, transphobic, and racist rapist running it is trying to hide something from us. I was able to get so far as to read that the app has the right to share your info with any third party service without listing or linking any of the services used, which means once our info is shared with those companies, we have no idea what they are doing with it.","title":"Eww","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"chimichongaaaaaaaaa"}},{"id":"6177778296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:34:14Z","review":"this is bad so trump wants to delete us(tik tok) silence us so now we hit back don’t mess with gen z we can destroy the world or save it. Gen z is one of the most powerful generations. He’s banning tik tok cause we have an opinion and we don’t like him but when he opinions like raping woman and being racist that’s fine right. He’s so childish this is like taking candy from a baby what a child he can’t stand the fact that ppl don’t like him and he wants to take away what some can’t live without cause ppl don’t like him. Ppl go on tik tok and are at there lowest and millions of strangers comment and stand by them and then it gets better for them and now he takes that away I wish the worst for that man","title":"i hope trump falls in a hole gets eaten alive😽😻🙈","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ok leave me alone now pls"}},{"id":"6177600225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:38:54Z","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app it said it I had to give my number 😥 but I did because because we LOVE 💕our frumpiest trumpie wumpy.
