My husband got it and he is unable to Whip OR Nae Nae. Don’t even get me started on the fact that it makes my phone call Little Caesar’s and ask for the phone number of Pizza Hut. THE EMBARRASSMENT. Not to mention When I open it it changed my lock screen to Donald Trump in a Nicki Minaj outfit including a Pink Wig. I am astonished. I WILL NOT STAND BY AN APP THAT CAUSES THIS EMBARRASSMENT FOR OUR BELOVED PRESIDENT.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app of our generation","rating":1,"userName":"Ok but short","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:18Z"}},{"id":"6174789857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first, this app fed asparagus to my dog, causing it to turn into a venomous snake that attacked my wife and children while I was out at a 100 gecs concert. I returned home to find them screaming in agony as this app literally consumed them alive. even though there isn’t a 0 star option, this app gets the 1 star I’m giving it because my family didn’t like 100 gecs. now the world is a tiny percent cooler😎😋","isEdited":false,"title":"this app ate my wife and children","rating":1,"userName":"Wradzin","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:16Z"}},{"id":"6174759608","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app will give you ligma! So I went to sleep to see my pet blanket went to the store and came back with a cardboard cutout of trump and I, of course, jumped out of bed to punish my pet blanket for doing this to me! After that I went to get some food and i wondered why chick-fil-a was open on a Sunday but, I wasn’t complaining so I went to get food and that same cardboard cutout of trump was the employee. In conclusion, don’t ever get this app!","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App!","rating":1,"userName":"Kale Salad Is Good","date":"2020-07-09T02:55:00Z"}},{"id":"6174756522","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is very slow and very glitchy. Not only did the app run slowly, but it also made my phone run slower as well. The app crashes constantly, and I can’t go 3 minutes without a notification popping up. It also repeats notifications all the time and won’t let me clear them. It drained my phone battery quicker than trump could drain the swamp. Terrible!","isEdited":false,"title":"So glitchy!","rating":1,"userName":"NChannah","date":"2020-07-09T02:54:04Z"}},{"id":"6174718167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app told me I was adopted.

The second I downloaded this app all of my fingernails fell off and I had painful explosive poo that continued for hours. I DONT recommend this for anyone. I’m shocked our president would make an app that would put anyone in so much pain and embarrassment. If you have this, delete it. The poo explosions come later for some so if you plan on keeping this app, be prepared to clean.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","rating":1,"userName":"review1108","date":"2020-07-09T02:40:57Z"}},{"id":"6174711852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I crashed like 10 times😤😤and when I did get in, made my whole device glitch😡🤬🤬and it made my device get so many bugs.😤😤 Absolutely waste of my time.😡🤬🤢 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PIECE OF DISGUSTING DOODOO💩🤮🤬.

I had to take a refreshing sip of the Diet Dr. Pepper that I had saved up for when I woke up from my afternoon slumber. Immediately I fell into a deep depression.
