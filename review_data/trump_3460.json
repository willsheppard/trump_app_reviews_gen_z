Until now. This animated series features Sofia, an ordinary girl who becomes a princess overnight when her mom marries the king. The adventurous young girl, first introduced in the 2012 TV movie \"Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess,\" must learn how to adjust to royal life. Offering Sofia words of wisdom are classic princesses -- including Ariel, Belle and Jasmine -- who make special appearances as they help advise the youngster during her transition to royalty. Throughout her journey, Sofia learns that it isn't having a title that imparts royal demeanor; it's that having the characteristics of honesty, loyalty, compassion and grace make one worthy of the role.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:31:44Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174798116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lynetteeee","title":"DON'T DOWNLOAD","review":"as soon as i opened the app, an automated voice began screaming slurs and even threatened me! i thought i was just a glitch, so after it finally went away (it took about 3 hours, and i didn't have access to any other parts of my phone during it) i carried on with the app. then, as i was entering my mobile phone number, my device exploded in my hands!! i have third degree burns all over my face. i decided to go the store, buy a phone and download it again. when i finally entered in my number, i IMMEDIATELY got thousands of messages from pedophiles and psychopaths. when vans started pulling up to my house, i decided enough was enough and moved to canada. don't download this app!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:06:47Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174592725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AvocadoEnthusiast","title":"BAD APP KEEPS CRASHING","review":"this app keeps crashing and has stolen my data! a hack keeps popping up that’s obviously not part of the app. in an unrelated note, when i downloaded the app, a wrinkled orange man with a questionable hair style and color appeared. he said to keep america great by downloading an app! silly boy! downloading an app does nothing to help the state of our nation! \nin the wise words of D.W. Read: “I gave you half a star. One star is usually the lowest you can get, but I made an exception.” Unfortunately and unforgivingly, I cannot rate this app lower than one star, although it deserves it. terrible app, keeps crashing, hacked with bugs, and is super slow. oh yeah! and he’s a president- NOT kim k with her fashion game app, nice try tho!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:08Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174583048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"asteroid.staar","title":"T e r r i b l e 😕😡🤬","review":"I was excited to be able to use the app, but for some reasons, the moment I open the app, my screen died unexpectedly. I thought it was a series glitch but when I opened it again, my phone vibrated with such intensity that the entire building I’m in felt it. My phone started spewing random nonsense like “orange 2020” and “support cheetos”. It is ridiculous. It didn’t stop there either, not only did my phone became completely orange, it keeps attacking my family members and I, including many others, whenever we try to touch it. I do not appreciate this terrible excuse of an app. I would have rate it 0 if I can. I can not believe I was excited to use such a monstrosity.
