They were talking about spray tans and telling me to dye my hair blonde? I’m a brunette and I don’t tan, I think whatever was whispering in my ears is connected to this app. 😬. There were also a multitude of other problems like blood leaking out of my walls and I started waking up with cuts on my arm that said things like “I’m cumming for you” and “nobody can help you now” and there was even a drawing of a croissant 🥐 that looked like a 5 year old drew it, next to it it said “do you want it babygirl, cause I want to stick it in you realll bad” and I can only assume that the demon was saying he wanted to feed me the croissant? I take extreme offense to this because I have a wheat allergy 🍞❌. Also the other day my cat was sitting at the foot of my bed and she looked at me with this absent look in her eyes and her head twisted to where it was upside down (kinda like an owl) and I could hear her neck cracking as it happened and then when I was horrified and crying, this reddish black tar started leaking out of all of her facial orifices and she said something that I couldn’t quite understand in this deep gravelly voice, it almost sounded like she was speaking words backwards and then she said “send nudes you wh***” and then her head twisted back around and the tar was gone and everything went back to normal. I didn’t think this was normal, considering my cat doesn’t speak English, she can only speak French and German. Also I’m a minor, this demon thing is insane! After that I undownloaded the app and everything went back to normal.\n\nIn short, DONT LISTEN TO THIS APPS FAKE PROMISES!!! I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING GET TO GO TO THE WH AND MEET BARRON BUT INSTEAD THIS SCARY STUFF STARTED HAPPENING!!!"}},{"id":"6177966638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:33:08Z","rating":1,"title":"Woah","userName":"Perfect 029383!39:'","review":"Bro.
