I first opened it and when I was eating my lasagna alone in my bathroom but then it started asking me questions and I had a mini heart attack ❤️ so I started speaking gibberish and next moment I know I was there with trump drinking cocktails 🍹 in my expensive golf resort. It was so so so much fun and while I was there I got the best service and got to treat everybody like my slaves ✌️🥺 but sadly I woke up and realized it was all a dream. I HATE THIS APP!!!!!! How could it give me such big HOPES!!!! Ugh 😩","isEdited":false,"title":"Fake information"}},{"id":"6179421841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:25:07Z","rating":1,"userName":"lalaaa5","review":"just terrible","isEdited":false,"title":"terrible"}},{"id":"6179421805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:25:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"tiny._satan","review":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"😗"}},{"id":"6179421763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:25:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"freckleface092","review":"It took all of my personal information when I opened it and it took forever to download.","isEdited":false,"title":"Why"}},{"id":"6179421697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:25:04Z","rating":1,"userName":"jojosiwasponytail","review":"Ever since I downloaded this app I've been having odd things happen.

It must have a virus or something as it destroyed my phone!  It took forever to download and when it finally did, I went to open it and I just couldn’t understand what it was trying to do!
