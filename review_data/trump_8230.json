I am proud to be a new Cheeto boy and support all endangered daddy Cheetos. I praise this app to not go to get milk as I will do it. We will go fishing tomorrow and hopefully he has 2020 vision to see all the beautiful fish.\nThe only problem is the fact that he is a Cheeto with no arms so giving him a rod will be a problem. The water will turn him into Cheeto dust and we will mourn his death while eating some flamin hot munchies and hold up my orange Cheeto 2020 sign.","userName":"Jay Ghhghggg","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is my new dad"}},{"id":"6174497430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because Mr. President Trump promised that there would be some very exclusive, special pictures of him on there. I looked for hours and could not find any. When the President of this great country promises something like that, he should deliver! My opinion has changed about him since downloading this app! I used to worship the ground he walked on but now I see that he is a CON MAN!!! \nWith that being said, I am still in the market for any *special* pictures of him and would like to find some ASAP!!!","userName":"Cristina81612","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:39:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"CON MAN!!!"}},{"id":"6174496472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m repulsed 👁👄👁 i open the app and see this big fat racist fake tanned nasty smelling fat beach y’all call a president and no ❤️.

My very existence was so disturbed by the sheer nakedness of Mr. Trump that not only did my cell phone begin to glitch, but my entire house lost power. It was been approximately 16 hours since this certain power outage and I fear that I am in grave danger of starvation and dehydration... not to mention my phone’s about to die. Please do not under any circumstances download this app, it is offensive, homophobic, racist and just plain ugly.","userName":"Kenna88899980","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🚫🚫🚫 offensive 🚫🚫🚫"}},{"id":"6174389414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i woke up on a normal wednesday morning in my garage, to see the trump app pop up in the app store. i decided to download it to se what it was all about, and what appeared on my screen as i opened the app was a big and sweaty disgusting water bear. how awful! i got out of the garage to make myself a cup of boiled orange juice. i seen something in the corner of my eye, and when i turned around, a huge striped dog was infront of me! how horrifying! so i ran out of my bathroom, and flew my pet giraffe to auto zone. when i got into auto zone, everyone was dressed up in baby bumblebee costumes, so i stormed out of there, only to find bob saget in front of me. he tried to talk to me about the trump app, which was absolutely ridiculous, so i drove my tv back to my garage, and deleted the trump app off of my phone. horrible app!","userName":"Aunnalou","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:06:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is horrible!"}}]}
