I genuinely wanted to know what Donald trump was doing for 2020, and I was thoroughly disappointed in the app. All of the features hardly work, and it’s the bare minimum of an app. It also continuously makes my phone crash no matter what I do about it."}},{"id":"6177784030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vickilolol","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"terrible","date":"2020-07-09T18:35:59Z","review":"i got the app to see how it was and it was ✨terrible✨ this app is useless because who would want to support this cheeto puff🧡. all i have to say is, u dropped this 🔴now put it back on ur nose 🤡✨😍. \n- I spoke to the queen of the tré🌿🌳she said no thank you but good try🦋✨🌈🥰💓\n- You go girl!🧚✨ no like seriously leave🦋\n-You can do anything you put your mind to ✨🧚♀️💞 just not this 💖🍃⭐️\n-nobody is perfect✨😋especially not u❤️🍊\n-the important thing is that u tried🌸🦋✨dont try it again❤️😍\nok thats all i have to say..mwah😚😚"}},{"id":"6177706130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jackotil","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"✨ creepy and no privacy ✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:12:32Z","review":"i HATE gen z suddenly giving really bad reviews but hear me out- this app took FOREVER to download!!!!!!! and then before i even OPENED it, it was already sending me notifications?????? it was al very, very creepy so i HAD to delete it!!!!!!! my privacy is everything!!!!!"}},{"id":"6177699659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"julie_jean_simon","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I thought it gave me free Cheetos","date":"2020-07-09T18:10:34Z","review":"I got this app thinking I was gonna get some free Cheetos. Turns out it was this horrible looking oompa looking thing. What I seen when I first opened the app was hideous. I’ve seen nothing like it before.
