Because I got to see my orange daddy😍. But then I realized that I couldn’t contact my hot daddy😔. I thought that on this app I could maybe contact him and show him all my love, but then I found out I couldn’t😡and that makes me very very angry. I also have just recently found out that daddy Donald is taking away my TikTok 🤬😖🤯, and I don’t think that’s fair Donald😤.

I knew in that moment that he WAS a child because that’s the only rational way to explain his childish behavior, with that in mind I remembered that his nudes where leaked and that child pornography . SO TO SAVE THIS CHILD WE MUST DELETE THE APP AND FREE HIM FROM THESE SEX TRAFFICKERS SAVE BABY TRUMP 2020 ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","isEdited":false,"title":"Save the child 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"tiktok😳💖🍊✨🧚\u200D♀️💕🧚🏽\u200D♂️🙈"}},{"id":"6177819956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When i first downloaded the app everything was fine. Then out of no where my phone crashes and is unable to turn back on. I had to go get it checked out and the guy at t-mobile said i had gotten a virus from a recent app. I would have to tie the two together because duh. I had to download the app on my new phone so i could leave this review. I will never forget.

I really do love and support trump but this app is trash. It’s completely stupid why did he make this and what was his reason because all we need is the news to see what trump is doing. He is an amazing president but I hate this app it’s making my phone slow and I have an iPhone 11 Pro!! So I really think that the App Store should delete this dang app!","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:47Z","rating":1,"userName":"ryryspucer08"}},{"id":"6177733787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a Trump supporter, I wanted to see what his plans were for the upcoming 2020 election. I downloaded it which actually took around 9 hours, just for it to lag and crash my phone every time I try to open it. In all seriousness, it needs a major update or to be deleted from the app store. My phone is still lagging and making my other apps slow and lag. I would give 0 stars if I could. Seriously disappointed. 👎","isEdited":false,"title":"WILL CRASH YOUR DEVICE","date":"2020-07-09T18:20:48Z","rating":1,"userName":"Benjamen Doevur"}},{"id":"6177703827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and I saw a Cheeto. Why is a CHEETO running for president???? I mean it’s a crusty dusty little Cheeto. I don’t know why anyone would vote for that. And after I closed the app the night I got it I had a dream that mr. Cheeto man came to my house and I was locked in a room with him. I grabbed some random bat in the corner. (There were both kinds) I gave him corona and decided not to beat him up. I don’t know why tho. When I woke and realized it was a dream I screamed. Anyways I hate this app so much.","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚\u200D♀️💕Cheeto for president?✨🧚\u200D♀️💕","date":"2020-07-09T18:11:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"CWBchlo"}},{"id":"6177687497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was trying de get into this app because yk make america great again🤧 but it won’t open or if it opens it take foreveeer to load and still kicks me out of the app. Not to mention it takes forever to download as well.

I downloaded this app because I was excited to see more of our Cheeto president however as soon as I opened it a terrible sound came out of my phone. My ears were ringing for hours after this and my dog was especially affected. My dog fell to the ground crying and I actually heard my dog speak to me right before she passed away. She said “beware the Cheeto”. This is for sure a sign from the universe. Everyone beware and protect your dogs.","isEdited":false,"title":"this app KILLED my dog!!","date":"2020-07-09T18:06:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"barnesfirminjuryattorneys"}},{"id":"6177665997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of keeping up with what’s going on but i did not get a single update nor did i get notifications and the worst part was seeing this BUFFOON of an ✨ORANGE✨ on my screen.
