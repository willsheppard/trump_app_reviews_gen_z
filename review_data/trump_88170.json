An entire app devoted to bunker boy? Yes please 🥰🤤. Nothing would make me happier than to get endless content of the Cheeto straight to my cellular device. Unfortunately, it turned out to be horrible. It took a total of 69 (😫💦) days to download. I had nothing else to do during that time obviously, so I just stared at a wall 👀 and chanted his name. I missed my brother’s sister’s aunt’s neighbor’s teacher’s cousin’s pastor’s dog’s funeral because of how long I waited 😞 A worthwhile sacrifice (I thought) when my phone screen finally lit up. Excitedly, I lunged for my phone, the pale glow illuminating my sunken eyes and sun deprived skin. Immediately upon looking at the screen, a strange feeling overcame me. I began itching and writhing, and my skin felt like it was moving on it’s own. I stumbled to the bathroom and turned on the light, only to start screaming. 👹 My skin was becoming more and more orange by the second, my stomach bloating into a massive beer belly, my hair retracting completely until I was completely bald (luckily I had my novelty Daddy Donald toupee which I put on later), and finally, my brain shrunk to the size of a small pea (to match the size of my micro penis which had just sprouted). I screamed in horror. I had become the thing I loved most. Suddenly, I feel rumbling started, softly at first, then louder. I thought it was an earthquake. After I few seconds, however, I realized it was a faint chanting that was growing ever closer. “One of us. One of us. One of us.” 🗣 I heard banging on the outside of the bathroom door. I locked the door and dove behind the shower curtain. The door didn’t hold. It broke in two and figures began approaching me, grasping at me. It took me a few seconds to realize, but it was an army of fellow Donalds. I had found my people. I let them take me to their secret base of operation underneath Trump’s golf course and we partied all night long. This app is not for you if you are scared of a good time 😉 Only gave 1/5 stars because I am now an ugly, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, psychopathic bigot. Love the app other than that though 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T16:24:03Z","title":"TREMENDOUSLY terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"eobmead"}}]}
