When I tried to pause it or delete it, nothing happened, the app has a mind of its own, not literally of course, but this is all a fraud! This is not like normal apps i don’t know why it did that but upon to use up all my time and my phones battery to finally download once I opened the app, it immediately asked for my number. I do not want to give my number to some random app I cannot even delete. Giving this app your phone number is letting the government track all your personal data! After I tried using a fake number to see what goes on in the app it sent it a verification code, which is even worse! I do no approve of the fact that it has to hack into our personal data. This app has been messing with my head for several days considering the fact that I can’t even delete it! Also I tried typing in the verification code to see what’s up, and to realize that you need a 10 digit code is ridiculous! I am furious! I finally decided to put in my number because I wanted to get into the app, one I entered the ridiculously long 10 digit code, the screen was black and it turned white all of a sudden and blinded me not being able to see for a solid 12 seconds, after I regained my vision, nothing happened. My phone started to lag and then immediately turned off when I tried leaving the app. I turned my phone back on and to my surprise, I had to enter my phone number and code again, when I realized it was the same code as before I decided to try this on my sisters phone, and it did the exact same thing! Well now we both have screwed up phones due to this issue. I do not suggest downloading this app! YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET RID OF IT!!!  \n                          Sincerely,\n                                 A very stressed and concerned politician.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:19:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do not dowload this app!!"}},{"id":"6176244540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anonymous 🥱🥱","review":"I wanted to support my amazing president by getting his app on my brand new phone❤️❤️. It took over 3 years to download. When it fully downloaded, I got a notification from Apple saying that this app was taking my information and was trying to hack my phone 😡. But I didn’t care, that’s where it went all wrong😳. The next day, I opened the app and on every TV Burnie Sanders was there 😖.He said that I was his “number one supporter” which is wrong🤬🤬. And when I yelled at the TV for saying that all the alarms in my house started going off🤯🤯. All of a sudden, the CIA busted down my door and tried to arrest me for war crimes 😱😱😱.Anyways, I explained what happened and they left🙄🙄🙄.
