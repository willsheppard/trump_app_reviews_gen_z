And then I go to the next screen to see the blob but this time it had a wig on that did no go to tint with its cheese like color. All I have to say is that this app has scarred me for life with this hideous blob thing and it’s freaking me out. But beside the point it is horrible and a waste of time where you could have spent walking your pet Caterpillar.
