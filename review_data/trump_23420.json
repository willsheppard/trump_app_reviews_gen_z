But was disappointed when finding no valid reasons. Trump is rasict,anti-LGBTQ+ and overall just a terrible person. I just don’t understand why anyone would want a president as awful as him. So please don’t download this app or support Trump. It’s just a waste of time.","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","userName":"HELP IVE MCFALLEN","date":"2020-07-08T15:22:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172616725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could I wouldn’t even rate it 1/5 stars. This is unacceptable. Right after I downloaded it, I got a notification if I want to accept into the military. I was trying to click no but it kept moving! And when I finally got to click it it’s turned into a yes!!??!? Am now rating this from the military.","title":"Worst app 👎🏽","userName":"*^~'•","date":"2020-07-08T15:08:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172591436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app doesn’t work I keep getting glitched out of it 😭.

I can not believe this orange Cheeto raped children and is racist! I also can’t believe the Cheeto said it would date it’s own daughter! I mean that’s disgusting this orange Cheeto should never run for president and it is the worst president of all time!

I really hope this app gets deleted. He doesn’t deserve to be president. In my opinion I think Obama should be president. Obama actually cares. Trump doesn’t care about anyone expect for himself. I really hope TikTok doesn’t get banned because of HIM. Can’t wait until Obama is president again! 😋","title":"This is awful.","userName":"Allie 😕","date":"2020-07-08T14:43:39Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172526797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app as a way to help my dear president trump in his re-election, but... it was absolute trash. I have never been so disappointed and appalled by an app. It doesn’t do anything whatsoever but send me a bunch of emails about trumps campaigns. WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO TO THOSE? I want to support our president from afar. But this app makes it impossible. NEVER USING IT AGAIN! DONT DOWNLOAD! 🍊🍊🍊","title":"No🧡","userName":"Cdanher","date":"2020-07-08T14:43:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172489167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was having a nice day wearing my black lives matter t-shirt when a maga supporter reminded me about being patriotic. So I decided to show support to the angry, racist Cheeto of a president✨🧚🏾 but the app started glitching out and white supremacist started showing up saying “all lives matter.” So this app has left me very disappointed","title":"Everyone’s favorite fascist🙈✨🧚🏾","userName":"Mary Trump","date":"2020-07-08T14:33:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172485708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Would never recommend, took wayyy to long to download even tho my internet is very good. Takes up too much space. It’s not informative on our president, the whole app is just supporting the orange which is honestly creepy and weird to be that obsessed with someone, anyways. Don’t download it, it’s very bad.","title":"worst app ever","userName":"hehe no ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T14:32:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172457311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Donald J. Trump is the most nastiest, rude, ignorant, arrogant president we’ve ever had he doesn’t deserve an app for himself. He should be taken down as soon as possible. He had, has, and will have the worst example for younger generations. He is homophobic, racist, and sexist. Is this the president you want to show to your children? Brothers, and sisters? Friends, and neighbors?","title":"Take Donald Trump down :)","userName":"step mom denice","date":"2020-07-08T14:24:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172442358","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Even though I want trump to die I downloaded this app. The first thing I did was text that number.
