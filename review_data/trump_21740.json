When you open the front page of the app multiple NSFW ads pop up.

It contains VERY inappropriate material that I would never want to see. It’s worse then the movie Love. Every time I click it I see something that has been harassing our country. Not to mention it took almost 10 HOURS to download. Why would the App Store allow this app. 💅itchin n burnin💞"}}]}
