I thought this app was to see a president, not an overcooked piece of burnt potato😬. Why would anyone decide to trick people into thinking this was a good app! All i can see on here is a big ugly cheeto head that belongs to the streets after all of the sex offending he has done in the past. Where is the real president! Now he is doing one of the worst things any person can possibly do in the entire history of Earth. TIK TOK IS BEING TAKEN DOWN!!!  While an angry creamsicle is melting in the whitehouse. I mean who would want to download an app where the main character was a screaming carrot demon.","title":"dumptrump2020 ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6174436624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bughead101","rating":1,"review":"So I installed the app because I was doing a project on America’s worst mistakes ever made and needed information, when I opens the app the app I saw some gross af photos, a rotten old burrito with his hairy chest hair, I wanted to kms because of all the gross things, I now have to go to my local eye doctor to replace my eye balls, also when I wrote my essay the SWAT team barged in my house took my paper and ripped it up after drinking all my choccy milk and leaving a big dump in my bathroom, I highly would not recommend using this app at all unless you want to see things while your going to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night crying because of a small chetto in between trumps legs, -10/10","title":"Gross, disrespectful, why waste your time on this app"}},{"id":"6174271563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:28:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼 this app","rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app and i saw this orange thing pop up on my screen🟠 and almost  immediately after my hair caught on fire🔥 so I ran outside and drenched myself with the hose💧 then noticed my shirt was see through and a group of people were walking by👉🏻👈🏻so I dropped to the ground and hit my head on the concrete and passed out I woke up in the hospital🚑 and out of boredom I opened my phone 📱\nand that same picture showed up and my hair caught on fire🔥 again so I jumped out of my hospital bed and tripped over wires and caught the room on fire🔥 and woke up once again in a hospital so now the hospital🚑 is suing me😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 so I 100 percent do not recommend this app🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼\nPs go to my Gofund me👍🏻","title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6174233548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:14:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"zr2931","rating":1,"review":"Okay, so I downloaded this app to increase my education on politics. I am HIGHLY disappointed in how this app works. It glitches as soon as you open it. It asked for my location and as soon as I clicked “allowed”, my special jar of children’s toenails went missing. Suspicious, right? Anyways, after I discovered that my children’s trimmed toenails went missing, I went grocery shopping. You won’t believe what I almost ran over on my way to Walmart! A freaking giant TOENAIL. It was attacking me and following me. Coincidence? I think not. It was this app for sure! It is cursed and I want it off of the App Store so it can’t curse anyone else. I have PTSD from this. I do not recommend this app to ANYONE. I am very dissatisfied with this apps work.","title":"Do NOT recommend!"}},{"id":"6174023616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:57:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"byslys marie sic sic sic","rating":1,"review":"I logged into the app just to find a disgusting picture of trump naked he looked like a dehydrated Cheeto and I was horrified at what I saw PEOPLE ALSO SEARCH FOR\nLyrics\nOn my pillow\nCan't get me tired\nSharing my fragile truth\nThat I still hope the door is open\n'Cause the window\nOpened one time with you and me\nNow my forever's falling down\nWondering if you'd want me now\nHow could I know\nOne day I'd wake up feeling more\nBut I had already reached the shore\nGuess we were ships in the night\nNight, night\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nWe were ships in the night, night, night\nI'm wondering\nAre you my best friend\nFeel's like a river's rushing through my mind\nI wanna ask you\nIf this is all just in my head\nMy heart is pounding tonight\nI wonder\nIf you\nAre too good to be true\nAnd would it be alright if I\nPulled you closer\nHow could I know\nOne day I'd wake up feeling more\nBut I had already reached the shore\nGuess we were ships in the night\nNight, night\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nHoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nWe were ships in the night\nNight, night: sweet night by taehyung","title":"Never downloading again ever!!!"}},{"id":"6174008793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:51:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dorime👽itze👽emoh👽","rating":1,"review":"First off, when I opened the app a horrific orange image was on there and I couldn’t tell if it was a naked orange fat Garfield type of cat or a big blob fish and it just DECEIVED MY EYES. I was SCREAMING AND RAPIDLY feel my eyes burning. I Had to Rush to the hospital where they told me I lost not just one BUT BOTH MY EYE SIGHTS. For everyone who has an IQ lower than a fifth grader I am using voice typing to warn other about this app. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. This kind of content should be BANNED. I don’t even know why this app is even running up if it causes pain to so many citizens. Now every time I close my eyes I can only visualize that DISTURBING DREADFUL image. Please be safe and not just take this app down for the safety of america but as well if whatever that orange THING was.","title":"EXPLICIT CONTENT"}},{"id":"6173962725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:34:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"zooiieee","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened this app it asked for my phone number, address, AND ssn. Good try Mr Trump but I am under age! 🤬 So anyways I said NOPE ✋🏼 and exited the app to find that all my other apps had been replaced with duplicates of this app 😲 I was in complete shock 😳 but I figured no biggy its an easy fix right? WRONG! I couldn’t delete the apps and second by second more and more popped up! So I decided to take a break from this mess and go get a snack 🍿but as soon as I left the room I found my whole family (except my little sister who was MISSING) dead ☠️ and written on the walls with blood was “Trump 2020” 😥 So just don’t get this app. It will break your phone, kill your family, and kidnap your little sister :(.
