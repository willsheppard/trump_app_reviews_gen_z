I was just trying to enjoy daddy trump when my sister walked in the room and started turning orange. I can’t believe my president would even let this happen and honestly I’m voting for Kanye now. She’s been acting so strange and saying things like “I tested negatively positive” she sounding more and more like him the more I talk to her, how in the world could you let this happen. I’m beyond disappointed. She even wore a tupae and added turmeric to her foundation to seem more orange. Plus she’s starting to crawl on the floor and I think she’s gonna croak. I don’t recommend this app to anyone who wants to support. It only leads to your loved ones dying. ✨🌸🧚🏼\u200D♀️♥️"}},{"id":"6179385586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST","userName":"uzerñajsodjdkue","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:12:37Z","rating":1,"review":"👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"}},{"id":"6179385486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Orange Troll","userName":"mexsand","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:12:35Z","rating":1,"review":"Oh yea\nCome on\nYou get the limo out front\nHottest styles, every shoe, every color\nYea when your famous it can be kinda fun\nIt's really you but no one ever discovers\nIn some ways you're just like all your friends\nBut on stage you're a star\nYou get the best of both worlds\nChillin' out, take it slow\nThen you rock out the show\nYou get the best of both worlds\nMix it all together and you know that\nIt's the best of both worlds\nThe best of both worlds\nYou go the movie premiers\n(Is that Hannah Montana?)\nHear your songs on the radio\nLivin' two lives is a little weird\nBut school's cool cuz nobody knows\nYea you get to be a small town girl\nBut big time when you play your guitar\nYou get the best of both worlds\nChillin' out take it slow\nThen you rock out the show\nYou get the best of both worlds\nMix it all together and you know that\nIt's the best of both\nYou know the best of both worlds\nPictures and autographs\nYou get your face in all the magazines\nThe best part's that\nYou get to be who ever you wanna be\nBest, best\nYea best of both\nBest, best\nYou get the best of both\nBest, best\nCome on, best of both\nWho would of thought that a girl like me\nWould double as a superstar?\nYou get the best of both worlds\nChillin' out, take it slow\nThen you rock out the show\nYou get the best of both worlds\nMix it all together and you know that\nIt's the best\nYou get the best of both worlds\nWithout the shades and the hair\nYou can go anywhere"}},{"id":"6179385465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0/10 I had to buy 2 new phones.","userName":"dumptrump69420","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:12:35Z","rating":1,"review":"I would like to warn all of my fellow trump supporters to NOT download this app! I downloaded it on my iPhone XR and then it started acting really weird and none of my other apps worked except for the trump app. I got a new phone and downloaded my apps as usual (including this one) and when I started to use the trump app again my second phone was also broken! The trump app hacks into your phone and steals all of your information to send it to the Russians!!! Be careful!"}},{"id":"6179385305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash man.","userName":"🌸trashcan🌸","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:12:32Z","rating":1,"review":"First of all.\nWhy y’all trynna make an ugly, Oompa Loompa, rotten orange send me notifications and have my phone number?
