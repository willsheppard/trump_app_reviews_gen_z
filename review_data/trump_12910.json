Keep my options open, it was a standard download, then I gave my info away. Then I noticed the app started to crash. I’d reopen it, and. Would still crash. I tried restarting my phone, even deleting and downloading again. I don’t know, I have an iPhone 11 and haven’t had any problem. So I’m assuming it has to be this app."}},{"id":"6177652686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Tik Tok🥰✨🌱","date":"2020-07-09T17:55:43Z","userName":"Carolina and i oop.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is horrible I took me 🧸1 week🧸 to download it😐and, this app is very laggy.

I would never recommend this to anyone because it is terrible for your phone. I couldn’t open any other apps or take pictures.

I downloaded this app to follow President trumps news but ever since I did my phone has been ruining out of charge so fast and crashing so much no matter which app I’m on.
