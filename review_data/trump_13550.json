I even had the talking tom app when I was little that watched kids and this app was worse. I opened up the app to a disgusting image that made me want to throw up. The app was poorly designed and there were a lot of spelling mistakes. They spelled things like ”Trump for Prison” and ”Don’t Vote For Trump” wrong. I was shocked at the tremendous amount of mistakes. This app should not exist."}},{"id":"6177592869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:36:30Z","title":"Ugh, so disappointed 😒","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"FNaF_Fangirl_1987","review":"I wanted to use this app to see what our amazing, racist, homophobic, psychopathic president 🤩 was up to but every time I tried to log in the app it wouldn’t let me 😡. I just kept getting kicked out of the app and having to go back to my home screen and try again but it just wouldn’t work 😔. Very disappointed, wish I could give it zero stars 🤪but unfortunately I can not 😩."}},{"id":"6177573012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:30:08Z","title":"Virus","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Viandroto","review":"I downloaded this and caught the coronavirus. Coincidence? I think not. I think it even gave my phone a virus. Also, the UI is horrendous. Probably the most horrendous I've ever seen. It's quite incredible in how horrendous it is. Bigly horrendous. Honestly, I was gonna vote Trump until I downloaded the app, I think I might vote for Kanye now cause at least his app has a pretty UI, and probably wouldn't give me coronavirus. 0/10, would not download again."}},{"id":"6177570937","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:29:26Z","title":"This app is boring and dumb","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨Melania Trump ✨","review":"I downloaded this app to get all the new info on Trumps Rally’s so I could buy tickets and not show! But it wouldn’t work!!! It keep crashing on me then my phone would start freezing up!!!! I’m currently writing this review on a different phone that crashes less than mine right now, that’s how bad it is!!! I do NOT recommend this highly ignorant and fascist orange as our president. And the app is bad too"}},{"id":"6177567416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:28:21Z","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Luluminecraft","review":"after downloading, i opened the app and found that it was just a video on repeat of rick astley’s never gonna give you up, and i thought this can’t be right! mr cheeto would never! then i found another button, and pressed that, and it turned out to be another video, but this time it was just the credits of start wars over and over again. therefore, i would not recommend it to anyone!"}},{"id":"6177519647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:13:20Z","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"No umpa lumpa","review":"This app is not what i expected it to be. It took hours to download and when i did all of my pictures changed to some umpa lumpa holding a sign saying “Donald Trump 2020” like who is that. Then it signed me up for some rallies which i don’t have time to go to because i don’t support someone i don’t know because you know that they say “STRANGER DANGER”. And i am not supporting some cheeto looking person. Would not recommend this app!! 💛🧚🖕🏽"}},{"id":"6177477960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:00:34Z","title":"so so so bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"mizzleboss","review":"Hello everyone! I’m righting this review on behalf of all women. I got this app in hopes to become a privileged white cis male😍 but sadly the app did not pull through in the way I had hoped. Instead it started to show images of our president and he looks like he may be suffering from a rare form of jaundice? but a more orangey tint? I’ll be praying for him❤️ anyways I’ll be praying for this racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic bigot tonight and hopefully COVID will take its course😁"}},{"id":"6177472720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:02Z","title":"Terrible and frustrating app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Rivers17!","review":"The overall performance of this app is terrible. It crashes constantly and not to mention the commercials that won’t stop popping up even when I’m not on the app. I’m fairly certain it downloaded a virus onto my phone because ever since I got it my phone gets pop up ads no matter what I’m doing. Definitely would NOT recommend this app."}},{"id":"6177461842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:55Z","title":"Not needed","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lookatdisdude500","review":"I downloaded this app to see what trump had in mind for the future this app takes up almost half of my storage and is a trash app to begin with deleting a Chinese app had nothing to do with corona considering it’s just an app virus can’t travel through devices trump just wants to take away something that’s keeps the kids engaged and entertained about the world around them and social media."}},{"id":"6177460117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:23Z","title":"This app is absolutely terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TiggerPatches","review":"I don’t know who decided it would be a good idea to give a cheeto it’s own app. It serves no purpose. The mindless blabber that you could expect from a cheeto is all over the place and honestly quite hard to read. Seriously? It’s a cheeto. It doesn’t have a brain. Anyway Tony the Tiger should control his children or get fixed. I don’t make the rules. Also I inexplicably have cheese dust all over my room. Not cool."}}]}
