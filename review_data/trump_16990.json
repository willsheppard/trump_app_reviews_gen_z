I am soo confused it smelled like rotten Cheetos. Also it took a week to download and I have the iPhone XR and usually it takes 30 seconds for an app to download. Then when it did download all the info was in another language, I think it was the language fascist sexist and racist.

Which he doesn‚Äôt understand he‚Äôs not just taking a app. He‚Äôs taking away jobs, creativity, inspiration, laughs, stories, a boredom cure, and most of all, a family.

Um. Weird. At least get to know me first before you‚Äôre asking all this personal info. After that it kept showing me all these fake and uninformative pics and stories about the president.
