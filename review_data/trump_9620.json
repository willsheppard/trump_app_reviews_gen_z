Right away I opened the app and remembered I have an allergy to oranges, I wouldn’t think it would be a problem but I got hives all over and threw up all over my phone causing it to sizzle and burn, it hurt my eyes to even look at the orange giant.

But then, that night, the cross that I have in my room, flipped upside down. I heard it. It was absolutely terrifying.\n\n My phone started glitching every time I opened the app. As soon as my phone glitched, my screen would go black, and my lights would switch off in my house. \n\nI personally, as a Christian, think someone cursed this app, and it needs to be immediately removed off the app store.","userName":"ib378","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172888364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:26:40Z","title":"Not Satisfactory in any way","review":"I was looking for reasons that trump should be in office again in 2020, and came across this app.  I downloaded it to see if there would be any reasons.  It made me put it all of my personal information to let me see the reasons why he should be re-elected.  But I found out that the app SOLD my private information.  I will never use this again and you shouldn’t either if you don’t want your information stolen and sold.","userName":"gûgûgûgûgûgûgûg","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172761926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:43Z","title":"Don’t download 🤮🙄","review":"I downloaded this app to show some love to the orange 🍊 president.

My cat happened to be next to me and looking right at my phone! My cat got so scared of the sad, strange 🍊that she teleported to a railroad! A train was coming right then and my cat flailed the train over! Many people didn’t make the tragic accident. My cat then ran away and we had to get the roaches to find the cat. The only way we could get the roaches to help was by letting them live in our house! Thanks to this app my cat is on the run, we have to live with ROACHES, AND MANY PEOPLE DIED!

I used to love Trump, first off this app took 2 years to download, next, It showed me a picture of the president himself, then played really creepy music and told me to vote for Biden instead which I’m not doing.
