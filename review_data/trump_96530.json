Is Guam still a thing? Shoutout to Guam) I am both flabbergasted 😨 and thunderstruck 🤯 by how BAD this app is. For starters, it took a full soul cycle of the harvest moon 🌚 in order for me to download. And then FINALLY when it downloaded (after mercury  went into metronome ~yeah it took that long~) it said it would send me a message from don trumpet himself. Color me excited!! Butttt then he called me Personally. He said “baby do you love me?” But I told him “only partly ✌🏻 I only love my 🛌 and my momma I’m $orry 😞” and BOY he did not like that!!! 💔He then threatened to listen in on my phone calls via the telescope 😫I thought he wasn’t forserious but he did it!! Proof: just yesterday I was talking to my third cousins niece that I needed a new thermometer 🌡for my Swedish minimalist goose 🦆 hutch for my backyard!! And GUESS WHAT SHOWED UP IN AMAZON’s RECOMMENDADTIONS THE NEXT DAY?? That’s right. A thermometer 👏🏻 for 👏🏻 my 👏🏻 geese’s 👏🏻 hutch!! Trump’s secretary then called me 📞 and threatened to take away my prized French Canadian Geese!! Like omg do not kidnap Reginald Honkington the vice chancellor of Gooslevania 👑 all because of one app!! I am so worried. I wish I could've just saved myself the fear and paranoia and NOT downloaded this app.  I couldn’t wait to dish the hot ☕️ with my fellow trump supporters but I guess I was thoroughly mistaken at what this app was for. 1 Star is GENEROUS. Worst public bathroom I’ve ever used.","date":"2020-07-10T00:20:41Z","title":"Not amazing not showstopping 👎🏻","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178744614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"EEEeEeReRer","review":"Don’t take down TikTok","date":"2020-07-10T00:19:55Z","title":"Stop","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178735491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"sjdjdjkdkd","review":"this app is straight crap nothing works and it represents a moron ♥️","date":"2020-07-10T00:16:20Z","title":"Ew","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178708242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"qwerrtyuij","review":"Is bad","date":"2020-07-10T00:05:48Z","title":"I don’t like it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178705108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ronnie2099","review":"This app is a health hazard.
