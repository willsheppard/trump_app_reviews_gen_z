His disgusting and vile ways show in this app as well. I get a notification every day which states that I am ugly and overweight. This app continuously glitches out into a large pixelated screen which yells, “LOSER” in trumps voice himself, at me for the next ten minutes; with no way of shutting it off. This app caused my pet gerbil to kill himself due to the constant harassment and torment ensued upon me and my loved ones. Please take this app down so it does not cause others the damage it has caused me. Please for the love of god."}},{"id":"6174008187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:51:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting and smell","userName":"auiiora","review":"I opened the app to find a stupid, homophobic man who looked like a fat orange in front of me. I barfed and some of it got on my Oompa Loompa. Thanks a lot, *cough cough* tRuMp. Also there were a dancing hot dog with no clothes, the disrespect. I showed it to my friend who was on the stairs and she tripped while barfing. Unbelievable. This is a worst app even so do waste time downloading it. Also I saw trump mimicking George Floyd’s death, saying “I can’t breathe.” What the heck is wrong with you!? If I time traveled back to when trump was born I would’ve yeet Ed out the window >:). I tried scrolling through some more stuff and found Danny dorito (who is a dorito) dancing saying “yeet my fellow chicken nuggets!” What the heck? 1 star review. Trashy trash."}},{"id":"6173971756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:37:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ariana Grande said just keep breathing🦋✨💫She didn't mean you orange 🙈🥰✨💫🧚","userName":"its reallly fun","review":"Oh, Oh r - r - roll up to the party with my crazy pink wig but I can’t get through the door because my booty’s too big (unlike yours Cheeto✨🙈💫🧚😻) 1% is human, 99 is plastic just a sec I gotta fix my lips theses ho’s are just jealous ‘cause their mans want me I can’t believe it, that girl’s so sexy dude are you crazy, I think it’s a tranny (What?)

That caused slightly less of a traumatic impact that this app caused. I mean no disrespect to the furry who was piping my uncle. This app has caused my beloved cat horrific vomiting and my bird severe mental strain that came from having to witness the atrocity that was this app. I will be seeking mental help for my ferret and alpaca. My plants have started to wilt and my dad lost the best lawn competition that my neighborhood holds every year. We believe that this app will bring nothing but irreversible doom upon to those who dare download it to their mobile device. Be warned and water your plants today. Don’t make the same mistake I did."}},{"id":"6173964920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:34:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Rip meemaw","userName":"c_smith01","review":"This app took forever to download and it glitches as soon as I done got it. I was just sitting on my porch with a pinch of dip in my mouth and as soon as I got it my 🇺🇸Trump 2020🇺🇸 flag caught on fire. I’ve never had to run to the watering hole so fast I fell on my way and swallowed my dip. I got back to pour the water down on it and oranges came out. I just decided to let it burn cause it stand for a rapist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, hypocrite that moved protesters to get a photo outside of a church he doesn’t go to and encourages police brutality. But anyhow meemaw done died cause the darned app show her trumps noods. I’m having to delete it cause of the glitching and just the though of Cheetos balls make me even more suicidal."}},{"id":"6173824734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:42:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT WILL GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES","userName":"ash.ovalle","review":"this app is for boomers that have nothing better to do with theirs lives. this app will give u nightmares and will make your phone data really slow and it will also turn ur phone orange🍊🍊it is not worth it. Also they say that if u don’t rate it 5 stars rats and roaches will come to your house and eat you and your family alive. When I first opened the app everything was fine until it started glitching and my phone was getting really warm so i called the cops but they said they were too “busy” killing black people. then I was walking my fish and a bunch trump ninjas that were all 🍊orange started chasing me but thank god i know how to fight."}},{"id":"6173774197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"acab","userName":"✌🏼👁👄👁💅🏼","review":"so first things first, the first thing i see when i open this app is a baby orange bunker boy which i honestly thing is so disgusting and no one should ever have to look at that racist, homophobic, sexist, fascist, rapist face ever. second this app is so unnecessary for people like me yk, cause i just wanted to support this ugly bastard🥺 yk cause i’m a horrible person but honestly i have this app like i don’t want him to know my information cause he might call ice on me even though i’m legal but i’m mexican so he’ll find a way. anyways i hate this app, one star, but it’s really zeros stars since the person who owns this app wants to hurt people hurt people fighting for blm and lets pigs kill POC and get away with it"}},{"id":"6173763920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Sorry losers and haters, but this app is terrible.","userName":"holycowijustwanttoreviewthis","review":"I’m truly channeling all of my Karen energy into writing this one star review. When I opened the app, it gave me a big logo with a T that said “keep America great”. First of all, I though it was a Tesla logo. That would’ve been cool. But instead, it stands for Trump! And then there was another T, but this time it was much smaller. And then it started spinning! As someone who has a fear of the letter T, this was quite frightening! Once I finally got past the terrible, torturous, T’s, the app asked for my phone number. I downloaded this app on my phone, what do you need my number for? It’s gonna be a no from me. Would give this app 0 starts if I could :/"}},{"id":"6173682027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:49:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Do NOT download this app ❤️","userName":"Mobile Ark hater","review":"I got this app because I was looking forward to be able to receive news on our president. I downloaded the app and took my dog for a walk while it was installing, but as soon as I got to the corner, a Bald eagle was flying after me WITH A KNIFE. Now you would think this has no correlation, but it does. The eagle grabbed my dog and kept yelling “Trump 2020” over and over again as it attacked me. I barely managed to escape and almost died from blood loss. When I got back to the house my dog was there, and he kept saying ‘Trump 2020’ it was a tough decision, but I decided that my dog needed to be put down. Never get this App if you care about your wellbeing or your animals."}},{"id":"6173605613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:22:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trash","userName":"Turtle8u","review":"Poopy stinky hot garbage looking app just made my grandmas phone blow up in her hand. The shrapnel went flying and killed our cat. The phone then caught on fire and when it dropped from my grandmas now mutilated hand it landed on the rug her grate grandma made for her before passing. The rug then burst into flames that then spread to the carpet and burnt the house down. I called 911 to help but when they arrived they beat me up and tried to arrest my grandma but because her hand was blown off they could not get her in the cuffs so they beat her up too. I am now in the hospital and she’s in a coma. Idk how I’m going to pay for the insane medical bills for both of us when I’m only still in high school and now homeless."}}]}
