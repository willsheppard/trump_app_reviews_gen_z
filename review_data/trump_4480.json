Not only that but the app was really complicated and I didn’t like how complicated it was because I have dyslexia. Also MY DOG DIED BECAUSE OF THIS APP. It’s some type of witch craft but a day after I got this app my dog died all of a sudden R.I.P Ringo 😔🐶 not only that but the creator is extremely racist #savebarrontrump #savemeleniatrump \n\nI would also like to add that the red, white, and blue is extremely tacky and doesn’t go well together not only is he racist but he’s also color blind. If I could give this app zero stars I would.

I had a pit in my stomach and started turning orange. My hands and feet began shrinking to an abnormally small size. I began to crave McDonald’s cheeseburgers and had a immense need to build walls. I started freaking out and I went to look in the mirror that’s when I noticed my hair was falling out and it was playboy bunny blonde. I had a obviously bald spot on my head and I felt the need to comb my little remaining hair over it so no one could tell. This app made me into some kind of fascist racist Oompa Loompa?? I don’t know but PLEASE delete to feel sweet release. If I could rate 0 stars I would.\n\nBLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","title":"Tiny Cheeto Fingers","userName":"Tiff47😇","rating":1}},{"id":"6173149868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:48:34Z","review":"So I put in my number email and it wanted me to put my address I don’t know if it’s because I live in a bad town or what but I did all that after I put my number in and my email it took me to a white screen I been on it for 20 minutes now and nothing. Now my phone will ring no stop I have to black the people who call me then my email started blowing up emails talking about student loan,sign stuff for trump,saying that I won 1$ and more so I started to think the app sold my whole phone data or something because my phone be acting slow to. Not really sure how to fix it.","title":"Did this app give my business away?","userName":"pooh$&","rating":1}},{"id":"6173085060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:27:58Z","review":"When I clicked download my whole phone started to glitch and then shut down for 2 weeks. It gave me several viruses. And just yesterday my brothers phone glitches out too. My phone also got taken over by a hacker. Probably someone in the government. I feel like someone is always watching me and watching my phone. Omgomgogngogn this is a few weeks later from this top message but I couldn’t finish it because someone or something wasn’t letting me type. I’m trying to explain what happened. I was trying to type what happened when my phone started deleted it.","title":"Worst thing I ever downloaded","userName":"roooooooaaaaarrr","rating":1}},{"id":"6173004449","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:37Z","review":"Did you know that if TikTok gets banned, that a variety of people’s income will be practically cut in half, or even more than half, there is no reason to even ban this app; You’d  see the exact same content on any other platform that you’d see on TikTok! Just because the app is practically new and is blowing off of the charts it has more people focused on it, so we’re blind to the fact that most social media platforms made it passed the era of looking to get banned because of the content, anything you see on the app isn’t ever relatively new, a-lot of people are just more engaged to TikTok, so every mistake sticks out like a sore thumb.","title":"Why Ban TikTok?","userName":"mikeyislit❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6172995117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:59:48Z","review":"This app is terrible to be honest I only downloaded it to give you a one star review I don’t even need to take my time to even open the trash app I don’t know how people like or even want you to be their president when all you do is lie,lie and lie some more. How is a president racist also when you ran for president you knew that the u.s was a place full of different races and ethnicities so why in gods name would you run. We don’t like you and you obviously don’t like us very much but we don’t care not one bit and if any of the Karen’s or Cheeto supports read this maybe you should sit back and think why do I like him.🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡","title":"A message to a Cheeto","userName":"🍊🍊🍊🍆","rating":1}},{"id":"6172893810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:28:19Z","review":"i bought this app thinking i could get to know my president but instead it started to glitch and play loud music i was continuously trying to get on the app but it started crashing little did i know the president was purposefully trying to play peaches ‘you so bad (remix’) ugh i was in my office for work and it was just so embarrassing as much as i tried to turn down my phone it kept playing over and over again there might be an issue with the app so i suggest you take it down and try again its been crashed for 4 days now and i even tried to redownload it :( fix this problem.","title":"This is horrible","userName":"TizzyMiller","rating":1}},{"id":"6172468673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:27:32Z","review":"I didn’t want to download this app but after everyone was raving about ‘what a successful app’it would be and ‘what good it will for you our phones’ I thought I’d look into it. And let me say, I’m still just as disappointed as I thought I would be. There’s a lot of things to hate about this app. Like for example I fee like it wouldn’t work on certain phones if the phone was a different color or if my phone wasn’t issued by a certain academy. Hmmmm it’s almost like I should have known this app was trash when it was being made. Oh wait i did know. It was other people who didn’t do enough research","title":"A lot of bugs","userName":"a proud sorority women","rating":1}},{"id":"6172422403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:15:01Z","review":"I tried to show my grandpop the app, but it was SO difficult to use! The text was so small, so he couldn’t read anything! I had to read it all for him! So how is he supposed to support our dear and beloved president when I’m not around??\n\nPlus, the app made no sense whatsoever! It was totally unnavigable, and I’m a millennial so I can basically figure out how to navigate any technical resource! If I can’t use it, how will my grandpop be able to??\n\nAfter a while this app started to close all by itself! And it caused a major glitch on my phone where I couldn’t tap anything! I had to shut down my phone THREE TIMES before it started working again!\n\nI’m pretty sure that my phone is now HACKED!! I had to tell my grandpop that he should avoid the app AT ALL COSTS because I don’t want him to get SCAMMED by it!\n\nOverall the app is a very disappointing feat from Mr. President. 😔 I hope he can do better next time and not hack people, but after this, I HIGHLY doubt it.","title":"My Grandpa Couldn’t Use It","userName":"Lämp506","rating":1}},{"id":"6177714332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:15:01Z","review":"I got this app today and it was the worst stop decision I have made because I had to delete other apps to get this one because there wasn’t enough room on my phone (this never happens) and every time I open the app it kicks me out.\nI don’t think I’m the only person that just wanted this app to stay caught up on the news and I don’t feel comfortable giving the app my phone number is soon as you login but I did and it still kept kicking me out and it kept glitching me out of the app like it didn’t want me there\nSo please do NOT get this app there are plenty other news apps out there 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","title":"F DONALD TRUMP","userName":"Carolinee7","rating":1}}]}
