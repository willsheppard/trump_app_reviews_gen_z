ELIO’S/OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 1\nThe sound of an approaching car. ELIO, 17, barefoot and in his bathing suit, is in the process of moving his clothes from his room to the adjacent room - a cramped storage room somehow refurbished into a single bedroom. The two rooms are separated by a ruined wooden door, with cracks all over it and share a common bathroom.\nMARZIA, a girl of about his same age, is lying on the bed. It is obvious both have been on it together.\nELIO goes to the window and looks down. A car pulls up below, blowing up clouds of dust, and stops at the villa’s main entrance.\nA tall young man steps out of the car, wearing a billowy bright blue shirt with a wide-open collar, sunglasses. This is OLIVER, 25.\nELIO\n(in French to Marzia)\nL'usurpateur. (The usurper)\nMARZIA jumps up to come stand next to him, looking down.\nANCHISE, the gardener and handyman, appears below followed by the PERLMANS who introduce themselves to Oliver. Professor PERLMAN is in his fifties, distinguished, vigorous. ANNELLA, his wife, is in her mid-forties.\nPERLMAN (to Oliver)\nWelcome! Welcome! Oh, my, you are much bigger than your picture!\nANNELLA\n(in Italian to her husband)\nDove è Elio?\n(Where’s Elio?)\nELIO\n(in French to Marzia)\nIl faut que je descende.\n(I’d better go down.)\n2 INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 2\nAt the end of the stairs ELIO sees OLIVER being walked to Professor Perlman’s study. Oliver’s suitcase and backpack lie on the floor nearby. ANNELLA sees Elio approaching and gestures towards them.","date":"2020-07-09T01:54:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174544445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stanbtsdumies","isEdited":false,"title":"Jungkook-My Time","review":"Ay yeah (ay yeah)\nAh twenty-four 누구보다 더 빨리 어른이 된 것만 같아\nMy life has been a movie all the time\n해 뜨는 곳으로 달렸어 every single night\n누구의 내일에 가봤던 것도 같아\n온 세상이 너무 컸던 그 소년\nKeep on runnin' errday, mic 잡아들어\nFriends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode\n전 세계를 rock on, I made my own lotto\nBut 너무 빠른 건지 놓쳐버린 흔적이\nDon't know what to do with\nAm I livin' this right?\n왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까\nOh I can't call ya, I can't hol' ya\nOh I can't\nAnd yes you know, yes you know\nI can't call ya (I can't), I can't touch ya (I can't)\nOh I can't\nLet me know\nCan I someday finna find my time (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh) yeah\nFinna find my time (oh yeah)\nFinna find my time yeah\nSomeday finna find my time (oh oh eh)\nOh I think I was in yesterday\n'Cause everybody walk too fast\n나도 모르게 커버린 어린 나\n(길을 잃어버린 어린아이처럼)\nThis got me oh just trippin'\n서성대는 이 느낌\nDon't know what to do with\nAm I livin' this right?\n왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까\nOh I can't call ya (yeah), I can't hol' ya (oh I can't)\nOh I can't\nAnd yes you know, yes you know\nI can't call ya (I can't), I can't touch ya\nOh I can't\nLet me know\nI can someday finna find my time (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh) yeah\nFinna find my time (oh yeah)\nFinna find my time yeah\nAh someday finna find my time (oh yeah)\n때론 나의 숨 막힐 때면\n모잘 눌러쓰고 계속 달려\nYeah I don't gotta know where I go\nEven if it's opposite of sun\nOne time for the present (one time)\nTwo time for the past (two time)\nHappy that we met each other\nNow til' the very end (ah ah ah)\nOh I will call ya, I will hol' ya\nOh I will\nAnd yes you know, oh yes you know\nOh I will call ya, I will touch ya\nOh I will\nAnd you know\nCan I someday finna find my time (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh) yeah\nCan I someday finna find my time (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh) oh oh\nFinna find my time (my time) yeah oh yeah\nFind my time oh oh oh oh oh\nAh ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah","date":"2020-07-09T01:52:16Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174508968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"savanna rizzo","isEdited":false,"title":"🤮🤮🤮","review":"grotesque excuse for a human being 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:17Z","rating":1}}]}
