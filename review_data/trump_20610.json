The owner of the app and face of it is a racist and sexually assaults innocent citizens. I know it’s not just me that has a problem with this.

This should never be a app with the face of this rude and ignorant and selfish person.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:45:15Z"}},{"id":"6173496678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕫𝕚𝕚","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"review":"This app is terrible as soon as I downloaded the app my phone got hot and it has never done that before and It started to glitch I feel as if the government is stalking my phone now that I got this app even though they already do but I feel they got the big dogs now and long story short this app is horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:54Z"}},{"id":"6173495672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"MACJACKK","title":"leave bye-","rating":1,"review":"Ok why did this take so long to download I even ate my McDonald’s I do not appreciate this😡😡😡.It kept glitching and making my phone BAMBOOZ WITH a patty fatty orange that did not pass the vibe check😢😡🔪.Im very sad now I’ll have to get my phone fixed💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔.Please make this app leave I do not recommend!GUYS IT WILL MESS UP UR PHONE LIKE IT DID TO MINE!!!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭This just made me have no storage what a shame 😤","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:44:34Z"}},{"id":"6173487836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"The Pink Bandana","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"review":"This app, should I even call it that. Whatever this thing is that they decided to put in the App Store, is the worst app I have ever seen. I took forever to download. The format is too prehistoric for my advanced mind to comprehend.
