The problem is once it loaded there were 80 different versions of the app. It was similar to when you click the same link on internet explorer and it all loads at once. Which backed up and broke my phone. I have to buy a whole new one, problem being stores are closed. I am writing this from my sisters phone. She also downloaded the app and as soon as she did her closet exploded. In the flames were dancing cockroaches that then took over the entire house, the cockroaches let out a loud noise that attracted many angry murder hornets. The murder hornets attempted to kill my goldfish and my sister. Sadly they successfully killed the goldfish. The murder hornets then tried to attack me but I shut my door fast enough to lock them out. However those pesky brats started to get in through the bottom cracks of the door. With nowhere left to go I jumped out of the window. I now have a broken neck, leg, arm, and 5 of my fingers are broken as well. I tried to call 911 on my phone but it was already broken because of the first time I downloaded it. I tried calling to my sister to dial 911 but she was already busy enough Trying to escape the murder hornets herself. After 2 weeks my neighbors found me and called and ambulance, but after realizing how expensive it was they said nvm and told the ambulance not to come. I am still recovering from my injuries and trauma. But please don‚Äôt download this app unless you want a broken phone,house, and body. Hater will say it‚Äôs fake","date":"2020-07-08T18:55:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever"}}]}
