Weird I thought, but sure maybe it wants a booty call, it wouldn’t be the first time it wanted one. And then out of nowhere boom a text message. It was the Cheeto I was nervous but I opened it (after 2 min obviously) and it was a little Cheeto stick coming off a larger Cheeto!!!!! It was the first Cheeto stick I had ever seen and I don’t know if I can ever un see it. I’m sorry but this app is not for me.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:48:44Z","title":"My virgin eyes","isEdited":false,"userName":"your mom isnt kool"}},{"id":"6174432923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all i would like to say that when i opened the app i was disgusted by seeing the cheetos chode right on my screen. must’ve been a glitch.. i downloaded the app 10 minutes ago and i am being BOMBARDED with emails!! i currently have over 20,000 emails from random users. i’m convinced this app carries bad fortune because every time i open it a stench fills the room. very dissapointed, i thought since the fat lard was so rich it would at least be a good app but i guess not.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:04Z","title":"don’t waste your time!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"lynnie😕🥳"}},{"id":"6174425762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app was the WORST thing I have EVER seen. As soon as you open it you see a PORNOGRAPHIC image of Garfield the orange cat doing UNSPEAKABLE things to his own privates that are depicted as a Cheeto puff🤮. I was with my 2 year old daughter when I saw this disturbing image to show her our amazing supreme leader but this has RUINED my support for him in the upcoming election this app MUST be taken down and he MUST be taken out of office so no one will ever have to see those dreadful images again🙅🏽\u200D♀️.

I opened up the app to see the big cheeto man himself. Little did I know that my cousin was allergic to the color orange, and she just happened to be looking at my phone when I opened the app. She instantly started breaking out and she couldn’t breath, we had to rush her to the E.R. A few hours later and my cousin was no longer with us and we were stuck with a huge hospital bill and no cousin. So this app is trash and the cheeto man owes me a cousin.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:44:07Z","title":"This app? trash.","isEdited":false,"userName":"keirston1604"}},{"id":"6174235596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"all this app is going is promoting this horrible man who isn’t even a man but is a boy. trump supporters don’t even realize how hypocritical they are they support a man who hates immigrants but they don’t realize that he married to one.  he has sexually assaulted many children and women but if that happened to your daughters and wives y’all would be real upset. and i have wanted to say this for a while donald trump is a big fat orange coward. he is scared of anybody that doesn’t look like him because he knows that if even half us had the same opportunities we would be unstoppable in a good way. he isn’t protecting the country he harming it corona is real look it up dummy and the next time you make fun of the way people want to live you best believe your in for a rude awakening. i hate u. thank u bye.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:15:28Z","title":"i hate this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"djfhaofhduenbfnf"}},{"id":"6174215971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m not sure what to say, I am absolutely speechless. I downloaded this app to find out weeks later that i has developed a tumor in my brain. Then my husband also got diagnosed with Cancer. I reopened the app in terror to find a chicken tender staring at me and smiling. He sure did not make me “Great Again”. My house burned down the next morning and i opened my phone to see my wallpaper had turned to the chicken tender. He was glaring at me and said “This is a What you get” and i deleted the app. Please, never again.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:08:09Z","title":"Terrifying","isEdited":false,"userName":"poopypants101😂😘"}},{"id":"6174131792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is absolute TRASH. i downloaded it so i could get updates about our president, but then they tried to sell me candy. i thought hm, maybe they’re just into sweets. nope. it was some bad candy. i looked up the names of the candies, and they had poison in them. is our president trying to poison us?? soon after this candy situation, i got weird guys in my instagram dms asking me to buy the candy the trump app tried to sell me. the poisonous candy. disgusting. do NOT get this app. it’s horrible.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:37:05Z","title":"don’t EVER get this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"getoutofhereyourenasty"}}]}
