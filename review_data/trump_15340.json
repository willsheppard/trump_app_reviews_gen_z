I’m a huge annoying orange fan and I over heard a friend talking about this app and how the annoying orange uses it to tell his fans information. I was very disappointed when I downloaded the app to realize that I was mistaken and they were taking about a different annoying orange.

Not sure what to say except how much I HATE this app! Absolutely terrible. Once it downloaded, I was so excited to learn more about my favorite president. Unfortunately, I only learned how terrible he is! News flash, is actually kind of racist😬This should not be on the App Store.
