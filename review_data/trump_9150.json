However, I have realized after seeing Satan himself disguised in orange in the app that the light side is the side that does not promote sexual abuse, misogyny, homophobia, racism, and violence. I think that this god awful app is a show for our god awful president. Gen Z will win this war. Whether you continue to try to take TikTok AKA our HQ away from us, WE WILL CONTINUE TO UNITE. WE SHALL WIN. DO NOT EVEN TRY TO DEFEAT US. WE ARE MORE POWERFUL IN NUMBER AND BRAIN POWER.","date":"2020-07-09T16:30:57Z","userName":"Phantom4ever!"}},{"id":"6177366481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"review":"it took 83 weeks to open the app and when it did i saw bill nye naked. i got rlly confused and then i saw trump and bill doing to dirty. so i saw trump tiny thing i almost threw up. also he’s a terrible president and he’s trying to take down tik tok like that will do anything to help him win the election. anyways i kept going into the app and i realized the bill nye dont want to do the dirty and after they were done the president put him in a dark room. also never under estimate the gen z nation!!","date":"2020-07-09T16:27:34Z","userName":"Trumptheworst"}},{"id":"6177330789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Crashes","rating":1,"review":"I know a lot of kids are trying to get this app taken down so I downloaded it to see what it was about to support our god of a president. But the app is trash and constantly crashes even when I’ve had it open for a couple of seconds. It runs in the background and just takes up all my space even when I don’t use it. I wish I could give this app zero stars but I’ll have to settle for one. But still Trump 2020🇱🇷","date":"2020-07-09T16:17:21Z","userName":"what isnt taken oml"}},{"id":"6177279528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨ h o r r i b l e ✨","rating":1,"review":"the app took several days to load so i watched ryans toy review and pulled all nighters. the app took me to some random place and i crashed into a wall of big cheetos. i just thought it was donald trumps wall. it was very similar to him. i sat on the top of the wall while eating dry cereal. overall my experience was ~ h o r r i d ~ . i suggest not buying this app because, who wants to support a cheeto for the next 4 YEARS of controlling and manipulating us into thinking Republicans have anything other than the IQ of a bumblebee?!","date":"2020-07-09T16:02:56Z","userName":"F1234321"}},{"id":"6177216452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"review":"so i got this app to support my fave oompa loompa😍🟠 and this app took over 5 hours to download 😭and i know it wasn’t just my wifi ✨because other apps take like 5 seconds to download. 🙊it is also the most glitchy app EVER 🤮and takes forever to load🥺 when i open it. 🤬i don’t recommend for anyone to download this app.😤also when i opened it there was a picture of an orange 🍊and i passed out.😭 i am still not awake ✌🏻thx for coming to my ted talk🥳","date":"2020-07-09T15:44:34Z","userName":"CreamPuffSheep_"}},{"id":"6177149631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"this app is TERRIBLE AND DISGUSTING","rating":1,"review":"as a person who isn’t usually hating or judging something this app deserves it when i opened the app it was just terrible it was a pop up ad saying i had just won a iphone 11 and so i declined the offer and then there was another pop up and i was so disgusted there was a pornography pop up and i know this isn’t my phone that’s doing it because when i left the app it wasn’t there i then quickly deleted the app JUST TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T15:25:42Z","userName":"Avaroseeeeeeee"}},{"id":"6177132304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"terrible luv.😘😘","rating":1,"review":"this app takes to much storage and takes so long to download, i download like 3 weeks ago and it just now finished, oh yeah instead of banning tiktok they should band trump, and don’t come at mexicans for being rapist because trump you’re one yourself, i can’t believe you didn’t do anything about BLM you make me sick what kind of president are you, you even killed a person, stop being a freaking racist with your orange sherk looking self, anyways love you.😘","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:53Z","userName":"mxmjen"}},{"id":"6177083200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I love penis","rating":1,"review":"Before I had this app I actually really liked trump.

My phone works perfectly on its own and I’ve had no prior problems with it, it doesn’t have a single scratch on it but my phone turned different colors and everything it was like I was being HACKED.
