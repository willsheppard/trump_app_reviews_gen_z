I’m 13 but I support your campaign and I’m sick and tired of people trying to cancel you. All cause they think their opinion is the right opinion. Look at Minneapolis, their crime rate is through the roof. Protesters destroying people with trump shirts on the street, thugs and looters destroying cities and they think it’s great. Please ban TikTok, I may be addicted but as long as they can’t  gang up and destroy someone’s ideas and beliefs. Thanks for reading this to whoever might me reading this from the trump campaign. \n\nFrom, Dane Sliker","rating":5,"date":"2020-07-08T23:32:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TikTok back at it again Mr.President"}},{"id":"6174119173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump for prison 2020","review":"Sorry I don’t like racist pedophiles.
