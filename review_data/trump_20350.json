I knew Trump would pull something like this! When the symptoms first appeared, I contacted the Trump Administration and they told me that if I don’t get tested, then I don’t have it, so it’s ok. Then I remember that they’re all imbeciles, so I got tested and what do you know- I have crabs!! Don’t download this app unless you want crabs!","userName":"emiliogerbiendin","date":"2020-07-09T20:27:17Z","title":"Gave me crabs!! 🤮🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178122053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"got this app to see what trump was all out and i was super disappointed.
