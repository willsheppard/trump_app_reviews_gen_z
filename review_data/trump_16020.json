When the music started playing rats gathered in the rat king so that he’s going to kill my dog. Now I love my dog so much but I cannot put up a fight with the rat king because he’s the most powerful leader ever. Then, everyone of my family started praising him and then they turned into rats🐀 . So now I don’t have a family anymore and I cry all the time when I look at my rat family.","date":"2020-07-08T20:48:28Z"}},{"id":"6173674294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"별이 빛나는 바다 눈을 가진 소녀","title":"Terrible, not surprised since this app is made by Trump 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤑 Stream Stay Gold","review":"Ooh ooh\nIn a world where you feel cold\nYou gotta stay gold\nOh baby, yeah\n魅惑的な moonlight\n今宵も眠らない\n月明かりを頼りに\n君の元へ hide and seek (ay)\n心へ (ay) と忍びこんで 君の間近\n近づくのさ いつの間にか (ay)\n穢れを知らないな\nその瞳はダイヤ\nどんな宝石よりも beautiful\n何度も (yeah) 見惚れてしまうほど\n君から目離せない no more\n時計の針さえ 動きを止めるよ\nUh let it glow, whoa\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\n気づかれないように\n近づいてく slowly\n予告するよ baby 無防備な君を優しく\nいただくのさ 君の深いところ now\n高鳴る想いは 鼓動を早める\nUh let it show, whoa\nStay gold 君さえいれば\nStay gold 何もいらない\nStay gold, gold 抱きしめたくて\nStay gold 愛は果てなく\nStay gold 光を放つ\nStay gold どんな星よりも\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold 🍊 ⭐️","date":"2020-07-08T20:46:49Z"}},{"id":"6173662913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Ashley 📺🎞🤎✨","title":"DISGUSTED/Angry/HUNGRY!!!","review":"Donald 🙈 oh Donald🍊 No.❤️ I’ll say it again for you....no. ❤️ this has been the 4,000,000,000th time that I have been seeing this ugly...disappointing, annoying, cold-blooded, racist, ped0, Sour, disgusting Orange..aka.
