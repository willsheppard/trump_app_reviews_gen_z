surprising, so I decided to download it to see and it told me to put my phone number so I did and it was glitching as I was putting my phone number in and I was like huh 😒 so I pressed next and then it said to put my email zip code and I forgot what else because I deleted the app and then my screen literally froze so I was like first of all I’m not trying to put that information, I do NOT like trump ‼️ and my dang phone froze so after 10 minutes I finally got it to unfreeze and then I just had to write a horrible review about this app because it is the WORST APP I had ever used and I really think it should get deleted because trump is trying to delete tik tok and this app has like sooooo many bad reviews because it a DUMB APP and there are barely any five star reviews and he’s thinking about deleting tik tok when it’s  better and it doesn’t mess up my phone like this DUMB APP does😒😒😒😒😒 TIK TOK LIVES MATTER‼️✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","title":"THE MOST WORST APP
