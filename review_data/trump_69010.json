I see this app is no different than this crazy election time frame.  You may not like all the things he says but if you are shallow enough not to see the things he has done, well you need to open your eyes.  \n\nThis president has taken more hits that any in history.  Just imagine if the energy spent to hammer this man was spent in negotiating deals and working with him.  Just imagine telling the truth.  Just imagine knowing what the fundamentals this country was founded on  were what people focused on.  If half of that energy was focused on good solutions rather than just pushing an agenda this country would be unstoppable in helping others.  But instead we have a deep left and a deep right.  It isn’t Donald Trump alone it is all of us.  Foolish people need to wake up and see what is happening to our country.  Riots and tearing down our country is playing into the hands of China and Russia and others. \n\nYou have the freedom of speech which is something that is an amazing right that is nowhere in the world as good.  Do good with that right.  If you want to make a change legislate it or vote for a good legislator with no ties to people they own something to. \n\nSpend a day looking at the positives of what you have and dwell not on the negatives as it will ruin your health and your family.  Work hard in life and give to others rather than put your hand out unless that’s where life has left you.  I pray that if that is the case that someone is reaching out to you.  \n\nI get it we are all not as fortunate and I have it better than some and worse than many.  I worked two jobs for 27 years to do the right thing for my family.  \n\nIt isn’t what can you do for me.  What can I get for free or even it’s my right.  Nothing in life is free and your rights were fought and died for.  Open the door for someone today wish them a Happy Independence Day.  Pray for our country as we need a lot of prayers.  Be happy we have folks out there protecting us.  \n\nTake care and God Bless you and this country."}},{"id":"6149908886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T22:02:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ya Like Jazz👁👄👁","userName":"BalloonCheeto","review":"Whenever I was on the app right whenever I opened the app the Cheeto himself asked if I liked Jazz.
