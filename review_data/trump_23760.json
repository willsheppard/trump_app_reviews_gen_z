WILL BE SUEING","review":"I opened the app to see an instituted picture of a orange man with a wig on. I immediately collapsed onto the floor and started profusely barfing all over. After I threw up I went to pick up my phone to call 911 and once again saw a burnt orange man with a toupe on. Seeing the image again led to a stroke and now I am in a vegetative state. Would not recommend downloading ."}},{"id":"6174015167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ur grandma earl","date":"2020-07-08T22:53:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"terrifying👁👄👁","review":"when i first downloaded this app and got on there was a big Cheeto man NAKED- I’m scarred.\nmy phone then completely shut down and started to levitate over to the garbage disposal🤚 my garbage disposal then turned on and my phone was dead 😾 rip.

Also, I think the orange man they keep showing me in the app is going to haunt me in my sleep...       👁👄👁 this app provides no assistance in telling me whether or not his toupee is alive or not. Wish I could give it 0 stars super unhelpful."}},{"id":"6174000597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"😌✋👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:48:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DiSgUsTaNg!!!!","review":"I’d like to point out bruised orange in the front, very distasteful. I can’t play the app because there’s too many racist white karens and hillbilly joes that think saying the “n” word is cool on this app and I don’t think I’d want that to carry on to the next generation. Anyway...I just don’t want a racist, misogynistic, watered down Cheeto pedo as a president.😌✋ and I live by that. Xoxo❤️"}},{"id":"6173995719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"yurendi","date":"2020-07-08T22:46:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","review":"This app is terrible. I couldn’t even sign up due to my excessive vomiting when I opened the app. The first thing I saw was a moldy Cheeto standing in front of the American flag. It also sends a terrible amount of spam notifications to my phone BEGGING for money. I hate this app and took it off my phone IMMEDIATELY. I’m not a Karen. Just trying to save Gen Z!"}},{"id":"6173982720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ghostgirlchaser","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst cooking app I’ve ever used !!","review":"This app had no recipes! It didn’t teach me how to cook anything at all!! All it talked about was “rigging an election” and trying to promote “systemic racism.” I can’t believe Apple allowed this app to be put on the App Store! I’m gonna take my business to TikTok instead. At least I find recipes on TikTok! Get slurped, snowflakes! Go cry about it 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6173952386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"x if Uzi bcv","date":"2020-07-08T22:30:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"VERY NASTY!","review":"When I opened the app I saw a nasty picture of a Cheeto getting a spray tan! Not to mention seeing his little 🍤 penis oh my gosh I am mortified! My sister also saw this picture and she went into shock because it was so horrific!

Then it asked if i was a hispanic and if i was they were going to kick me out. I ignored it then it asked if i was under the age of 18 to click on a link so i could have a “special meeting” with the president🙀🤖. don’t recommend"}}]}
