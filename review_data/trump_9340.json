I downloaded it to get to know my president, but it turns out that this app steals the data from my refrigerator! How insane is that...? All my food from my refrigerator is gone. And that’s not even the worst part. After downloading it, my family said, “Get that bread 💵, get that head 🧠... Then Leave”! It’s been two days and they aren’t back. They really did hit that dash. Zoom! 🚗 \nThis app is horrible (Imagine Gru from Despicable Me saying that please 👍😘)"}},{"id":"6175231892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:24:41Z","userName":"Devin da raptor","title":"This app is not on brand","review":"I downloaded this because the man himself told me I’d get a free hair removal kit from the puppets in fraggle rock. I downloaded the app and saw it required me to kettle cook myself and my gynecologist told me I was not allowed to to that until I read goodnight moon. I tried to anyways because I was growing a mustache at age 7 and that was not okay. When I finally did there was no fraggle and I was not getting a hair removal kit. Only glitches and advertisements for mattresses. Never again. 0/10"}},{"id":"6175219532","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:20:17Z","userName":"__ren92","title":"Caused glitches","review":"This app caused some real problems with my phone. I noticed these glitches almost immediately after downloading the app. First, whenever I was typing a text message, autocorrect would change every other word to “tremendous” or change the language to Russian without me prompting a language change. Next, Instead of regular dark mode, my background kept turning orange, like a Cheeto color? Weird. Would not recommend."}},{"id":"6175127948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:48:19Z","userName":"Sarahpotato11304","title":"This app is disgusting","review":"After I downloaded this app (mind you I’m a huge maga fan) I was presented with links that were labeled as news sources, but they directed me to p*rnhub and other OUTRAGEOUS websites... also they got ahold of my personal information such as my phone number, credit card, and address. These were leaked to a group of people whom I don’t know of, and my phone is getting blown up with death threats and my bank account was drained. Do NOT download this app it will destroy your life!!!!"}},{"id":"6175022375","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:14:44Z","userName":"..melodyyy","title":"WORST APP LITERALLY","review":"i downloaded the app cause i wanted to see if the reviews were true AND THEY WERE the all automaticity glitches as soon as i open it and now my phone is messed up BIG TIME. i. suggest you remove  this app asap before some bad complains happen. my phone now has a virus and whenever i tried to open another app it would take me to this one. the information in the app is horrible and nothing like i was expecting or wanted. this app is horrible."}},{"id":"6174909062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:39:19Z","userName":"GENZ IS PRESENT","title":"Don’t get this","review":"App was very slow and never up to date and never stayed on top of America’s current events. I got a lot of spam after downloading it and it almost NEVER loaded. I do not recommend this or his texting line all you get is random petitions trying to get you to sign that have NOTHING to do with trump. If you want updates on what he’s up to go to his Twitter. You’ll see all the negative and immoral things he updates there. Hope this helps!"}},{"id":"6174899833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:36:33Z","userName":"mmays_1","title":"THE WORST APP EVER","review":"So one day I decided to get this app cause I heard that you could get free money off of it, and when I went on the app, IT LITERALLY SAID “SORRY ONLY DONKEYS AND SNAKES CAN PLAY” so then it wouldn’t even let me get in the app and I was really up set cause I wanted to win some money.

A.","title":"This app put me in therapy 😡","review":"After hearing such gOoD things about this app I downloaded it hoping to see what the fuss was about, and boy did I. The moment I opened the app it scanned my face to decide which racial slurs to use! Then it asked me for all of my information right before the screen tried to hypnotize me into buying all of Trump’s merch. It then threatened to make my guinea pigs fight to the death if I didn’t listen! I’m in therapy now because of how traumatized I am. Will I ever be the same? 😢"}}]}
