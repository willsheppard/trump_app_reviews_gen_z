I would say It needs a lot more improvement but at this point, you can’t even make it better. Donald Trump did not take into consideration the older generations such as myself ( I am 67 ) when making this app. It is so hard to navigate through and on top of that is completely useless and terrible. It is such a bad app I want to cry all day and throw my grandchildren in the oven. This app has also made my phone glitch out incredibly much. It is terrible. To all my trump supporters : don’t download this app because it is terrible.... stream Nicki Minaj tho 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"tativ143","title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-06-29T14:50:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6133859370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Instructions unclear my dogs but was stuck in the plunger and then the toilet straight doo dooed on me. this is so unacceptable my led lights in my room broke and then caught on fire causing me to run.

I was on the app with my daughter and out of no where an very scary orange popped on my screen and scared my daughter so bad that she passed out. I had to rush her to the hospital and the doctors said that her insides turned orange😵The doctor’s asked what could have caused it and I told them that we were on this app and they rushed her into surgery and they said I might have been exposed to it as well🤦🏽\u200D♀️So I have been in the hospital for several days doing nonstop test on me and I haven’t gotten to see my daughter yet and they haven’t told me anything about what is going on with her.😥","isEdited":false,"userName":"tee hee✌🏽🤏🏽🤏🏽","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP‼️","date":"2020-07-09T18:49:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177739850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app to support our presidential cheeto 🧡✨. However, when I launched the app a demon was released upon my home and watches my every move. I quickly befriended it, nevertheless it expels a negative aura/vibe in my home. About a week after the demon was released I began to be haunted my orange items at all times. I had to stop buying oranges because they would attack me when i wasn’t looking. Not to mention the cheetos that haunt my dreams (every night i dream of cheetos suffocating me). I haven’t had this app long so who knows what else could happen, but download it at your own risk.","isEdited":false,"userName":"_cryatal","title":"no.","date":"2020-07-09T18:22:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177656410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to see what his plans were an I was absolutely horrified. This app gets hardwired to your phone and will bring bugs that repeatedly bring your phone down. This app is not to be trusted. It will make your phone go off in the middle of the night with these loud irritating sounds, and I’ve turned it off in setting it still goes off. To say the least this app is crap and should have been taken down a long time ago to stop messing with people and feeding bulls*** into people’s mind he has no good plans for our future do not trust him or his app!","isEdited":false,"userName":"hopesrateing","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T17:56:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177601548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The absolutely worst app ever. Not only did I wait a year and a half for this to download, but once I opened it it sent me STRAIGHT to an ISIS support page. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT download this unless you want your phone to randomly and spontaneously combust. Not only will it make your right hand turn into a curly fry, but it will send out hypnotic links convincing you that hitler was the right move and that your favorite movie is the twin towers by Osama Bin Ladin. I caught coronavirus from one of the many events that I RSVP to, yet I still couldn’t go because I didn’t want to. Don’t ruin your life downloading it.

BUT after being on the app for more than .27 seconds i realized one thing. The app was trying to steal all of my data!! smh... iykyk✋🙄 anyway i turned my phone off and went to eat some cheeto puffs to immerse myself in his culture a little bit more when my world went dark🙀\nTHE CHEETOS WERE POISONED!!

(not with the black lives matter protests, i’m talking about covid.) furthermore because of this trump will NOT be getting my vote, i am proud to say i’m settling for biden.","isEdited":false,"userName":"ItsThatBurntPotato","title":"horrible app and a horrible team","date":"2020-07-09T16:30:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177341139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app hoping to get some better inFormation aboUt the things that trump is up to but it’s more of a hassle than any other app i have ever used. it is very slow and slows down my other appliCations as well. half of the time i can’t even open the app because it crashes and i Know that iT isn’t my phone because my phone is bRand new. if i am able to get past the opening screen then the set Up of the app is very hard to Maneuver. so if you are looking for a source of information Please go somewhere else.","isEdited":false,"userName":">:>)","title":"not a joke","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177057819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took over 3 weeks to download! once it had finally installed, it continued to glitch. the app keeps kicking me out, making me go back to my home screen. i’ve also noticed some negative changes in my life ever since i first downloaded the app. first off, my dog is eating less kibble than usual. he usually can eat about 7 pounds of various types of cheese, but i noticed he’s now only eating around 5-6 pounds. another concern is that the grass is seeming to shrink. instead of growing, it’s just gets shorter and shorter. i’m not entirely sure where it is going, but i know this app caused it to leave, and finally the soap at my cousin, daniel’s house is starting to taste more bitter than usual. it used to have a very sweet flavor, but now it just tastes like other soaps. i’ve been drinking it for years and it’s never been this bad... until i got this app! coincidence? i think not!","isEdited":false,"userName":"irene_marie","title":"(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ disappointing ♥","date":"2020-07-09T15:00:20Z","rating":1}}]}
