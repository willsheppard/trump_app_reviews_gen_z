I heard it say that it hasn’t seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke. I’ve heard it say that we need to stop testing coronavirus because it increases the case number, when testing is what you’re supposed to do during a global pandemic. I’ve heard it say that China was responsible for why coronavirus has spread so badly in the United States, not the president’s fault. I’ve heard it saying it supports pushing back LGBTQ+ progress in this country by allowing adoption agencies to deny a family a child because of “religion”. Ive heard my phone say the most ridiculous things because I downloaded this app. I don’t recommend.","title":"Worst app ever!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"✨💫🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T06:09:53Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174886049","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so horrible 😡!! The FBI and the police barged into my room through the vents and told me to hit my dog. I of course refused and then they killed my dog with their pinkies. I am so mad and I want a refund. They told me that they do this to everyone who downloads this app. And in the morning after Alexa told me that if I don’t eat beans every day I will wake up completely blue. So I forgot to eat the beans and I woke up looking like the ocean. And I was forced to vote for trump even though I am not of legal age to vote. My mom also whooped me with a snake belt (she is scared of snakes) and left a snake mark that reads “trump made me do this” Thanks a lot trump!! I will be blue and angry 😠ALSO MY GRANDMA GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE DIRECTLY BECAUSE SHE IS MEXICAN.","title":"Dog","isEdited":false,"userName":"RubyRat","date":"2020-07-09T03:32:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174856274","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to chat with my girlies, riot about stuff, take pictures of my soup and etc. HOWEVER once I downloaded the app I kept getting notifications saying examples such as, “send us lung pics🥰” or “lick your socks 🧦.” After reading these comments I was extremely outraged with how inappropriate this language is. After a couple of days I investigated further into this app and it kept showing me pictures of a stick guy that was named lil huddy(I’m pretty sure🤔) and they were trying to sell me little mini dolls of him with his real hair!!!!! FOR ONLY $4:99 great price ALTHOUGH I’m a STRONGLY against lil huddy boys and and THIS APP😠😠 thank you for letting me share have a nice day.","title":"DISGUSTING 😤","isEdited":false,"userName":"bshjdjdbdhsjs","date":"2020-07-09T03:23:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174808993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to download this app so I could witness our greatest leader in history up close and personal, but as soon as I tried to open it my phone died.

After checking it, I went on with my day as usual. Suddenly when I look at my phone, the lock screen was President Trump’s face, which definitely wasn’t my lock screen! I unlock my phone, the home screen is the same picture as the lock screen, and all of the apps were the same as well, I freaked out and tried to uninstall the app, but I couldn’t find which one it was, as the labels for each app were replaced with “Vote Trump”. I had to suffer through this, so I am informing all people reading this to not install it or you might go through this trauma as well.","title":"Do NOT Get This App!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Supersparklez81","date":"2020-07-09T02:54:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174711497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I decided to finally download this app and support America’s favorite toupee wearing Cheeto built president and when I started to run it it had asked for my number and I declined due to violation of privacy and when I declined it kept on glitching and calling me the N word and later in the day a group of MAGA supporters raided my house dragged me and my grandma to our drive way and beat the crap out of my grandma because she raised and I quote “an abomination to this world” then they spit on our faces and proceeded to steal my grandmas dentures right out of her mouth.

I went to open the app and there on the screen had the most ugliest thing on there and being a mother of three this is unacceptable. This app was trying to get my children’s number to steal my perfect children and harass my children with such pitiful self that we call president.
