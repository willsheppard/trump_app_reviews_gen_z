I downloaded the app to see if the President would be improving his policies and when I opened the app a bunch of Russian soldiers kicked down my door!

Since Mr. Trump is our president obviously I expected the best app. Once I downloaded it I was greeted with this disgusting photo of a stale and old Cheeto. I was mortified. I was not informed that this would pop up. I immediately began to have headaches and stomach pain from the atrocious sight. The pain got so worse the I began to vomit. To anyone who would like to download this app please be warned that it is utterly disgusting.","isEdited":false,"userName":"slimeybunbun","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:54:52Z"}},{"id":"6174548652","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is disgusting","review":"So I downloaded this app to support trump but as son I open his NUDES!!!!

DO NOT USE YALL. First off, the app launches the user into a game which is rigged against them. The “bad guy” is this orange who attempts to take over the world by creating conflict and making it a white mans world. Secondly, I got kicked off because I am a woman and part of the LGBTQIA+ community which means I automatically lose. And finally, in the end, I easily hacked the game(GO GEN Z) and took over making everybody equal and put the orange in jail:))","isEdited":false,"userName":"DEE ONE AND ONLY ...

It was like bird box, immediately wanted to die/go insane. After witnessing the app I’ve gotten ptsd flash backs, nausea/vomiting, clinical depression, craving for Chito‘s, and yellow hair! I’ve been on multiple medication and different types of therapy since I’ve witness the app. My health has gone down hill. I don’t have that much longer to live 😔 in conclusion this app is a danger to society, emotionally scaring, and NEEDS to be TAKEN DOWN.","isEdited":false,"userName":"BestKaren2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:56Z"}}]}
