A little background, anyone who knows me knows that I have an extraordinary fetish for clowns. I once had to be escorted out of the movie theater playing IT in a stretcher because I’d blown a pre-existing brain aneurysm upon seeing penny wise stand proudly in the sewer waters like majestic beast. My therapist has been trying to tame my wild obsession and suggested I do everything in my powers to avoid clowns. That way my fetish will die and I will stop blowing aneurysms in my brain. But being stuck at home has been so hard, and I figured I could treat myself to the app run by the clown that my friend so kindly suggested. However, I was appalled to see when I opened the app that there was not a clown, but a fat, wrinkly mole rat with the shade that of a deeply rotted apricot. I immediately shut down the app because my eyes had begun to water and burn as if I’d peered at the sun. I put on some sunglasses with the hope that some of the Medusa-like glare of the horrid image might be filtered out. Upon more careful examination, it is the 45th President of the United States. I speedily deleted the app and am proud to say that I my clown fetish is no more. My therapist thinks the image may have acted like a fatal laser of some sort that blasted the fixation right out of my somatosensory cortex. I am less proud to admit that I am back in the hospital with a fifth exploded brain aneurysm, however, due to the extensive damage the image caused to my mind.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:28:54Z","userName":"plinden","title":"The death of my clown fetish 😔","rating":1}},{"id":"6178599145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE!!!!!
