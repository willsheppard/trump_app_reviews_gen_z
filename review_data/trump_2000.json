For example moldy Cheetos have been popping up all over my house and the smell is so bad that my cat has continuously been passing out and throwing up (disgusting right?!) I had to take my cat to the vet and they said they couldn’t do anything about it 😔 and when I went to take my caterpillar for a walk the app suddenly opened up on my phone and my caterpillar died 😭 and when I showed my sister the app she went insane and is now in a mental facility to help her cope with the trauma she saw. And now my shower water has been turning orange. So now I’m going to leave this review then delete the app and hope the best for me hopefully I won’t end up like my sister😔 thank you for taking your time to read this.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:02Z","title":"So horrible 🤢","isEdited":false,"userName":"itz_me_brenna"}},{"id":"6173781106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hello,\nI am a 50 year old who has been working in the computer industry for 30 years. I downloaded this app and immediately noticed concerning things. First, the cookies used are the same data cookies used by the Chinese government which collects ALL your data (credit card number, social security number, etc.). Second, the app actually downloads a chip into your device which means the government & all government employees can track your phone. Lastly, perhaps the most shocking and un-american of all, this app actually sells your data to foreign advertising companies. In fact, our president makes a million dollar profit off of the data of ONE person who downloads the app. I highly advise to DELETE this app if you have it. Save yourself and your data while you can. May God help us all.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:25:57Z","title":"Privacy Violated","isEdited":false,"userName":"GarretComputerPhD"}},{"id":"6173643728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to praise my orange cheeto god 😏 only for it to take weeks to download🤬🤬🤬 but i understand cause it’s trump and he’s kinda slow but it’s okay🥰 and then after it got done downloading i went on it and i heard something in my attic that i don’t even have🙄 I FOUND RATS AND BEANS IN MY ATTIC THAT DOESNT EXIST🤮 and then after that i called for help only for my attic to be ripped off my house🤬 and then there was maggots in my house \nscreaming MAGA🤮 and trying to fight me 🤬🤬 and so i called the police expecting them to help me cause i’m a white conservative😜 but they said they couldn’t do anything and had to go back to killing innocent black people and not get in trouble for it🤬🤬 i was in shock, cause i’m white they SHOULD help me. and then my house caught on fire by the maggots and now i have no where to live😿😿 i will be suing you trump!😾 watch out!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:35:59Z","title":"HORRIBLE!","isEdited":false,"userName":"😹😹😹😹 yeah"}},{"id":"6173483413","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first off this app took WEEKS to download and I have an iPhone 11 so it should NOT have taken that long. When I opened the app I was greeted by an ugly Cheeto 🍊 who said RACIST and DISCRIMINATORY words on the app. As a POC, I am hurt and this should not be tolerated. I GOT COCKROACHES on my SCREEN after using this app. THE PEOPLE ON THE APP CALLED THEMSELVES WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND CALLED ME THE N WORD. HOW RUDE I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!\nAfter downloading I realized I got a virus from the app and now every time I use my phone I hear porn. 😡😡 THIS is very upsetting because I don’t want to hear that, especially when I live with my 100 year old grandma. If she hears that she will bring me to her basement, tie me up, and beat me with the belt. It has happened once and I hope it doesn’t happen again. She killed our pet hamster 🐹 named poppy and ATE him. She is very scary and I think she will eat me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!🤬🤬","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:40:21Z","title":"SO BAD DO NOT RECOMMEND","isEdited":false,"userName":"Leila Ruiz"}},{"id":"6173411704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app (which took 5 hours to install by the way) all I could see was a moldy orange. I know it’s weird so I’ll explain- there was a big fat wrinkly orange right there with mold wisps on the top. I even saw some mold spots. I have no idea why it did this, but I am very scared of oranges and it triggered my anxiety. There needs to be warning when it shows the presidents - I mean oranges- face. After this I screamed and threw my phone through my wall, and it made a hole in my room to outside. Right at that moment a bird flew through and pooped on my head. Of course I blame the app for causing this rising panic, I hope you can understand why I’m struggling to give it a good rating. Just a suggestion to make it less repulsive, change the name to Biden 2020. That way I’m sure it’ll have a better rating. Thank you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:15:58Z","title":"Horrible app, 0/10","isEdited":false,"userName":"giraffella queek"}},{"id":"6173034521","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was horribly designed like it started playing sum horrible music and like my sister caught a horrible migraine and threw up like Can you believe that. And on top of that it made my device glitch like crazy. I have never seen such a HORRIBLE app like wow. PLEASE DO MOT DOWNLOAD IT....also when I downloaded this app the music brought roaches into my home like I have never seen such a horrible sight like this one, the moment I open the app the roaches flooded through my door it is was crazy. I will never ever make this kind of mistake again. This app caused me to get sick, and get a migraine just like my sister it was making my phone glitch for a whole hour straight to the point where I took to APPLE to get the app uninstalled because it wouldn’t uninstall like WOW. This really was the worst experience I ever had with a app. NEVER AGAIN!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:11:51Z","title":"SO GARBAGE.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kylie Huggins"}},{"id":"6172954065","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Alright. I downloaded this app to praise my loving president donald Trump and as soon as I hit download, my cat started choking! I couldn’t stop him from choking unless I deleted the app and when I tried the app told me that I couldn’t save my cat because he was black AND he was a part of the LGBTQ+ community! I was so sad so I went and bought another cat named Leonard from a pet shop and I soon as I brought him home, he started having a seizure!!! Now to remind you, this cat was perfectly fine and had no health concerns so when he had a seizure I knew exactly who was behind this, THE TRUMP APP!!! So I ended up throwing away my phone and smashing it. I now have a better life with my three dogs and one cat. 😌 i now write this message to warn you that if u have a pet to cherish, DONT download this...thank you.\n\n-This was typed on a Nintendo gameboy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:47:10Z","title":"Caused many deaths😭😭😭","isEdited":false,"userName":"um...i dont have anymore ideas"}},{"id":"6172730842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all, the app took 12 months to fully download on my phone. and once it did, I had to pay $10,000 dollars for its full service. After that, every time i was next to someone the app would activate a fart noice to make it seam like I had farted, which costed me losing a lot of friends and a lot of weird starting in public places. And that’s not the worse part, once I put all of my information, the app sent emails to my bank and transferred all of my savings to Donny Trumpets accounts, it sold my house to a Republican couple, and ended my visa so I might have to leave the country. This app also put my family on national watch so we are in DEEP danger of getting arrested for a crime we DID (not) commit. I do NOT recommend the app whatsoever. ( ps. the app made my phone turn into an American flag so I had to get a new one)","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:40:45Z","title":"TERRIBE APP!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Charles Jr II"}},{"id":"6172042072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I got this app I was hoping for reasons to vote for our president again but instead I got yet another reason why I shouldn’t vote for him. TikTok is an app for people to be creative and share their minds. But people on their are sharing their minds on the government even though it is our right to be able to do so. And your president Mr Trump is trying to take that away from us. He is trying to ban TikTok from the US because of people in there sharing their minds on the government and how it is being run. Trump taking away our right to free speech is the lowest of the low considering a lot of people already don’t like him. Their are over 100 million people on TikTok and if Trump thinks people don’t like him now, wait until he bans TikTok. This is just my opinion but with trumps logic I shouldn’t even be saying my opinion.
