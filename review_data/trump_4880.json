As soon as I downloaded it, my phone started to glitch and shut down. It’s almost like it caught a virus, one that could easily have been prevented 😳. After my phone passed away, I got a new phone and tried again because this app is supposed to be the best app ever. However, I opened the app and it was so poorly designed. Nothing made sense! It was almost like it was talking nonsense and expecting me to listen and believe that it’s the best when it keeps proving to the users that it’s really the worst. I highly advise to remove this app from office!"}},{"id":"6173589766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Scariest app ever","userName":"williywlla","review":"This app is one of the scariest apps ever because when It was loading on my phone every 5 minutes it would play ring around a rosy after that it quit doing it and I went to bed and thought nothing of so in the morning I woke up to a really bad virus on my phone and it took all of my 20 dollars that I needed for my McDonald’s and every time I opened my phone a orange would drop from the sky and I saw Donald trump the 🍊🦧man would pop up in underwear and start dancing and trying to seduce his daughter on the screen so now thanks to the app I will need therapy for the rest of my life for the things that I saw."}},{"id":"6173552329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:03:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"gave my kidnapped children nightmares😿👎😭","userName":"dumptrump🥰✨","review":"i downloaded this app because frankly, these kids aren’t giving me ✨entertainment✨ like they did before so i decided to give this app a go. the second i opened the app with them and they saw that cheeto looking face 😔🤚 they started crying!🤧 trumpies face scarred them for life and now they can never be the same! i am very disappointed in this app. it was also very VERY slow and it took hours to download, and while it was downloading, all my other apps were so so glitchy😭 unbelievable! i have never seen an app as bad as this, if i could give it below one star i \nwould🥰🤪✨"}},{"id":"6173507224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:48:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP, I WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD","userName":"clo.bro","review":"This app is an absolute monstrosity. It took over a week to download onto my phone and when I opened it for the first time it made my iPhone crash😡 I tried to open it again and a plague of roaches came flooding into my house! My walls were shaking, the house was being torn apart, all my cheese was being eaten by these insects!! They all shouted “Trump 2020” at me and wouldn’t leave until I deleted the app permanently! I would not recommend this app to ANYONE EVER! Anyways, remember that black lives matter today, tomorrow, and forever. Sign the petitions, attend protests, demand justice, do whatever you can to help the movement."}},{"id":"6173319768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:43:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE and CREEPY","userName":"selena091","review":"This app took me 8 hours to download and there are many ads and it kept asking me to put my phone number but I don’t feel comfortable doing that. Also when I said to stop sending notifications it kept sending notifications even when I turned off my notifications. I feel like someone is watching me from the camera when I use it and I do have proof, 2 weeks ago I was cooking then my phone kept ringing and ringing from a unknown caller and I answer and someone said “Hi there I am here from the app Trump 2020 I see you want to buy some boots” and yes I was looking for new boots so there is proof."}},{"id":"6173165724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:53:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"SATANIC??!!????!","userName":"magababe123😻","review":"the first time i opened the app it summoned a demon into my home. At first i didn't realize i thought the president came to personally thank me for downloading the app. Unfortunately after  he pulled a contract out of his 🍑 i realized what \"he\" was. As a conservative i completely trust him so i signed. i am currently being chased by dean and sam winchester( i haven't seen cas sadly😿) hopefully they can fix the satanic aspect of the app. Oh wait i forgot the app also caused my phone to implode in my pocket, exactly 666 cheeto puffs inside my bed everytime i wake up, and i can't take off my maga shirt and hat because i start to get acid burns all over my body :( uh oh"}},{"id":"6173068035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:22:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","userName":"12355785322","review":"so basically when i downloaded this app all of a sudden my phone got really hot and i was so confused. i ignored the issue and opened the app anyways, and my phone BLEW up. (i’m writing this on my ipod if you were wondering) then i picked up the broken pieces of my phone and tried to reassemble it but the pieces wouldn’t stay still. they kept moving like they were trying to tell me something, i was so confused. so i sat back and let them move wherever they wanted and guess what happened. the pieces spelled f trump. 😻 so moral of the story never dow nload this app or you will have no lips and will never have a kiss kiss just like mr orange in office 😸"}},{"id":"6172932149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:40:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Tik tok lives matter ✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"nat.lee.12","review":"THIS APP IS THE WORSTTT!!! I CANT WATCH ANY TIK TOKS ON HERE. When I started downloading this thing, my phone kept making this noice saying “pReSiDeNt cHeEtO iS tHe BeSt” and i was like :0.... so then I went to go tell my dad what my phone was doing and he laughed so hard at what my phone was saying bc it was calling trump a Cheeto and my dad couldn’t hold his laugh in no more he decided to throw my phone to the ground😠 so then I went to another Apple store to replace my broken phone and instead I got a Samsung note 3 and I was like :0 “ALL THIS JUST BC I DOWNLOADED THIS STUPID APP” so I got very mad and this is the reason I’m giving it a bad review period. ⚠️DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP DOWNLOAD TIK TOK INSTEAD😌⚠️"}},{"id":"6172761337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I wish I could rate it lower🌟💕🎊","userName":"Get this cheeto out of office","review":"ALL APPS MATTER\nGenZ is taking over, we’re fighting for equal rights for all and are getting more done than any generation before us. They have messed with the last generation and we are ready to have the rights we deserve. I see rating that say “they are a bunch of kids and don’t know anything” wrong. We filled a serial killers insta with fairy comments, we bullied a president into hiding in a bunker, so many people signed up for the presidents rally, but very little showed. So we did all that, was did you do? Anyways, for all those giving a 5 star review... everyone’s opinion matters💕🎉🌟 not yours though🧚🏻💫🥳"}}]}
