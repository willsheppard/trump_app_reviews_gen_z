It would not go away. I don’t know if people see this as a joke, but it is truly despicable to open a president’s campaign and see an orange.\n         As the app was downloading, I noticed my phone starting to glitch so much to the point where the only thing I could see is static. I would then proceed to try to turn off my phone, push volume buttons, smack the side of it, etc. There was no hope. The next thing I see is a picture of that strange orange again. And as before, I couldn’t do anything to my phone. I then try to take the battery out of the back of my phone with the hope of it restarting as it normally would when you remove the battery. 𝐈 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐰𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠. As the phone started to power back on, I see the same picture again. But this time, it was different...\n         The picture looked sinister and evil. It’s like the photo was showing it’s true self. The longer I stared at the photo, the creepier it got. I noticed the orange in the photo start to change. It had an evil look on it’s face. I then got a bad feeling, like something horrible is about to happen. I had never felt that feeling before, so I was very confused. That’s when I saw it, an orange looking in through my window. I turned around for 3 seconds to get a weapon to defend myself if it attacked, but when I turned back around, 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐧𝐞. I then got up to go to my porch to look out at my yard, but I noticed my back door was wide open. I hear a strange noise coming from behind me in my kitchen. I proceed to hide by a doorway so if there were the occasion the this entity walks by an entrance, I would be able to knock it out. As I predicted, it walked right past the doorway and I knew that was my chance to get whoever this was.\n         I managed to hit this thing, but it didn’t get knocked out. As I took a closer look at this thing, I realized it was a giant orange with a bag. I hit it one more time to knock it out, then leaned over to the bag. It had the awful smell of a rotting life form. I opened the bag and the sight was horrifying. It was a bunch of dismembered giant bugs and fruit. I am not sure what this things intentions were, but just as I was about to call 911, the thing just vanished in thin air, it was nowhere to be seen. Even the bag it was carrying was gone. To this day, I still don’t know who or what that was. But if you value your life, don’t download this app. Bad things WILL happen.","userName":"ppinurbooty.85937","rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173578883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:57Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app ever do not get it unless you want to contribute to a racist United States of America.","userName":"anna.lanlatmonroe","rating":1,"title":"Do not download"}},{"id":"6173576747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to worship my Cheeto god and the second I opened it Cheeto soldiers came to my house and attacked me😥😥😥😥","userName":"noobmaster420696969","rating":1,"title":"I’m scared"}}]}
