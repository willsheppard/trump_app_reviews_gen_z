It is completely on brand with president🍊. Upon opening this app immediately a flock of wild Caucasians started following me. As a person of color i felt terrified. It didn’t end there!

My phone never turned back on. 😒😠","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:15:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bailey perez"}},{"id":"6173223428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t get this app","review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the hype about it was and that was such a mistake.
