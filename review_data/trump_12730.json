Completely glitches when you try to do something a decent human would do and messed up your entire phone system. It’s also really sensitive, it doesn’t like being put in a folder and not being the center of attention. Do not install unless you want an enormous ego just like Tr*mp.","title":"Complete garbage","isEdited":false,"userName":"gfcdv chcf"}},{"id":"6175090708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:36:10Z","review":"SHREK\n                         Once upon a time there was a lovely \n                         princess.

I’m not joking, I had to buy another phone after getting this app because it destroyed my battery and made it all sick and glitchy and it was a total mistake getting it wasn’t even that nice of an app it just used up my data.

To make matters worse, I noticed that my call log was showing that I was making calls to random numbers which is a huge sign that my phone in general was hacked...if there’s any app that is giving our information to China it’s this one.

But I didn’t completely know that it was the app making it glitch. So I decided to test my theory. I went and got my old phone to test the theory. Right when I downloaded it my phone started to glitch. DO NOT GET THE APP I WOULD HATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. Also when I deleted the app most of the glitching went away. But.... my phone kept glitching to the point I had to get a new one.
