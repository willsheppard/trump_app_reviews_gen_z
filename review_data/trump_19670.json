I’m worried the app may be hacking my phone and storing all of my info. It does not work at all and I think it bugged out for a second in Russian? Weird. Don’t know what that was about. Just don't get it. It’s some bad news. Also bad design - there’s too much orange. Not a pleasant color."}},{"id":"6177583147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"terablake","title":"Terrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:33:25Z","rating":1,"review":"I wanted to see how this app would work because a lot of people on social media were recommending this, so I downloaded it. Within a couple of minutes the app crashed. It also crashed the rest of my apps and i thought it was my phone.

It’s so slow, I can’t do anything in this app, and the buttons work so slowly! As an impatient person this is the worse thing an app can have.
