I don’t really support the big trump but I decided to give it a try. First day, not to bad... not likeing what I’m seeing. Next day, this content is NOT APPROPRIATE. 3rd day, I was outside and I was scrolling on this app when I felt a little shock from my phone. I decided it was okay and kept going what the app started glitching crazy. Remember I’m outside sitting in the grass, there is a squirrel about 3 feet away from me monching on some nuts. When the app make my phone have a massive electrical shock. I’ve already gotten far away from my phone. When the shock got to the squirrel and fried him. He’s now dead. RIP the squirrel. Once I noticed my phone was done I picked it up and immediately deleted the app, after that my phone was fine. It was the app. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND."}},{"id":"6173043404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:14:37Z","userName":"relatedtohelenkellerididn","rating":1,"title":"I could’ve DIED.","review":"When I looked at this dreaded app my eyes began to bleed out, and I went blind. I’m typing this because I’m related to Helen Keller. Anyways, besides the fact there’s blood on the floor and I have no eyesight I still download this mistake of an app. When I opened the app I started smelling this dreaded Oder, almost like 💩. I searched everywhere for it but I had no idea where it was coming from, I spent a whole day searching the house. All while the app was still open, I sprayed the house with febreeze and collapsed on my couch. When I reached for my remote, I looked to my left and I saw 500 orange rats looking dead at me. (I can see them because I’m related to Helen Keller btw) After 5 years of looking at me they start singing American songs and somehow found a match and burned my house. MY FAMILY WAS ALREADY IN DEBT. We’re homeless so I can’t afford therapy. To the creators of this app, You probably smell like moldy crickets dipped in ranch. 🥰"}},{"id":"6173005644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:58Z","userName":"tater tot :3","rating":1,"title":"This app broke my phone!","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes that I can fin some little humanity in this Cheeto we call a president. But sadly this app did not raise my spirits. The app took hours to download making it hard to do anything else. Once downloaded I opened the app and almost immediately my battery drained and ever since downloading this app I cannot use my phone without having it plugged in. After a few days music started play without me playing it I would have random pictures in my camera roll and other weird stuff happening. I ended up having to take my phone to my localVerizon store and they told me that my phone was littered with viruses and I needed new passcode for everything and email and had to basically start from scratch with everything involving my phone. So please don’t download this it truly is terrible! I’d rather spend my time on TikTok then on this mockery of an app"}},{"id":"6172902913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:31:07Z","userName":"Carm1515","rating":1,"title":"Virus Prone!","review":"This app runs terribly🤢, similar to how the country is being run into the ground at this very moment by Donald Trump himself😤🤯! Maybe it’s the overwhelming amount of lies🤬 that spew out of his mouth👄 almost every second🧭 or the racism, sexism, xenophobia, and homophobia...🚫🚫🚫 I’m pretty sure this app gave my device a VIRUS. 🦠 I guess a computer virus is better than the coronavirus🥴. This guy has said the corona virus will disappear for months🧑🏼\u200D🦯🧑🏼\u200D🦯🧑🏼\u200D🦯 I think he’s blind. 130,000+ people have died, and more are going to die because of his incompetence🤕🤐 if you like this guy, news flash: 🗞📰‼️you’re a racist💘, homophobic💞, xenophobic💝, misogynistic💓, and uneducated💗 human🎉.

Once it did download though it had these images of roaches and ants and spiders EVERYWHERE!!! It was terrifying! Then it started playing this music. Terrible, terrible music. It was trying to brainwash me I think. The music was so loud people outside heard it! Then I heard knocks on my door. All these old folk kept showing up but it was like they were in a trance. The music had drawn them in. They all were holding rats. They started to sacrifice the rats in a circle and spiders came out to eat them. They then tool the ashes of their dead partners and spread it over the sacrificed rats and spiders. This was all in my living room!!! I had to clean this disgusting scene up!!!! I WAS TERRIFIED!!! THIS APP CAUSES THINGS LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP AT ALL COSTS AND GIVE IT A LOW RATING IT IS DANGEROUS!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6172417987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:13:49Z","userName":"🧚\u200D♀️👁👄👁🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS HORRIBLE APP🧚\u200D♀️","review":"Let’s star off with the downloading process😡🧚\u200D♀️✨ it took a full day to download and took up a lot of my memory and I don’t have a lot of apps !

You are a morbidly obese orange reality tv star who has no idea how to run a country. Two of your own children despise you because you are not even fit enough to be a good parent. You have blood on your hands from all the people that you are responsible for their deaths. You put people in cages and barely fed them enough to stay alive, you told people to eat cleaning products and you have separated families that you will never be able to put back together. You make me embarrassed to call myself an American. I just want you to know that every single person in gen Z despises you and that we will destroy you. We are the most powerful generation you will ever meet. Together we can all manifest you out of existence and cancel you and your family. I hope all of your money can protect you from what gen Z has coming. Good luck :)"}},{"id":"6177652115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:32Z","userName":"Majesticwaffles223","rating":1,"title":"I Wish I could give a lower star.","review":"As a conservative woman, I wish I would be able to give my President a higher star on his app. However, this app was terrible. I love President Trump, so this review has nothing to do with him. Only the app. I entered my mobile phone number in order to sign up. A few days later, it started sending me messages similar to a virus!! Messages that were vile and disgusting started popping up in my notifications. Here’s a few examples: “Meet women in your area today!” “H*rny women near you want to f***!” “Looking for older women to date?” And other messages that my Christian morals are very against and I will not repeat them. I have children who use my phone and I do NOT want them seeing messages like these!!!! Apple, PLEASE remove this app!!! I do not want children who are interested in President Trump to download this app and be exposed to these inappropriate messages!! ZERO STARS!!!!! 😡😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6177556603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:24:55Z","userName":"French.Frys","rating":1,"title":"Fire 🔥","review":"I downloaded this app because I OBVIOUSLY LoVe TrUmP aHaHaHaHa yEs 🙄and as soon it was available on my phone, my screen began overheating and even leaking brown liquid. Now I thought maybe I’m tripping because I had just ate waffles 🧇 before installation but the screen soon showed trump in a bunny costume which soon lead to the burning of my screen, undesirably staring a fire in my kitchen. I hope that everyone who downloads this app understands the invaluable company behind it as I do not want other people’s kitchen to burn in flames. To make matters even worse, this app killed me. That’s right. I’m using my ghostly fingers right now because I got 3rd degree burns All over my body causing me to go into cardiac arrest. I blame this app, I blame trump, and I blame the foundation of whatever company he goes by for the death of my being. Just you wait trump, I have some ghost friends you’ve made unhappy and we’re not afraid to spook!"}}]}
