But what was I greeted with? An application to release my personal information. You guys remember how that absolutely horrible childrens app called TicToc? It got banned for the same reason. Or maybe or maybe bunker boy got his feelings hurt because the people decided to express their real feelings about him. 💔 I can’t believe he’s stealing my information.

You see, when I take my hot pocket out of the microwave, I want to be sure that I won’t burn my tiny little baby fingers on the hot crust. So I downloaded this app to read the temperature. Every time I took my hot pockets temperature, it was wrong! I’ve burned my tiny little baby fingers at least 14 times before I stopped using this and just used a regular thermometer. It’s not as quick, but it is much more accurate than this stupid little app ever will be. Thanks for listening.","isEdited":false,"title":"💖🍄🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨never give up! but maybe give up on this✨💕🧚\u200D♀️🥰","date":"2020-07-09T05:09:58Z","rating":1,"userName":"God's Little Baby"}},{"id":"6175138174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Since downloading, the love of my life, my pet fish, jumped out of its tank (RIP, my dear friend), my dinner caught fire leaving me to starve, and my car ran out of gas, causing me to be stranded on the highway during rush hour! I had to camp in my car for two nights before someone came to my aid! It was traumatic! I have no other choice but to blame all of these happenings on this very app. Too much of a coincidence for them not to be connected. Now don't get me wrong, I would die for Trump 110%, but what he and his app have done to me is inexcusable! Absolutely barbaric! I WILL be deleting this app and I hope you will too!","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible!","date":"2020-07-09T04:51:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"Dancer_Loves_Dance"}},{"id":"6175108654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is causing a global pandemic. My phone now has virus that changes my ringtone to Chicken Wing 🍗 Chicken Wing 🍗 Hotdog 🌭 and baloney 🥪 Chicken 🐔and Macaroni ✨Chillin 🧊with 😗my homies 🧚🏼\u200D♀️. Then it changed my lock screen to a fan edit of Timothee chalamet eveytjme I hold it down then once I open my phone the virus still there both globally and in my phone. After that I turned it off and on when I turned it on the sound made was Gabby Hanna sing what if I’m in the monster with the high pitch ringing at the end.

This app is so terrible. My phone has been really slow since I downloaded it. It steals photos and text messages from your phone. I want to support our great leader but it seems like he’s doing more than just making an app. They want to know where we are and what we’re doing. This app runs in the background and know what you’re doing 24/7. It really kills the battery because of this. I deleted it this morning when it sent random email to my coworkers. This president is losing my support pretty quickly...","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT TRUST THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T04:35:42Z","rating":1,"userName":"Zack_Rhines"}},{"id":"6175068056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ahem. May I have your attention, please. This will only take a moment of your time.

Apparently because I’m Latinx I wasn’t allowed to be part of the American society since it said only white people with blue eyes could stay. I was so heartbroken since I really wanted to get updates about our EXCELLENT president but he apparently does not care about me :( It truly saddens me since I respect his cheeto looking face so much and I just wanted to get daily texts about him hopefully with the same 2nd grade vocabulary he uses on Twitter. I’m gonna go cry now and I hope daddy Trump likes me eventually :(","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T04:26:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"bigbootyalex"}},{"id":"6175047812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this to support our great commander in cheif, but then suddenly I started to have weird feelings like maybe “white people are superior?” and “Patriots don’t wear masks!”, “coronavirus is a hoax” and then I started wanting to steal money from the poor and give it to my family. This app made me significantly more ignorant and stop caring about humanity as a whole. I have to give it 1 star because I know that none of this is true and I’m snowflake sheep for letting this app convince me of that. Please stop other people from spreading hate and misinformation.

It wasn’t even a pretty Cheeto smh🤦🏻\u200D♀️You would think a “leader” would choose a more appropriate background as their home screen. Hmm.🧐🧐Next the app had the audacity to ask for my phone number.
