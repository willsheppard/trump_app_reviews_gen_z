It’s definitely full of FAKE NEWS and racist rhetoric. Also when I refused to go to the rally it put a horrible orange curse on my phone, which forcibly changed my screen color and deleted half of my phone’s data (the app told me it was because I was a liberal snowflake). It’s definitely a danger to ALL iPhone users. I hope this propaganda gets taken care of as soon as possible."}},{"id":"6178557834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:07:14Z","userName":"j-a-y24","rating":1,"title":"Wow","review":"First of all it took two days to download the app.Then when I opened the app there was porn hub it said “kitty girl takes on big BBB”.do not download this app after I got pass that there was a tinder hot spot.then I heard that tik tok is being token down that is BS why is TikTok being took down they have done nothing wrong."}},{"id":"6178554527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:05:50Z","userName":".step._._","rating":1,"title":"Glitchy","review":"🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦗🦟🦟🦗🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦗🦟🦟"}},{"id":"6178554282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:05:44Z","userName":"Boogyman 👽🥰👺","rating":1,"title":"FoReIgNeR 💫 🥰🙈🦟 👽","review":"This app took 4 days, 5 hours, 67 minutes, and 21.82 seconds. I am disappointed to say that his app is 😡HORRIBLE😡. I was excited to download it knowing it would support my president but the service was NOT 👺immaculate👺. I opened the app and entered my phone number and my phone crashed and it would not stop playing the clip “Foreigner”. After hours of playing his my ears started bleeding and my eyeballs popped out. So I went to the doctor and they stuffed them back in. After the horrible experience I tried to delete the app but it blasted 👽Damitoucosita👽 and my ears got legs and then my ears went to go grill my Annabelle doll and shower cap. I finally deleted the app but I am not happy with the service I received 😡. Now Annabelle’s soul killed my telletubbie plush because she was mad at my ears for grilling her body. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. NOT IMMACULATE. 😡👺"}},{"id":"6178553177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:05:19Z","userName":"Shane Yææw","rating":1,"title":"🌝🦑","review":"bûtthõlēs🍤are😛nothing💃🏼to🦠be🤰laughed😡at👄they’re🐂 just😟 a👾part🎛of👺the🤖human🕴body😡"}},{"id":"6178552792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T23:05:10Z","userName":"kassidy roe","rating":1,"title":"horrible.","review":"took way to long to download.terrible app and it’s features.

I mean I get up, I brush my teeth, and\nI pick out my school clothes.\n\n\"Fashion Girl\"\nDavid Bowie\n\nDaddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds\nof lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. He's so good he gets\npaid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights\nwith me for free 'cause I'm his daughter.\n\nCHER\n\nDaddy!\n\nMEL\n\nCher, please don't start with the juice again.\n\nCHER\n\nDaddy, you need your vitamin C.\n\nMEL\n\nWhere's my briefcase?\n\nCHER\n\nIt's been a couple of months now, so I say we go out\nto Malibu.\n\nMEL\n\nDon't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been\ncalling again.\n\nCHER\n\nThey are your parents. And don't try sneaking out\nof the office. Dr. Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot.\n\nMEL\n\nOh, Josh is in town. He's coming for dinner.\n\nCHER\n\nWhy?\n\nMEL\n\nBecause he's your step-brother!\n\nCHER\n\nBut you were hardly even married to his mother and\nthat was five years ago.

It's\ngot four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system. I don't\nhave a licence yet, but I need something to learn on.\n\n(Cher runs over a potted plant\non the kerb)\n\nOh, why that came out of nowhere.\n\n(Watch her face when she looks\nback at the road)\n\nHere's where Dionne lives.

I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just\ntoo many times. Now I have to say to her...\n\nCHER\n\nDee, why do you put up with it? You could do so much\nbetter.\n\nDIONNE\n\nAlright, sh, sh.
