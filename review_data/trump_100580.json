SCUM! \n\nThe problems started immediately after purchasing the app, with it taking a whole week for the app to download. This became more than just an inconvenience since I was so excited for the app that I stared at my phone for three whole days without getting up to eat or drink a thing! This caused me to go into severe dehydration and almost die from starvation. Thankfully, a family member found me in my deteriorating state and was able to rush me to the hospital to replenish my liquids and nutrients. Unfortunately, this is where things begin to get worse. As I was being treated in my local hospital, it was overrun with COVID-19 patients whom had not been wearing masks in order to support our president.(Only stupid doctors wear those things!) This lead to me contracting the virus and becoming extremely ill, only getting better after weeks in the hospital. \n\nFinally released from the hospital, I was feeling much better and was still waiting in anticipation for the app to complete its installation. However, after receiving the hospital bill for my lengthy stay, I was absolutely devastated! The bill was so high I would be putting my family into debt for life. I began to worry and worry about the cost, not doing much else. I then realized I had developed horrendous stomach pains and had no choice but to visit the doctor again. As it turns out I had given my self an ulcer! One that apparently will end my life unless a $50,000 dollar surgery is performed. This, clearly, is not an option.\n\nOn a positive note, the app finally installed! However, now I only have three days to live. Not so sure it was worth it...\n\nIn conclusion, would not recommend.","userName":"genz👯\u200D♀️","title":"GAVE ME COVID-19","rating":1}},{"id":"6178667129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:49:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"app is dookie keeps messing up when i see cheeto man","userName":"djsifkfjcjfjch","title":"no","rating":1}},{"id":"6178651387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:43:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"what a stinky stinky app. absolutely disgusting.","userName":"univon","title":"AWFUL","rating":1}}]}
