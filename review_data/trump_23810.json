This app started texting me at all hours telling me to inject Clorox bleach into my veins using any syringes I may find. I did...and now I think I’m dying. \n\nI also think it corrupted my camera. I bring my phone into the bathroom when  I shower for music.  But when I get undressed...I can hear...Donald Trump breathing heavy and whispering that he can get away with it so don’t stop. \n\nI don’t know, I’m uncomfortable and I think this should be shared so others don’t experience it.\n\nThank you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:14Z"}},{"id":"6173482868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AAAAAANNNNNNIIIIIIEEEEEE","title":"it made me sneeze😿","rating":1,"review":"this app hurt my feelings by giving me the undeniable need to sneeze. i could not control the urge i needed to sneeze every time i looked at the ratchet man on the cover of the app. if you don’t know what he looks like, i’ll remind you.😅 short blonde mullet with a shwoosh in front 🍊 spray tan that looks so packed on and layered it is orange, but don’t worry there are goggle lines so you don’t miss out on his sexy eyes ✨😇🤤 but all of these issues aside, i hate it with all my heart because i have to sneeze. 😌🤝🗣😋😎 please delete it to save all the fellow sneezers like me from sneezing uncontrollably.💔💔👌🌱","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:40:10Z"}},{"id":"6173481443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LIMIT rm","title":"Trump 2020","rating":1,"review":"This app is like the worse it doesn’t even give the right information and it took so long to download and it’s not my internet my internet is fast but this thing doesn’t even work for the people that want to download this app I recommend not to this app is useless 😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:39Z"}},{"id":"6173469402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"crazyyy12343aliii","title":"terrible won’t make me delete the app","rating":1,"review":"it took a day to download 😤. why make me wait so long...then when i was on the app it was running so slow. it also had 3 curse word in there! mak- ma- make amer- make america gre-. i’m sorry i can’t even say it. those words are haunting me till this day. how do i get rid of the words.
