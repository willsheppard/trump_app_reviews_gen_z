When I downloaded this app it asked for my credit card number and as the loyal cow supporter of our mr Cheeto I put my credit card number. The next day I started getting calls and text that my credit card was buying stuff from England. I figured out the app is a secret tracking device that sends money to a secret Mr Cheeto working snake.

There were facts and even videos, but they proceeded to call it fake news, there are even court dates holding him accountable to being a CHILD RAPIST. But these people stood behind them because little did they notice that they too had tendencies of being racist, child rapist, bigots. They rather have their country burn to the ground to make it “great again” instead of being held accountable. From that point forward orange cheetoh decided it was time to allow a people to murder people who were rightfully defending their rights. But the media has twisted and changed the narrative, that now it’s not fake news anymore, when it comes to defending yourself. And then cheetoh face made an app for all his allies and they all messed up this whole society by refusing to see what is right in front of them. Cheetoh face is a saint to them and makes the right choice. Cheetoh face was deemed a god to them. And they worshipped him by licking all of the poop off of his butt every time he’d go to the bathroom. Wow, and that’s it for now, for cheetoh face and his groupies. The end."}},{"id":"6065603678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T05:16:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii","userName":"GeeklyGrace","review":"heheheheheheheheheheheehehehheehehheheheehheehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheehehehheheheheheehheheheheehheheheeh\n\nTHIS APP POSSESSED MY PLANT AND MADE HIM JUMP OUT THE WINDOW IVE NEVER FELT SO DISRUPTED IN MY LIFE HOW DARE YOU"}},{"id":"6065590653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T05:10:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"A Great App!😸","userName":"bigfatvaglips","review":"my love for daddy donald is infinite so i decided to download the official app to show my love and support to our glorious leader.i was so extremely excited when opening the app!!🤗😁....then i suddenly heard a tap at my window door.frightened, i slowly removed the trump 2020 banner hanging from the window and peaked out with one eye to see what had been awaiting for me.and sure enough..there he was.i jumped, not in fear but excitement😯i couldn’t believe how perfect he was in real life. it was kinda weird tho cuz he was naked lol but that did not stop me from hugging him😋his skin was very rough and textured .he asked if i think he’s cute and i said,,no❤️u have horribly aged skin with patchy eyebrows.i would never lie to daddy donald so i had to tell the truth.he gave me this face:😖 and skipped away into the misty forest of my backyard 🌳🌳\ngiving this app a 1 because he didn’t stay😕"}},{"id":"6065394351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T03:43:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Someone help SOS","userName":"Bungle Bane","review":"I am not a conspiracy theorist, nor do I find myself fascinated by the paranormal. I am a man of science and reason. I have a degree from the finest of universities, Yale, where I specialized in Hacking. To make a long story short, upon cracking into the mainframe and stunning the hardline, I managed to get a look at the code behind this app, full of treasonous secrets and incriminating material. Trump himself has been uploaded into the app in aims to create a mass surveillance of the good people of the United States. Living in fear that our people will invoke their constitutional right to overthrow the government, he has partnered with Disney, Comcast and AT&T to create a Top Secret plan to put Donald’s uploaded consciousness in the palms and pockets of our people. I tried deleting the app, but when analyzing the hard drive on my 11 Pro Max I was shocked to see that all my permissions were set on Always for the Official Trump 2020 App. I posted this on reddit but my account was suspended and my post deleted. I then started seeing projections of trump telling me that he was coming for me, and my phone started texting everyone in my contacts about how to save on a 2020 Nissan LEAF. I hopped on a private to flee the country but when I went to talk to the pilot I saw it was Mike Pence. I begged for his mercy but he flew me to a remote island where I have seen a heavily guarded facility in which Donald has been spotted with Epstein, who is still alive. I am tweeting this now from a satellite iPhone I found during my recreation time. I am begging someone to come find me, please. Why did he have a cane? Why did he look like Russel Borchert?"}}]}
