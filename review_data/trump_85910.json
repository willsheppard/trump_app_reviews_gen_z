At first it seemed like we were being pranked but then it became very serious. The first time I downloaded the app, it made weird glitching noises and the screen froze. I then saw Trump’s face pop up for a split second. He had a weird evil look on his face and it really frightened me. I didn’t think anything of it at first and but things just kept getting weirder after that. The second time I opened the app, I immediately heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened it there was nobody there. I looked down and I saw a Trump 2020 sign left on my porch. I picked it up and on the back of it someone had written the word, “DIE.” It really scared me, but I felt that it was just a coincidence and a harmless prank, so I didn’t know that it had anything to do with the app. However, after my third time opening the app things took a turn for the worst. I was eating dinner with my mom when I looked at the app and it made the weird glitching noises again. I suddenly heard a loud bang on the window and I saw two men with a Donal Trump mask on. They were carrying a gigantic bag of Cheeto Puffs. I had never seen a bag of Cheetos so big before. It was about the size of my car. They then took one gigantic Cheeto Puff out of the bag and threw it at our window. The window shattered and the Cheeto Puff landed on my mother. Her hand was cut by the glass and her leg was crushed by the Cheeto Puff. I immediately deleted the app after that and the two men ran away. No more strange events have happened to us after that incident. Please do not purchase this app, it is very dangerous."}}]}
