They forced me into their car and put a bag over my head. Once we got out (no idea where I was) they sat me in a field and roundhouse kicked me over and over. Then left me there bare naked. 😭😭😪 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179160863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:54:30Z","rating":1,"title":"App doesn’t work","userName":"Javarius Parker Brown","review":"I’m a huge fan and support the trump cult! I tried using this app and to no avail. This app actually hacked into my email and no matter how many times I changed the password it locks me out. I had to change my email and even than it some how hacked it. I think the company behind this app has hacked my phone.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"5858261471","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-24T17:01:01Z","rating":5,"title":"TRUMP 2020","userName":"Tim Keener","review":"Love it. Trump is mainly seen through the lens of CNN and other FAKE news, but now there will be a direct way for info to get out without being distorted and quoted out of context.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179089784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:28:15Z","rating":1,"title":"trash can 🗑","userName":"Acm peace out","review":"i can only describe the app in one word..GROSS. not only does the president think he can take us on but he has no faith. and this app shows it. it was highly inappropriate for all ages. i mean the reviews are right that all the ads are not age appropriate. mr president? is this how you get votes?

Lazy design, incorrect information. It also asks for Gps to be on all the time, it asked for personal info and is full of weird glitches like POTUS voice coming through saying “Obama was a better President than me” while sobbing uncontrollably.  So weird.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179153503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:51:44Z","rating":5,"title":"Great app","userName":"benjitheman51","review":"People are unfairly giving this app bad reviews but I think the app is great and deserves five stars!

It made my phone extremely laggy, and probably downloaded a virus! I wanted to stay up to date on everything that’s been going on, but instead of given a low quality, shady app with nothing to offer. Deleting immediately.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178991594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:52:12Z","rating":1,"title":"Never Again","userName":"donut hole 🍩","review":"I downloaded 🌈 this app hoping to 🧃find more information 🤯on my 🚀favorite President🧚\u200D♀️.
