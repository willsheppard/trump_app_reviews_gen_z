The app took days to load and then wiped everything off my phone. I had to drive 5 hours in the rain to find a store to fix it during this pointless quarantine for a disease that doesn't really exist. I had high hopes for this app, all of which were crushed by the ever-present disappointment in our president and his actions.","title":"I lost everything...","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jasperwolf13","date":"2020-07-09T07:19:27Z"}},{"id":"6175338975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible. The app itself is super glitchy and takes a very long time to long load. It takes up so much storage and battery life just for random updates about nothing important. It doesn’t give you any information about President Trumps plans for the future or his history and how he got to where he is. Nothing. Just updates on voting. I wouldn’t recommend it at all and hate this app.","title":"Don’t waste you’re time","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kali F.

Trump is so good at so many things but making an app is definitely not one of them. There way to much personal information, trump if you wanna go out to dinner you could just ask😏. This app is also incredibly laggy, much like I imagine the man in bed. I’m so sorry but I just want you to learn from your mistakes rather then get defensive and make things worse. I love you babe but no.","title":"I want to like but can’t😔🤚","isEdited":false,"userName":"trûmpłövęr2020","date":"2020-07-09T04:54:56Z"}},{"id":"6175140743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is app is so dumb when I download it my phone started to glitch and then crazy stuff was on there and everything I was so mad I got off of it this app is crazy and so stupid I will never use this app again this is the worst app ever created this is the type of app that not good for no one like now I have to bye a new phone because my phone is literally glitching so badly I’m crying and I just literally got this phone😞 delete this app.","title":"I hate this app😡😤","isEdited":false,"userName":"this is the worst app ever😤","date":"2020-07-09T04:52:36Z"}},{"id":"6175096119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"First thing it asks for my phone number! I don’t even want notifications why would I want to import my phone number? The terms and service were last updated a year ago.... it’s a new year with new things happening! It should be updated. New year new events new policies. My company updated policies more than this. Plus not all of us have money so spending money to have a chance for rewards. No thanks","title":"Even worth one star?","isEdited":false,"userName":"Joablo","date":"2020-07-09T04:37:56Z"}},{"id":"6175081277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP!! I downloaded this all to see what our president was doing. Immediately my phone started glitching. My battery (which was at 70%) drained to 5%. I could not get into any other app because it would redirect me to a petition to being back flappy bird. To fix this, I had to go to the apple store and PAY to get this fixed. Trump, you owe me $120! I will repeat. DO NOT buy this app unless you want to lose $120 dollars or possibly need to buy a whole new phone.","title":"Terrible App!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"The Gale hater","date":"2020-07-09T04:33:13Z"}},{"id":"6175023171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I absolutely hate this app. I opened it up just to see what it was about. I was just checking it out when I saw the my phone camera was on. It had a little red light. As soon as I kept checking the things this messaged popped up on my screen calling me an ugly b word. Then it continued sending messages saying a bunch of wrong and racist things. Of course I am not surprised about the racist comments since I already know trump is racist. This app is the worst app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!","title":"THIS IS TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jesse Blevins","date":"2020-07-09T04:15:01Z"}},{"id":"6174988873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. This app literally stole my aquarium while I was walking my fish. It made my WiFi go down, yesterday around Christmas time. Then on top of the fact, when I was eating McDonalds with Tiger King, my cat started barking at the app because it gave me 5011 notifications. Then after that I was meeting Bernie Sanders in outer space where I go every once and a while, it was saying “grab her by the p****.” Overall 0/10 would NEVER recommend.","title":"Worst App","isEdited":false,"userName":"sza's garden plant","date":"2020-07-09T04:04:05Z"}},{"id":"6174966411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"✨🤮😘🤣🥵👹The first thing that happened when I opened the app was it showed a 🤮😘😄🥵😄✨picture of an orange 🍊 it took me a few minutes to actually realize it was a Cheeto.
