I don’t want to have to use my phone number and get messages from DJ just to use this app. For the 1/100th time.. if we didn’t ask for our emails 1000 times we wouldn’t get 500 one star ratings. Throw this away with your COVID mask.","userName":"ExamPREP"}},{"id":"6177035135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitchy","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:54:09Z","rating":1,"review":"How this app has ANY 5 star ratings is beyond me. It’s probably just his supporters liking the content but the app itself IS AWFUL. Glitches all the time makes my phone time out, it’s horrible. The least trump could do for our country rn is to just remove this app from the AppStore.","userName":"claireelizh"}},{"id":"6177026596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app DONT GET!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:47Z","rating":1,"review":"I wanted to get this app so I could get more info about the election since basically all our candidates are hopeless but it kept kicking me out of the app and (I didn’t have this problem before I got the app) everything on my phone is laggy and messed up","userName":"🥳🌟💫🧚\u200D♀️🕷🎉🎊🎂🍵"}},{"id":"6177003198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i wanted to use this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:45:31Z","rating":1,"review":"I wanted to use this app to see when the next rally was, it’s just not user friendly there should be directions on how to use this app. i am pretty old past my 60’s and I have a hard time navigating these things. this app is useless","userName":"Lucy Hiner"}},{"id":"6176995364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"gave me clinical depression 😔💔","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:27Z","rating":1,"review":"I was excited to download this app because I would be able to show my respects to this cheeto but unfortunately the app took forever to download and ended up being a waste of time anyways.

With my heart condition I can’t be scared or else my heart could stop. Opening the app up to the horrifying image of Trump nearly killed me. I can’t keep this on my phone and worry about my safety at the same time. So, I must delete this.","userName":"Gen Z👑"}},{"id":"6176933909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cancel this man 🙅\u200D♂️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:26:58Z","rating":1,"review":"This orange man is the reason that Corona cases are high and is considering on banning TikTok in this country, if he wants America to be great again then he shouldn’t sleep on a virus and take away one of the greatest social media platforms. I don’t see how people would vote for Trump who is a sex offender and made many people offended. I miss Obama 😢","userName":"Random guy playing"}}]}
