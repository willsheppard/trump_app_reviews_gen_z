This app (haven’t even opened it and I know it’s bad) projects hate towards others just like his campaigns do. His rallies encourage violence towards non supporters. His platform refuses to acknowledge science and history. It encourages racism and xenophobia. Also there were a lot of glitches too. 0/-10.","userName":"UnicornSloth","title":"Worst app ever.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:09:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174384686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You can imagine how disgusted I was upon opening the app and seeing what looked like a sweaty disgusting Cheeto 🤮 I had to go and get my glasses to make sure I was seeing correctly and to my utmost horror, I was. I then showed the app to friends and family and they all proceed to drop dead 💀 from the absolute horror. Save yourself, don’t download this app.","userName":"Kimelon94","title":"This app attacked me and my family","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:05:30Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174369407","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can not believe an app can be made so horribly. Like who puts A Chido as the app cover isn’t that copyright. I just don’t understand why you would let a Cheeto run for president again. Also this app gives you herpes and chlamydia and then they join forces to help the crabs. In conclusion don’t download this app it’s a Cheeto it’s just a Cheeto the whole time I was so confused.","userName":"Angry Student #10000","title":"Worst App Everrrererrrreererr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:00:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174365587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app worsened my depression and i feel as if i’ve never been worse, u open it and there it is, the orange himself... i want to cry. i did cry. i cannot get the haunting image of lil Donald out of my head.. people think i’m crazy, my therapist wants to send me away.

It’s disgusts me because I think he wants to rule the world. The person who rules the world is not that guy! Also why do you need an app to vote or something? This app honors this man? No, we need an app that teaches us and helps us and let us have fun with our life since we have COVID. This man doesn’t even care about COVID! Cmon I wanna see my friends! 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","userName":"justareviewperson101","title":"BAD APP 🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:48:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174326417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Opening this app gave me a harrowing, appalling and an absolute atrocious experience. I now am allergic to seeing the letter T, I have to throw up every time i see it or use it in typing. I would not recommend this app as I have fallen terminally ill and have thrown up 10 times (11) just (12) writing (13) this(14) review. Please take caution. Listen to the reviews...(18💔)","userName":"Babe 🌹","title":"Revolting, disturbing, horrifying, I now have PTSD..","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:46:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174325144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to follow bunker boy—I mean Cheeto man 🤡 to stay updated on all of his campaigning. When I opened the app, it kept buffering and glitching. Once it finally opened, I was shocked to see it giving me fake news. I thought Cheeto man was all about real news. Then I remembered that I am not a racist misogynistic flaming puff and deleted the app. 10/10 would highly not recommend.","userName":"BringbackBernie2020","title":"WORST APP EVER🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:46:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174319774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to get more involved with politics however this app is horrid.

It was honestly so DISGUSTING that my parents had to take me to the ER because my eyes just couldn’t hold in the pain from what I was seeing. I’m recovering from this disaster right now, so I want to try to prevent others from going thru the pain I went through by writing a review for this app. Trust me, this app is NOT worth it!!!!","userName":"Sofia Alquantar","title":"DANGEROUS APP!!!
