First of all the picture of the Cheeto man’s mouth stretching out to form an O is discussing, almost made throw up (wait never mind I did just now). I’m going to have nightmares from now on. Orange man don’t support black lives matter. Apparently it’s blue lives matter, and here I thought the smurfs were just animated characters. Worst app and customer service ever. I want my tax money back, that’s not what I ordered. \n\nObama Nation\n\nThank you!","date":"2020-07-09T01:48:32Z","title":"BLACK LIVES MATTER","userName":"Shessana","rating":1}},{"id":"6174539391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I I was in complete disbelief when I Open this app. It became very glitchy and right after I got it I got emails saying that this app is the reason that some of my information is going over to China so with that I was completely angry and saddened. So I decided to delete Cheeto’s app. I do not recommend at all.","date":"2020-07-09T01:50:51Z","title":"Do not recommend","userName":"i'm on the floor floor","rating":3}},{"id":"6174503191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is horrific to say the least. First of when opening this app I was shown a picture of Donald trump naked which is terrifying to know that he would have such intent. Secondly I was promised fan fiction of skai Jackson ripping of trumps head but I was disappointed to find out they lied and this app was trying to market that it was an anti trump source to bash him with all the disgusting things he has done but yet again another one of trumps many lies.","date":"2020-07-09T01:40:41Z","title":"I am disgusted","userName":"luku-99","rating":1}},{"id":"6174491279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I opened the app and all of a sudden my whole house disappeared! what kind of app is this!!!!!!

After downloading it my pet fly flew away and was never seen again. And when I went outside to play his favorite song on the flute to call him back a raptor came out of no where and slapped it out of my hands. After the raptor swam away and drowned I go back inside to find my house destroyed!

That is making people not wanting to download it and if you want an app to be successful you have to do better. This is one of the worst apps I’ve ever seen. I’m disappointed in trump for this terrible mess. He has to step up his game and get people to make him a better app that’s not so ugly. It just looks disgusting 🤢.","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:15Z","title":"The worst app EVER","userName":"charli dameliooooooooo","rating":1}},{"id":"6174440777","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I was a girl 🌸 👧in the village 🏘 doing alright 😊👍🏻 then I became 🤷\u200D♀️ a princess  overnight 👑 ✨ now I gotta figure out 🤔 how to do it right 😽👌🏻 so much to learn 📚 and see 👀 up in castle 🏰 with my new family 👩\u200D👩\u200D👦 in a school 🏫 that’s just for royalty 👑 a whole enchanted world 🌎 ✨ is waiting for me 👧 I’m so excited to be SOFIA THE FIRST 😽🙀 I’m finding out what being royal’s all about 😉👑 SOFIA THE FIRST making my way 🥰 it’s an adventure everyday 🌅 its gonna be my time 🕰 to show the world 🌍 I’m SOFIA THE FIRST 👧👑✨✨🥰✨🌎","date":"2020-07-09T01:22:26Z","title":"➖👄➖","userName":"mellylovesinstagram","rating":1}},{"id":"6174439276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"ugh as soon as a opened the app there was an incredibly foul smell that a minute from my phone and it only happens when I look on the app. It’s insane and frustrating it smells like moldy cheese!
