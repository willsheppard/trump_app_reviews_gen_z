The winner of the presidential election is. Donald Trump!\"  Everyone claps as he shakes hands with  Hilary Clinton.  \"Donald Trump will be inaugurated January 20th, 2017.\"  2020:  \"Donald J. Trump. Won the reelection!\"  2023:  Claire's POV: I pick up a piece of broccoli with my fork as I slouch in my chair not wanting to be here. Its currently 7pm and were eating dinner with the Trumps in silence.  \"So, Mike. Did you get the paper work I sent you?\" Mr. Trump asks. Melania looks at him and he continues eating.  What even are we eating?  I pick up a piece of meat and shove it in my mouth. Chewing and looking out the window.  My parents adopted me from Alaska when I was 5. I'm 16 about to turn 17 in about a week.  \"Claire honey, did you hear Melania?\" My mom asks. I look up to see everyone looking at me. Minus Barron. He decided not to join us to go to dinner at his girlfriends. God I despise her.  \"No ma'am. Pardon me Melania?\" I ask. she smiles at me and starts speaking.  \"What are we going to do for your birthday next week?\"  \"I havent really thought about it ma'am.\" I say eating some more of the dry meat.  \"I was thinking suit and tie and ball gown party. Really formal.\" My mom says as someone from the staff takes her plate.  \"Oh that'd be great! And we can have it here! Right honey?\" She says turning to Mr. Donald. He nods and they squeal like teenagers.   ***  \"We can put some flowers here.\" Melania says pointing to someone and they sent the vase down. It is now the day before my birthday and I'm sitting on the stage next to Barron where the live band will be playing. I look through the 7 page long guest list and sigh.  \"I don't even know most of these people.\" I say on page 5. \"Prince Harry? Why would he come?\" I ask turning to Barron. He shrugs not looking up from his phone. I sigh and look back down at the list.  \"Claire darling. Have you gotten your dress?\" Melania asks turning around to me.  \"Yes Ma'am.\" I say looking up from the list. She nods and goes back to decorating. I look at the time that says 10:27. I get up leaving the guest list on the stage. I hug my mom and kiss her cheek. I go over to Malenia and do the same.  I walk down the halls and knock on the office door. It opens and I walk in.  \"Dad. Im going home to rest up before the party tomorrow.\" I say walking towards them.  \"Goodnight Sweetheart.\" My dad says kissing my forehead.  \"Goodnight Claire.\" Mr. Donald says.  \"Goodnight Daddy. Goodnight Mr. Donald.\" I say hugging them both before walking out and out of the white house.  I see a slick limo as someone from the staff opens the door welcoming me in.  \"To the vice presidents house.\" I say grabbing a gummy worm from the pocket.","title":"chapter 1","userName":"AHHHHHH
