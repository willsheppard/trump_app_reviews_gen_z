While I was on the train to the Capitol, I was trying to find the sex offender locator but then came across this so I decided to download it instead. It took over a week to download and I was stuck in a tree with the careers below me when it was finally finished. I decided to open it thinking that I was gonna die anyways when all of a sudden, I pressed the red button and nuclear mussels shot out of my phone and killed 3/5 careers. Luckily for me, Peeta and Cato were off taking a dump so I ran away before they got back. I didn’t have to kill anyone until the finale, when Peeta, Cato and I were stuck on the cornucopia. Peeta lost the Rock Paper Scissors match and was forced to battle Cato. It was mostly Cato giving Peeta purple nurples and I got really bored so I got on this app and fart blasted Cato off the cornucopia where the mutts were waiting to eat him. President Snow was planning to kill one of us but really liked our spray tans thanks to the spray tan feature on the app. Over all 10/10 experience, would use again!","title":"🔥Helped me win the Hunger Games🏹","rating":1,"userName":"peetaishot69420"}},{"id":"6179566255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"To all of my fellow Trump supporters, I must caution you to not download this app. When reviewing the app, I noticed the age restriction was 17+, but oddly enough, President Trump himself has had many (very inappropriate) interactions with girls and boys under the age of 17. I would advise the Trump administration to rethink these hypocritical age restrictions on this app because if Trump can r*pe a 13 year old and get away with it, why shouldn’t a 13 year old be able to use his app? At least have the age restrictions align with the ages he sexually desires.","title":"Inaccurate Age Restrictions","rating":1,"userName":"K8J8!!!"}},{"id":"6179566186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:13Z","isEdited":false,"review":"rac·ism\n/ˈrāˌsizəm/\nLearn to pronounce\nnoun\nprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.\n\nOh and it took forever to download 😬","title":"Yuck 🤢","rating":1,"userName":"mmarietorres"}},{"id":"6179566207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:13Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This took forever to download it started downloading at 6:09 am and finished at 4:20 pm it’s not worth it and you will get hacked so don’t even bother I was trying to walk my fish then my phone started glitching and it’s all because of this app I have never had such a bad app and so many problems with one 🤦\u200D♀️🙄🥱","title":"Don’t waste you’re time","rating":1,"userName":"Roxann Escobar"}},{"id":"6179566104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Donald trump ugly big fat baby he is","title":"bing bing bing bing stupid ugly man app go bye bye pweez","rating":1,"userName":"fathergarc"}},{"id":"6179566070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Bruh","title":"Bruh","rating":1,"userName":"uh ph stinky"}},{"id":"6179566043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app expecting to find my favorite shrimpy 🍤  president but instead I was redirected to the Cheetos website....

I opened it and every button was also delayed a few minutes. So frustrating! I looked it up to see if other people are having the same issue and I come across all these articles about sketchy user data collection. Seriously! And just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse it’s been glitching out my phone. The only thing that worked was to turn off and on my phone and delete the app. Never again!","title":"Worst app I’ve downloaded","rating":1,"userName":"jojo9371"}}]}
