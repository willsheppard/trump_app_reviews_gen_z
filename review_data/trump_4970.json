This app is specifically brainwash the select few ignorant followers he has today, into pushing his immoral values into the sacred soil of The United States. He has by FAR been one of the worst and most ignorant president in office throughout America’s history.","date":"2020-07-08T16:06:04Z","userName":"URealNewMan"}},{"id":"6172811207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t like","review":"This is the worst news app I have ever worked with. It was so laggy and glitchy, it would always log off and then I would have to log back in. It would turn off my phone and it would never save anything that I saved. It would also tremendously drain my battery. The software update wouldn’t update on my phone. It would always send me messages repetitively even when I tried to cancel them. I could never register to an event because it would always lag out, even if I deleted the app and got it again. I severely don’t recommend this app or Trump for president ever.","date":"2020-07-08T16:03:50Z","userName":"wedontlikehim"}},{"id":"6172759128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"New voter","review":"This app hacks your phone so that every notification has to do with trump my phone is glitching after this and they send you 1000 notifications per min.

MY FAMILY WAS DOING FINE UNTIL THIS DESPICABLE APP RUINED OUR LIVES, WE FOUGHT OVER THE POTS, THE OIL, THE HAY, NAY EVEN THE GOAT IN OUR ATTIC. The fights BROKE us apart *cry face* And when i read the PRIVACY POLICY, OH NAY I WAS NOT HAVING IT, NO WAY ARE THEY GETTING INFORMATION FROM ME, I TELL YOU NOW THAT THEY DONT NEED TO KNOW I LIVE IN ANTARTICA. Enough about them, I was MAD, at that moment i wanted to eat chalk because of the horrible feeling i got. After that experience I was NEVER the same, i would always have the urge to pick the hairs out of my goat, WEIRD I KNOW but thats what this DHHDV app brought me to. anyways 1 star dont get it.

He hasn’t lived up to our expectations, no wall has yet been built like promised and he somehow can anger me more every single day. The bright colors are too aggressive and it seems like he’s asking for a lot. The pictures used within the app are displeasing to the eye. And as I expected, there are MANY grammatical mistakes within the app. The slogan “make American great again” needs to be updated to something actually accomplishable. Overall, 1 star review ⭐️","date":"2020-07-08T15:32:34Z","userName":"Hi my name is bubbles"}},{"id":"6172546993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Do not download this app.","review":"While downloading this app I ensured that I had a secure wifi connection, however, the app took 53 minutes to download. About half of the times that I try to open the app, it closes automatically. When I am actually able to open the app, I only see poorly developed graphics. Moreover, the content of this app isn’t very factual (I.e. there are no numerical statistics or poll results) and I solely downloaded this app as a way to fathom the president’s policies and impact on our country. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this app and I discourage anyone from downloading it.","date":"2020-07-08T14:49:17Z","userName":"Nass T.

And Trump has also given us many reason to prove that he is against any other race that isnt white. And now that he has his own news app he can filter what he wants his cult to see, its all fake news. he doesn’t want the cultists to see how bad of a president he is so he sugar coats interviews, speaches. Also he is a hypocrite for allowing his own wife to live in America. He is a disappointment to America and its history.","date":"2020-07-08T13:22:28Z","userName":"Orville Tootenbovker"}},{"id":"6172190368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download!! Why is this app so glitchy????","review":"I downloaded this app because I was hoping to be able to find a rally near my hometown, it was going to be my first. But it literally took like a whole 45 mins to download?? And then for the first like 4 hours after it downloaded, it wouldn’t even open! I literally waited the the whole day before even opening the app to see maybe if it was my internet or something at the time, but nothing! I couldn’t click any of the options on the app and it’s just so bad! It’s honestly just such a horrible app, I don’t recommend! Someone please fix this!!","date":"2020-07-08T13:11:20Z","userName":"emilyyrosiee"}},{"id":"6155053278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I expected so much better 😤","review":"When I went to buy this glorious app to support the true supreme leader of this god forsaken world I would’ve thought that the aesthetics would’ve been better>:(. Everything was all wrong and as an America loving American I was honestly insulted at the lack of American flags. But not only that, oh no, not only that... Like I wish there were more pedophiles to support on this app ya know? It would just be so amazing to be able to show my love to those who forcefully love and threaten on little children :) Anyway, if these things could be added in I’d honestly be so grateful Make America Great Again :D","date":"2020-07-04T04:44:00Z","userName":"MaDsunXD"}}]}
