This is it.\n\nOne star off only because of the daily incentive points.  I would love to see my local grassroots campaigning be credited, too.  If I send email to friends, if I send out text, if I go precinct walking, phonebanking, repost the news and events and other efforts.  I hope the app developer can add these items.\n\nAlso, I'd like to receive notification on the newsfeed and events."}},{"id":"1559414154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"America First","userName":"Pistol Mama","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"date":"2017-03-07T14:06:15Z","review":"I love this app. Started using it during Donald Trump's campaign. It was a wonderful way to stay informed with his daily schedule-what was going on-when and where. You could even watch his campaign speeches live with the app. Sooo great!  Now, I still use it daily to keep up with President Trump. I enjoy keeping up with his tweeting and all the neat shared photos. I do not have Facebook, twitter account, or instagram. This app allows me to continue to follow the President so that I don't have to depend on \"Fake News\"!!!"}},{"id":"1476668079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Has issues","userName":"Fgutgigfvhffhifvgydf","isEdited":false,"rating":4,"date":"2016-11-01T09:23:27Z","review":"I am a fan of Mr. Trump but unlike everyone else giving the app 5 stars just because of it being a trump I would like to point out some issues the app has. It can be very slow at times and feels slightly clunky. I feel it requires a lot more information than it needs, the AP system is very similar to the way Hillary's app worked and I honestly thought hers was a bit more polished. Overall good app but does need a bit more refining."}},{"id":"1439299949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Make the App like Trump Direct and to the point","userName":"DemonHunter Dead Flowers","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"date":"2016-08-26T02:39:21Z","review":"The app has a lot of features and provides great content.  It is targeting experienced app users ... Donald Trump's message rings true with the American people because his message is direct and to the point with no PC filters.  Model the app after the candidate ... Direct and to the point...easy to understand for all.  If you need help...reach out and ask...there is an army of us who do this for a living."}}]}
