I downloaded this because I wanted information on Trump, but every time I open the app, it’s just a super zoomed in pictures of Trump’s wrinkly orange skin. Also it took forever to download! I waited for at least a week before the app was functional. Total waste of time, really shows you that the Trump administration doesn’t care about anyone"}},{"id":"6173321362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Melanoma Fump","date":"2020-07-08T18:44:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"App is trash like that Cheeto","rating":1,"review":"I tried downloading it but when I opened this app, it froze my whole screen. I had to send my phone to a local phone technician in order to get it fixed. Not only is this app the worst app ever , this app also forced me to pay 80 dollars to fix the frozen screen. This app is futile and dangerous just like the rusty, wrinkly Cheeto dictator-like president who is corrupt and is a tyrant. Anyway, Stan Loona✨✨💋💕."}},{"id":"6173315357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LexiiMichelle05","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Orange Scary Man","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app hoping to stay up to date with our LoVeLy totally NoN racist president, and wasn’t too happy with the outcome!💕✨ Right as I downloaded it, an orange scary man appeared at my front door!🍤😡🟠 Cheeto man started chanting “BeAnS bEaNs BeAnS”. Then little lizard ninjas came to attack me and I was horrified!🦎😱 Then PeAcHeS appeared and started yelling “WHO IN THE HELL PUT THE MUFFINS IN THA FREEZA”. Then Charli Damelio appeared and peaches started to fight her. It was very scary.🥳💕👴🏿🍤🧚🥢🙈 Anyways, the bottom line is, horrible app!!"}},{"id":"6173314315","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"doeownnforuenf","date":"2020-07-08T18:41:58Z","isEdited":false,"title":"App rate-","rating":1,"review":"Worst app ever!!

I tried to educate myself in the things he has done for this country, but unfortunately I could not find anything but him repeatedly shaming joe Biden rather than bringing good news to the app. I find that insanely immature which led me to give this one star. I will not be voting for him this year."}},{"id":"6173169872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"heatherpuff","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t Download","rating":1,"review":"This app made my phone glitch so many times 🤬😡 and to top it off I think the app gave my number to telemarketers since I keep on getting spam called. All I wanted to be was a good citizen by supporting and trying to re-elect our Best president yet 🤡, but I guess that’s asking for too much. \nAlso this is a message to our president \n~ You made my year (worse) 🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚🧚"}},{"id":"6173162551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lillie.irene","date":"2020-07-08T17:52:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","rating":1,"review":"This app completely shut down my phone. It took forever to download and completely glitched upon opening it. I had to restart my phone because it was frozen, but my phone wouldn’t turn on again. When it finally did all that opened was the app. I could be wrong but I think our president is trying to hack my phone."}},{"id":"6173154927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bully The Pres","date":"2020-07-08T17:50:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"My Life Will Never Be The Same","rating":1,"review":"I was so excited when I got this app but as soon as I opened It, It turned everything on my phone ORANGE! So now when I use my phone my fingers turn orange, like after eating a bag of cheetos! I really wanted to love this app for the great pedo-sident himself, but I cannot. I feel like I got the ICE experience instead of the presidential treatment. I feel trapped in a cage instead of liberated in the fascist- - - i meant GREAT USA."}},{"id":"6173115563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dxpeandrea","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Save Tik Tok🤧🤧😪","rating":1,"review":"Anyways I downloaded the app and first thing I see is our president with his gorgeous hair✨👩\u200D🦰that can barely hang on to his head and Cheeto skin🍑🥰but then I find out it gave me a virus   😡🦠but of course it couldn’t have been our presidents fault it was probably those beans that are stealing our jobs🤮🤢also disappointed that he didn’t build the wall🧱🚫anyways, in conclusion frick trump Abolish ICE and Defund the police✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿"}}]}
