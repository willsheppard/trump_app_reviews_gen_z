Telling to vote for Trump over and over really took a toll on me and the result of that is losing my hearing. Thanks to him, I can’t hear the allegations that being made against him anymore 😤😤😤. The doctor said that I may never hear again, this really goes to show that this app is cancerous, DO NOT GET IT. I’ve heard on a news article that it can give off radiation so harmful that it can give you tumors. Maga? Yeah right, my ass. Thank you Donald Trump for making me lose my hearing thanks to your raspy voice.","date":"2020-07-09T13:36:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m deaf"}},{"id":"6176739205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cbnccnjdxbnjfc","review":"Trump is a poopy head butt face chicken eww butt face no bottyihfhf","date":"2020-07-09T13:35:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ewww no trump"}},{"id":"6176738209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gabbie hanna💕","review":"have🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄","date":"2020-07-09T13:35:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"no❤️"}},{"id":"6176734378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cłłaire","review":"horrible","date":"2020-07-09T13:34:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible"}},{"id":"6176734021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sndjbrsbeb","review":"So the app took about 69 weeks to download and then after that it turned my leg into a balloon.BEEWAAREREE","date":"2020-07-09T13:34:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is weird just like Trump is"}},{"id":"6176727938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Claire the Werdo","review":"if you like spam, this is the app to get. \nAccording to all known laws\n\nof aviation,there is no way a bee\n\nshould be able to fly.Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam?\n\n- Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here.\n\n- You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me!\n\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!\n\nBarry, I told you, stop flying in the house!\n\n- Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry.- Is that fuzz gel?\n\n- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,\n\nthree days high school. Those were awkward.\n\nThree days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.- Hear about Frankie?\n\n- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?\n\n- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.\n\nSuch a hothead. I guess he could have\n\njust gotten out of the way.I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.\n\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.- Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!- Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah!\n\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of.....9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go.Keep your hands and antennas\n\ninside the tram at all times.- Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary.Welcome to Honex,\n\na division of Honescoand a part of the Hexagon Group.This is it!Wow.Wow.We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life\n\nto get to the point where you can work for your whole life.Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive.\n\nOur top-secret formulais automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrupwith its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey!- That girl was hot.- She's my cousin!\n\n- She is?- Yes, we're all cousins.- Right. You're right- At Honex, we constantly striveto improve every aspecof bee existence.These bees are stress-testin a new helmet technology.- What do you think he makes? - Not enough.\n\nHere we have our latest advancement,\n\nthe Krelman.- What does that do?\n\n- Oatches that little strand of honeythat hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman?Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know\n\nthat every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefullybecause you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that.What's the difference?You'll be happy to know that bees as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.\n\nI'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.But, Adam, how could they\n\nnever have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?Like what? Give me one example.I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about.\n\nPlease clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.Wait a second. Oheck it out.- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow.I've never seen them this close.They know what it's like\n\noutside the hive Yeah, but some don't come back.- Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!You guys did great!You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!- I wonder where they were.- I don't know.Their day's not planned.Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\n\nJock. You have to be bred for that.Right.\n\nLook. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.It's just a status symbol.\n\nBees make too much of it.Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it.Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?Distant. Distant.Look at these two.- Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them.It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock Yeah. Once a bear pinned me\n\nagainst a mushroom!He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me!\n\n- Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out.\n\nWhat were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that.\n\nA little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.\n\n- Six miles, huh? - Barry!A puddle jump for us,\n\nbut maybe you're not up for it.- Maybe I am.\n\n- You are not!We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\n\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\n\nAre you bee enough?\n\nI might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me.You decide what you're interested in?-Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one.Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day?Son, let me tell you about stirring.You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around.You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it,maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals?That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey!","date":"2020-07-09T13:32:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"do not bother"}},{"id":"6176726696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gracendjskid","review":"have🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄","date":"2020-07-09T13:32:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP SHOULD BE BANNED"}}]}
