Also, when he arrived all the kids started screaming and running. Then, the clown got all insecure and blamed it on them. The clown I hired’s stage name was Cheeto man, and there was no way to rate him on the app so I’m doing it here. Also, he was very plump so he barely fit through the door and the left orange stains everywhere he went. Talk about Cheeto powder! Never hiring again.","title":"🤡🧡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:16:46Z","userName":"zoeydimon","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174232525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"downloaded this app to see 🍊🥵🤤 bUt was HARASSED instead!! immediately the app asked for my phone number like um chile so anyways, no❤️ i don’t need my information stolen😤 and my entire phone crashed and nothing will load!!! disappointed but not surprised i accepted more from trumpyy but whatever i am extremely disappointed and disgusted by how slow and unreliable this app is and it needs to be REMOVED asap!!/!!:&.👺","title":"TERRIBLE 0 ⭐️s IF I COULD!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:14:19Z","userName":"yeet10101","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174220035","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i opened the app and then it glitches my phone out of existence. then my pet dinosaur turned on me and killed me. it was a t-rex. this app is cursed . it caused my death. i am writing this from my coffin. my funeral was so beautiful. they played astronomia. but this app is horrible. would not recommend😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 and my favorite kpop idol announced that he was sick and passed. this app is CURSED. at least my kpop idol is dead with me😔😏😏. still....
