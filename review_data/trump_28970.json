It makes my phone turn all shades of color and also my dog died? So I went to get a grave but the Trump app (this app) told me to just throw it in a pond. Like who does that? This app apparently. If you care about your pet at all I do not recommend.","userName":"El Erai","date":"2020-07-09T02:36:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Would give 0 if I could.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174690569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so trash just like the the guy in charge... it (referring to the appüòâ) told me to go back to where i came from.

I can‚Äôt believe the trump administration is fine with this app being in the App Store. It is completely full of glitches and almost never works. How am I supposed to empower my own bigotry and xenophobia now???","userName":"Crawdadehhhhhh57382758","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:14Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is so horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6174672382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I am not fully convinced this app isn‚Äôt a form of Russian spyware. Trump has said beware of robots. They may take over the world some day. His fear is also my legitimate fear.
