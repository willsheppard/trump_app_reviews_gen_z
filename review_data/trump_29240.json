First of all, it has trump in it. Which makes it so disgusting. Second of all, it’s not even good. This app is supposed to be about trump, not some orange guy. Literally all they show is pictures of oranges and stuff about the orange. NEVER download this app you will be absolutely DISSAPOINTED.","date":"2020-06-29T02:19:16Z"}},{"id":"6136524494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Ignore the Fake Reviews","userName":"sshiggins","review":"This app appears to be a great digital outreach tool.

Also the Trump online campaign as a whole is really poorly put together and hard to maneuver through, due to the lack of proper set up and execution technology wise. Because I guess I’ll have to vote blue. oh well.","date":"2020-06-29T01:33:15Z"}},{"id":"6134075864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Great app","userName":"florida for President Trump","review":"We were able to order Signs for our yard and signs to hold at a rally.

Burned all my MAGA merch; I’m heartbroken 💔The app then proceeded to jump out of my phone and hang BLM signs from my windows. Disgusting.
