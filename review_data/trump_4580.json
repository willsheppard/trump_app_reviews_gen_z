It took HOURS to download and then once it was downloaded, my phone just started randomly crashing. Soon after that pictures from my camera roll started deleting and my phone started tweaking so bad it would barely work. I would not recommend this app unless you want your phone to be absolutely destroyed. Waste of my time. Not to mention the app was really hard to figure out and contained nothing but bias and exaggerated bull-devlin all over. I would give this a 0 out of 5 if I could.

It is slow and very laggy. You would think an app made for our PRESIDENT wouldn’t be so faulty. I have had this app for some time now but always noticed too many issues on this app to actually want to use it. First, you can click anything you want but it will not do anything. For example: if you want to type in your email or password, when you click the space you are supposed to type your email/password into, no keyboard will show up. How am I supposed to join if it doesn’t let me put my information in with a keyboard? Ridiculous.","title":"Very Frustrated","rating":1,"userName":"vw2183"}},{"id":"6176636047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:08:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to see if this app would change my opinion on president Trump. IT DID NOT! When I opened the app a weird orange popped up on my screen, I was horrified! I had to close the app for a bit to calm myself down again. After opening the app and seeing that scary orange again I couldn’t look anymore. That same night I started seeing weird figures and shapes, I was hallucinating!!! For that whole week I was continuing to hallucinate! It kept getting worse and worse, the orange even appeared! I was so frightened I had to delete the app. Whoever is reading this please do NOT download the app!","title":"It made me hallucinate!","rating":1,"userName":"Val 😽"}},{"id":"6176608187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:01:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I opened the app it show multiple pictures and videos of the president in his hot Cheeto glory doing some irreparable damage to his already disgraced reputation I’ll give you two hints ⚱️🚿. Anyways after barely escaping that disgusting moment with my life I found my self in a sea of misinformation and lies that only the lovely generation x would willingly swallow. But I don’t blame them as they were conditioned to obey in their schooling and have a sheep mentality like you’ve never seen before. But anyways I wouldn’t recommend purchasing this app as it’s a totally waste of energy and time, App Store please do your job and remove it.","title":"A true shock","rating":1,"userName":"Ebunnyfrogapple"}},{"id":"6176585205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:54:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"In order to support my favorite USA president I wanted to download the app to keep up with him, but when I downloaded the app it would kick me out. Once I finally got it to work it was asking for too much information that I thought was unnecessary but nevertheless I still gave it as I love my president. A few days later I was getting constant spam. This app was very underwhelming the set up is visually unpleasing very disappointed as an extremely dedicated fan. I write this review definitely not to mock the app but to share the lackluster experience of this app. Please get rid of it as it has cause more harm than good","title":"HUGE disappointment","rating":1,"userName":"Jamie J Wu"}},{"id":"6176571366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:51:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded this app I was hoping to find reasons to like my racist sexist, etc. President buttttt a soon as I did things started to change. I went to my kitchen for a snack and there was a random Oompa Loompa there I asked what it was doing in my house of course and it said that it’s job was to break in sent by the app and that it was abused I gave it some tea and it began to talk. They would abuse it but he wasn’t the only one, there were.... millions more... abused as well. Horrible right but it doesn’t stop there he began to tell me how trump would cut off his toes then stuff them mc flurry’s so yeah I wouldn’t get this app by have a nice day 🧚\u200D♀️😍","title":"DO NOT GET IT","rating":1,"userName":"elizabeth😂🍭🍭"}},{"id":"6176497991","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:31:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"If I could give this no stars I would - the app took several days to download and the overall quality of pictures was very bad.  It was either blurry or pixelated and worked very slowly.  Every time I would click on the icon it would freeze and at random times it would click out of the app, leaving a black screen.  It works very slowly and wouldn’t let me click to put my number in.  The notifications, even though I enabled them, wouldn’t pop up for me either.  All I wanted to do was support my wonderful president but the app really does not do him justice.","title":"Worse app ever","rating":1,"userName":"barronboys"}},{"id":"6176221304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:11:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I was expecting a nice opening and a good warming welcome but no i got a racist Orange looking dude on my page I almost had to go to the emergency room for my eyes. He is dumb can’t even state things correctly and I believe he has mental issues like have you seen what he caused shame on you for this if the app had a zero i will gladly rate a zero because even a one star is to good for you and it’s very very very sad that a four year old child can act better then the person you call YOUR President in conclusion its a trash app and I didn’t even use it but i know in your good hearts we together CAN AND WILL get rid this nasty app.","title":"Nasty","rating":1,"userName":"-/@:@$;);;"}},{"id":"6176060661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:21:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I understand the point of this is politics. But where is the style where is the taste. Trump has so much money in his campaign, he should put it to good use. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! It has too many bugs!! Trump hasn’t even thought of fixing such glitches. It takes up ALL ur storage!! It also doesn’t tell you real news. It’s a bust of a cheap excuse for an app. It takes all your storage, tells you fake news, and Trump ONLY uses it to promote himself on an off disgusting way. Definitely not fair!! Especially since it glitches too much and takes all ur storage. If I wanted to see Trump be dumb I WOULD GO TO TWITTER. WHERE THERE ARE NO GLITCHES.","title":"Stressful Cheap App","rating":1,"userName":"Melania Trump and Barron"}}]}
