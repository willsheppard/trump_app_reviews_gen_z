I get it. He has money. But he obviously doesn’t have enough money to create a decent app for his platform! This app is literally worse than those children’s dress up game apps where it crashes every three seconds. First of all, it took FOREVER to download. 😣 All I wanted to do was to get some information and it was all false! It also looked off on my screen. Like it was created for an old Nokia phone. The words were glitching and none of the buttons tabs worked properly. Worst of all, I kept getting THOUSANDS of notifications a day! It kept crashing, and worst of all it kept asking me for money. More and more often it was begging for donations. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It will drive you insane and it’s not worth your time."}},{"id":"6179495175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Donald Trump","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MandyTx512","review":"More like Donald Dump cause YOU’RE TRASHHHHHHH 😂😂💩"}},{"id":"6179495147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"69","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:25Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"BidenForLife","review":"It’s been 69 years since I first downloaded this app I hate it and wanted to die after looking at this mans orange face and his strange blonde wig how he got Melania I will never know. He is generally an awful person I have spent the last 69 years of my life in critical conditional at the ER after looking at this mans face I luckily survived but the ptsd is so bad I have been in rehab for 69 days"}},{"id":"6179495019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Periodt!","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"thick but flat","review":"*inserts bee movie script*"}},{"id":"6179494935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"bad","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"dnjskejrjfjsjskejdjfjdjjdjjj","review":"scary❤️"}},{"id":"6179494932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"disgustin122","review":"I had downloaded this app to keep up to date with decisions made my Donald Trump on how to make America great again. I must say, he has not done that at all. I haven’t heard anything about black lives matter from him and how he is contributing and I have not heard if he feels threatened by Kanye West running for president. Instead I ran into a lot of glitches and recieved information that Russia has my social security number. If I could give zero stars I would. Also I have not seen any information about the fairy comments on his Instagram. Coulda sworn he would comment about like how he comments on women and how he wants to have sex with them. It makes me very disappointed with the quality and information that this app has. Disgusting 🤮"}},{"id":"6179494862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The worst app ever do not download","date":"2020-07-10T04:49:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"gacha life update commet","review":"It was racist vary racist do not download it lags a lot I don’t see it’s point shouldn’t even be on the App Store it has a virus 🦠the Guy or women that made it is absolute racist bc when I downloaded this app I saw some racist stuff.and also it has a camera that stalks you so I really don’t recommend✖️you guys downloading this app🙃"}}]}
