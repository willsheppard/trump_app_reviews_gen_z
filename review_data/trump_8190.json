Unknowing of the consequences I proceeded to type in my number. Thinking nothing of it I registered to vote and continued on doing other things. Later that day I received multiple calls from people wanting to scam me out of my money. I kept getting countless unknown callers which I blocked. However, every call had a different number. Do not download this app. It’ll scam you and fill your phone with junk calls.","userName":"ForTiktok24","title":"Worst App Ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6175786683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:51:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"When I saw that my little Cheeto puff baby gerber baby lovey babyness made an app—I HAD TO HAVE IT. Alas, I’m disappointed. There were none of the exclusive photos and videos as would be expected with an Onlyfans. I was excited to have the opportunity to see another side of this orange lamb. His sweet corn husk hair, curves, his elven lover (vp), and forever pursed lips. However, there was none of this. NONE! I cannot believe that your fans would be left in the dirt to scavenge for pieces of your oh so lovable persona. \n\n-a disappointed aficionado","userName":"mickey pence🇨🇦","title":"rlly?? is this what we get!?","rating":1}},{"id":"6175780759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:49:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I am very disappointed in this app it’s so terrible!! All the cool cats and kittens I know who have this app are so displeased by this app. It not only runs slow but caused my phone to freeze! Then my iPad crashed! I think Trump took my personal data through this app!! Either Joe Exotic somehow got someone to hack into my electronics for my data or Trump is having this app take my data!! I might as well feed him to the cool cats and kittens here at Big Cat Rescue! Do not recommend this app. If I could I would rate it zero stars!!!","userName":"✋🏼🥰","title":"Carol Baskin","rating":1}},{"id":"6175770580","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:45:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I have never written a review for an app before but holy moly this app is actually so awful. It is full of glitches, doesn’t open most of the time, and when it does open it overheats my phone and causes a temperature warning to pop up. I’ve had so many phone crashes since downloading it and my phone randomly restarts now even with a high battery percentage!! I’m so disappointed in this app. It’s worthless. A true and accurate representation of trump himself.","userName":"Reviewing-Apps-1994","title":"Ruined my phone","rating":1}},{"id":"6175710822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:25:29Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I would not recommend this app. The day I downloaded it a shadow has been along side me; I see a shadow that follows me EVERYWHERE and sometimes it’s faces me, looks directly to my face, it only appears when there’s light. IT MOVES LIKE ME, IT WALKS LIKE ME AND IT EVEN LOOKS LIKE ME; but when I’m in the dark I don’t see the shadow. I feel like it’s watching me, waiting for me to go to the light for it to haunt me, I AM TERRIFIED, even after I deleted the app IT STILL HAUNTS  ME. I 100% do not recommend if you don’t want a shadow following you 24/7.😴🤚","userName":"shanik osorio","title":"This is giving me the HEEBIE-JEEBIES👁👄👁😠😥","rating":1}},{"id":"6175679980","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:15:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As an independent, I need to see the viewpoint of each candidate that will be in the general election, so I decided to download the app. IT TOOK DAYS TO DOWNLOAD. THEN right when it was done downloading, it automatically started updating. ANOTHER SEVERAL DAYS. And now when I go onto the app, it DRAINS MY BATTERY LIKE CRAZY with all the ads. And it MAKES MY PHONE GLITCH if I don’t clear all the apps before and after using it. Not worth the hassle to just get promoted MAGA hats without getting any information about his campaign.","userName":"Lainy-Louu","title":"Would NEVER Recommend 👎🏻","rating":1}},{"id":"6175476153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:59:23Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app has a horrible interface and is not user friendly. It glitches constantly and steals all your data and contacts!!! It hacks into your cloud and takes excessive permissions and steals your photos, notes, voice recordings and releases your twitter and tik tok drafts!! Completely horrible and needs to be removed from the app store. I don’t understand how there aren’t already lawsuits against their data stealing. Put this app in the trash where it belongs✨🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"josroe","title":"you tried...now stop","rating":1}},{"id":"6175466383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:55:24Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the glichyest app I have ever downloaded. It freezes all of the time and then forces me to completely restart my phone before anything on my phone works again. Also it’s constantly just closing out of the app so I can’t see anything I want to. This is beyond annoying and I do not recommend ever downloading this app, it’ll probably end up corrupting your phone and then you’ll have to spend another thousand on a new one. I do NOT recommend.","userName":"dhahuansbdckk","title":"Runs poorly","rating":1}},{"id":"6175387572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:24:45Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded this app thinking i could support my racist, homophobic, sexist president but was sadly mistaken. I type in my address and phone number and instead of letting me into the app it said that the fbi was on its way cuz i discovered that being racist is illegal and that woman have rights. the fbi came to my house and ate my pet caterpillar. i cried for weeks so i’m writing this to you do you won’t lose ur caterpillar. make sure to take it on a walk even if you have plans to go to trumps supportive ralleys.","userName":"rburgess469 <- Sc","title":"He ate my pet Caterpillar😔🧚🏻✨","rating":1}}]}
