When I hit the install button, installing it took so much internet power I had to drain NYC’s entire electricity power plant, plus some of New Jersey’s diners with the help of the Kardashian’s twelve mansions, not to mention all of my grandmother’s lemons’ electrolytes just so it can halfway install. When it finished installing my room was filled with so much electricity I felt like I was going into the Avatar state while ascending to super saiyan with Kurama shadowclone jitsu-ing in my stomach. It was a weird feeling. \n\nAnyways, the app has really poor sense of graphic design.","title":"I almost died","userName":"Shwaptain Shwermica","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173066546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Donald Trump has to be the most racist, sexist, and most mental rapist I’ve ever seen. There are a plethora of factual evidence of him being a sex abuser and a child trafficker. He says he wants to make America great again, meaning back when black people were slaves to the white man. He literally used military forces one peaceful protesters and didn’t even cars if anyone dies. He calls peaceful protesters “thugs” and say we’re violent but his own supporters are being caught on camera verbally and physically harming POC. Donald TRAMP how about you go back to where you came from which would be the ninth level of HELL. Say hi to Hitler for me🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽 #BLM. ✊🏾✊🏿✊🏽✊🏼","title":"SCREW DONALD TRUMP. #BLM","userName":"CourtLuv2.9","date":"2020-07-08T17:21:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172998673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took at least 6 hours to download, and when it finally finished, i clicked on it and my phone glitched and froze. It stayed that way for at least a day or two. It wouldn’t even let me turn my phone off. I ended up having to take my phone to the apple store and get it completely reset/rebooted, and after that it STILL had some issues. My battery runs dead when on 80% and I can’t even take it off the charger without it running dead. This app is terrible and should be taken off the AppStore immediately ! ✨✨✨✨","title":"Horrific ✨🍬","userName":"kami justice","date":"2020-07-08T17:00:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172830317","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app and made my phone slow and glitch I have the newest phone from Apple and I never had this problem before. Also it looks so bad the formatting is just 🤢. Step up your game you don’t have enough money to update the structure of the app or what? Oh thats right you are trying to spend billions of dollars on a wall that has no purpose of being there. Which in that case don't call Hispanics rapist because the only rapist here is YOU don’t blame your pass actions on hispanics.

I got this app to see if it could educate me a bit more on our president. It does take up a lot of storage on my phone I had to delete a lot of stuff to free up space. It took a really long time to download and if I went on another tab it would cancel the download. I didn’t feel too comfortable giving all the personal information that the app asked for. I’m not against trump but I’m definitely not a supporter and this app didn’t help me make up my mind.","title":"Not worth it","userName":"Addy Chase","date":"2020-07-08T15:37:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172641770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Gee- Girls Generation\n\nListen Boy\nMy First Love Story\nMy Angel and My Girls\nMy sunshine\nOh!

When I tried to download it, it look hours to download and while I was waiting for it I couldn’t even open any other apps, all I could do was call someone. When I opened the app it asked me all these questions about bugs and showed pictures of them. It was disgusting. When I tried to click the buttons on the app it was being so slow and it took so long to click anything. When I tried to close the app it wouldn’t even close. I WILL BE DELETING THE APP IMMEDIATELY!!

And then, it started leaking water out of the speakers on the bottom. I’m unsure how that happened because it was sitting on my desk. Anyway, the water got to be way too overwhelming and ended up leaking onto the floor. I still couldn’t stop the water. I even tried plugging it with gum. My hamster drowned. I gave it CPR but it still drowned. Then my cousin started drowning but I know human CPR so I saved her life. But yeah, the water stopped eventually but then my phone wouldn’t turn on. If I could give it 0 stars I would.","title":"Made my phone crash","userName":"Sofiaagnifilo","date":"2020-07-08T14:33:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172293698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For anyone who supports 🍊Donald Trump🍊, lemme just say a few things. Considering his past actions (which you can educate yourselves on), he should be spending the rest of his life rotting👏🏾in👏🏾a👏🏾jail👏🏾cell👏🏾.

Now of course, it’s your choice to believe or not believe the facts🤡But if you cannot get the fact that the president of the United States is a racist, pedifile, and a crappy father/husband❤️ That shows that you simply cannot comprehend common knowledge inside of your circumcised penis🍆shaped brain❤️❤️❤️\n\n#BlackLivesMatter✨❤️\n#TrumpIsARa_ist🤡\n#ImOverThis😒","title":"absolute ✨shat✨💅💅","userName":"i loveritzcrackerzzzzz","date":"2020-07-08T13:39:56Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
