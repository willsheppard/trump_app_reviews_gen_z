It is a horrendous app and should never have been created. When I opened it up it showed me a picture of some horrible creature that made me almost gouge my eyes out in fear and disgust. I don’t know what it was but I never want to see it again. 🤢 this app is just overall a horrible thing and needs to be deleted... why would anyone want an app that portrays those horrible pictures. Honestly disgusting to see. 😡","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible... absolutely disgusting","date":"2020-07-09T02:00:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174568626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ncastroo100","review":"I downloaded the app🤩and my phone started to glitch🙀🙀!!! all my app icons went missing😭😰lil huddy 😖appeared on my home screen and started to say the n-word!!🤬🤯💔then my room started to shake and i heard the loud, obnoxious sound pulsating through my ear drums, “TRUMP 2020”.

The layout and design of it is literally impossible to navigate. There’s also the fact that it is STEALING my personal information and is a threat to all American people. After I downloaded this app I got a call from an unknown number. When I answered it, Donald Trump was on the other line. He threatened to ruin my life if I answered the polls with the “incorrect answers”. This is just sad. I’m very disappointed that I even downloaded this app in the first place (it definitely wasn’t just to give a one star review)","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:21Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174503158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"madsyeda","review":"this app is utterly disgusting. the amount of poopy smells that shot out and polluted my beautiful eyes from the images and words from this app, 🤮 I’m gonna vomit🤮 hold on gimme a sec🤮 my toilets all messy now. i don’t wanna ever see this app ever again. cheeto man forreal destroyed the beauty of cheetos for me. now every time I eat a cheeto, it just tastes like racism, misogyny, and bad leadership 🤮 sorry I’m vomiting so much I can help it. this dude makes me wanna cry :( get this app outta here 🤮 you tried, but don’t ever try again 🧚🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♀️👋🏽👋🏽🖖🏽👁👃🏽👁","isEdited":false,"title":"thanks a lot, now I have to get my eyes removed","date":"2020-07-09T01:40:40Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174462932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cupcakekami","review":"This app is horrible and disgusting you may ask why those 2 bad things?, well Trumps opinions as a president are disgusting and even disturbing to think about, so Trump how about you go get some therapy for that horrible mind of yours, BTW Obama is Infinity times better he was educated, treated everyone equally, and gave back to others you on the other hand is the complete opposite.
