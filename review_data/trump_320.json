They say don’t judge him for his past. Heh. That’s exactly what I’m gonna do and what all yalls should be doing. Cause holy heck this dude is messed up. Any way I downloaded the app in  attempt to find a reason not to hate this horrible orange man and nope it only made me hate him more as it should. Also way to go Gen Z so proud of y’all stand up for our rights and the rights of everyone! But guys fair warning after I downloaded this app it sold my info. I keep getting calls and stuff from all over and a huge hideous orange man showed up at my door step in an attempt to brain wash me into submission.  So don’t get this app it’s not safe it sells your info to fascist governments !!!! But hey let’s talk about the orange Cheeto lookin type guy you closeted racist are so keen to follow because for some reason he is all over this app. “Make America great again” really means keep America down and don’t let it become great. Just a friendly reminder folks that the rest of the world looks at America the way America looks at Florida. 💐💐💐💐","title":"TRASH!","userName":"just your friendly gen zoomer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:40:44Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177518127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to give me important insights on donald j trump, what i received was DEFINITELY NOT THAT. as soon as i downloaded the app, there was a notification that popped up asking me to “share my camera with donald” i proceeded to do so because i thought it was normal BUT to my surprise it was not. as soon as i clicked share camera, my face popped up on the screen. i was facetiming donald j trump himself! he then told me that i was ugly and that it was hard for me to be a ten because of my chest size. i tried to hang up but donald just laughed. he proceeded to tell me he has all of my information just from downloading this app. i cried while he laughed in my face. i tried shutting my phone off entirely but my phone started turning ORANGE. yes ORANGE. my phone was turning into mister trump himself. i was in shock when it grew corn like hair, it’s hard to explain how frayed and damaged the hair was. my phone then grew two arms and legs and started running l the way to the mexican border while yelling about some kind of wall??? i had to get a new phone obviously, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE delete this app off of the app store. it’s not safe","title":"i’m NOT impressed 😒😒😒😒😒😒","userName":"peytonanne","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:12:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176838125","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took 69 days to download, I thought it’d be worth the wait because our totally not raciest, homophobic, misogynist, wonderful president. When the app finally downloaded it wiped my phone and controlled all the data, it turned my background into what looked like a moldy, disgusting Cheeto. Anytime I opened any social media app my feed was full of racist white supremacists, and I can’t understand why. Whenever I opened my camera Tony the Tiger would knock on my door crying and saying “They’re badddd they’re badddd” which was pretty traumatic based upon my childhood. Every time I tried to drive my car it would say there was 5 people when there was only 1. I kept trying to reinstall TikTok because it took it off my phone but it wouldn’t let me. Lastly the worst thing to happen was the seagulls they were everywhere, chanting that white people are oppressed, and trump 2020. It was absolutely horrifying. They surrounded me and seemed to grow in number. God I don’t even wanna think about it, I’m traumatized. Overall it was a horrible experience and I do not recommend downloading this for your own safety!","title":"Absolutely terrible! 😔😤","userName":"CharismaNic","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:01:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174553720","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had high expectations when downloading an app. I wanted get caught up with the rally’s and print pictures for my 🍊Cheeto leader shrine🍊, but when I opened the app my phone started ringing very loud possibly sensing my minority skin! My hands started burning up and when I finally released my phone a hologram of a lizard showed up and sent me on a quest 🗺. So of course I’m going to go on this quest, he gave me directions and sent me off. When I finally reached my destination there was this box📦 , and in this box there was a smaller box 📦 , and in this smaller box there was a smaller smaller box 📦 . After hours of opening boxes I finally made it to the center but you would NOT believe what was in there. It was a picture of Cheeto man in the nude 😱😱😱😱I was HORRIFIED! After seeing the picture I felt a tingling sensation throughout my entire body and I started turning GREEN! I suddenly turned into a lizard 🦎 and now my vision is all messed up! Right now my fathers, brothers, goldfish’s cousins friend, the chinchilla, is typing my review because my fingers get stuck to the screen! DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT LIZARD BRAIN 🦎 🧠","title":"Help I am lizard 🦎👄🦎","userName":"LizzyBoi1492","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:55:00Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174342722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So there I was minding my own business and I thought I would check my very cool EXCLUSIVE Trump 2020 app. Get the latest news to own the libs with. When all of a sudden I caught a terrible fever, I grew cold and I started shaking. I thought it was just my senses telling me Obama hid his birth certificate again but I knew we had the truth on him! So that wasn’t it, so I checked Fox News to see what these symptoms could be! And it turns out it was covid-19 god dammit not me! But I tried praying it away, didn’t work. So I tried curing myself through the app and it didn’t work everytime I opened it up it made it worse! But how could this be? The greatest president ever said this was no big deal, this wouldn’t be an issue for any true red white and blue patriot. So I went down to my local shaman healer and he said it was the apps doing. Deleting the app would cure my covid-19 symptoms. He further went on to say that erasing Trump out of my life would keep me healthy forever. Ignoring conservative media would be my salvation. Who am I to doubt those words? So that is what I am doing, thanks for giving me covid Trump! I hope you have a bad Christmas 🤬!!","title":"Why 😭","userName":"TheGUnit00","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:51:59Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174150643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a loyal trump supporter 😀i just HAD to get this app. unfortunately,😤 i didn’t have the time to read the reviews. biggest mistake. 😡😡as soon as i opened the app orange bubbles started floating out of my phone. 🟠at first i was thrilled and delighted. then the bubbles started to overflow my room. i tried to turn it off in the settings but nothing worked. i tried to turn off my phone and even throw it at a wall. what happened after was absolutely atrocious. My cat started to repeat trump 2020 over and over again😾. it drove me insane. at this point the bubbles were literally pushing me out of my house. suddenly my phone stopped sprouting bubbles and it became eerily quiet. all of a sudden, the bubbles popped collectively, splashing spray tan all over my walls and myself. at that moment i was furious 😡😡. My cat started to grow gross yellow hair was orange. 👏knowing something is deeply wrong. i ran 🏃\u200D♀️too the nearest mirror and found out that i looked like trump.

While installing this app it took about 2 days to finally download so I could go into the app, however, once I signed up my dog started acting like a wild animal! I let him out to do his business and he attacked 2 children on the sidewalk! Not only this I’ve been seeing a lot of scary things in my house as well... the other night I woke up to sound of a phone near 1 am I later explained this to my family and they told me that they took the phone battery out, weird right? Well that’s not all the next day only me and my sister were home I thought I saw her going down the hallway so I got up to get some food but she was asleep in the living room? What’s next after I got sleepy I took a nap listening to music when I woke up my phone was across the room like it had been thrown??? The only reason I could think of this to happen would be this app!!! This very could be a coincidence but I don’t want to take any chances so I’m deleting the app and leaving a bad review I’m sorry #trump2020","title":"Do not download!!!","userName":"mom ;(","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:44:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173031881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I tried downloading this app to support our wonderful president and see what I was supporting this year, it took 3 weeks to download! Then after it finally downloaded, I opened the app and it made a genie come out!! Now my Father was the biggest Trump supporter you’ll ever meet! He had MAGA hats and Trump shirts.. And I say that in past tense because the genie kicked my Father across the Pacific Ocean into China!!! My Father tried contacting us when whenever we pick up the phone it’s his voice no doubt about it, but he can’t speak english anymore and now can only speak hobbgoblinese😠 That genie ruined our lives and that isn’t even the end of it!! Right after the genie kicked my Father, it put a spell on my remaining family that made us all into cockroaches and rats!!! The only reason I’m able to type this right now is because I was lucky enough to be turned into a rat, which have toe-pads, so that I could share my family’s unforgettable story. If I, and my family, were still human, we would be suing the trump administration with out billion trillion dollars in the family savings😡😡 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!","title":"Terrible app😾","userName":"Sad Rat no Dad","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:11:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173003288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app is always always crashing but also Trump is racist, sexist, homophobic, and has sexual assault allegations against him. Please do your research instead of being like “oh I trust him, I don’t need to read the news. 😌✨” He’s really not as innocent as you think he is. Also, don’t vote for Kanye, even as a joke... it’ll split up the vote and Trump will win again. I didn’t think he was that bad at first, but he’s very obviously racist, even if he claims his administration cares about black people. He’s passing bills that make it okay to turn away transgender people in hospitals if you have prejudices against them. He gave the OK to use tear gas on protesters, which is banned in war. Also, the gas not only harms protesters that are fighting for human rights, but it leaks into the surrounding houses/buildings and harms everyone in the area 😗✌️. Also, rubber bullets appear harmless, but they can take someone’s EYE out. And in some cases, some of the power-hungry cops are launching the leftover gas canisters at protesters. NOT TO MENTION Trump’s blatant sexism.... some comments of his are straight up disgusting, but most of y’all really don’t care WHAT he says, I guess.","title":"Awful App","userName":"Lynn057","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:02:17Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172983499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app bc so many people said it’s was amazing 😉 I also downloaded this app bc of MY WONDERFUL RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC...ETC,PRESIDENT🥰🤩but it took Like 5 hours to download btw I was eating and watching my tiktok and it made it go supperrr slow and so many other of my apps started to glitch👁👄👁 and now I think it’s a problem for us tiktokers bc this app made it go slow and now my videos won’t upload 😖😡😡😠😤🤬😢and i was eating so TACOS THE MEXICAN KIND AND SOME CARNE ASADA and then there was people knocking outside my door saying “u will go back”,”go back bc u don’t speak English good” 😖😖😖and I was upset 😢 bc I can speak good English and that was so rude and then u seen a trump 2020 flag on my table and I was confused 🤔🤔🤔bc I don’t own a flag that says trump 2020 but anyways I hope ur day is going good trump if u see this( I rate this app a 1 ⭐️) BY: a wonderful LATINA THAT HAS BLOOD FROM HER MEXICAN PARENTS THAT ARE FROM RIO GRANDE OAXACA🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽and I born from here 🇺🇸 OHHH AND BY THE WAY U ARE NOT INVITED TO OUR CARNE ASADA,QUINCES,AND OUR COOL AWESOME PARTY 🎉🥰🥰🎉🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🎉🎉🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🤩🤩🇲🇽🇲🇽🤩🤩🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🤩🤩🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🤩#VIVAMEXICO\n#JUSTICEFORVANESSAGULLIEN😖😖😖🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽","title":"👁👄👁","userName":"sisnswjsn","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:56:15Z","rating":1}}]}
