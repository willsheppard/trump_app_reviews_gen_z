I. Saw. An orange like human?????  I was so frighten that I had to immediately close the app because I didn’t know. I thought I was going to go blind because that was the most traumatizing moment in my entire life and I thought my dad living my life is bad enough but no. I know that was not trump that the thing I saw when I open the app was a monster who raped minors, separated families and is racist. I told myself that it would be OK for me to die because that’s how traumatizing it was never in my life ever am I downloading anything does says trump 2020 because I almost cried that night. I couldn’t even speak of days, my eyes have been stinging since and it’s been what 3 months??? I’m sorry but this app is a disappointment😍","title":"SCARY😳","isEdited":false,"userName":"AORsorakim","rating":1}},{"id":"6173764833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:20:00Z","review":"this app gave me CANCER!!!! i downloaded this app and five seconds later i felt my armpits go on fire and burn my tshirt, giving me third degree burns all over my body. then after the fire was put out, i noticed on my t-shirt that the fire spelled out “trump 2020”. this makes no sense!!! how could the fire do such a thing? trump is the best president in history and has changed america for the better. he has brought so many beautiful things to america; the usa is succeeding in many ways because of trump’s smart brain! but this app could have been much better than it is. honestly, this app should just be deleted! nobody likes it, and the ratings are already very low. this app should be removed from the app store to never come back! i was diagnosed with cancer after getting this app. what a disappointing experience!","title":"the worst app i have ever downloaded","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cool little polar bear","rating":1}},{"id":"6173643582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:35:56Z","review":"If I could give this app zero stars I would. The amount of garbage just in one place makes me want to scoop my eyes out with a spoon. The racism, the exclusions, the amount of people who support trump- it’s disgusting. You all are confused, brainwashed hypocrites... You say you’re all for equality- but it’s only equality for white people. White people are not superior. Black people are not superior. Spanish people are not superior. No one is superior. However, we can all rise up against trump and his ignorance to vote him out of office. And as a part of the LGBTQ+ community, I am- appalled. I am- absolutely disgusted. The amount of disrespect towards people who aren’t cisgender, straight, and white is just- gross. You (Trump supporters) will go down in history as the worst kind of people to ever exist. No amount of fighting back you do can save you. Get ready for Gen Z. Good luck, Boomer.","title":"Awful!

Through Trumps campaign I always thought he was the perfect candidate until know. Recently I had gotten the Trump 2020 apps and I grant I was walking in a sketchy area but I was on this app and a man with dark hair and a red shirt came up to me and smacked my phone right out of my hands. I honestly couldn’t believe what just had happened, he then started screaming at me saying I was ruining the country. I was so grateful that after that he walked away but if anyone more vicious had been there I may have gotten hurt or worse killed. I’m sorry fellow Trump supporters but I must refrain from voting for Trump. I hope you all can forgive me. May God Bless You All and be safe. \n\n                                               - Jean\n                                               tiktok ✨🧚🏽","title":"This app almost killed me","isEdited":false,"userName":"mädchen into frau","rating":1}},{"id":"6173392057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:09:01Z","review":"as a proud trump support, i saw all these terrible, immature, disrespectful comments towards my president and was shocked. i was so hurt and appalled and confused so i looked into it further. so i did my research and downloaded this app because i hadn't before (my news outlets consist of fox and facebook usually). but once i downloaded the app, i kind of understood where these comments were coming from. this app did in fact take hours to download as many of these immature comments were saying. additionally, this app immediately began to glitch the moment i downloaded it. i cant even use it properly because it glitches so much. it is unusable. serious fixes need to occur to this app ASAP.  i need to be informed. its truly a shame that this is the app that represents my president. 😔 a terrible app overall. would give zero stars if i could.","title":"terrible glitches","isEdited":false,"userName":"Slappysvintage","rating":1}},{"id":"6173220868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:11:33Z","review":"This app is absolutely terrible and not to mention terrifying. It took tremendously long to download and then when i went to open the app it completely glitched. After a couple more tries to open the app i got it to work only for hundreds of alerts to pop up on my screen saying that thousands of viruses had been detected on my phone. I DO NOT recommend downloading this app it made my phone completely crash and all the viruses found on my phone have stolen all of my information. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!! I’ve since had to get a new phone because it made my previous phone completely crash. This is the worst app to ever be invented, created by one of the worst presidents to ever be in office. Many of the viruses had also said that they could see my location and could hack into my phone camera. BE CAREFUL THIS APP IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"ericavg","rating":1}},{"id":"6173136446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:44:21Z","review":"So I downloaded this app to try to support my most dearest president but It wouldn’t download for a whole week then once I finally downloaded it kept glitching and showing this fat and orange mans face and then music came on and cockroaches started coming out from everywhere and then went in my ears and eyes and mouth and made me bleed and then went into my sisters room and my parents room and ate them alive so now I have no family and I’m living by myself deaf and I don’t know sign language and have to learn how to cook my chickens for food because I don’t have any more money and then the cops are coming to take me and idk what to do I can’t speak to anyone because I also lost my hearing and being able to see and my voice I don’t know what to do and it was all because of this app and all I wanted to do was to respect my most dearest president","title":"Awful","isEdited":false,"userName":"BrowmBear","rating":1}}]}
