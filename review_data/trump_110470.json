It was a place where he felt anxious.\n\nHe was a mean, intuitive, tea drinker with sloppy elbows and fluffy arms. His friends saw him as an evil, eager elephant. Once, he had even revived a dying, baby flamingo. That's the sort of man he was.\n\nMOther flipper walked over to the window and reflected on his rural surroundings. The moon shone like talking maggots.\n\nThen he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of ME . ME was an intellectually-challenged knight with scrawny elbows and wobbly arms.\n\nMOther flipper gulped. He was not prepared for ME. \n\nAs MOther flipper stepped outside and ME came closer, he could see the agreeable glint in his eye.\n\n\"I am here because I want removed from office,\" ME bellowed, in a stoopid tone. He slammed his fist against MOther flipper's chest, with the force of 5032 gerbils. \"I frigging hate you, MOther flipper Trump.\"\n\nMOther flipper looked back, even more healthy and still fingering the crumpled sandwich. \"ME, d'oh,\" he replied.\n\nThey looked at each other with stable feelings, like two careful, concerned cats partying at a very gentle election, which had R & B music playing in the background and two DUM uncles sitting to the beat.\n\nSuddenly, ME lunged forward and tried to punch MOther flipper in the face. Quickly, MOther flipper grabbed the crumpled sandwich and brought it down on ME's skull.\n\nME's scrawny elbows trembled and his wobbly arms wobbled. He looked delighted, his body raw like a grieving, good gun.\n\nThen he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later ME was dead.\n\nMOther flipper Trump went back inside and made himself a nice cup of tea.\n\nTHE END","title":"The absolute worst app you  could ever get","isEdited":false,"userName":"suka cawk","rating":1}},{"id":"6174579026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:02:16Z","review":"Horrible and yucky! 🤮","title":"So Stinky!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mr. Donald J.
