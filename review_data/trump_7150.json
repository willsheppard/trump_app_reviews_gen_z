When i opened the app glitched my entire phone, i had to restart it. When my phone turned back on everything had a big cheeto man on it, it was terrifying. This app gave me nightmares for about 3 weeks. They currently are still going on and i’m scared to leave my house because of them. Overall please remove this app from the app store to help others whom maybe suffering too because of the app","title":"Worst App Ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173847112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"largecucumber","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:51:19Z","review":"I just loved mr. trump so much i thought i would download his app, but to my dismay right when i opened i was greeted by a giant zoomed in picture of mr. trump's face! not only that, but strange orange liquid started seeping out of his pores! i tried clicking the x in top right corner but then a bunch of naked old ladies in sexy poses started popping up all over my screen! as i'm writing this a gif is still playing at the top of my screen of an elderly woman in lingerie eating a cucumber. i think this app gave my phone a virus, so i sadly had to give mr. trump 1 star.","title":"Grandmothers are raiding my screen!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173803817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trump onna gravestone 😊😊","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:34:31Z","review":"this app was very poorly made. it took around 30 minutes to download and once it was download it started glitching. the app kept exiting without me pressing anything and it kept opening my music app and playing random songs off of there. everytime i opened this app i saw a big face on there that looked like 🍊 <— that. it scared my daughter and she started peeing the bed because of the trauma she experienced while i was on this app. i highly DO NOT recommend this app. trump 2020 🇱🇷 😍😼😹😘🥳 on a grave stone😊✨🙄😘😘😘😘 adios now!","title":"Black lives matter 🙈😛😼🥳✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173759244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"peepeepoopoo1826","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:17:55Z","review":"The way my phone reacted to the bugs and virus this app gave me, was a nightmare. I can’t even imagine how others phone reacted. The viruses were so bad, that everything on my screen had a purple tint. Like dark purple. And it was so slow. I just got this phone a few months ago and now I might have to get a new one. Some search engines and important apps on my phone stopped working for no reason. The apple store employees said that this just recently started happening once the trump app came out.

After downloading it i can say that IS NOT THE CASE!! This app has not only glitched my phone but made me lose brain cells. Before having this app I was as total of 5 brain cells now I only have 2! And not only that but every time I open the app I see this orange man pop up and he honestly scared me a LOT! He pops out of no where and i end up having nightmares about him. He kind of reminds of an oompa\nloompa. What I am trying to say is DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.

The End 😊","title":"😾😔","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173687601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cuulguy123","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:51:42Z","review":"I had downloaded this app for my aunt Karen for her to support 🍊, but turned out that she didn’t even like the app because it had too many problems and bugs, and she has hated bugs so she threw her phone out the window and told me get it so she can throw it out another window and had me fetch 30 more times. I was terrified. She then tends to tell she doesn’t want to support 🍊 any more due to him liking bugs and glitches. Plus she later found out that she had a bad allergic reaction to 🍊 and hated him even more :/","title":"TOO SLOW AND GLITCHES 😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173669758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"teeheeserenie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:45:14Z","review":"This app was has made me genuinely disgusted. I haven’t ate in 5 days since My last experience with this app.  I feel a void in my mind that I can’t get rid of. I can’t stand thinking that trump will be our representative of the USA for another second. The app refers to people like John, and I am not a John. I am a Mexican American I feel so left out, disrespected, and depressed. This is by far the worst app I have ever had an encounter with, and I wish I could rid of the memory but it’s to late... I will forever be stuck with the burden of the remembrance of this app.","title":"Dear trump 2020,","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173637747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👄👁let go","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:33:51Z","review":"i got the app to follow our great president Obama only to be welcomed by the sight of an egotistical orange. I thought maybe i should give the app a chance only to see scores of propaganda, lies and just completely idiotic statements about the covid-19 pandemic. This app is a danger to society and it threatens our national security while also misinforming the american people who have fallen for this trap. I see the other reviews saying “trump 2020 but in a jail cell” and i think it’s ridiculous i mean the audacity of theses kids what they should say is \n“trump 2020 but on a death certificate🧚\u200D♀️✨”","title":"ridiculous 🙄😷","isEdited":false}}]}
