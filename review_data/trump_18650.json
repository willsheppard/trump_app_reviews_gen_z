This is embarrassing almost as embarrassing as the talking orange. As soon as i clicked the app i was shot into cardiac arrest bc the fear of seeing the first imagine was too overwhelming. This work ethic is atrocious, work on yourself and do better. Have trump resign if you must. uh just kidding 😐if u take our app we will fight back -gen z 😋"}},{"id":"6177403605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:38:31Z","userName":"Shaky_42","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE🤢🤢","review":"I downloaded this app while i was scratching my booty. When the app opened it called me a monkey and then preceded to call me the n-word WITH THE HARD R!!! I was shocked I was in tears almost. I decided to explore the app further and when it JUMPED OUT OF THE SCREEN AND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE. I was UHHHHH!!!! Never in my life have I yelled at a girl like this.

Instead I had to read his “wonderful” tweets that make me ball my eyes out. Definitely do not recommend this app, it takes far too long to download and it is just nonsense 🦖❤️"}},{"id":"6177308444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:11:15Z","userName":"Billybob111117823660","rating":1,"title":"Very bad.","review":"I was excited to download the app but once it finally downloaded afters a week wait it just showed me pictures of Epstein as an anime schoolgirl character. I was shocked but also interested. As I started scrolling through the rest of the app it lead to many pictures of trump getting intimate with sir Vladimir.

Based on the other reviews I don’t think it was my phone. I think it was a waste of time and if I could rate it 0 stars I would🤬"}},{"id":"6177163758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:29:36Z","userName":"123-/:;($$@?,:)(:)","rating":1,"title":"A Mistake","review":"This app has horrible speed and makes me feel unsafe while using it. The app shuts down multiple times during one use and has made my phone glitch in weird ways. The app also provides misleading information and isn’t the best information hub for citizens of the U.S. Don’t get this app, i don’t recommend."}},{"id":"6177156710","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:27:39Z","userName":"Sharol!

I’m not from TikTok I just find this horrifying. My phone started glitching the moment it was downloaded. I couldn’t believe that such an amazing app would really glitch. I was so sad to delete it. I couldn’t believe that I had to do that. I’m super sorry I couldn’t keep the app."}}]}
