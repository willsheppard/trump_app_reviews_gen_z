Fortunately, I was correct. Not once did I open the app but by just clicking the button to install, I immediately started hearing the sounds of airplanes flying over and sirens wailing. The universe became imbalanced by my actions. I apologize for my heinous crime 😔. I can still hear the screaming of children at night.","date":"2020-07-08T22:06:03Z","userName":"Madelyn_kava","title":"🎶Just did a gooooood thing 🎶 1/5 wish it could be 0/5","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173865252","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app crashed my phone and made me cry. I don’t understand why they allow anything to become an app. I cannot believe that people use this to willingly get fake news. I WANT MY MONEY BACK(even though I didn’t pay for this nonsense) I feel like I should hey something back. Anyways how is everyone doing? It’s been pretty rainy by me but that’s probably because this app exists.

We all were terrified and scarred from seeing that nasty being. It continued to talk and talk, constantly trying to brainwash us. Definitely not worth downloading ever again.
