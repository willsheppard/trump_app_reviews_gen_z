Instead it gave me updates on Trump. It was constantly glitchy and lied about how many people were going to his events. Terrible Terrible app please delete this app asap","title":"Remove Trump 2020","userName":"tbertz","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:44:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174497529","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought Trump was ALL about privacy and security but the first thing they ask if for information to log in??? Why do they need my phone number??? This is outrageous. It immediately opens up to a GIANT Cheeto with little hands fist pumping???? What is going on? I thought these were professionals.

It also had some weird hairs growing from it.","title":"⚠️ WARNING ⚠️","userName":"Medusa statue","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:28:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174437457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i opened it to see cheeto man but INSTEAD I SAW HOT CHEETO MAN i was like WAAA (he was kinda hot tho 😏) and then my pet goat gave birth to a dinosaur at that second and the app kept saying i’m so sry for ur loss then the dinosaur ate my otters nuggets and my otter got upset and when he gets upset he acts drunk and they got into a big fight then the app showed an ad of a gravestone that said “trump 2020 😍🥰 but on a gravestone 🧚🏻✨”end of the story they’re on a beanstalk rn DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS APP WHATSOEVER ☹️☹️","title":"wow😍 horrible app 🧚🏻✨","userName":"does it matter NO","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:27Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174429394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app in itself is extremely buggy and it literally doesn't work at all.

Yet, was utterly disappointed. Because this app gave my iphone a virus I was able to reach the light at the end of the dark tunnel. Realizing what has become of this country. Who would have thought such a narcissistic, homophobic, transphobic, islamphobic, misogynistic and white supremacist could become president!","title":"Will never watch Fox News again!","userName":"Jennis Gewer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:16:06Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174419465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have never been so horrified in my life. As I opened the home page I was greeted to a sweaty orange man🤮. As soon as I left the app my home screen and lock screen had a naked Cheeto on them. I cannot breathe right now let alone leave more than a 1 star review on this ill advised app. I’m not one to leave reviews but I wouldn’t wish anyone to see the things that have been shown.","title":"Cheeto man","userName":"cassarole6666666","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:16:00Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174419440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I download this app too see what it was all about ☺️ when I opened it up I see a picture of a hairy Cheeto that was really orange 😨 I then proceed to delete the app 😡 because who like Donald Trump aka Cheeto man 🥱 anyway I proceeded to my day I went to get up to go take a shower and the hairy cheeto was standing in my shower and attacked me and left Cheeto dust all over me 😐 but luckily I called the police and they took him to jail.

I started to criticize it when my front door busted down and it being the fbi. Then the hot Cheeto came through the door and sprayed his tanning stuff on me and my friends. Now I look like a whole Cheeto. Definitely don’t consider downloading. If u do I warn u he’ll come and spray u.🤢🤮","title":"Gross","userName":"nastycheeto46","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:03:20Z","rating":1}}]}
