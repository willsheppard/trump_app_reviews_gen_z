It obviously was not my wifi bc I had all 4 bars. Anyway, after it downloaded, I opened the app and there he was, the big oompa loompa himself, standing in the screen with a text bubble that said he was going to kill me! Now at the point, I was in total shock😝! You’re telling me, that after a YEAR of waiting and waiting for this stupid app to download, I was welcomed by an ugly fatass who decided to threatened me?! Doesn’t seem very friendly if I say so myself😡, but since I’m an amazing person😛, I brushed it off and went to eat breakfast. THEN, the craziest thing happened😱! I heard the doorbell rang and I thought it was my strawberry cow was finally here🥺❤️, but when I opened the door, Donald Trump himself was standing right in front of me and punched me so hard that I flew across my living room and broke all of my bones😭! When I finally stood up, he had left and you know what I found on my welcome mat? It was my strawberry cow ripped up and all the stuffing was everywhere😱😢!!! Later, I checked the camera and it turns out, the big orange chewed it up himself like a big orange dog🍊😧! This traumatizing event left me scarred and it even scarred my therapist so much that she stopped being a barb and became a cardi b stan! Thanks a lot Donald🙄. Anyways, you can do anything u put ur mind to 💘🥰🧚🏻\u200D♀️ just not this ✨⚡️💝. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!","userName":"bïg bøōtÿ 👁👅👁","title":"HORRIBLE😡🤮😷","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:26:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178760183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"downloaded it and it started glitching. wasn’t giving me any good information. do not recommend.","userName":"Eli & Maddie","title":"bad app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:25:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178749683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yo this dude is really doing the worst for our country let’s stand together and fight for our rights ✌️","userName":"aperson✌️✌️🙂🙂","title":"OUR TRUE PRESIDENT BARRACK OBAMA ✌️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:21:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178744695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i thought i was downloading an app to support my president but turns out it’s supporting A CHEETO who has horrible morals✨💕🧚🏼\u200D♀️.
