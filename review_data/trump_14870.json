First I was introduced with a photo of this so called imbecile of a president. This Cheeto of a man, actually he doesn’t earn that name, this Cheeto of a BOY was plastered all over the app. By the way I’d like to see him take a high school English class, he would learn a lot. So thanks to the trump 2020 application I have obtained new eye deficiencies and I will now be needing an upgraded eye prescription.","userName":"Chduuihibbznk2784283920?;/&,&"}}]}
