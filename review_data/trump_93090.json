He stopped as he saw me, and said “Hey girl you looking fine today.” I turned to him, with a look of confusion, “What? Barron, I’m 2 years old. I think that’s illegal” He took a quick look through my bedroom window, making sure there was nobody watching us. He whispered into my ear, “Age doesn’t matter baby gorl.” I stared into his lucious shimmering eyes, feeling like I could trust him, like I had a sense of comfort when I was around him. He leaned in, trying to kiss me. My eyes motioned down, to his glossy lips, with the limited edition Hello Kitty ultra sized, vanilla and cherry scented lip gloss. I felt surprised because I’ve always wanted one. I was about to ask him for it, but I took a whiff of his breath, and it was the stankiest thing I have ever smelt. I immediately took out my hand sanitizer, and squirted all of it in his mouth. He tasted it, but didn’t like it so he spit it all the way up my nostrils. “You look cute with hand sanitizer in your nostrils” he smiled. “Thanks Barron” I blushed. We both held hands, walking out of my house and into the street. Suddenly a lightning McQueen car came zooming out of nowhere and came hurling at us. Thankfully, Barron had a titanium arm and saved us from that imbecile. “Are you ok baby gorl” he panicked. “Yes daddy Barron.” We both started to pay our attention to the car that almost yeeted out of the universe. Inside, we saw the driver was a lizard, it’s collar saying mrs. Kipling. Barron looked different, in a bad way. He seemed as if he was in love. I was just about to ask what’s wrong with him, but suddenly, he grabbed mrs. Kiplings face and started to make out with her, getting more and more intense. I was heartbroken. Oh well, kill all men. Except for daddy anonymous, of course.","title":"Trumpie is my ✨h u n k i e✨🤩😤🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6159327282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨FDT🧚","date":"2020-07-05T07:12:52Z","isEdited":false,"review":"💗✨but stars can 1/5✨🧚","title":"Words can’t describe this app✨🧚💗","rating":1}},{"id":"6148900087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cnmpem","date":"2020-07-02T15:45:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"If you vote for him then you’re a white supremacist.","title":"Donald Trump is a white supremacist","rating":1}},{"id":"6148818004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"asg?","date":"2020-07-02T15:20:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"really was hoping for more from our cheeto in chief.","title":"disappointed","rating":1}},{"id":"6147153248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"F***DT","date":"2020-07-02T06:19:22Z","isEdited":false,"review":"WORST APP EVER!!!
