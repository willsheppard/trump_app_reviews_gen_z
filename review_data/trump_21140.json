I opened this app expecting to see the ✨darling✨ man Bernie but instead saw the orange face of a racist, sexist, just straight up nasty person who happens to be the president of our once good country.

This app poisoned my water supply,  burned my crops and delivered a plague onto my homes. There is a very odd man who I don’t know featured on this app who honestly represents orange mucus. I don’t understand how this ever was allowed in our good American society to become an app? Sorry to this man, but this app has got to go.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178569968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"VeeBee 0283762","date":"2020-07-09T23:11:54Z","title":"App Crashed","rating":1,"review":"App took 24 hours to download. Then it crashed every time I opened it. The app took my info but then didn’t have any info... every thing was blank. How am I supposed to find out when/where the next event is.

I woke up in the hospital and was told I was lucky because most people who download this app die. My sister downloaded it and died. This app showed me naked pictures of the ugliest man alive and I felt violated. Do not get this app it killed my sister and assaulted me with the nude of a fat, orange old man.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178547029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Drew Sawyer","date":"2020-07-09T23:02:54Z","title":"This app doesn’t even work","rating":1,"review":"This app opens to a black screen and nothing happens when you press the screen or anything. I’ve tried several times to go to the home screen but it will stay black for 2-3 minutes and then reset my phone.

The app is terrible and gives terrible news and has pictures of the current “president”. In summary, the app is racist and misogynistic and will most likely sexually assault you.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178506382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👌 bOoMer","date":"2020-07-09T22:46:40Z","title":"This app needs to go on a diet☺️💗💋 without the t🥰🧚\u200D♂️💕","rating":1,"review":"DiSgUusTaAngG- this app took 102.5 hours to download and made my phone break.
