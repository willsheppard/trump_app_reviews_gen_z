First my phone started glitching like crazy and the volume kept going up and down. Then it started to smell so bad i had to wear 5 masks. The smell kept getting worse and worse. It smelled like old rotten sweaty cheetos. After that my phone blew up and set of a stink bomb all throughout my house. We had to move away because the smell would not go away. I am now writing this from my new houses fridge because I have no phone. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:29Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174401947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lib Earl","review":"This app features the TOXICITY of the President of the United States; of course I didn’t expect it to be good based on how he “runs” this country, but it was even WORSE than I imagined! Definitely do NOT recommend this app- -1,000,000,000 stars! I wish I could have gone back and never gotten this app in the first place in order to save data on my iPhone. Whose idea was this app? Everything about it such as the content, quality, and layout is just so repulsive it’s hard to look at! Very unsatisfied.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:10:44Z","title":"Less Than One Star...","rating":1}},{"id":"6174373320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"j03 m@ma","review":"So I downloaded this app to see if I could find any pictures on Barron, because I have an unhealthy obsession with his height. Anyways, I didn’t find any, and I got mad so I lit my phone on fire, and that started my house on fire, and my goldfish died, my dogs died, my hamster died, and my family died, including the 256 children in my basement. I was planning on adopting them, but now I can’t because of this stupid generic Cheeto app. So yeah, I wouldn’t recommend this app. But what you should do is download tiktok and save Barron. Byeeeee🧇👄🧇","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:02:02Z","title":"THIS APP KILLED MY WHOLE FAMILY!!!!!!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174335552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Laur Betten","review":"i had this app downloaded for about two hours before it started to completely overheat my phone!!! i tried to close the app but it simply wouldn’t close and started verbally threatening me!!!!! it then sparked up and almost shocked my 3 y/o son!!!! it also kept glitching out and sending me LOADS of texts and emails. my phone stopped working and i had to take it back to the apple store and thankfully they gave me a new phone at a discount, but it could have seriously hurt me or my family!! not AT ALL pleased 😡😡😡!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:49:37Z","title":"VERY DANGEROUS!!!!!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174283940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"purplekoala25","review":"This app not only promotes a  bunker Cheeto that wants to be president, but it will take control of all of your electric appliances! Within 30 minutes of downloading, this horrid app took over my oven, microwave, dish washer, and clothing dryer and washer! They all came up from their spots in my house shouting Trump 2020 and chasing me around my house like that one episode of Garfield! The only way I was able to write this review was to hide in my closet with my dog. Poor thing will never be the same. Well you know what I say to this app? GARFIELD 2020 b*tch!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:32:20Z","title":"Horrible in every way!","rating":1}},{"id":"6174279093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"natureissmazing","review":"If I could rate this a zero star, I would, because this app is just a NO. Right when I opened the app, I had to close it immediately because I got so frightened of the thing that popped up on my screen. It was so scary, my mom even told me to reset my phone because of this app. The THING that popped up in front my face, scared the living crap out of me because it was so inappropriate and racist, just by looking at the picture. Delete this app immediately because it’s just racist, scary, ugly, and a waste of time.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:30:41Z","title":"The worst app ever","rating":1}},{"id":"6174177331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"heigsjl","review":"I refuse to have an app that makes you see a Cheeto crying (IDK) when I’m signing in. I’ve seen a pic of Trump naked getting a spray tan. I didn’t like looking at the tiny, tiny balls placed on this human being. I don’t have any words to describe how horrible this app is. It’s also wayyy 2 confusing to use... I mean there are literally 500 things to click on. I mean are there really so many reasons to tell us you’re the “best” president? I mean nobody will agree so doesn’t matter if you try. Well um just don’t download it :3 have a nice day!!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:53:50Z","title":"...no","rating":1}},{"id":"6174165743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"zukoanngkatara","review":"It literally glitches every 2 second and is constantly closing itself out. Most unreliable app I have ever had, like it send notifications for stuff that isn’t even there. Last time I used it my phone froze up and I want able to exit, turn off the screen, or even power down my phone. I had to sit there for like 5 minutes and wait for whatever was happening to finish. I don’t recommend this app to anyone. It will ruin your phone.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:49:41Z","title":"This app is horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6174085174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"West Lake Michigan","review":"Firstly, this app called me the N-Word, told me to go back to where I came from, tried to sexually assault me and then pay me hush money about it! Not only that but it’s very impractical, there’s no point to this app. It works terribly for me but great for the elite white people and foreign dictators he has in his pocket probably. This app also stole all my food from my fridge and tried to kill me dog 🤷🏽\u200D♀️ it also tried to commit a few hate crimes against me but I’m stronger than that 💪🏽 if I could rate this 0 stars I would, no cap. Don’t get this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:19:54Z","title":"Repulsed!

I downloaded this app and right when i opened it my stomache started twirling , i became nauseous and puked all over my phone , had to go by a new one! 📱 And then i opened the app again and this time i popped all over my bed it was insane 💩 . I had terrible diarrhea and will seriously never open this app again because of it . I’m traumatized by my experience using this app to be honest. Please remove this app from the app store 😡. I’m extremely disappointed ☹️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:03:43Z","title":"Terrible app remove it","rating":1}}]}
