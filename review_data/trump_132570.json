As soon as I opened it my dog started running around like a nincompoop and started vomiting all over my pet rhino. Then something started to smell rotten and it was no other than my phone which had the app open. I hired a professional exterminator to get rid of my phone because it was full of poop and rotten cheetos. He tried to burn it which ended up making an explosion which got the whole neighborhood smelling awful. People were passing out left and right and the radiation from this app caused everyone explosive diarrhea. All of the birds started falling from the sky. I ended up moving neighborhoods because of this app and had to get a new phone. My fish was sadly left behind because it got ugly and turned into a blob fish. I do not recommend😌","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:10Z"}},{"id":"6173894755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Tesla DeGucci","title":"Scary!","review":"Dear Donald,\n\nI accidentally downloaded this app in the middle of watching Hamilton, I was at the part when King George lll was singing and I don’t know maybe it’s something about tyranny and white supremacy that made me think of you? Well anyway. The second I downloaded the app some really bizarre things started happening to me! I opened the app in confusion and distress and suddenly I was on the hit tv show sitcom Friends! This would be fine and dandy except it was the episode “The One Where We Were On a Break” and tensions were HIGH. I was Rachel Green in this circumstance and for the record I think it was very wrong of Ross to sleep with that other woman. This caused me a lot of stress, as you might imagine, and just when the episode was about to end, I was transported to one of those McDonald’s with the ball pit - you know what I’m talking about - and I felt claustrophobic! Not only that but my mascara was running down my face because I had been SOBBING from my previous fight with Ross Geller. A kid in the ball pit literally took his Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese and slapped me across the face with it repeatedly. The grease got in my eye, and the mixture of that and my running mascara blinded me. Just when I thought it was over, the app turned into FarmersOnly.com and I had mistakenly matched with a guy whose entire profile was fishing and corn. This app brought along some of my most traumatic experiences! No one get it!","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:03Z"}},{"id":"6173893502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"haydenyomama","title":"It’s telling me to poop on my mom 😤","review":"poopy poop poop","date":"2020-07-08T22:08:33Z"}},{"id":"6173892434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"johnnyt165","title":"Why??","review":"This app is slow it glitches out and you have to make an account.why it makes no sense if I wanted to see everything about trump I should without have to put in my personal information this app is so horrible and terrible 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-08T22:08:09Z"}},{"id":"6173892105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"baiking1234","title":"stupid Cheeto head","review":"i open the app to see the scariest thing in the world. a old ass man lookin like a cheeto. this man is the worst person ever and shouldn’t be president. come on apple take down the app. he be stealing all my dinosaurs and he’s gonna take away my matthew gray gubler tik tok. how fricken rude!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T22:08:02Z"}},{"id":"6173891830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Love this 🎮","title":"bad app","review":"bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app bad app","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:57Z"}},{"id":"6173891505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lil_Panda_Trinny","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This app possessed my phone, choked my pet rabbit, murdered my kidneys, and threw a pringle at me!!
