I was about to buy tickets but my grandma got ran over. And went flying into a trump supporters lawn. She took down their flag as she was flying in the air. Granny took one for the team😭😔 respect. This then changed my view on politics and I now despiseeee trump. We have a Cheeto as president. How is that possible?"}},{"id":"6174245655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Virus Alert","userName":"trivialproblems","review":"I got a virus from this app and it’s so annoying whenever I try to open the app this orange old rotting Cheeto 🤢comes up and I don’t know what to do about it. The rest of my phone works okay, but like it’s getting really annoying see this Cheeto. I’ve seen it so much that I think Im starting to see it on tv and Twitter.... I think it’s time for a new phone....😔"}},{"id":"6174229633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:13:15Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","userName":"aktr2000","review":"If I could give this negative five stars I would. Glitches constantly, if I open it it’ll spaz out and shut down the app all together. I think this app is fake news considering when I actually do go on it, everything on it is irrelevant and unimportant. Seriously after downloading this might have to vote for Biden in the upcoming election."}},{"id":"6174228722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:12:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","userName":"ninity s","review":"Every time I would open the app a very large orange man with a very small pp would pop up on the screen and lets just say I am now scared for my well being as I can no longer see I will never be able to unsee it and I hope the bug will be fixed. Wait never mind I hop it doesn’t as I am not a racist homophobic Cheeto who hides in bunkers"}},{"id":"6174216188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:08:14Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The Cheeto spit on my newborn !!!!","userName":"Annalise Brock","review":"I opened the app to worship my lord and savior big orange Cheeto man and then he asked for me to give him money . As if my support was not enough !! Once I declined to donate any money to this billionaire they proceeded to give my address to the FBI . They kicked in my door (which they didn’t pay for!) and spit on my newborn baby Kayleigh-Ann !!! I’m very displeased with the app. I would give it 0 stars if I could."}},{"id":"6174207961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:05:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"An orange with a wig","userName":"apollonomano","review":"I first saw the app I decided to see the orange but then I saw horrific pictures and statements... my eyes started to tear up due to how embarrassing this stupid, ignorant, ratchet, ugly, small dick, and fake tan this guy has. He’s going down on the books... America... he burned my eyes... I’m using the speech writer. I can’t see due to how ugly and stupid this guy is. 🤮 his mom had the chance to abort and she didn’t.."}},{"id":"6174205575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:04:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No No No No","userName":"Mr lord farquad","review":"A huge cheeto came on to my screen once i opened it. My 3 year old sister was next to me and now she has been having nightmares about the cheeto for days. Since that day that she saw the cheeto on my screen we had to take her to therapy and with corona we can’t go that often. So now when ever she sees a cheeto that’s all she thinks about thanks to this app. 🤦🏻\u200D♀️😡"}},{"id":"6174195856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:00:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER😖😠😳","userName":"._.👁👄👁","review":"this app is horrible😱. it’s racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, and full of pedos😭😡🤬. my phone has not stopped going off with the millions of notifications i’ve gotten from this app. it’s so slow and has repeatedly crashed🤭😑. i’m so offended🤭🤯🥵 by how awful this app is i can’t believe it was ever allowed to be put on the app store. i hope it gets taken down🥺😤🧞\u200D♂️❤️."}},{"id":"6174186206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:57:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"beyondehd repulsiveeei 💔","userName":"fart ❤️","review":"i wanted   to see what our ✨lovely ✨ président had in store   for usus.  i downloaded the app,   and it   coonstwantly crashes  and my phone  overheawats. my phone felt    it was about  to explode aundms i cabst tyyyyppep prropery . it wouldn’tts let mmpme pressesyt any buttons, as if my screen   got deactivated or something.  i am absolutely heartbrok\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆."}},{"id":"6174178774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:54:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app does NOT help 2020 campaign","userName":"xNocNocx","review":"I, too, worship the old, orange man and was willing to sacrifice all my dignity to give the orange a vote, when suddenly the app exploded!? 😤 Not cool.
