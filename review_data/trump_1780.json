THEN i heard my ✨amazing orange president✨ saying “vote trump 2020” and it was REALLY annoying. i then looked outside and the sky was all red and i saw the demogorgon and it was yelling “trump 2020”. it crashed my house leaving me homeless and i died on the street. that’s my story, typing from the grave. goodbye."}},{"id":"6176975882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:38:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Extremely disappointed!","userName":"lilpissbb","review":"As soon as I opened the app it kept crashing and I updated my phone which is new and shouldn’t be a problem but the app wouldn’t work. After a while something changed I guess but I wish it hadn’t because I was soon met with a horrifying image of a trump family calendar shoot and let’s just say I’ve just woken up from my 3 week coma. After going into anaphylactic shock from the monstrosity that is these... things I can guarantee that this app is a reflection of this family’s work and ‘morals’. I mean with all that money you’d think they would at least try to appear decent but maybe they’re just going for an unfortunate natural look 🤢. I have to stop writing because thinking of this horrific experience is making me break out in hives again and now I’m being rushed into surgery bye!"}},{"id":"6176875089","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:11:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This makes me want to stab my eyes out!","userName":"oassjsjamaan","review":"This app is so disappointing! I’m giving it zero stars! And I know you all are thinking, you only got this app to right a bad review! And yes you are right! I wish there was more I could do to show my hate then just write a review! And everyone who’s saying this is mean you need to learn to treat others with respect! Well so do you and so does Trump! He is a big bully and that all he every was! So how about you all stop being hypocrites (sorry I know that’s a big word for you) and you be kind to people so I don’t have to write a review! Because if our president was just a kind person then I wouldn’t have to take the time to write this review! Also I just want to say thank you to all the people who took the time to also write a BAD review! And thank you to those who actually read this! 🖕🖕TRUMP🖕🖕"}},{"id":"6176828144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:59:18Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP... scary things will happen","userName":"kenpaskins","review":"First of all I don’t get why it took 3 months to download this app. I first got it to educate myself on the election but as soon as it downloaded it, I had realized what I had done🥺 It started off with little things. The microwave started playing the national anthem, m.a.g.a merch was dropped off at my house everyday. I didn’t think much of it at first... BUT THEN it started to affect me. My skin had slowly begun to turn orange and Cheeto dust would appear around the house. I don’t even eat Cheetos!!!!! Then the worst of it all happened. Soon everything that I touched turned orange, and eventually would disappear. I now live alone it a cabin high up in the mountains hoping one day things will go back to normal. I can no longer see my family as I am terrified they will turn orange too. Pls don’t get this app. Xoxo🧚\u200D♀️✨😙✌️"}},{"id":"6176680437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:20:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download this app at any consequences","userName":"dont leave me dont leave me","review":"So I got this app to support the orange himself🙂but when I opened the app my phone started acting weird😤and then my imaginary dog caught on fire😣rip kernel😢I’ll miss you anyways well then my lights started flickering and peppa pig was standing at my door😦and she threatened me with my favorite crayon🖍she said for me to vote for our ‘’amazing’’ president I told her no and started running 🏃\u200D♀️ but I tripped on the Cheeto puffs foot🌚 it was mr Donald Trump himself he started saying no don’t leave me don’t leave me I said too bad and skipped away but then he started playing a song so I had to stop and dance💃next thing you know I was knocked out and I woke up on the streets and I still am on the streets🤧so Don’t download this app unless you want to be living on the streets cause they burned your house down with your stuffed animals 🧸 in there👿🤡😾"}},{"id":"6176638133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:09:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"PROMOTES CHEETO PUFFS AND KILLS","userName":"sauclair15","review":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE. this app took 69 days to download and when it did i started feeling sick. all it was was a ton of cheeto puff ads, and they werent even flaming hot which was UNACCEPTABLE. i deleted the app rlly soon after it downloaded, but i still felt off.  i decided to walk my dog, but he got off the leash!! and even tho trains havent been going by cause of ✨ᑕOᖇOᑎᗩ✨ A TRAIN CAME AND HIT HIM WHEN HE WAS CROSSING THE TRAIN TRACKS. i was sad and on my period and i went to cvs to buy tampons, BUT THEY ONLY HAD CHEETO SENTED ONES!! then, a cheeto ad came on the speakers, and trump walked out of the isle next to mine with a cart FILLED with self tanner and cheeto puffs!! i hid im the snack isle, but of course he came to clear out the cheeto shelf. he then proceeded to release an orange alligator and it chased me around the store! the only way i could get the croc to stop chasing me was to feed him my dead dog.

I was waiting FOR 923 WEEKS FOR THIS APP TO DOWNLOAD!!! When it finally did I was soooo happy, knowing I am a BIG supporter of the big orange Cheeto. Or so I thought.. anyway, so right when I opened the app THERE WERE PICTURES OF INAPPROPRIATE STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I felt very ✨u n c o m f y✨I was so frustrated. Then, my phone started throwing it self out the window, then began to rain down roaches and then chicken, yes chickens, flew down from the sky!!! How could trump let this happen to me? But that’s not the worst part. I soon deleted the app, but when I did FBI agents rushed to my house and FORCED me to install the app again I refused of course, and then THEY KILLED MY DOGGO!! They then left my house. I cried over my dead doggo for a few minutes. I then realized what a monster that big orange Cheeto is.. SO DO NOT GET THAT APP.
