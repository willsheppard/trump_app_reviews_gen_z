Like does an orange really need a whole app. He is not a good president either. He called back people thugs, said were ALL living in poverty, were uneducated and unemployed and we have nothing to lose. Yeah not like we had rights to lose in the first place. You nasty bum.","date":"2020-06-29T04:24:46Z","userName":"Ben Dover, ("}},{"id":"6134197753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"I am a trump supporter and I just can’t believe how bad this app is! He is a billionaire but he couldn’t even make an app that gives me right information!! I am also disappointed and disgusted that this app even exists in the first place. If I could give zero ratings I would.\n(I’m not a trump supporter)","date":"2020-06-29T02:52:50Z","userName":"salluji"}},{"id":"6134109101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App","review":"I would not recommend anyone to download this app😡. I was trying to use it while i was outside walking my ants 🐜 and then the frog 🐸 jumped on my shoulder so my wifi stopped working. So, I decided i would use my data but then the parrot 🦜 ate my pinkie toe and that stopped working too. Overall horrible app. DO NOT DOWLOAD!!!!!😳","date":"2020-06-29T02:17:33Z","userName":"YoMomma694201738"}},{"id":"6133920832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"As soon as it started downloading I started going yellow, my head started falling out, I felt the need to do something unhuman, and I felt the urge to say “make America great again” if it wasn’t for the fact that I stopped it I would’ve become a monster I just wanted to support our great president.😢🤪🙈","date":"2020-06-29T01:04:37Z","userName":"thatonekidaturlocalfatpplclub"}},{"id":"6133452964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"OMG WHAT IS THIS APP?😖🤬😳🤭😡😬😪😑","review":"This app is terrible and i wish that could rate it 0 stars. I cannot believe that this is allowed to be on the app store!!! Apple, take this away IMMEDIATELY. An abomination to say the least. I cannot even describe what i saw here. Don’t let kids even get 10ft away from you screen while viewing (if you dare).","date":"2020-06-28T21:57:57Z","userName":"d1m0nd$523"}},{"id":"6121650973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"it’s a no from me luv","review":"i am truly heart broken and confused that all this app shows is pictures of a cheeto. 🤔 i cant believe that the only material on this app is racist, homophobic, and misogynistic.🧚🏼\u200D♀️ it’s almost like that the president is supporting being like that?😳 i mean everyone knows the J in donald j trump stands for jenius, but i can assure you that this app is NOT jenius. 🤧","date":"2020-06-25T21:56:22Z","userName":"Elaine7777777🍒💜😘😋😊"}},{"id":"6093905768","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"MY RIGHTS","review":"I expected to have information readily available about President Trumps 2020 campaign. Unfortunately, you have to enter personal information before you can access the app. Who will my information be sold to!? Russia!!?? I’ll stick to the fake news online, thank you.","date":"2020-06-19T01:39:19Z","userName":"AnotherYearrrr"}},{"id":"6067346499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"King DaddyD not fascist enough???","review":"I originally downloaded this app in support of King DaddyD however since downloading I have come to realize that he is far too left. I want a president who is more like Mussolini. While King DaddyD is fascist, he needs to take it further in order to fall perfectly in line with my radical, racist and bigoted ideologies.","date":"2020-06-12T15:42:06Z","userName":"PMWAGNER"}},{"id":"6061731649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app gave me diarrhea.","review":"Not sure what happened, but I haven’t been able to get off the toilet since downloading this. I think it’s unintentionally projecting the brown sound through my phone’s speaker. Tried deleting the app, but it hasn’t stopped. Seriously, my bathroom is a mess.","date":"2020-06-11T06:03:08Z","userName":"magamudbutt"}},{"id":"6058159952","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed","review":"This app is coded so poorly. I can not maneuver the application without it crashing. The point system is terrible. Would not recommend to this app to my worst enemy. I cannot support someone who is allowing an app to represent him be so poor. Poor decision making this app 0/10 👎👎👎","date":"2020-06-10T09:33:38Z","userName":"Coliair"}}]}
