I think that the dinosaur really eat it. I told the dinosaur not to and he still did. Frog the fish also told dinosaur to do it but the microwave Said beep beep. And the plates in the pool went splash splash. And that’s why I’m giving it 1 star.

This app will steal all your furniture. I downloaded this app at one of my groceries trips and when I came back everything was gone but a note that said “we took it all -trump”. So I do not recommend downloading this app. I have to replace everything now.

It tracked my location and someone kidnapped me and took me to a flash mob. They were dancing to call me maybe. Imagine the trauma and therapy I must endure to recover from this traumatic experience. How can the president create an app that caused an act of terrorism on own of his own civilians??
