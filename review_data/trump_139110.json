How can there be so much that you don’t know? You don’t know! You think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you, but if you walked the footsteps of a stranger you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew.

Want to be given false facts? Want to be oppressed and denied basic human right? Well this is the app for you! While you sit here on this app forget about the thousands of kids and people being treated like animals and being put in cages with no basic human decency like food and water. You can also forget about the world wide pandemic going on and how our genius president pulled the US out of the WHO in the middle of it. But wait! There’s more! You can also forget about the fact that people are being slaughtered because of the color of their skin.
