Right when I downloaded the app I got a notification from it saying “get off ni**er”. I was absolutely shocked and I could not believe they said that. On top of that I got bugged. Every single app in my phone began sending me notifications calling me racial slurs. The government controlled pigeons outside of my house began swarming around it pooping on me and destroying my house as well as traumatizing me. My grandmother was in the room and ended up getting scared so bad she had a heart attack and died. -10/10 I would NOT recommend"}},{"id":"6175656999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:07:09Z","userName":"pinheadjas","rating":1,"title":"Horrible 😤😤🍊","review":"After the app took almost hours to download it managed to hack all of my social medias and get all my data 😰 it told my friends that I didn’t want to be friends with them anymore can you believe it ? 😖 it keeps talking about make America great again, makes no sense to me 👨🏽\u200D🦯😝 I don’t recommend getting this app unless you want to be ver disappointed and have a big feeling of invasion of privacy 🤒 it gets an honest 1/10, on reason it’s not a 0/10 is because I like the color blue 🥶💙"}},{"id":"6175638424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:00:31Z","userName":"a0031!","rating":1,"title":"IT ALMOST MADE MY PHONE EXPLODE 👁👄👁","review":"When I first downloaded this app I smelled a burning smell I thought it was just overheated but when the app downloaded it was too hot to even touch I had to keep it in the freezer for 3 days and it’s still as hot as a hot pocket. I opened the app and realized the app is what caused my phone to malfunction. In big bold lettering it said that the reason why the phone is burning is because this app is a portal to hell. Please do not download it’s going to burn you or even explode your phone! It’s a waste of time and it’s going to cost you!"}},{"id":"6175579031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:38:42Z","userName":"Anonymous_603703219","rating":1,"title":"Fish and salamis","review":"This app is terrible!!

What is our president Tonald Drump trying to hide? I am only 11 years old and I know I wasn’t supposed to download this, but I just wanted to see how to support. But as soon as I opened the app, and I saw his face, I realized why Tonald Drump is not allowed around kids. It’s definitely a good thing it’s 17+, but I cannot recommend this to anyone. This is the worst app I have ever seen and will be fueling my nightmares."}},{"id":"6175562689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:32:44Z","userName":"burntBeanzzzz","rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","review":"So I downloaded the app so I could support my lovely president, but as soon as I did it, and opened the app I started getting spam messages about them getting my personal messages, but I didn’t believe it, and then i was on my phone and then something weird happen and they collected all my information and wiped everything cleaned off my phone taking everything on my phone personal information, etc. And then I ended up getting a virus and I had to get a new phone.
