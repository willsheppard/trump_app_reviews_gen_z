However, something about getting text alerts by someone who is keeping his son hostage really turned me off. Along with this, the app design is awful and the red, white, and blue color scheme is not aesthetically pleasing.

I would not recommend downloading this app! it‚Äôs full of fake news and pictures of dirty towels in it. Right when I downloaded it, my cat died and my dog threw up Cheetos.

At 3am someone knocked on my door and when i opened it , there was just an orange on the floor. When i tried grabbing it, spiders started crawling out of it and on to me . In fear i threw the orange and shook off the spiders. After that i had trouble sleeping, around 6am I finally got to fall asleep but had the worst nightmare ever, trump getting re elected.","userName":"mangoo juicce","title":"It glitched","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173756175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:16:45Z","review":"This app is the worst one I‚Äôve ever downloaded.
