But I was terribly disappointed, to start the app took two days to load, and it’s filled with fake news and to my disappearing I found out, that trump literally has done nothing good for this country.

It glitches so much that I had to delete it and leave my phone alone for hours before I could use it again! All I wanted to do is stay up to date with our lovely orange Cheeto-man president, but now I can’t! I can’t see how people would want to vote for a man who can’t even make a working app","date":"2020-07-08T16:37:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172891556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Listen here you cinnamon H!tler","userName":"oirhwhd","review":"This app is really bad, I don’t want to support a little bunker baby. My dog took one look at this app when I opened it now he’s in the ER. Thanks. I really do not appreciate how you didn’t put a trigger warning for “trumphobia” on this app. Very unprofessional. Your soggy orange wrinkles make me want to revolt the 2 ounces of breakfast I’ve had in the past 7 days. Anyways, my dad is calling me. ✨","date":"2020-07-08T16:27:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172874109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Huge Trump supporter here.","userName":"HoldenManutz","review":"Hi, I’m Holden Manutz and have found this app extremely difficult to use due to my blindness. Nothing on the app is friendly to the blind and would really appreciate if our lord Trump would fix this himself. Although this is a one start review according to my blind assistance app I will still be voting for the Donald. Also I cannot find my dentures so if anything is misspelled I apoluzie.","date":"2020-07-08T16:22:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172845974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful!","userName":"sofaloaf04","review":"this app caused nothing but pain and misery. the day it downloaded, my mother, grandmother, and dog died. coincidence? i’m not so sure. this app also brought rats! they ate through my bathtub to reveal cockroaches! i’ve looked into this further, and i’ve discovered that this is because the app sends a signal to them! it’s a SCAM! i was a trump supporter before this. completely lost my respect. i am utterly disgusted.","date":"2020-07-08T16:13:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172701417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t get the app end of story","userName":"bbbbbbbbbbhgfhvc","review":"So I just had to download the app because I just love our Cheeto looking president and all. When I opened up the app I got a glimpse of his ugly face and then I dropped my phone and it cracked.😞I honestly think this app is kind of a curse but who knows right. Anyways I’m not gonna say directly don’t vote for our beloved president but it appreciated if you didn’t.","date":"2020-07-08T15:32:26Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172640284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app!","userName":"Tik.Toker","review":"I got this app so I could vote for trump. But then I realized, why am I voting for trump? He has been so racist, he doesn’t set a good example for covid, and much more he has done to make us divided. I will not use this app and nor should anyone else, I read the other reviews and they said something like my experience. If you support trump, then support him, but I know I don’t.","date":"2020-07-08T15:15:16Z","isEdited":false}}]}
