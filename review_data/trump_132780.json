Umm anyways chile so I was about to call 911 because I was scared for me and my purple cat’s safety but then I remembered #ACAB so I didn’t🤪Anyways I defff dont recomend u to download this app like it literally took 9 hours for it to load and it overheated my phone🤯🤬only to see the horrible cheeto imposter😱😭 To finish off this review I decided to leave some Kardashian quotes that apply to the creator of this app:\n“Just like 20 pounds overweight”\n“You’re worthless✨”\n“Kim, there’s people that are dying”\n“No, I am going to tell you what your issue is”\n“Your lucky that I am gracing you with my ideas”\n“You are so dumb please dont”"}},{"id":"6173774450","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","userName":"Lipstickandpizza","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:29Z","rating":1,"review":"This app took 5 days to download and it crashed my phone multiple times. The funny part is I’m not even Mexican. Sorry Mexicans. My mom told me to download it but I told her I will not be voting for trump anytime soon. Then 5 minutes later while I was taking a dump rats started to come out of my charger port. I had to give my phone to animal control. Then I got a notification that my Mexican brother-in-law was gonna get deported so I went 500 miles to trump tower and my bro was there but then I got another notification that my cat was going to send a nuke to my house and I should leave the country. The funny thing was that I live in Antarctica. Pls don’t delete my house I’m hejsbsbs I like oranges better to be honest, (and) I’m surprised that they didn’t try to (patent) transferring data since it’s been 7 years and this finally (exists), but they are saying it’s the best thing since sliced bread. Well, my phone isn’t bread so I’m gonna stay with Android."}},{"id":"6173774414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Seriously","userName":"probably from tiktok","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:29Z","rating":1,"review":"The thing I want most is to be able to rate an app lower than one star. Absolutely awful. This app gave me AND my family corona virus. Just because we were in the same house and the device downloading it. The app had an option in it to enter my phone number and it WOULD NOT STOP copy and pasting my number onto the DT official Instagram account 🙄 -300009880/10 DONT recommend."}},{"id":"6173774257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dissatisfied, app doesn’t work","userName":"Karen Zucher","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:26Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to get more updates around the campaign, however I was severely disappointed. When I first opened the app it kept crashing and logging me out of the app. So I re downloaded it but it just made everything worse. The app taps into your other apps and changes everything. The other day it logged into my Spotify account and started playing the Sofia the first theme song on repeat. It got so bad my kids and I started getting nightmares. My daughter the other day cried because she thought she was gonna turn into a princess overnight, but her dream is to be a fairy. How do you explain to a little girl that she won’t turn into a princess overnight if she keeps hearing that theme song in her dreams. The app also logged into my amazon account and ordered 1000 orders of the book Trump 101: The way to success. I cancelled the order but they still keep sending me the books every week! It’s frustrating! If I could I would definitely give the app a 0 out of 5 stars. Not worth all the problems I had to go through."}},{"id":"6173773990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App","userName":"samuel leonardo jackson","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:20Z","rating":1,"review":"Very horrible, very terrible.  I know MANY things about apps, more than you would know. This app, I don't like it. It's a bad app. I say we get rid of apps, send it back where it belongs."}}]}
