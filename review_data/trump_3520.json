It makes my phone super slow even when I’m off the app, it sends unnecessary amounts of notifications throughout the day, and it also supports Trump (so that right there should give you all you need). The App Store should take it off right away as it supports a racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, racist, and ignorant “man”. \nPlus, the app is just awful and give misguiding information. It is totally biased and appears to be made by a 10-year-old. It is just flat out a bad app and needs to be taken down. Apple shouldn’t waste its space and neither should an other App Store user. \nI’ve rested my case😌","title":"Deserves to be taken down right away!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Dwight K.

After that we all deleted the app. We keep trying to see if it’s coincidence but it’s not! We know this because whenever we download it again, the plumbing acts up again 😣😠For anyone who wants this app PLEASE BE CAREFUL! I don’t want a travesty similar to what happened to us to happen to you!

I opened the app and saw an old wrinkled cheeto on the main page. I got out of the app to refresh since i believed this was a glitch and my home screen had been taken over by this horrifying creature. My phone then started bugging out and going crazy, the battery went down rapidly and siri kept going on and off. The worst part is it also deleted my favorite app TikTok😤 Now i see people everywhere outside chanting like they’re in some sort of cult🤮and none of them have masks on! Anyways, this app looks like it was designed by a child and the glitches make it even worse.","title":"Glitches","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tRUmp 2o2o 0n a grave"}},{"id":"6174585733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:04:09Z","review":"A threatening voice interrupted the song on my CD\n\n“I was in bed, listening to an album from a well-known metal artist. It was on full blast when suddenly the music got interrupted and a female voice started talking. She sounded like a flight attendant, and very politely and calmly stated ‘your greatest wish is to die. Your greatest wish will come true.’\n\nI freaked out and ran from my room to grab an adult. They told me to stop freaking out, and that it was probably just a part of another song on the CD. I listened to that entire album several times and never found anything like that on it. Even today, I still try to search for a song that has those lyrics at the end.","title":"Worst app I’m the world","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dtunnnn"}},{"id":"6174552912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:54:45Z","review":"I opened the app and all I saw was error all over the screen so I opened it again once again error. I than just left the app open hoping it would load I left it like that for 4 whole hours when I went to check back on my phone all it said over the screen was 666 repeatedly everywhere. It freaked me out a bit so I kept the app open for another 4 hours when I went back to check my phone was at 6 percentage and all it said was this one sentence \"Vote Trump 2020\" next thing I know I hear \"Vote Trump 2020\" coming out side and all I saw was a demon chanting that over and over. So now I have a demon Trump supporter standing outside my window.","title":"Doesn't function properly","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"GrimOtaku"}},{"id":"6174456700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:27:18Z","review":"I can not even express how horrible this app is in words but I will try my best. I got this app a few days ago and I opened it up and this HORRIBLE stench started coming from the speakers of my phone. I don’t even know how that’s possible but it happened. Then it started playing the worst music ever. It was like screeching, nails on a chalk board all of the worst sounds I’ve ever herd put together in ONE. After minutes of trying to get out of the app I was about to give up and just turn my phone off and my phone EXPLODED IN MY HANDS.
