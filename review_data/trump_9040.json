Once the app finally downloaded I opened it as one does.....imagine my face when I was met with an in-app message telling me by downloading the app I unknowingly gave up loads of personal information including my IP address. The app then froze without allowing me to exit then forcing me to restart my phone and delete the app. I am truly and utterly disgusted😔","date":"2020-07-09T09:24:12Z","userName":"Trice.j","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175738347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i can’t believe how AWFUL","review":"the worst app in the history of apple! so insanely glitchy and took DAYS to download... i have a virus on my phone which caused me to lose the voicemails of my late grandmother. you’d think tr*mp would come up with something better with all that extra money he has from not sending out another stimulus check. kinda crazy.. ANYWAY do NOT under any circumstances download this app and see how glitchy and awful it is and then leave a true, raw review! fdt (:","date":"2020-07-09T08:34:53Z","userName":"Peaches12313","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175639230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"At first when I downloaded I noticed my phone slowing down. I think there is a virus with the app. When I uninstalled it, it still continued to show up and wouldn’t allow me to use any other applications on my phone until I agreed to vote for Donald trump. I assume wasn’t able to respond quick enough because I was in shock. Then, I received threatening emails saying they were from the “trump administration” and I worry my phone has been hacked due to this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-09T08:00:47Z","userName":"lillltaabs","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175630895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRASH","review":"This app is worse than the bottom of the line food chain. DO NOT get this app, it keeps sending me notifications every 2 MINUTES. It killed my 55% battery in just under an hour because of the notifications. And mind you I do have the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Under any circumstances do not get this app because if you do, you’re supporting a racist homophobic person that we do not need in OUR society. Also, P.S. No lives matter until black lives matter ;)","date":"2020-07-09T07:57:42Z","userName":"🗣👄","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175623409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely disgusted 🙀","review":"when i was looking for an app to be able to support my amazing racist, homophobic, misogynistic, pig of a president, i found this. i was pleased that it was free and immediately downloaded it! 😸 to my surprise i had to be 17 to download it, i always thought trump liked his girls younger. 😋 anyways, i downloaded it and once again i was surprised, he asked for my phone number! my personal phone number, disgusting. 😾 not only that but i also see that the app can see ur location even if it’s not open, just in the background. i am i’m pure disgust. donald wants tiktok removed cuz he’s afraid it can see where we are and hack our phones 😹 but he’s out here using our location just cuz we downloaded an app. you should be ashamed of yourself! 🧚🏻\u200D♂️❤️","date":"2020-07-09T07:54:56Z","userName":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️💔","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175579651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"completely wiped my info!","review":"it took hOUrS to download this app. then when i finally went to click on the app, it crashed along with my whole phone. my phone actually exploded after opening this app. i’m using my old phone to leave this review because this app deserves nothing but baaaaadd things. i am disappointed. who’s going to pay for the damages?? terrible terrible app!! would not wish upon this app to anyone, not even my worst enemy.","date":"2020-07-09T07:38:57Z","userName":"jennicahhhhh","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175576519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"SCAMMED","review":"this app managed to steal my credit card information, my social security number, and  my dildo that  i never cleaned since the day i got it 4 and half years ago that has been in hiding underneath my moist bed. i just have such a deep connection with that specific dildo and i really just am heart broken beyond words. this app really has demolished whatever bright future i had envisioned and because of this i will have to email the creator of this app and they will pay !!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:37:44Z","userName":"freakypinkdildoluver100","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175294410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP 😤😟💖😳","review":"i downloaded this app and immediately when i opened it, my whole phone shut down and everything was deleted🥴. just moments later, i received a notification that my phone had been hacked and all of my info was stolen 🤥✨. later that week, over 2000$ in my credit card account was used to buy kraft  mac and cheese😡. 😿this really offended me because everyone knows that annie’s organic white cheddar shell mac and cheese because is superior💖😼. xoxo 💋 gossip girl ✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T05:48:58Z","userName":"Djhcjkkkjsssgjk","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175281519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"To whom it May concern","review":"I downloaded this app hoping to get some feedback on the upcoming election but regret to inform you that when I opened the app all that came up were videos of the Cheeto president attempting to sing baby your a firework while getting a spray tan.
