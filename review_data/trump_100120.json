I can promise you even they don’t want to hear you. \n\nLet’s remove this app!\n\nI just think it’s so funny that a group of teenagers can create so much change in a short period of time and come together on important subjects and to fight for what’s right, so much change in fact that even our beloved✨president who absolutely loves to spray tan, will go hide in his little bunker. I think it’s absolutely hilarious. We not only post things about it but we also DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. We have more brain and smarts then any of trumps supporters and even him himself ☺️ Now that they’ve seen what we can do they’re trying to take away a whole social media app. Wow whatever happened to freedom of speech? 🤪 We are so powerful together and we can make so many changes. You are not ready for all we have to offer. We’re not scared of anyone. We don’t care if you’re the president or if you have money sir. We will make your life as miserable as we can. So maybe stop trying to take away our freedom of speech and stop being a misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, white supremacist, racist, egotistical, idiotic creep mkay? You really haven’t done any of us a favor. Nothing that comes out of your mouth matters so shut it ❤️we don’t care about your opinions, and racist viewings. I’m 16 and know my opinion on this topics and even I know what’s right and wrong. I’ve done my research too, just because I’m young doesn’t mean the adults know more than me. All of you trump supporters really should go to therapy. There is no reason to follow this man, he hasn’t done anything good can’t you see that? I am glad to be apart of this movement and to make your lives miserable until we get justice for all. Black Lives Matter, Kids don’t belong in cages, ICE needs to be stopped, police need more training, they need to learn how to deal with every person depending on any diseases or mental illnesses they have. Elijah shouldn’t have died. Breonna shouldn’t be dead. Make the officers pay, do the right thing. Instead of of being so scared of us that you want to shut down a social media that has taught me more in the short time it’s been here than my 16 years of life, why don’t we try to fight the things that actually matter and need to be changed right now. \n\nWe can do this guys. I love all of you.\n\nWe are strong. We are Gen Z. \n\nYou should be scared of us. \n\n-GEN Z","title":"No honey no ❤️","userName":"IAmApartOfGenZ","date":"2020-07-09T19:46:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177996272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is so bad. it’s gross and looks gross. if it was a person it would probably smell. oh wait, donald trump, he smells","title":"ew","userName":"white cheddar cheezits","date":"2020-07-09T19:42:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
