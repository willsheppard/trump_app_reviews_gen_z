I had to get my jet pack and try to catch it while it skateboarded away! It took hours, but the chihuahua finally stopped at some egg-shaped building. I looked through the window and it was like a factory! They were trying to change my phone into a watermelon so I had to find a way to stop them. I used my invisibly cloak that Harry Potter gave me and I snuck through the top-secret porta potty. It brought me to the living room where it had a baby chihuahua in a crib. I thought I would just take it when I get my phone back. I saw a cart and chihuahuas were going towards it, so I decided to enter the cart and they would hopefully bring me to the main area. After a while, the chihuahuas pushing the cart found me! I had to tell them the words “Ooga booga ooga booga” because that’s what my grandfather taught me back in 1969. Those chihuahuas then became on my side so they showed me the way to the main boss. When I arrived in her office, she wasn’t even a dog! It was just a huge robot! She had my phone in her hand and she said, “You’ll never get it back!” I tried using the words, “Ooga booga ooga booga” but nothing happened. Suddenly, I heard a voice saying, “Fight!” I then became a masked woman with two razor-sharp fans. We began to fight and she was taking down my health bar really fast because the fans would not come back to me when I threw them. I remembered I had to press my big toe so they can teleport back to me. We were both on very low health and I found out I can use the chihuahuas on my side as bowling balls! They curled into a ball and rolled themselves across the arena to trip the big robot, and it was successful. The voice came again, saying, “Finish her!” I decided not to Bc I felt like there was someone in the robot. I went to it and I took off its helmet and the person in that robot was Peppa the Pig! She was only turning the phones into watermelons Bc they ran out worldwide. I told her that there are still a lot at the Walmart from across the street. She gave me back my phone and everyone else’s phone that the chihuahuas took. Besides the baby chihuahua, they all went to Disneyland to have a good time while Peppa went to the Walmart from across the street. I then became president of the whole world for my heroic actions and when I unlocked my phone again, the app was still on the loading screen! Worst app ever!","title":"Are you serious???!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Daniel Penaloz"}},{"id":"6174073946","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:16:00Z","review":"They told me to give them my phone number like I got bf","title":"Ew","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"duck andy"}},{"id":"6174068253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:13:48Z","review":"this app was pooped up by hell. they didn’t even want it so they put it here.
