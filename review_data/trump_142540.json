This dear app caused a lot of pain. Once I first downloaded the app I saw this horrific orange thing on my screen which made my eyes pop out of my sockets and slither across my floor and manage to go to my neighbors yard. My neighbor is a nice old lady but she was walking and slipped on my eyes. I saw the whole thing clear as day then after the ice cream truck pulled up I ran over and got my double fudge strawberry bliz that was amazing. But then the next day I gained 35 pounds from the double fudge strawberry bliz and then my imaginary boyfriend I had since 2nd grade broke up with me over text 😭😭. I was so devastated that I decided that it would be a good idea to make an apple pie. But while I was making my apple pie I forgot about it because I was watching wonder pets with my pet wasp that I named Greg. So as u can imagine the smoke alarm went off and Greg decided to go into the oven and now my pet wasp sadly passed due to these circumstances. I was so angry yet sad so I had a funeral that costed me about 30,000$. So now I’m broke, has a fear of apple pie, has to pay for neighbors hip injury, gained 35 pounds and is now very much single due to this one app.","title":"The end of the world as we know it"}},{"id":"6179289846","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:40:10Z","userName":"anthonydel18","rating":1,"review":"It’s boring","title":"Not worth it"}},{"id":"6179289834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:40:10Z","userName":"luvluvluv4all","rating":1,"review":"This app is a huge disappointment and sir trump you have lost your number one fan","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS 🙄🙄"}},{"id":"6179289860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:40:10Z","userName":"Funny do","rating":1,"review":"So like I download this app to get new updates and just to generals to support our lovely president, Mr.Orange J Trump🍊🍊🍊. But upon download the app doesn’t work🤧🤧. I found this app to only support white supremacy🤮, have a low iq of a pig🦧, and to only divide our nation👁👄👁. I must only get it a 1 Star, I would give it a zero if it was a option but it sadly isn’t.

Then it almost gave me a virus! I personally think this app should no longer be allowed. To protect us. This app is also run by a misogynistic homophobic trans phobic, racist. This app should be taken out the app store and maybe even banned. Cause you see this app is the real danger. We can no longer allow people to blindly follow a oompa loompa cheeto orangutan bunker boy. Who obviously only cares about himself and his money. So in conclusion, this app is terrible and he is terrible so get rid of this app. k thanks.\nLove an angry girl, 💕🌸✨💫🦋","title":"This app is dangerous!

But no, honestly, this app is a mess. No disrespect to the president. But really they must replace this app. Be warned. I downloaded onto my IPhone-11 twice and both times it froze my phone. The 2nd time I had to use the backup to restore my phone. Come on Trump campaign get it together. To all of you who support our president, please don’t download this app. I don’t know, but their is something very wrong with it. Be warned!!! And I am real.","title":"I feel cheated."}}]}
