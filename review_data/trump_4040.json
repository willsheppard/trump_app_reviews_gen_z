As soon I opened this app it detected the melanin in my skin and called me a looting thug. And then it scanned me for African heritage and threatened to deport me if I didn’t build a wall around my culture. And the app must have mistaken the Taco Bell on my breath for real Mexican food because the app automatically translated to Spanish. I was just coming on the app to see what a wonderful job our president has done for country🧚🏾💅✨,the racist white areas.  I just wanted to know whose rally I was going on Saturday✨ but oh wait I forgot I have to attend the birth of my roosters new chicks that day. My bad 💅✨🧚🏾for you.","userName":"um excuse me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:41:04Z","title":"Tiny Hands Hold Tiny Mans🖐🤡🍊","rating":1}},{"id":"6172466818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this 🍊 literally can’t keep the promise that got him in office. the moment i downloaded this app my phone started glitching like the wifi was bad even tho i have really good wifi. how can you even vote for him when he’s a white supremacist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, friends with child offenders, made fun of black peoples getting killed by police, and his new shirts are literally the same as the nazi logo of the eagle it’s even facing the war side. also america has never been great, what he meant is make america white again. he’s such a 😺, he’s mad and scared at children. Gen Z makes him tremble in his loose pants so people can’t see he has the tiniest 🍆 in the history of the universe.","userName":"hunan with a brain","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:27:02Z","title":"FAKE NEWS","rating":1}},{"id":"6172398747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app causes my beloved friend, doritoisha, to take her own life 😔 we were sitting at the table eating waffles for breakfast when we decided to check on the ✨g o d s✨ trustworthy news source. We saw a post  on trumps tour dates; (ugh an iconic sight, truly😩)AND SO BEHOLD, IN THE PICTURE SHOWN- TRUMP WAS HOLDING DORITOS!! the NERVE. Doritoisha dropped her fork and IMMEDIATELY ran up to her room. I tried to run after her to comfort her but she told me that she just couldn’t do it anymore. I heard a loud bang and screamed “DORITOISHA?! DORITOISHA ARE YOU OKAY?!” When I finally was able to wrench my way inside.. Doritoisha was dead. This app is a horrible influence to society, please take my story into consideration and bring justice to Doritoisha. 😔","userName":"Dadogemasta","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:08:36Z","title":"This app caused my friend to take her own life 🤧😔","rating":1}},{"id":"6172095271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app because I wanted to keep up with news, the app wanted my location so I politely gave it permission(we love when people ask for consent✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️) next thing I knew, there was a man wearing a trump mask outside my house, he drugged me and put me in a van. When I came to, I was tied to a chair (imagine this) legos surrounded me. There was a sign on the wall that said “TRUMP 2020, VOTE OR DIE🇺🇸” I untied myself(those kidnappers can’t tie ropes) the hardest part was the legos. When I escaped I went to the police, but as you know they aren’t really doing their job at the moment. I was maced then pushed to the ground, DO NOT GET THIS APP. Who knows what would have happened if I didn’t escape.","userName":"lego walker","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:44:18Z","title":"Basically got kidnapped","rating":1}},{"id":"6177741385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So, I downloaded the app and all of a sudden my screen froze and went black. I took it to the Apple store and they said it had a nasty computer virus. Just then while the apple guy was looking at my phone a picture of Donald trumps 0.3 inch penis appeared on the screen hairy and nasty. I was so traumatized that I need to seek therapy because of this app, I keep having nightmares over it every night to the point I have extremely bad insomnia. I can’t unsee what I saw on that horrific day but all I can say is... don’t download this app. You will see things that will forever traumatize you. We must all save Melania from the horrors of Donald Trump’s downstairs region!","userName":"Heckashe","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:23:05Z","title":"Technical Issues","rating":1}},{"id":"6177656202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So sad that an app like this could change my support for Trump so quickly. He used to be my only choice for our next president, but after downloading this app I quickly came to the realization that his beliefs do not align with my true Christian values. Not only has he hardly ever even set foot in a church, but he can’t even recite a single verse from the Bible? What’s much more evil than an atheist is a fake christian- using a religion that they no nothing about just to get votes. Lost my support and I do NOT recommend this app to anyone. I will now be voting Biden 2020 just to put an end to this monster.","userName":"JaniceHamings","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:56:52Z","title":"Used to be rooting for Trump’s re-election before I downloaded this app...","rating":1}},{"id":"6177647076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely horrid! I went onto the app for some education and to just inhale the beauty of our wonderful president orange. Only to see that instead of our orange, there were only sexist posts?? I’m very confused! I thought this was the app where you took care of him? Like feed him and stuff? Guess not. Second, when a notification popped up and I opened the notif, MY HOUSE FLEW ON FIRE. Luckily, I used the magic of subway surfers and Shane Dawson’s singing to make the fire go away. Also, it made my phone CRASH and DISAPPEAR into ANOTHER DIMENSION. I had to go on a very long journey to get it back in which I met a mermaid and a flying man named Peter Pan. Anyways, this app brought ZERO blessing to my life!
