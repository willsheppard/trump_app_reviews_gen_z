I’m so sick of this orangutan with a comb-over and his mess. 🐒 He is always running his mouth and tweeting his tweets while nothing is getting done! I wish he cared more about ALL US citizens 🇺🇸 and not just the white washed ones that look and think like him. I will NEVER! EVER! support a man who forgets every hateful thing he says and blames it on others. Trump you make me sick and I pray your hearts changed for the better. ❤️","userName":"HotBlackChick101","date":"2020-07-09T15:50:33Z","title":"God said Black Lives Matter Too ✊🏾"}},{"id":"6177233313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is definitely the worst app ever. it took exactly 14 hours to download, and it hacked all my accounts. Also the bank account had 700 in it now it has 100. I don’t know what the White House is doing to my accounts but also I love bts they are the best bts is a Korean Kpop group they taught people how to love their self and they are truly amazing and legends The BTS and other Kpop fandoms are amazing best fandoms ever unlike the trump fandom 😂🤮 eww I feel bad for who ever supports him","userName":"jimin_bts_fan_ot7","date":"2020-07-09T15:49:26Z","title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6177219284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD!!! Absolutely do NOT download this app. As soon as I downloaded this app, my whole phone CRASHED. It took three whole days just to fix it! I was so excited to read about what Trump had planned for us.. but to my dismay, I couldn’t :( and I WILL NOT be supporting him anymore. I’ve spent HUNDREDS of dollars on trying to help him win the election.. FOR WHAT?! I am absolutely ASTONISHED at how terrible this app is and how terrible our president is! \n\n-Karen","userName":"ImMad>:(","date":"2020-07-09T15:45:22Z","title":"We want Obama back!!!"}},{"id":"6177192275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"after waiting for about a total of 3 hours for the app to download, i decided to log in to “support” the 🍊🍤. it didn’t let me sign up, then after contacting your email, whoever spoke to me was so I N C R E D A B L Y rude. they sassed mouthed me and told me they could hack into my phone data. which doesn’t even sound real. but then, i got a notification later on saying that i have 13 viruses. i am truly FURIOUS with this app and the workers surrounding it.","userName":"Ella Koke","date":"2020-07-09T15:37:41Z","title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6177177629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app literally was the worst app I have ever downloaded onto my phone. I can’t believe why this app even still exists honestly. It says you have to be 17+ to get it but honestly I’d make it 25+ because our young minds aren’t fully developed and we can’t be subject to all of this horrible information that isn’t even true. This was absolutely my worst mistake that I have made app wise. Will be deleting.","userName":"~~~~~~~~~~me~~~~~~~~~~","date":"2020-07-09T15:33:34Z","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6177145705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"one day I open the app and the whole thing glitched.

It's been a long time coming...but this app done fell apart. Really wanna work this out but I don't think its gonna change... He is a villain by the devil's law. He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun. That man's a snitch and unpredictable. He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none. All I know, should've let go, cause he's a president with a tainted heart and even I know this ain't smart","userName":"bobbi rossi","date":"2020-07-09T15:05:28Z","title":"Kinda hurted me tho"}},{"id":"6177051004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app because of obvious reasons and at first it all seemed normal but after a week it started to give me troubles, my phone would freeze or even shut down completely after being on the app for no reason, and its not because of my phone since i have an iphone 11.
