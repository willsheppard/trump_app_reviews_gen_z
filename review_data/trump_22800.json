It burnt out my phone battery the minute i opened it, it wanted a huge update that drained my phone. This app is terrible and deserves to be taken off the app store. Try something new!

It’s offers are misleading, also not an easy app to use. I suggest it be made more user friendly, just in case the people who use the app need that extra help (i’m sure they would).","title":"Not Good.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:27:11Z"}},{"id":"6175652581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"CamiMikaValentin","review":"Wish I could give it zero stars. App has too long of loading times, terrible graphics, and too many photos of a naked pig man. I thought i was supposed to see trump himself in this app. Must have been another one i guess...

I’m sorry, sir, but I find this behavior EXTREMELY inappropriate considering you have a WIFE and a CHILD. And, as I’m SURE you know as my Dearly Respected King (i mean president), you MUST know that I HAVE A HUSBAND TOO!!!!!!!!!! And TWELVE UNVACCINATED CHILDREN!!!!! Needless to say, I’m disappointed. I would love to speak to your MANAGER about this, Mr. Trump.","title":"I have a HUSBAND - Karen White","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:03:54Z"}},{"id":"6175638687","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"trump has a vag 2020","review":"First of all, the app took over a month to download completely. Then, as soon as I open it, the screen is all black. THEN it starts playing these weird cryptic messages and now I’m literally scared for my life. The app gave my phone a virus and I had to get a new one. The app LITERALLY CURSES YOU!!! DO. NOT. GET. IT.","title":"Literally the worst thing to ever happen to me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:00:36Z"}}]}
