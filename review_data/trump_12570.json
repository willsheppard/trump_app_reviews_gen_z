I went to the doctor and they said there was something seriously wrong. So they sent me to the ER and turns out THE APP GAVE ME RACISM!!

I am constantly bombarded with pictures of an orange cricket and news alerts on where to meet him. I got so many notifications from this app it interrupted other videos games on my phone. It’s impossible to get past level 14 on the app, and it crashes every time you go up a level. \nThe treatment I have received from the development team is absolutely appalling."}},{"id":"6173773967","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DONT GET THIS APP NOT WORTH IT!!😡","userName":"cherry-blossom-luvs","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:19Z","review":"i went to download this app people just like all my other white friends i wanted to support our annoying orange president🧡🧡 but when i opened the app all it kept screaming at me was “WHITE POWER WHITE POWER” “WHITE SUPREMACY” and other chants that made me jump out from my seat and fall down my 20 flights of stairs and i nearly broke every bone in my body!!😡🤬 now i’m stuck in the hospital and might die because of this app!! don’t get this app if you don’t want to die!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173770282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It’s the whole app fa me","userName":"asiyita","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:22:00Z","review":"Absolutely the worst app ever invented and I’m disgusted with the entire app. I mean seriously is the world a joke to thing 🍊. #thankyounext. 0/10, would not recommend. The app would not stay open and was constantly glitching. And not to mention Donald trump he is giving me very much stupid, very much racist, very much ugly, very much liar...

The color of the UI kept having an orange hue making all the photos of people appear as Oompa Loompas. I also didn’t trust the content shared in the articles.  The claims were all baseless, unable to be proven by science or experience.  This app is sad, very sad, maybe the worst app I’ve ever used and I’ve used so many apps.  I would not recommend this app to my worst enemy, or this country’s worst enemy."}},{"id":"6173748292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is TERRIBLE!
