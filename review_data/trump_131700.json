After I left a rate on the app my phone was HACKED because of the low rating and so now every time I open safari or google I see a video of stormi Daniels and the Cheeto 🤢🤢🤢 I don’t know why they do that isn’t that beastiality or something??? Then my phone BLEW UP‼️ So I had to get a knew phone and SIM card to erase all that off my phone. I’m in hiding right now because of them threatening to kill me and my whole family. These people who made the app are evil and Trump is evil. But know I have to throw this phone away too since they can track it. OMG THEY ARE CHASING ME.

It’s just a constant reminder that this is this type of person that controls this country. You are a filthy, orange, sex trafficker. This man is a literal rapist and racist. You ruined too many lives. You’re a manipulative a$$hole and now that you have so many secrets being leaked you want to ban tik tok too. You are a disgrace to this entire planet. I would’ve given this app no stars but it won’t let me🤷\u200D♀️ Hopefully you at least look in the mirror and realize you’re one of the worst people to exist. Rot Trump🍄✨🧚and if you disagree, just remember you support a rapist and racist👏 good for you! Hope you feel good about yourself. You are the reason we aren’t seeing any positive change.👏 You should really reconsider your opinion on the man who controls our lives because he has 40+ rape allegation, was best friends with Jeffery Epstein(a sex trafficker), he is extremely racist and does nothing to truly support the minorities in this country, etc. So, if you support him I’m sure you’re a uneducated, racist white piece of sh!t who believes everyone has the same privileges as you! Oh and I’m sure you say all lives matter too and sh!t on BLM which just contradicts the entire saying “all lives matter” because if all lives matter to you that would include black live. 👏Congratulations, you’re also a disgrace!","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"F$%K TRUMP 2020"}},{"id":"6174194417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i am shook to my core","review":"I, a 74 year old elephant😀,opened the app so i could be hip on the trends with cheeto man🤪🤪but was immediately greeted with glitches😔 after I closed out of the app I saw that my wallpaper had been changed😵 to a picture of Adam Sandler’s character in grown-ups Lenny Feder😱 I simply cannot believe this🤬after I open the app a second time I look to see all of my vintage exclusive five nights at Freddy’s Funko pops levitating👻 I look to the app to see a nasty Cheeto🤮this caused me to go into shock☠️ I simply cannot believe an app that does this much damage is allowed on the App Store😾😾 once I came back to I noticed that my Anakin Skywalker poster was saying something👂 after listening very closely I could tell that it was singing black and yellow by Wiz Khalifa🎵🎵 I simply cannot believe something this offensive was even allowed past the app producers🤚🤚this app gets a -69/4200🤡I hope this gets taken down soon and no one goes to the trauma that this app has given me🤒🤕😷","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"COMPLETELY TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6174193270","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BLM.BLM.BLM!!!!!!!period","review":"TRASHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.","date":"2020-07-08T23:59:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst thing imaginable .
