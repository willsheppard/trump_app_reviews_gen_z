Once the app was finally downloaded, I tried to use it and it just kept closing me out, almost like my phone was rejecting the app in all of its undeniable stupidity. I couldn't use the app once.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"this app was terrible","date":"2020-07-09T14:36:41Z","userName":"Mabs2345432"}},{"id":"6176873979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took five whole days to download! Not one or two but FIVE WHOLE days to download! Naturally after waiting for soooo long I thought the app would be worth it but nooooooooo! I was clearly very wrong because as soon as I opened the app my phone SHUT DOWN! I had to spend 50$ on trying to fix it, but finally it unlocked. But when it did open the only app I had left was the stupid trump app! It ERASED Alllllllll of My DATA.

I know it sounds crazy and I have never heard of this before or experienced this smell coming from my phone. After only a day or so the smell was starting to leak more out of my phone. It almost smelled like money and an orange but if you take another whiff it smelled like racism and corruption. Would not recommend!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Who","date":"2020-07-09T13:47:18Z","userName":"brexxyberry"}},{"id":"6176705718","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After reading all of the reviews I was skeptical to get the app, however I decided to try it out. That long download time was true, I waited almost a day, but I was one of the luck ones with the shorter of the download times. Once I opened the app it asked for so much of my personal information so I decided on not going further! This especially because some people’s information has been hacked from this app; so no thank you!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app","date":"2020-07-09T13:26:57Z","userName":"erick6928"}},{"id":"6176330285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I’m a time traveler and I wanted to experience 2020 in its fullest. 2020 is historically the worst year of the 21st century, but the silver lining is that the USA did not elect the Cheet0 man for a second term. I downloaded this app to write an accurate report of how life was in this year. After I entered my phone number I received multiple spam texts that mostly related to p0rn. I knew he was tra$h but I didn’t know how bad it actually was. Keep your head up people, things will get better.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Message from the future","date":"2020-07-09T11:44:34Z","userName":"hansrach"}}]}
