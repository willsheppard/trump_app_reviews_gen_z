Waste of time. I downloaded the app to find out more about his policies and found out that he is really just a racist, homophobic white supremacist who has the intelligence of a Cheeto. Not to mention that he is most likely a rapist. If you want America to be great, then do not vote for him again! #dumptrump"}},{"id":"6172774781","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:53:23Z","title":"Fake","userName":"Edinajupic.","review":"I downloaded to see if I could find any reason to actually back what his voters say about him! and now i see why they back him so much! if you only listen to a liar, dictator, fascist, racist for your daily news and don’t fact check anything or do your own unbiased research-then ig all you will believe is the lies. Nonetheless-this app is filled with nothing but fake news, biased opinions and absolutely not factual information!!!"}},{"id":"6172762671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:56Z","title":"it’s a no for me💅","userName":"tacoslovingchicken","review":"I downloaded this app to support the amazing Donald trump🟠, but unfortunately when I downloaded the app, I started hearing little whispers “vote for trump” “vote for trump”😳👎it’s been following me around for days so I contacted the ghost adventures people and they wouldn’t even come inside Bc they were too scared🙀I finally deleted the app and the whispers went away🥳 so I don’t recommend this app at all or strange events will happen to you😔🤧"}},{"id":"6172744666","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:44:45Z","title":"black lives matter/ hispanic lives matter/ICE needs to be canceled like 6ix9ine also","userName":"ALL LIVES SHOULD MATTER","review":"he is a racist dude who is only president for the money he is a selfish non-worthy president like seriously “the rock” and kevin heart should be president if all there is to do is care about them because they care more about this country than trump himself like seriously he is the orange male karen that started all this mess like delete tik tok and your deleted(that isn’t a threat it’s a promise)"}},{"id":"6172712895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:35:41Z","title":"unacceptable","userName":"Misakuna","review":"I can’t believe Apple still even has this app on the App Store. This app works terribly. As soon as it was downloaded, all of my other apps started glitching. TERRIBLE. If I could leave a 0 star rating, I would. I wanted to support our president but not if I have to go through this just to do it. As soon as I deleted the app, my apps started working again. I think it’s a government hacking system. NEVER again."}},{"id":"6172699502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:31:55Z","title":"worst app ever","userName":"~^.**","review":"this app is absolutely horrible.

She got a heart attack and we had her rushed to the hospital. After a few mental and medical tasks, the doctors declared that she had Cacophobia. The photo traumatized her and she still lays in the hospital bed unmoving, relying on the life support machine that stands nearby."}}]}
