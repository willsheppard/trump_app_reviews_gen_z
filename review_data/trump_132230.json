That is the single good thing about the app. First of I tried to sign up with the username “trump2020inthegrave” and it said “this username is invalid. I tried something similar and it didn’t work. I had to settle with “deadCheeto.” After I signed up it brought me to a screen with a nude Cheeto. I’m not sure how that happened, but it was DISGUSTING! I don’t recommend downloading the app or supporting trump, but I do recommend following my tik tok. @juliawitherington.","date":"2020-07-08T22:52:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174011575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NewKing14","isEdited":false,"title":"Honestly racist","review":"I cannot honestly believe just how offensive this is.
