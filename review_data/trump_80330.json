I downloaded it and when I got on it immediately said that I had to wait 8-10 business days so that it could download all of the stuff on my phone! And like any normal person of course I tryed to delete it. BUT IT WASNT DELETING!!!!! I tryed deleting it countless times but it WASNT WORKING!!! So I decided to reset my phone. After resetting it I got back on my phone and without even getting on the app my screen started saying racist slurs at me on full volume in Donald Trumps voice. Not long after Donald Trumps head showed up on my screen like in my nightmares. (Any dream with Trump in it is a nightmare). I went to sleep with Trumps voice still playing (on full volume may I add). That night I had the worst nightmare I have ever had in my life!!! Worse then corona and everything! In my dream Trump was president and he won 2 elections in a row. I woke up in a cold sweat knowing that it was only a dream and this would never actually happen. So I went downstairs to get a glass of water. That night at 3:00 in the morning I looked on tiktok and noticed i was not the only one one who had this problem. Every single other person on tiktok had the exact same problem as me. Crazy right 🤪. The slurs were still on FULL VOLUME!!! This happened for about 10 business days (day and night). When the app was FINALLY finished downloading I no longer supported our president. He is racist, snobby, sloppy, rude, sexist, I could go on for hours but I have to find a way to get all of the VIRUSES off of my phone. Only to discover my phone got CORONA 🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠. And my phone needed help at the hospital. My phone was struggling to breath because Trump isn’t giving hospitals the correct supplies to take care of its patients. My phone did recover after 1 month at the hospital (Still saying the slurs). Though we did everything we could to get trumps idiot face and voice off of my phone we couldn’t do it. We took it to the apple store and every other place we could. So i had to trash my dear phone and get a new one. Though you might think “oh that’s so great” it isn’t. I used to have the iphone and now I have a flip phone. I went onto tiktok to vent and got lots of support. They were the ones who encouraged me to write this review. I AM ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","userName":"Nashville, Tennesee"}},{"id":"6179030951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:06:37Z","title":"Trump1984","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Let’s all stand for 2 mins of Hate","userName":"Trump1984"}},{"id":"6179028983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:05:53Z","title":"Works bad!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is hard to use.","userName":"Andrewinlunadabay"}},{"id":"6179012750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T02:00:05Z","title":"this made my day🥰💐✨ WORSE 🧚\u200D♂️🦋🌸","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"You tried your best 🌺🧚\u200D♀️ stop trying 🌷💫","userName":"mydogisbetterthanthisapp"}},{"id":"6178980398","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T01:48:08Z","title":"HIDE YOUR PETS!! DONT RECOMMEND!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I’m 99.9% sure that this app is the reason why my cat died. My cat pigeon (named after one of my favorite members of a famous band) has always been a pretty happy cat. She doesn’t shine as bright as her siblings but she is a star in her own way 🥰🥰. Anyway I downloaded this app because i wanted to keep up with my beloved president! BUNKER BOY 2020!! However after I downloaded it a few days ago some things started happening! First of all ever since I signed into the app with my phone number I’ve been receiving calls every other hour by an unknown number. Every time it is the exact same! A verse of 🎶Do you want to build a wall🎶 followed by Say So by Doja Cat on repeat!! I have to say it’s really been disturbing my week of binging british cooking channels! Pigeon has also begun acting very weirdly! Yesterday I saw her cleaning the mirror and putting sunglasses on between each stroke! I ALMOST HAD A STROKE. Since when did she know how to clean?! Later on in the day (after another call) she was holding a gummy bear album in her mouth! I distinctly remember the package saying something about how it was released to stores on november 13th (whatever that’s about). More and more weird things kept happening after every call! She was doing this weird thing with her hips that i didn’t even realize a cat could do! She would lower one and raise the other and then switch! She also has been baking to some music that sound like that song from ratatouille! She then puts those baked goods in front of me and I know she can’t talk but the gleam in her eye made it seem like she would be very angry with me if I ate it. I did anyway though (AND ID DO IT AGAIN BAP BAP).  More weird things happened but I don’t think I should explain it all, wouldn’t want to take time away from our star of a president. Anyways I found my cat dead this morning. I know it was this app. For anyone considering downloading it... NOT WORTH IT.","userName":"catlover62739495"}}]}
