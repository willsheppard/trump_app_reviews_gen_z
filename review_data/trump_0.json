But unfortunately the app kept making my cell phone crash. It was constantly kicking me out of the app time and time again. So I thought that it was probably just my phone. So I powered my phone off and waited a couple of minutes to get back to the app. Then after about ten minutes, I went back onto the app and it continued to crash and kick me out. So then I was like whatever maybe my iPhone 6 is broken and I just decided to drop the whole thing and ignore when my phone would crash. Well that was a bad mistake. Over the next couple of days my phone was constantly crashing. It didn’t matter if I was on Facebook or if I was on candy crush, it was just constantly crashing. Now I know that some of you may be thinking “oh your phone is just old” but my phone had never done that before I got the app. It was constantly and constantly crashing and closing me out of apps. I seriously think that this app is no good for you and you seriously should not get it. Not to mention the fact that this app also took up a tremendous amount of storage up on my phone. Please do not get the app. It’s software must be really out of date and will ruin your phone. That being said- I wish I could give the app a 0 but unfortunately I cannot. This app is no good.","title":"Please delete","isEdited":false,"userName":"hwalker6"}},{"id":"6177707149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:12:50Z","review":"as the political 8 year old i am. i wanted to download this app because i need Chick-fil-A. so i downloaded this app hoping this orange looking man would give me my waffle fries. but instead he tried to force me to vote for him for president and kept asking and asking to the point that i broke my phone screen. after 5 days he is still asking me to vote for him for president. He is an orange, oranges can not be president. but he keeps pushing my buttons and annoying me to the point that my only option was to delete this app. i gave this man one more day to 1. fix my cracked screen 2. to get me some Chick-fil-a. so i then asked him can u plz give me Chick-fil-A. yes u might be thinking, “well you could have asked him a long time ago,” but no fellow stranger i could not. the orange would not let me speak at all until i voted for him. so i tried telling i am free man i do not have to listen to a talking, walking, orange 🍊.  so you see i deleted this app i was so happy. But the story doesn’t end there. He then sent me things in the mail, saying that i need to vote now and i threw his paper away in a rush locked all my doors and ran to my room and then well he tried to text me. and i blocked him cuz the only reason i downloaded his app was to find my chick-fil-a, but no i never received my chick-fil-a. so i recommend that you do not download this app if you are need of chick-fil-a because he will not give u what you need. my final review is a one star, peroid.","title":"sorry but no🥰","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤡muffins in my freezer👹"}},{"id":"6176643519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:10:35Z","review":"I wanted to download this app just to see what president trump was up too and what he was going to plan for America. Although I don’t like him very much, I decided to get the app just to see if he was actually a good person. Turns out he wasn’t. THE APP HACKED MY PHONE AND DELETED ALL OF MY APPS AND PICTURES. I tried to get them back but having the app installed wouldn’t let me do anything. I tried to call my best friends afterwards to see if they could help, but the same thing happened to them. We decided to meet up at a near by park and talk about what to do, when three guards of some sort came up to us. We are only teenagers who had done nothing wrong, but these guards grabbed us and put us in a tree at the park. I asked them why they were doing this, and they said it was because we all didn’t like the app. My guess is that this app SPIES ON YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT!!! That’s why the guards found us. Anyways, me and one of my friends were TERRIFIED of heights and we were begging to be put on the ground. The guards said they would only do that if we voted for Trump in the future, since we aren’t old enough to, and we were all forced to say yes. My other friend hesitated but finally she said yes. Then we were brought down and chased back to our homes 😔. I would NOT recommend getting this app, since I still don’t have any of my pictures or other apps, and since it spies on you and does bad things to you if you don’t like Trump. 😔✨","title":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE","isEdited":false,"userName":"ihavecakeudont"}},{"id":"6177139179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:22:47Z","review":"so i downloaded the app bc i saw how all of these ppl said he wasn’t homophobic, racist, sexist, etc and i wanted to see if they were right. so at first when i downloaded the app it didn’t rlly work right, it would always ask me for my location and i thought that was weird bc why do you need MY location! well i went on the app one day to see what was happening and as soon as i opened the app i had oranges all over my screen and trump 2020. i think this is very wrong bc it seems like he is trying to force ppl to like him and to get spray tans..which IS NOT ✨OKAY✨ my phone started glitching all the time so i deleted the app. i went to sleep and in my dream it kept telling me to redownload the app it else and the cheeto man was trying to come into my dreams using powers!!  and i was like 👁👄👁 it is absurd bc he has wife and children...i think he was trying to ✨seduce✨ me which is NOT okay!!!!! he already has 40+ r*pe allegations! i woke up and my vision was all orange and it wouldn’t go away so i redownloaded the app and my vision went back to normal so that shows he was using his magic spells on me!! do not download this app unless you want him to use his powers on you😼😼😼😼 i got on the app a couple days ago and it started playing cows sounds so it was like he was calling me fat. body shaming is NOT okay. i am very disappointed😾 and hurt😍😍 but anyway don’t download this app✨😹💗 stan anonymous for clear skin🥰🥰🥰","title":"magic powers😼😼😼😼😼😍😍😍😍","isEdited":false,"userName":"Heyyyuhuh"}},{"id":"6176824977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:58:27Z","review":"i downloaded this app to see what i could do in order to support my non racist, homophobic, non misogynistic president.  needless to say i had high expectations for the app. however, i was immediately asked to give my phone number to him which i find completely inappropriate because  I don’t like giving my number to apps. i wouldn't imagine for our beloved president  to want our numbers, but i figured i would put my number in anyways to see how far things could go between us. almost instantly my screen was filled with SPAM messages from him which i don't appreciate and find completely unacceptable. i mean i  had found it weird that he wanted to see all of our data, but at this point he seemed desperate. i had no choice but to block the messages and delete the app. about 20 mins after it was deleted, i heard a knock  in my door which was strange since no one comes too see me anymore because i support  ed the big cheeto e * + .i opened the door to see TWELVE oompa loompas at my doorstep practically begGING me to re download the app and give it five stars.  I've sent freaking MINIONS to get me back.  at this point i was fed up with his childish behavior so i slammed the door on them and am now leaving the opposite of what he wished for me to do, which is leave a ONE star review on his yucky app.  sorry things didn't work out between us donald xx.  i'll be voting for you this year, but to be sent to prison ✨💗🌸","title":"Waste of time 🤢","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen Smith 👩🏻\u200D⚕️"}},{"id":"6177730327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:47Z","review":"This app is undoubtedly one of THE WORST apps I have ever come across and here’s why: IT DISRUPTS MY NETFLIX SHOWS. Usually at the beginning of installation, apps ask if whether or not you would like to receive notifications from the app and I always click ‘no’. Well to my great disappointment, whenever I receive a notification, it not only exits me out of whatever app I’m using, I cannot clear the notification until I respond or perform whatever task it wants me to do i.e sign a petition, text my local government leaders about re-electing our awe(ful)some leader, etc. This is a huge incovenience to me because ritually I watch the Disney movie Ratatouille, in which provides me with a daily dose of self-encouragement and confidence that allows me to go about my day knowing that I can do anything that I set my mind to. And that big talents can come from the smallest of places. This movie is such a classic and will forever go down as one of Disney’s best. However, this app interrupts me over and over again every time I watch my movie, and just when I think I’ve resolved one notification another one takes its place. I’ve contacted Apple Customer Service, my local Apple Store for tech support, as well as tried a multitude of times on my own to sort this issue out. I will be deleting this app for it has no purpose being installed any longer and I would advise anyone else to do the same.","title":"Ratatouille?

It does not go with the whole vibe of them app! Extremely disappointed. And you see him holding up a black lives matter hand? When he’s doing nothing at all to support and comfort the black lives matter movement. It also says “join today to make America great” While he teaches our children to sexualize women and be homophobic! What a great country! And his fans have no facts nor a comeback to any criticism because their only response to everything is “TRUMP 2020”. Very mature! Okay okay Now lets move onto entering your phone number so he can text you to vote for him. When you do so it asking if you would agree to them actually texting you. That is the first time trump asked for consent! I’m so proud!! When you consent it asks again! This ensures he doesn’t get another scandal. On the screen it says “as a reward for helping us fight socialist Democrats you can earn items like...” I’m not gonna go into opinions here like his supporters. But all I have to say here is no ❤️. Next it says, “Help trump win by registering for rallies and events” But remember when over half this last event was completely empty because the educated teens got tickets and didn’t show up! And from there I deleted the app because well it’s garbage. Whoever seriously has this, has a problem. I hope you find a cure❤️❤️😘\n\nTake care and remember,\nSettle for Biden!","title":"WOST EXPERIENCE EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"ammontgo12"}},{"id":"6175610829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:50:22Z","review":"this app took forever to download and to be specific it took 3 days to download which i don’t understand why it took that long if i just gotten this phone meaning i have tons of storage. i have read reviews and people claim it takes forever to download because it’s busy stealing all your information and data. maybe trump should be less worried about tiktok and other platforms that kids get to use during this whole pandemic to pass time and express themselves and should worry about his own app and maybe himself because BLACK LIVES MATTER , VANESSA GULLIEN’S LIFE MATTER the disgust i have that no one bothered to look for her and the fact that she was a solider apart of HIS ARMY is just disgusting, she was sexually assaulted and no one listened but her family i hope whoever killed her gets life in prison or the death penalty and she deserves a memorial and a funeral payed by the government ICE needs to get removed immigrants should be able to make their lives here this should be a country of freedom where anyone can come to have a better life for them and/or their children hispanics DO NOT bring crime into the United States if you do research mostly all crime is done by whites , whites are the ones doing the crimes no one should be racially profiled or pulled over just because they “fit the profile” based on their race history should not be repeated instead it should be made better than it was in the past years.

We don’t want you to send more cops out send our own army on us we just want you or someone to look more into the justice system and fix it make the requirements higher make body cams accessible to the public and EVERY cop no matter the excuse should have there’s on at all times because I highly doubt they forgot because if they can forget that so easily can’t they forget there training just as easily to? We just want to be happy and safe where we live and all of us who want these things don’t support the riots that happen but as evidence show your cops nun the less are the ones starting it so then we see this and it makes our blood boil your trying to ruin our cause or freedom to speak and amongst each other no less so where gonna run you threw the dirt. 80% of the people who support you are airhead people who are just to lazy to care about anything and honestly I really wanted to hope that you would help us not bring in more money not bring in more guns but help and protect your civilians.

As soon as it finally did, the login/ signup took multiple hours to complete. It asked very personal questions, such as my social security number and what I was currently wearing at the time. I had to fill out all family tree as far back as I can. When told to input my race the only two options were “White” and “other”. I was taken aback by this because I would never expect something of the sort, especially with the great diversity our president promotes. As soon as I finished the sign up, my phone started to act very peculiar until I realized I’d been hacked!! I checked my social media’s and it showed I had blocked all democratic politicians after my account had sent automated death threats to each of them. I would never write such disgusting things. I’ve been staying positive and kind to all leftists to follow in the footsteps of our president, who constantly welcomes difference in opinion with open arms. As well as that, my parents gotten phone calls from various radical racist groups trying to recruit them, saying it was part of the Trump Administration’s welcome to supporting our campaign. It truly disgusts me to have even downloaded this in the first place. This hardly represents our amazing president! The app was filled with hate speech toward LGBTQ+ and POC. I truly recommend not downloading this. Just stick to his amazing twitter for the most reliable sourcing!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"Makenzie-1"}}]}
