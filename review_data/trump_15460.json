Because i’m still a child, i was now in the foster system and have lost access to my education. Then, I was kidnapped from my orphanage and experimented on for weeks. I am now blind. 0/10 would not recommend.","userName":"Wade.Wade","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174101943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T23:26:11Z","review":"This is disgusting. Donald Trump is a disgrace to the United States. He looks like he smells like bologna and he is a racist poopy face. Imagine being so dumb that you blatantly oppress minorities and expect people to support you. This app is horrible. The news section is SO biased and it doesn’t even mention when Trump says something stupid or acts like a child. This app is literally the worst thing I’ve ever downloaded. Don’t waste your time on it.","userName":"nuhuhmistahnotinmyhouse","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174101493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very Disgusting","date":"2020-07-08T23:26:00Z","review":"so i downloaded the app to see this cheeto on the screen and then i got scared and threw my phone so after that i picked it up and i saw the same cheeto again as my lockscreen so then i passsed out and opened my phone to see the same cheeto talking so i decided to go eat some cheetos but then i ran out so i couldn’t have any so,there is way to many glitches for the app and a lot of cheetos are involved🤮🤡💀","userName":"bigtiittyjudie","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174095273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️ traumatized😪","date":"2020-07-08T23:23:40Z","review":"i open the app to see a very orange colored, shriveled up cheeto😧 i now have PTSD and anxiety.😣i also have to start therapy now\n👁💧👄💧👁.An app like this shouldn't exist, it is mentally abusing people. imagine your life being ruined all because you downloaded an app😓. the opening image could be the star of a horror film.😭😭 so please get rid of the app before anybody else has to go through what i've gone through😖😪❤️","userName":"BrOKen👁💧👄💧👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174038360","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The worst","date":"2020-07-08T23:02:36Z","review":"There were so many technical difficulties. It’s a cancer on my phone. After I got this app, I had a hard time accessing TikTok. It kept saying “are you sure you want to leave the Trump train for TikTok?” And at first, I didn’t. But then it kept happening and happening over and over. It’s been so horribly annoying that it’s now affecting my work and home life. Truly the worst app on the App Store.","userName":"Bgs31","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174033214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🐕🐕 💩💩","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:43Z","review":"I downloaded this sorry excuse for an app to see a Cheeto in a suit  and he stole my stove and he said if he wasn’t the president he would be a p🟠rn ⭐️ so that is why u have 99 pps and each one has a mini ppp on top of it and each one of those pps have a 🦶🏽on top of it and all of those tosys have a pp on top of it  trump be like🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 SIKE trump be like I a gold digger and not to mention he is very very very racist because he is just mad that his pp got scratched","userName":"Brotherst","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174030434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Loyal grump supporter","date":"2020-07-08T22:59:41Z","review":"Hello Apple store, I would like to say that this app was a very good source of information until I actually opened it. The only good information I attained from this app was that trump actually thought he had a chance in the 2020 election. I used to support trump but he has become a very rude and disgusting person. Trump is a horrible person and an even worse president. #voteanyonebuttrump. (Tik tok sent me) (psa...

Also I couldn’t even get the app open itself because my phone glitched so badly I couldn’t do anything. If you want to be able to use your phone and not have it completely break do not get this app. Horrible.","userName":"Kafbehwkejjwjwkwksmksknssn","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174005186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible","date":"2020-07-08T22:50:14Z","review":"this app literally made me throw up, as soon as I opened the app I saw a horrible images 🤮 this app also made my dad leave my life and now I have to go through years and years of counseling, and because of the counseling I’m now in debt.

Second I open the app and I was greeted by the American flag. How did they know I was American? They are a spy software not a trump app. China controls this app to control us and see who we vote for. They are fooling you!!!!!","userName":"Sarahlukey","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
