Everyone who supports trump is supporting a child rapist on top of a racist sexist man child who can not even form a proper sentence without contradicting himself or his cabin. I would like everyone who supports him to re-evaluate and look and see that you are on the side of the abuser as well as a man who has made an extreme amount of inappropriate comments to women and POCs. YOU are apart of the problem, you are supporting a white supremacist which basically means you are a white supremacist and no I‚Äôm not taking anything out of ‚Äúcontext‚Äù because even with context it is still disgusting and horrible. Supporting him is supporting systematic racism and abuse in this country and under trumps administration he has broken the peace treaty between indigenous tribes and the put children in cages and many have died due to both of those injustices. On top of all that trump is homophobic and just recently passed a law that puts restrictions on same sex couples adopting so trump pretty much feels better with kids in the system than with a living same sex couple. Last but definitely not least trump supporters your only argument is that liberals and Democrats are just children who have zero stable points in their defense but in all actuality that‚Äôs trump supporters their only argument is trump 2020 if you have actually valid points I would live to hear them but I haven‚Äôt heard any truly well formulated arguments to why I should support trump so please educate me on why we should let a man who encourages systematic racism and sex abuse as well as homophobia to be in office for another 4 years. Thank you for reading why your president (because i will never see him as my president) is a pompous douche bag."}},{"id":"6173489943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:42:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Nghbghgfdfrgfrvf d vf vfrgtrt","review":"I was excited to support our orange Cheeto racist president ‚ú®üßöüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èbut was dissapointed when the app was HORRIBLE üò°"}},{"id":"6173481957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ilovemyboo","review":"Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nI used to love Cheetos \nUntil I saw you ü•∞‚ú®üßö\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüåà\nIf you vote for trump you need help ‚ù§Ô∏è"}},{"id":"6173477752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:38:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"12348682819495929","review":"This App is so glitchy"}}]}
