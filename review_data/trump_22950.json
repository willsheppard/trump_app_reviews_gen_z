Just looking at it you can tell that it’s filled with hateful and non-Christian information, it’s pretty anti-biblical. This “app” and the Cheeto who runs it remind me of a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object (cult). Yikes. Definitely don’t download.","rating":1,"title":"Not a vibe","userName":"Emmie632","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173575416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was utterly terrible for the most part. It glitched all the time and I couldn’t even do what I wanted. Either way I don’t like trump, he’s nasty and this app has to be the worst of all time to be honest.

Not only should this app be banned but it should be erased from history just like trump. Children under 12 will have serious PTSD if downloaded.","rating":1,"title":"Despicable","userName":"thebestfreakinglivingthing","date":"2020-07-08T20:06:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173556774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app very much disgusted me it took up half the storage in my phone it took 2 hours to download it started playing music out of no where it gave my phone a virus’s big I hade to go to the Apple to help me get it fix I do not recommend this app you be better off getting a game app then this","rating":1,"title":"Do not get this app🤮🤮🤮","userName":"denise ben","date":"2020-07-08T20:05:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173555310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Doyour thang\nDo your thang with me now\nDo your thang\nDo your thang with me now\nWhat's my thang\nWhat's my thang, tell me now\nTell me now yeah yeah yeah yeah\nAy 심장이 뛰지 않는대\n더는 음악을 들을 때\nTryna pull up\n시간이 멈춘 듯해\nOh that would be my first death\nI been always afraid of\n이게 나를 더 못 울린다면\n내 가슴을 더 떨리게 못 한다면\n어쩜 이렇게 한 번 죽겠지 아마\nBut what if that moment's right now, right now\n귓가엔 느린 심장 소리만 bump bump bump\n벗어날래도 그 입속으로 jump jump jump\n어떤 노래도 와닿지 못해\n소리 없는 소릴 질러\n모든 빛이 침묵하는 바다 yeah yeah yeah\n길 잃은 내 발목을 또 잡아 yeah yeah yeah\n어떤 소리도 들리지 않아 yeah yeah yeah\nKillin' me now, killin' me now\nDo you hear me yeah\n홀린 듯 천천히 가라앉아 nah nah nah\n몸부림쳐봐도 사방이 바닥 nah nah\n모든 순간들이 영원이 돼 yeah yeah yeah\nFilm it now, film it now\nDo you hear me yeah\nDo your thang\nDo your thang with me now\nDo your thang\nDo your thang with…","rating":1,"title":"stream kick it and ON🥰","userName":"✨✨✨🙈ARMYZEN🙈✨✨✨","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173551234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app literally took dats to download and was glitching as soon as I got it.
