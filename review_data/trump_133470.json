But then when i opened the app hoping to see my racist king👑 I saw an ugly orange🍊🍊🍊🍊! It was intensely terrifying so sadly i wet my pants👖. Then my husband walked in threatening to beat me since supper 🥙wasn’t ready and that my only job. He saw that my pants were wet and proceeded to call me a pee pee poo poo body. I started crying loudly and my neighbors called the police. They came and shot my favorite teddy bear🧸 just because it was brown. They said it was just a safety precaution. But then the real nightmare started. ORANGES FLOODED MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE. I told them to go back where they came from (i find myself saying that a lot) but they just turned into mexicans🙈! They have sombreros and tequila and then morphed onto black people! With cigars and tattoos. I started crying because i’m scared of those people and idc care if you say that not all black and mexicans are like that bc the oranges proved it to me. I needed to calm down so I went to abuse some black children as i watched other mexicans get harassed by my friends. 🤗","date":"2020-07-08T19:35:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173469403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Lodilouwho","title":"Horrible app","review":"This app is cursed. I tried to download it and it asks many very personal questions then this awful music played the entire time it was downloading which took forever and made my phone completely unusable. I think it’s a Russian spy app because as soon as the app FINALLY downloaded a man called speaking in Russian then proceeded to ask about emails and someone named sleepy joe. I told him I didn’t know anyone by the name of joe personally but I would be voting for a man named joe because this guy in the presidents office now is a total ass clown. He started screaming at me telling me that Russian troll farms were going to flood my social media with ads and propaganda to brainwash me and that after I would join in yelling and whining about wearing a mask and chanting make America great again. I was deeply confused as America is an entire continent and there is both a north and a south so I wasn’t sure what he was getting at but I knew that this was some kind of low grade psychological warfare. Unfortunately it has worked on some unintelligent primitive simple minded people because I have seen people wearing t-shirts and waving flags with that exact slogan. Anyway to make a long story short this app is really bad! The Russian man said he knew where I lived and had all my data to track my social media habits and that they would act accordingly. All this for a stupid app and it didn’t even have games 🤬 Also the man had me so distracted that I burnt my quesadilla and now I’m hungry. Screw this app and F.D.T 🙃","date":"2020-07-08T19:35:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173468893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"anna bortinon","title":"IT KILLED MY FAMILY😾😾😡😡😪😿","review":"this app killed my parents and my two sisters. it’s horrible and i still haven’t recovered😭😭. when i downloaded this app i thought it was just to keep up with turnip but no. it brought a bunch of bugs, rats, moles, and TRUMPETS😱😱😱😱😱😱THE WORST OF ALL. they all kept chanting “TURNIP 2020” and it was so scary, but then the worst night of my life happened one day after i downloaded the app. ok so it was a very foggy night after a awful day of trying to keep all of the stuff from my house and when i sent to sleep a few hours passed until i heard screaming from the bedrooms and when i went there with my baseball bat but it was two late😖😖😖when i got to the bedrooms and fought off the giant moles and rats my family was long gone😩😩😩while i was grieving a wild pack of trumped came thru my house getting their bodies, one bitting me, and worst of all they weren’t even wearing masks😷😷😷i an still so sad because i couldn’t even get them an actual funeral😿😿so please do me the favor and DONT GET THIS APP.","date":"2020-07-08T19:35:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173468060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"jdjdjdjfnfjrkf","title":"Melania Trump","review":"My husband made my son and I download this stupid app!!

I waited for this app to download for around three days, and nearly died on my couch from dehydration. After it downloaded, trump himself flew down from his helicopter which read “I LOVE kids” he jumped out, using his obese figure to bounce off his the ground safely, leaving a dent in the asphalt. Him and 5 of his rape victims proceeded to reenact a white supremacist jazzercise dance. He even took my unborn child and baptized it in his own urine, while singing “Born in the USA” by Bruce Springsteen. My wife swooned. My mouse suffocating from Trump’s fumes. My fetus became jesus and cast me to hell, which just appeared to be trump’s brain. It’s very small here and I’m claustrophobic.
