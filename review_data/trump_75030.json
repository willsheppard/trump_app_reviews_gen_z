EVERYTHING WAS GONE. my photos, my apps, my contacts, my messages, and it even reset my wallpaper. so DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you want this racist white supremacist to completely wipe your phone and kidnap you to make him your slave. really thought trump would never do such a thing. turns out all of those references hinting that he wants to go back to slavery is true. i was a slave at the white house. after days of messages and threats from him he finally sent 25 oompa loompas to pick me up. i tried to fight back. but those little demons were so wired and trained by him they couldn’t hear my pleas. i was at the white house for at least a month. i’m not sure. time is unclear when your kept in a box and only let out to clean his dirty toilet. i noticed that the spoon malania fed him fruit flavored baby food and apple sauce with was very sturdy. it had a few bits marks but it would have to do. soon enough i escaped by taking his baby spoon that he likes to be fed with and digging a hole out of the bathroom. i ran for my life. almost got hit by a car. but i escaped. i can safely say that after he sees this review he will send the oompa loompas for me again. only to imprison me again. but it will probably be worse this time. please for your safety do not download this app.","userName":"Triana Xandraya Rivera","title":"terrible terrible terrible"}},{"id":"6176296900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:34:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app made me start feeling like a racist so I had to delete it immediately!!","userName":"ddgdwecchjgerf","title":"TERRIBLE!!"}},{"id":"6176289526","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:32:39Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I don’t know what to say it’s just horrible who would want to vote for a Cheeto puff","userName":"offical karen","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6176284916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:31:20Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The user hid is too crowded and the app itself is stressful to look at.
