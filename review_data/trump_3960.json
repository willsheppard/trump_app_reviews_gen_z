I expected so much more. I opened this app, and IMMEDIATELY another window popped up. It ended up sending me to a PORNOGRAPHY site. I was with my husband and kids at the dinner table eating the pot roast I slaved over for HOURS in the kitchen. I had to explain to my 8 and 4 year old children why naked people were on my phone. Undoubtedly, I’ve failed as a mother. I can’t believe that the president of our COUNTRY would force me to expose my children to this nonsense. Luckily, I had both of my offspring baptized, so they are blessed with the grace of God Himself. I hope they are able to move past this traumatic experience, and find God in the process. 🙏🏻","title":"Terrible Experience!","rating":1,"userName":"ih8b00mers"}},{"id":"6173965042","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:35:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is maybe the worst app on the entire app store. not only does it take forever to download but the second you open it it asks for your phone number. i just wanted this app to make fun of the orange man but instead he tried to take my information. this app has no respect for my personal privacy and due to immediately seeing an orange cheeto the second i opened this app i proceeded to hurl on my phone which caused $100 in damage repair. the design of this app could have been done by a five year old (at least then it would have been better executed than it currently is) and it was a waste of storage space.

I was so excited to finally be able to convert from a snowflake libtard ❄️🤢 to an elite trump humper 🤩🇺🇸 instead, the app gave me brain damage, morphed me into a slug of a human, and completely depleted my iq. Im so disappointed with the results. Ive also noticed a strange tendencies to despise minorities, speak and act misogynisticly, and be an all around unlikeable human :( Ive lost my ability to articulate; i can construct sentences mentally but all that leaves my mouth is “TRUMP 2020.” Im scared these effects may be irreversible and that i will live out the rest of my life as an ignorant, grimy cretin. Why didnt the app work?????!!??????","title":"So disappointed","rating":1,"userName":"yq3101"}},{"id":"6173668607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:47Z","isEdited":false,"review":"It took a little too long to download, I am connected to WiFi and it works perfectly with everything else, so I don’t know why it’s not working. Also, when I tried to press “get involved” my phone shut down. I thought it wasn’t anything and I tried again, but it didn’t work. I wanted to make my grandparents proud and try to help out our president, but I guess that won’t happen because this app is trash. Make it better or just delete it. Very, very disappointed.  Now I am going to be kicked out of my house because I can’t go help out our president. So thank you for that.

I know this is just an stupid app review but if the state of this country doesn’t prove that we need new administration and a new president who isn’t racist, homophobic, transphobic, and a literal child rapist and womanizer then I don’t know what will. We should all come together and settle for Biden to get this guy out of the White House, I 100% understand that he is not our dream candidate, believe me, but he’s the only reasonable choice. 💙💙💙","title":"Don’t download this app😔","rating":2,"userName":"soccerdaisy10"}}]}
