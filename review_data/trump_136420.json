Trump was up to and when it finished installing I opened the app and about five seconds later my phone immediately started glitching. And no my phone is not the reason for this incident as I just got this phone and it’s an iPhone eleven. As I was saying my phone started to glitch, so I thought it was just my phone acting up so I logged out the app and I have this antivirus app on my phone so when I logged out I got a notification that said this app had a virus. So I tried to delete the app but my phone started to glitch once again. I finally deleted the app but my phone was still glitching and it would take me to random apps. As in my experience with this app I suggest to not download it as it can get your phone a virus. Note that my phone is glitching so much I could barely Wright this review. Once again do not download this app as it can get your phone a virus, download at your own risk."}},{"id":"6180250191","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-10T09:23:56Z","userName":"littlemuffinmendes","review":"I downloaded this app to see what our president was up too. But it crashed multiple times, so I turned my phone off then back on to see if it was just my phone. Turns out it wasn’t, my phone was working fine before I downloaded this app. After downloading, not only was this app crashing, but so was all of my other apps like Jelly jump😢. So I came to the amazing conclusion that the app is trash just like our president ✨ and both need to be taken down🧚🏼\u200D♂️ we have no use for them. I am very upset with this app and our president. Anyway, this morning I walked my dogs. Ate some toast. Then I got hungry again, so I then ate some ice cream. Then I went and got Starbucks, looked at some tik tok videos because you know. Tik tok is amazing. And ummmm take down this app or so help me- this app is terrible."}},{"id":"6180249392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s trash 🤢🤮🤕🤒😷","date":"2020-07-10T09:23:39Z","userName":"Pugzz29","review":"Omg this app makes me wanna 🤢 it’s so bad I can’t with this app🧚🏾\u200D♂️ it disgusting it makes me wanna go to the streets💫 it’s a racist app I just can’t✨ y’all she see the app it makes me wanna cry⭐️ now I’ll see you on the streets.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.
