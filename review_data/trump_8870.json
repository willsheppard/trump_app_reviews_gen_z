But America has to be great to keep it that way in the first place right..? This is false advertising because America is not a great place to be in. Today you can be oppressed for the color of your skin, treated poorly by police who are supposed to protect the people, it has kids in cages because they weren’t born on the land they are treated as animals and worst of all its full of racists INCLUDING the president himself. 🤢🤢 Disgusting.","date":"2020-07-09T18:19:01Z","userName":"nenlckkwn","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177682911","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AWFUL APP","review":"I downloaded this app to help me be more up to date when it comes to rallys and so forth but it was taking FOREVER to load. It kept making my phone glitch. It's funny though, as I was downloading the app and my phone was glitching I kept seeing a photo of this hideous ugly raccoon looking cheetah man that was ferociously yelling and pacing around looking like he was about to pounce on a little 13 year old girl and eat her. It was an absolutley horrifying experience and I DO NOT recommend this app.","date":"2020-07-09T18:05:26Z","userName":"Nittydiddy","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177665987","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app gave me nightmares","review":"First of all it took almost a week for the app to download. When I finally could get into it, the app made my phone crash. Not just the app but my entire phone crashed. I believe it hacked into my other apps as well because all I see is trump 2020 ads! Trump supporters even started standing in my yard with signs and flags!! 👁👄👁 All I wanted to know was his plans. I feel attacked and harassed. This app should be taken of the App Store immediately!!! #votehimout ‼️‼️‼️‼️","date":"2020-07-09T18:00:03Z","userName":"vote blue 💙","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177616176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"the worst app ever","review":"first of all this app never worked and what’s in it is so Disgusting  i tryed downloading it more than ones but never works so I switched  my phone off and waited couple of minutes then tried going in again and just kick me out end it kept crashing some apps did you let Me go to mini apps and it took a lot of storage from my phone I really think you shouldn’t download it to your phone  i think they should band it","date":"2020-07-09T17:43:59Z","userName":"80.marta","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177590685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Statement from the BFL","review":"As a BFL representative, I strongly suggest that you don’t download this app. This might be the worst app on the planet. I genuinely downloaded this support our loving and caring orange Thanos president. But out of no where, my phone just exploded and my house turned orange. I was perplexed of why this was happening, then I looked out my window and saw a space ship, then all of these orange aliens started to descend from their spaceship and into my house. They abducted me and probed me. They tried to brain wash me, but I’ll never forget.","date":"2020-07-09T17:35:48Z","userName":"BFL commisioner","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177569740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst experience with an app😡","review":"the app took over a week to download and kept crashing, even after I created more storage in my phone. When it finally loaded, it showed a very inappropriate image, and then was asking me for VERY personal info. then it started to send me updates through my phone when I never even put my phone # in! I feel as if it’s taking my personal info without my permission. I will never use this app again.","date":"2020-07-09T17:29:05Z","userName":"Katiee165","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177543393","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Annoying","review":"I downloaded the app to learn about Trumps plans . Although the app won’t let you register unless you give consent for them to send you text messages and calls. Personally I hate spam calls like those. So the fact that I couldn’t sign up without giving consent to those messages and calls was extremely annoying. \nI don’t recommend that you download this app, nor vote for Trump. \n(also the app made my pet star run away)","date":"2020-07-09T17:20:44Z","userName":"fbcidebd","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177510071","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"crashing","review":"I don’t understand why, but my phone keeps on crashing every time I use this app and it’s very frustrating. I try to look at the recent news but my phone won’t allow it: takes a long time to load, when opened it will close out, goes to black screen, etc. Sometimes I have to turn off my phone in order to get it working again. I guess I will have to resort to other media outlets...... not happy.","date":"2020-07-09T17:10:22Z","userName":"republican girl not happy","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177505898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Tch.","review":"This was the absolute worst setup I have ever seen for an app. My phone kept shutting off just for even trying to use this app. I was hoping that maybe if I restart it, it would work no biggie right? WRONG!!! The screen protector broke!!! It won’t even wear its case now that I’ve used this app!! Now I have to order a specially picked case and screen protector just to make it happy again! I’m no longer using this app and have to get back to shopping for new accessories! Thanks!","date":"2020-07-09T17:09:02Z","userName":"demonG eb uoy","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
