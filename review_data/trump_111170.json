Birds are flying and porpoises are swimming happily. From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves\nSailors: (singing) \nI'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue\nAnd it's hey to the starboard, heave ho\nLook out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you\nIn mysterious fathoms below.\nEric: \nIsn't this great? The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face . . . a perfect day to be at sea!\nGrimsby: \n[Leaning over side.] Oh yes . . . delightful . . . .\nSailor 1: \nA fine strong wind and a following sea. King Triton must be in a friendly-type mood.\nEric: \nKing Triton?\nSailor 2: \nWhy, ruler of the merpeople, lad. Thought every good sailor knew about him.\nGrimsby: \nMerpeople! Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.\nSailor 2: \nBut it ain't nonsense, it's the truth! I'm tellin' you, down in the depths o' the ocean they live. [He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops away and lands back in the ocean, relieved.]\nSailors: (singing) \nHeave. ho. Heave, ho.\nIn mysterious fathoms below.\n[Fish sighs and swims away.]\nTitles. Various fish swimming. Merpeople converge on a great undersea palace, filling concert hall inside. Fanfare ensues.\nSeahorse: \nAhem . . . His royal highness, King Triton! [Triton enters dramatically to wild cheering.] And presenting the distinguished court composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! [Sebastian enters to mild applause.]\nTriton: \nI'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.\nSebastian: \nOh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever conducted. Your daughters - they will be spectacular!\nTriton: \nYes, and especially my little Ariel.\nSebastian: \nYes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . . [sotto] If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . . [He proceeds to podium and begins to direct orchestra.]\nTriton's daughters: (singing) \nAh, we are the daughters of Triton.\nGreat father who loves us and named us well:\nAquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.\nAnd then there is the youngest in her musical debut,\nOur seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,\nTo sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,\nShe's our sister, Ar-i . . . \nShell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent.\nTriton: \n[Very angry.] Ariel!!\nCut to Ariel looking at sunken ship.\nFlounder: \n[From distance.] Ariel, wait for me . . .\nAriel: \nFlounder, hurry up!\nFlounder: \n[Catching up.] You know I can't swim that fast.\nAriel: \nThere it is. Isn't it fantastic?\nFlounder: \nYeah . . . sure . . . it - it's great. Now let's get outta here.\nAriel: \nYou're not getting cold fins now, are you?\nFlounder: \nWho, me? No way. It's just, it, err . . . it looks - damp in there. Yeah. And I think I may be coming down with something. Yeah, I got this cough. [Flounder coughs unconvincingly]\nAriel: \nAll right. I'm going inside. You can just stay here and - watch for sharks. [She goes inside.]\nFlounder: \nO.K. Yeah - you go. I'll stay and - what? Sharks!
