When the first thing I had to do to enter the app was give my email, I thought nothing of it. Normal app things, right? WRONG! Now, I get nothing but Russian Spam to my email and have noticed my phone activating and scrolling through apps without me doing anything!!! If you don't want China stealing your info and getting Russian spam, stay away from this app! It's obviously a fake used to destroy Trump's image!!!\nI'm so scared that I'll have to get a new phone after all the malware this app has probably put on my phone! Stay safe guys!","date":"2020-07-10T03:40:12Z","title":"PLEASE don't get this app","isEdited":false}}]}
