I had no idea of what was going on so I went to get it fixed. The worker said my phone was in perfect condition so we had mirror my phone to my apple computer.

This app immediately started spamming with notifications... but my notifications were off. Completely takes control of your phone, trump 2020 was sent to all of my contacts, and his face became my lockscreen without me changing it. highly disappointed:((","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T03:06:58Z","rating":1,"userName":"Slappy82"}},{"id":"6174750006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app the whole screen started to be covered by a GINORMOUS orange. I thought it might have just been a picture of the big man himself but I was severely wrong. The whole app is filled with bugs that keep messing up my microwave which made my squirrel run away in fear. I am highly disgusted by the fact that there’s no pictures of glizzys on here. I highly expected them to be and they’re not. Overall terrible app. DONT RECOMMEND!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"ABOMINABLE APP!!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"milaqueennnnn"}},{"id":"6174745773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was the worst app I ever downloaded. Immediately when I first opened the app, it was filled with cockroaches and the disgusting bugs that they need to clean up. Also THERE WERE RATS and let me tell u how much I hate rats! Absolutely disgusting, how dare our president put out such a disgraceful app. You would think that he could’ve payed some fancy person to make a five star quality app but NOOOO he had to be cheap and make an app infested with roaches.

Before it could ruin my life and my countries I threw my phone into a lake than took a swim myself washing away all the negativity this app and this president brought me. Unfortunately when I got out of the lake Trump was still president and this app still exists. Luckily I can help get rid of both by rating this app and voting for the 2020 election. \nLet’s do this Gen Z! Let’s change the world.","isEdited":false,"title":"For gen Z","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:48Z","rating":1,"userName":"k-potatie"}},{"id":"6174726146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"y’all are y’all doin is the day you got a girl boo ya ya girl boo ya girl ya ya girl boo ya ya girl ya ya girl boo ya ya girl don’t wan to go to sleep now lol omg is was gonna was a really fun night and i is the morning day you wan to come home and do it again like it like a day and then go to eat a whole lot of things that stuff you don’t wan to come eat eat pizza and then go eat and eat pizza or pizza then go eat and eat some food then go get some stuff for you then bye bye i’m was tlike ywas you a was like the last one of the things i i is a way to make you wanna was the eot i is the day we gonna get it up sis and i is a good day night out for a y’all to me omg omg is was the time of day you got a girl boo ya ya girl boo ya wan to come eat it all day omg is a day or night is a year to you","isEdited":false,"title":"this app gave me a virus","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"ӏҽտӏíҽ"}},{"id":"6174706537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I was obviously going to download the trump app because I’m a racist menace to society, as all are the other people who support trump are (hey dad, i’m talking to u) and afterwards my phone started glitching and then out of nowhere porn ads just started popping up on my phone. the next day i went on the trump app to see how the cheeto man was doing😆😆 then my phone just CAUGHT ON FIRE😱😱 I’m now dead and i am typing this review from hell. don’t download the app😠😠","isEdited":false,"title":"This app ruined my life","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"annabanannacabananorana"}},{"id":"6174665573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got this app thinking it was helpful but NO!! it was not at all. i am very disappointed in mr. orange man OOPS I MEANT DONALD TRUMP anyways this apps dumb, stupid and a big meanie i HATE this app from the bottom of my toes to the stop of my scalp.
