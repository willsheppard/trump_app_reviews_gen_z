I left the app open and went outside to water my ohone like I do everyday, but when I came back, the app was still?? Open?? Like, no, that’s not how apps work. Seeing the cover of the app triggered my acid reflux, and i burned down my house with the acid 😭😭😭all was lost except for the app, but I realized that was all I had left, so I threw it into the fire... 😢Now I am deathly allergic to everything orange, I burn down everything in my path whenever I think of the word ora-","isEdited":false,"title":"???","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:21Z"}},{"id":"6177457854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Adele Mammadova","review":"i love trump with all of my heart. he is my god, my religion, and i have never opened the bible in my entire life in order to strive to be just like my president! but this app is something else. first of all, IT ASKED FOR MY LOCATION😡😡😡😡😡 I DONT WANT TO HE TRACKED DOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT!!

Trump🦐","review":"I thought my great uncle donnie would make a good app, but now i realized that he is just a 🧚✨big fat stale cheeto✨🧚, not even the good kind of cheetos, like the črüśtÿ, mOldY, STALE, sOgGy cheetos you find in the dumpster❤️. This app makes my brain hurt from all the lack of intelligence and the lack of truth being told. I just got rid of my migraines last week but now they are back because of the app. But since i’m a decent person i’m not going to sue even though this brought back my traumatic migraine experiences I’m just going to rate this very low! periodt. 💅","isEdited":false,"title":"disappointed 😪✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:42:27Z"}},{"id":"6177242751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"This chick ...hi","review":"I downloaded this app and every time I go onto it my phone shut off. I’m not sure if there’s a virus. I’m up to date on all of my phone’s software updates, the apps updates and I restarted my phone multiple times. If you want something to make you mad then I recommend this app because it just doesn’t work well. I’m starting to think this was a terrible choice to download it. \n#genz \nI am apart of genz but I love getting information on both sides and this is not reliable at ALL. Take it down.","isEdited":false,"title":"Crash","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:52:12Z"}},{"id":"6177218448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Whitetapper","review":"This stupid app keeps crashing and the moment I downloaded it, I began to get numerous emails and phone calls from people who are very obviously trying to scam me. They're saying things like \"Trump 2020\", advertising his campaign, and asking me for money. I'm not sure what's going on but these incessant calls and emails won't stop. It's at a point where I can't even use my phone. Please just make it stop. I'm definitely not voting for Donald Trump because of this.","isEdited":false,"title":"Getting bombarded with scam calls and won't let me open the thing.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:45:08Z"}},{"id":"6177191112","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jt awesome111","review":"What can I say except this is the single worst app ever made. I hate everything about it. I hate it so much because it makes my phone crash every single time i open it. It physically hurts me to look at the color schemes. I’m in legit distress 24/7 ever since I downloaded such a terrible app. This app needs to be deleted before it becomes spyware for russia... which is definitely what is happening. I think this app is meant to be a virus on your phone. please never download this app whoever sees this review i’m trying to help you!","isEdited":false,"title":"So bad","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:37:20Z"}},{"id":"6177127229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bxjsosgsvzj","review":"If I could give this app 0 stars... I would! It took months to download. It made my phone slower and slower until I can barely write this review right now. I really believe that it hacks your phone and takes your information. Anyway, 0 stars for just the fact that it legitimately took 2 months to download. This app is solely responsible for breaking my phone. I now have to go buy a new one and waste hundreds of dollars all just because I wanted to know Trumps future plans for this country. I repeat: DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:19:28Z"}},{"id":"6177101582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"HEIWHUWJSNW","review":"okay so i will start from the top, i was downloading this app to support our 🍊✨ orange ✨🍊and then when it finally downloaded i flew to chuck e cheese and saw 💅 queen young money 💅 and she said \"🥰 hey girlie wassup you downloaded the app now you must die🥰\" i was like \" omg no pls no ily please stop 😣\" so i was 💕running 💕 and jumped on the trampoline on the 🥰chuck e cheesys 🥰 and landed in los angeles where i met the 😍 renegade ms damelio 😍 and then i ✨ renegaded ✨ with her but then remembered 💅 queen young money 💅 was still after me 😣 and then i ran and ms damelio was like \" omg * renegade * * renegade * where are u going?!! 😣 \" but i had to 🥰 run run run 🥰 i ran into some oompa oompa that looked like a cheeto and it took me back to my houseyyys 💅🥰 and i deleted the app and them my phone got a 🦠 virus 🦠 and then i deleted the app 0/10 i would not recommend this app. crazy experiences 🥰💅","isEdited":false,"title":"✨young muney nicki 💅","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:12:21Z"}},{"id":"6177014723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jeirisbthaofimsbd","review":"i value trump very much so as one does, i got the app. i was very excited to help support our president in another way but this app is terrible. when i first opened it, it was working fine but as the days went on the app started glitching. then a pop up add came up for BIDEN🤮🤮yeah❤️ that’s not even the worst part!!!! a virus hacked my phone and started flooding my camera roll with biden pictures and inappropriate pictures of our president. i was absolutely horrified!!! please fix this app so i can support our “fantastic” president!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"i got a virus","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:48:38Z"}},{"id":"6177003301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hehehe❤️","review":"So my hand slipped and is now writing this review but now that I’m writing might as well say something. This app claimed that if downloaded I would get to DM the real cast of Maze Runner but turns out you can only text the people involved in this so called “army for the Cheeto puff” or cult as I like to call it. This app also made my phone crash when I was trying to tell the Oompa Loompa happy belated birthday, I couldn’t make any calls and my phone would crack with disgust. In conclusion I had to get a new phone so the pedo in office owes me 🥰🥱❤️🧚🏼💗🙈🤡happy reading 💋💋","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤢🤢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:45:33Z"}}]}
