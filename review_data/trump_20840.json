Every time I try to type “huge” now, it autocorrects to “yuge.” All of the written content is in broke sentences and does not exceed a 2nd grade reading level. Would never recommend this to anyone.","userName":"lukelael1"}},{"id":"6176662367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:15:31Z","title":"Had to buy a new phone","rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely awful!!!

A tiny monkey woman jumped out of my phone and personally slapped my eyeball. My phone started flying all over my room and changing a weird curse to try and make me vote for trump. I tried to get it down and it bit me. This app is an unacceptable excuse of an app at all. Ps. (The monkey woman won’t leave) DONT TRUST THIS APP!","userName":"MiseEnPlace83"}},{"id":"6176601143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:59:15Z","title":"I HATE THIS APP","rating":1,"review":"This app has caused so many crashes on my phone. It took 3 hours to download and I got so mad. I downloaded this app to see what news trump was saying. Every single news is inaccurate and it’s not what’s happening in the world. All of the covid stats are highly false and same with other things. I strongly to not download this app.","userName":"Pkl."}},{"id":"6176594845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:57:30Z","title":"Bad","rating":1,"review":"This app was very glitchy when it first opened. So bad that I had to get a new phone because it hacked my phone. Now i am being sent to a correctional facility since my whole life was hacked ! My family has nothing and this app has scared me. Not only that but when an app takes 2 days to download too.","userName":"Book of Lego"}}]}
