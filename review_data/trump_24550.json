It kept on coming back to a screen with an orange man on it and it really freaked me out. “Make America great again” he said but all that is happening is “ITS CHINA!! CHINA MADE US HAVE AND NOW WE ARE KEEPING IT!!! ITS CHINAS FAULT!”  🙄 But the good thing is... nothing. There is nothing about this that is good. Nothing at all. Have a great day Gen Z😁","rating":1}},{"id":"6174772729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Pure Disappointment","isEdited":false,"userName":"😔👅🧊👅😔","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:00Z","review":"This app is absolutely awful. It steals the blankets off of you when you finally get comfy in your bed. My cat did not approve of that thank you very much. I hope that no one downloads this app because I did not expect to be so disappointed in the way he set this app up.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174769342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"genz risen up to the plate","date":"2020-07-09T02:57:58Z","review":"This app is absolute garbage.🧚🏽✨ it will steal your family and your dog😪.

I was like wow.. I didn’t know they made an app for silly wonkas oompa lumpas ! Big fan of the chocolate factory. So I did what ANYONE else would do and downloaded it to see some dank candy and midgets. Was highly disappointed when all I came across was racist pedos :c no candy. No midgets. No wonka.

I was pleasantly disappointed to find out that he was sadly eaten by his son Barron Trump in revenge for kidnapping all his friends and storing them in his underground bunker to starve (#savebarron2020). DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It is all fake news and loves to feed you information about the misogynistic, racist Oompa Loompa.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174741713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"IT HACKED ME.","isEdited":false,"userName":"5star🐷","date":"2020-07-09T02:49:34Z","review":"I downloaded this app, and my phone immediately glitched. NOT ONLY THE APP. MY WHOLE PHONE. I’ve seen on social media platforms that the government is trying to hack into our devices from this app, and delete tweets, videos, etc. regarding trump. If you do not want to get hacked, DON’T DOWNLOAD. AND LEAVE A BAD RATING SO OTHERS WILL BE WARNED. I wish I would’ve heard this news sooner.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174739628","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Be Warned!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Fruit Attacks Lover","date":"2020-07-09T02:48:56Z","review":"so i was heading over to talk to my friend donny and then my friend jimmy network pooped on my head so i decided that i would eat chicken nuggets for dessert. sometimes i think donny doesn’t like me and my chicken feed says don’t say that so i guess if you like pineapples you shouldn’t get it because it’s bad so thanks for listening.

All I wanted was to see my favorite orange cheeto looking blob but as soon as I opened it it started glitching. Now everytime I try to open any other app it won’t let me. Also it took up almost all my storage. This app is just as useless as the government.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174724128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheeto_l0v3r","date":"2020-07-09T02:44:16Z","review":"i downloaded this app and my dogs started crying because when i opened it there was some weird orange cheeto monster saying something about making america great again and then i tried to make some unsee juice but when i went to my kitchen the cheeto thing was in my kitchen and we ran back to my room where an eagle flew in through the window and then dropped a toupee on the floor. to my horror, the cheeto man followed us into my room and put the toupee on and started shouting hateful remarks while making duck lips. i will never download again","rating":1}},{"id":"6174713860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Low life jerk","isEdited":false,"userName":"mad republican mom","date":"2020-07-09T02:41:08Z","review":"This is the worst app in the world because it is about the worst person in the world.  In my 50 years, I have never seen such a sorry excuse for a human being.  While I would never wish anyone dead, I certainly would not be sad should Mr. Trump see the light and quit this nasty charade of a campaign.","rating":1}}]}
