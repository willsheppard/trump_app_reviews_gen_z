But she had an enchantment \n                         upon her of a fearful sort which could \n                         only be broken by love's first kiss. \n                         She was locked away in a castle guarded \n                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. \n                         Many brave knights had attempted to \n                         free her from this dreadful prison, \n                         but non prevailed. She waited in the \n                         dragon's keep in the highest room of \n                         the tallest tower for her true love \n                         and true love's first kiss.

I feel so bad for the spray tanners! I had to take my two year old potato to see a therapist after the image was imprinted in their brain. Then when I went to go get a BigMac an alert from the app said I was going to get obese. The app tracks you and is really mean. The big Cheeto man is in charge of it all I know it. Then my pet dinosaur looked at the Cheeto’s bleached wig and wanted one so it went on amazon and spent $3 million dollars on a wig just like that so now I am homeless. Then the dinosaur became like the Cheeto and destroyed everything I owned. It burnt everything and gave me a tan like the Cheeto man. I was so ugly all my family members died on sight when seeing me. Now I am homeless, tanned, and have no family. Now I will end this review with my main statement,”DESTROY THE CHEETO MAN WITH HIS SMALL BALLS!!” If you do not agree with this review than vote Biden 2020. If you do agree with this vote Biden 2020.
