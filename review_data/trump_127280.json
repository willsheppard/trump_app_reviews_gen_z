I’m writing this as a ghost because trump is a horrible person and it needs to be brought to more peoples attention how terrible he is. The rainbow dash jar image is better than trump himself. He’s a terrible person who doesn’t support anyone and wants to ruin our country. He’s a sick person who doesn’t accept POC and anyone apart of the LGBTQ+ community. I say he can f🤮ck off. He’s done no good for our country and he just continues to f it up. Anyways this app causes so many software issues and caused my house to fall down and kill everyone in it. i say it gets taken down just like that jerk wants to take down tik tok.","userName":"rainbow dash ghost","date":"2020-07-09T18:42:17Z"}},{"id":"6177804354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I open this app to see nude pictures of little children, I’m talking tiny 6,7 year olds, with countless advertisements for adult videos and harsh content. 11/10 would not recommend, that being said, I have also seen countless coordinates placed in random parts of the app, that when googled, are places of murders that have been unsolved to this day.
