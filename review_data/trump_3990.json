He has zero political experience before becoming president. He told people to drink bleach to stop coronavirus from entering them. He received word of corona in January and didn’t do anything until March. He refuses to acknowledge Black Lives Matter. The only reason he wasn’t impeached was because the final vote was up to his friends. People who have gotten corona understand how bad Trump is. Not to mention how long it took this app to download. When it did it was the laggiest price of crap ever. And every time I refuse to donate it calls me a worthless price of trash."}},{"id":"6177344726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"patrice mitchell","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:21:17Z","title":"the cheeto man lives?!1!1🙀","review":"i was TRYING to be a better person by getting this mole infested app but i just COULDNT HELP BUT LEAVE because the opening picture is of the big fat ugly wrinkly scary cheeto man!!! truly i hoped he was a myth because why would such a vile creature like that be running our country?? still waiting for someone to say sike 😾 anyways, the app is terrible, theres no information, it crashes a lot, specifically, the party, but also, really does crash my phone, also inflicts nightmares, and daymares, because the cheeto man truly is a monster 😾 the app must be taken down immediately as it is a threat to all!!!!!!!! seriously nobody cares about trump or his well being 💖"}},{"id":"6177121212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"😽😼✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:17:50Z","title":"this app is ✨t r a s h✨","review":"hate it 🙅\u200D♀️ disgusting 🤮 i see this ugly cheeto lookin thing 👹 and its making me do things i don’t want to 😳 WHICH IS AGINST MY RIGHTS 🧚 i thought this was a FREE 👁👄👁 COUNTRY 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐 guess not 🖐 only free if ur a white male.  basically this app made me die of a stroke thank god ✨MICHELLE OBAMA✨ was there to save me.  👑 unlike 12 🤢 who right now are most definitely killing innocent peoples LIVES  due to THEIR racial prejudice views. so rude honestly 😾 oh? oh? who’s controlling the cops and telling them what to do at the protests which is harming all the peaceful protesters.

I decided I should start to acknowledge what is going on in this country. First I learned from my cat that everyone in this country should be accepted. Then, I downloaded the app and see what Donald Trump did with the place. As soon as I opened the app, a huge storm cloud formed over my town. From the darkness of my phone I could see the reflection of the clouds. An orange blob? As I turned around I heard the haunting cackle of our president crackling through the sky. Huge lighting bolts formed in the shape of oppressed country and mobs of lady’s with bob hair cuts came storming through the street. This app was the beginning of an apocalypse. 0/10 don’t recommend"}},{"id":"6176857038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kari092","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:06:51Z","title":"UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I downloaded this app, thinking I would be able to see the key differences between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and I saw the KEY DIFFERENCES, alright!! On his app all he does is bicker and talk crap about everyone he knows, and then goes on to try and steal your money for his campaigns, and ISNT EVEN NICE ABOUT IT! One of his tactics said, “I’m very disappointed in you for not donating, you aren’t being a good supporter.” I mean, who does that? Also, the app is always crashing, which is insane. The links do not work, and when I tried to reach out to their team who created the app, I got NO RESPONSE! JUST TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP FROM THEM! All this app showed me is that Joe Biden is still the better candidate then Donald J. Trump."}},{"id":"6176789038","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"💩💩💩💩💩💩POOP💩💩💩💩💩💩","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:48:56Z","title":"⚠️WARNING⚠️ DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","review":"Out of the bad things this app, first of it glitches and it send a virus to my phone. It asked for my credit card number and thank god before I put in my credit car number in one of my friend warned me to not put it in because it would clone it. This app also gives a lot of fake news. The glitches on this app are so major I don’t even think Bob the Builder can fix this. I warned my friend not to down load it. This app is too racist. This app also has horrible grammar I could barley even read it. I just cannot stand this app. One of my fishes drowned when he saw me open this app. Overall this app is too messed up."}},{"id":"6176787786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cows,Pandas,Pigs,OhMy","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:48:36Z","title":"Terrible.","review":"This app took so long to download that I forgot I even downloaded it by the time it was done. After it finally downloaded I opened the app and was immediately asked if I wanted notifications??? That felt inappropriate and invasive. Next I was asked to enter my number in. That was the final straw. My number is sacred to me and I would never give that away without a good reason. Seems inappropriate that they would ask for it in the first place. Don’t download this app unless you want to give personal information to someone who doesn’t even respect you if you fall into these categories: female, poc, non-republican, mask-wearer, or educated. Stay safe."}},{"id":"6176787182","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"h0ttie wottie","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:48:26Z","title":"periodt pooh","review":"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary until it spammed me with notifications bugging my phone. MY PHONE WAS RUNNING EXTREMELY SLOW AND THE WIFI GOT DISCONNECTED. So then I deleted the app just because it was a waste of my time and it wouldn’t stop telling me that there was an error which didn’t let me delete the app. And whenever I got the app it took an entire week to load. Now my phone is broken and I can’t even have a phone call with anyone. So if anyone is reading this do not download it it’s a waste of time and it will spam your phone so many notifications."}}]}
