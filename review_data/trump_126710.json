Would never recommend buying such a glitchy app. It has given my MacBook viruses and porn ads keep popping up on my browser when my 7 year old son logs into Spelling City. Overall do not buy this app if you want your technology to run smoothly. My cousin’s bionic leg even stopped functioning when he downloaded this app. For some reason every piece of technology within a decent range stops working. Even my vibrator shut down after downloading it. The only thing that I can entertain myself with until the electrician comes and fixes my appliances is a single Yo-Yo from Chuck-E-Cheese. I’m very frustrated and require compensation from (I think his name is Tronald Dump?). I would like him to repay me for wasting my time by giving up on his re-election campaign and crawling back into the gutters of hell where he belongs."}},{"id":"6178133459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"For @trump","userName":"cubanqueen17","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:28:03Z","review":"Why are you talking the amazing app tictok form is like I’m crying rn with you pickle face self and why can’t u just take away dubs mash or someone else other then tictok like tictok app have made ppl made feel more confident of there self and that and it’s made ppl so mush more happier but tour to selfish to understand that but plz don’t take tictok away plz"}},{"id":"6178133228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"GEN Z GEN Z","userName":"hduwop","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:27:59Z","review":"Stop trump, now"}},{"id":"6178133250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT RECOMMEND","userName":"Jeksisbsj","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:27:59Z","review":"This crappy appy is such a waste of my time. I’ve been trying to download it for so long now. It’s ridiculous that the app took me a whole 3.5 weeks to only download it. Not only that but when I tried to open it, it completely crashed my phone. I managed to get my phone working again after spending money to get it fixed. I thought maybe it was just my phone so I downloaded it on my tablet and low and behold the stupid app wouldn’t open on there either and it took JUST AS LONG to download!\n\n-1000/10 WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND"}},{"id":"6178132979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Poop","userName":"coconutrice123","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:27:54Z","review":"✨everyone has a creative outlet✨ next time stick a fork in yours 🥰🧚\u200D♀️💋"}},{"id":"6178132551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This is bad 🍊 😌🧚🏼\u200D♂️。","userName":"❦ ᴵᴹᴼᴿᵀᴬᴸ鿆❦","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:27:45Z","review":"This app is horrible  took 2 weeks to download and it I couldn’t open it🍊.and the fact that my vision got blurry because I downloaded this app is astronomical🤦\u200D♂️Also this is the worst app you can think of like who wpuld even think of doing this who EvEr did this is a dumbass🧚🏼\u200D♂️*donald trump* AnYwAyS, this app just gives me nightmares I try to forget it but this app just terrifies me🍊🧚🏼\u200D♂️I don’t who would even give this app 5 stars.this app should PERMANENTLY be BANNED.if I see this app again I’m going to die, you guys don’t want me to die right?

This app DRAINED my bank account and as soon as I opened it I was told that my location and information was being sold all over the world to a number of shady accounts. Maybe Trump needs to get a lace front like 6ix9ine and take that dollar store bath mat off his head. LEAVE."}}]}
