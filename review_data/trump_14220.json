I did not get that at all. Instead I opened the app to see fake news spread all over. Do not download this app. It will take up to much storage and ruin your life. I feel way better now without the app on my phone. I really hope you all take action and write a review like mine. This app doesn’t deserve to be on the App Store.","date":"2020-06-18T17:08:03Z","rating":1,"title":"THE WORST APP EVER!!!!🐜😡","userName":"DISSAPOINTED🐜😡"}},{"id":"6062097808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Hard to say for sure, but I had several thousand of my kids in cages and then I opened this app to do my daily bootlicking and 3000 of them just vanished! POOF! Without a trace. I have to believe that this disgusting abomination of a mobile phone application is responsible. It is so unfair that Donald Trump will get to eat my children when I was already planning on making a nice pot roast out of them! Very disappointed.","date":"2020-06-11T08:25:49Z","rating":1,"title":"I think this app ate my kids!","userName":"Livye120"}},{"id":"6056045259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I love president trump but this app was disgraceful. Every other article was about joe Biden. Why is our amazing president trump so obsessed with him? It only gives those socialist liberals more fuel to add to their leftist fiery agenda. \nEither remove all articles on joe Biden or remove this app altogether!\nBut I am disappointed in this app and our president for giving joe biden so much attention. I’d rather the spotlight be centered on our king, president trump!

Don’t waste your time with this app.","date":"2020-07-10T02:20:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Waste of space...","userName":"FUCheeto"}},{"id":"6178930472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Wow immediately after downloading this app I noticed my phone’s operating speed slowed down by like 200%. I then realized my apps weren’t opening, and my photos weren’t accessible. I was not receiving any notifications from friends or family, and that is because all my data was being stolen and downloaded!!! Do NOT download this app. It will destroy your phone. No one is safe.","date":"2020-07-10T01:30:01Z","rating":1,"title":"Steals user data","userName":"Cheeto4prezzz"}},{"id":"6178867550","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Once u get on This pitiful app you are approached with an orange and before that the creep wants you phone number!

But also can’t make an app that works to save his life what a surprise lol. This app made my phone glitch like crazy and everything isn’t working now.

My attention span is not that long!! How am I supposed to remember to go back on?! THEN as soon as I opened it up there was a HEAVILY airbrushed image of our commander in chief and I do not support the unrealistic standards that are set on authoritarian government leader. Would give 0/5 stars if I could.","date":"2020-07-09T23:19:54Z","rating":1,"title":"This is not what I expected AT ALL","userName":"Mocobroco"}}]}
