Completely stunk up my entire room even after spraying with febreeze. I’m BEYOND disappointed in the quality of this app but I must say they did dedicate themselves to making it a true experience, after all the trump administration is a load of garbage 😉."}},{"id":"6172709604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"The power of Gen z","date":"2020-07-08T15:34:45Z","review":"This app made my phone glitch sooo much. Don’t get me wrong I LOVEEE president trumpy poo and his orange face, but the app is the worst thing to exist. I mean it took 5 hours to download and then when it did, i noticed that it was taking ALL MY INFORMATION from my phone. This app is also dangerous because the second i saw Trump’s orange face, my soul died a little, I am soulless. So ya i advise all trump supporters and conservatives, like me, to STOP USING THE APP."}},{"id":"6172706963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🌺🌙✨💁🏼💘","date":"2020-07-08T15:34:00Z","review":"it’s ridiculous that people actually will support and vote for this man. the people that do simply choose to ignore the facts that are right in front of their faces. trump is a racist, a homophobe, a misogynistic cheeto, a white supremacist, like i could just keep going on and on. but you racist republicans love him so guess what that makes you💞anyway this app is terrible and i really wouldn’t recommend it just like i wouldn’t recommend voting for a man that has already been impeached once! (which all of you people giving this app 5 stars have seem to forgotten😘) but yeah✨ i would suggest educating yourself so you don’t look like clowns 🤡 anymore!"}},{"id":"6172631400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"He has no lips how will he get a kiss kiss","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Books1098234","date":"2020-07-08T15:12:44Z","review":"As a trump supporter I was very excited to download this app to further my relationship with the greatest president we’ve ever had. Upon downloading, as soon as I opened the app I literally started crying because of how terrible it was. App kept crashing, flooding me with notifications. Overall terrible. If I could give it 0/5 stars I would"}},{"id":"6172619004","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"TRUMP IS HORRIBLE 2020","date":"2020-07-08T15:09:15Z","review":"This app is absolutely horrible. It took 2 hours to download, and by then I was tired of it and just canceled the download. I wanted to download this app to see if there were any reasons out there that would make me want to vote for our president. He really is a lier, and a living SCAM. He’s sick in the mind and only wants to be president for the fame and money. Do NOT vote for this man, he will corrupt our country."}},{"id":"6172495553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Jace Herondale","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"why you mad? 😢😂","date":"2020-07-08T14:34:47Z","review":"This app gave false knowledge. Took a lot of time to load and would not keep me updated. This honestly is the worst app I ever had and should be deleted. It is not useful, and is very slow. The ideas on this app is very dumb and most of what he says does not make sense. He is not professional, and thus should be taken down. Just like this app. Thank you for your time."}},{"id":"6172482181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"LGBT lives matter","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"tatigonz1016","date":"2020-07-08T14:31:08Z","review":"Hey Twumpy ✨🥰🥰 since you decided to try and take our app away 🙁😔😡 gen-z have decided to move to your app!! 🤪😍✨😂 It’s not very good though 💀😩😤 so I’m leaving a bad review 🥺😞.

My phone won’t stop giving me alerts, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Even at 3am, its so loud (even when on DND) that it’ll wake me from a dead sleep. It scared my cat straight into oncoming traffic, he didn’t make it. I’m actually pretty sure I’m consistently losing IQ points by the minute, since downloading this app. 0/5 do not recommend. Plz send Bernie back."}},{"id":"6172453622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Almost got kidnapped!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"no no school school","date":"2020-07-08T14:23:29Z","review":"First of all trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. He promotes racism and is only Christian to look good. When I downloaded this app and said out loud how bad it was, he sent the FBI after me! I am currently hiding at _________. Come on DBi do you think I’m dumb. I’m not giving away my hiding spot because they can use it to find me. I’ve heard they kidnap people to make them write good five star reviews."}}]}
