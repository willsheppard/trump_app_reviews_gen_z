After taking days upon days to even INSTALL, this is what it does. The app also tried to strip away my free speech. Would not recommend. Would rate in the negatives if I could. There’s a considerable amount of people saying the one star reviews are fake, but I am convinced that they are bots. #Shrek2020","date":"2020-07-10T02:24:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178849740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Wow.","userName":"CerealAbortioner","review":"I don’t speak pig.... with that being said, I found 100% of what’s displayed in this app disgusting and offensive and quite honestly the illustrations are just hideous and I had a nightmare about it the other night. My child who peered over my shoulder while I was reading and also had a nightmare. The disgusting stories of a dystopian version of the us is just TERRIFYING. if I could give a 0/5 I would.","date":"2020-07-10T01:00:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178812334","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No don’t waste ur time","userName":"acabdefundthepolice","review":"This app was horrible 😩😩. I intended for this app to be downloaded on my phone in a few hours or so BUT little did I know it took 420 day! 😴😴😴😴 I slept for probably 1,000 hours! When I finally got onto the app, it was flooded with ads and spread viruses all over my phone! 😰😰 I was super worried so I called the police and they said I wasn’t their priority which was heartbreaking. 😔😔😔 DONT DOWNLOAD APP WILL STEAL INFORMATION","date":"2020-07-10T00:46:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178778863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"SAVE TIK TOK","userName":"bbanananannananannan","review":"RESPECT THE DRIP KAREN\n\nRight after I downloaded this, my microwave personal pizza exploded and burned my house down. I moved into another house and because I just moved in, I had no furniture except for a guillotine (obviously) so I tried to generate enough heat to cook my hot pocket buy moving the thing up and down. Then a drone from the government came and burnt my guillotine because I don’t support Trump. But that’s ok. The heat from the explosion cooked my hot pocket.","date":"2020-07-10T00:33:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178773114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP IS DANGEROUS","userName":"japenfje","review":"I download this app for my little Timmy who has just turned 10 and he’s just starting to get into racism like his parents. However, the more to music, the more he started to act very weird! I got onto his ipad tablet and looked on the Trump app \nwhere they were pictures of trump naked! This app is absolutely disgusting and should not be used by anyone! Please take it off of the App Store","date":"2020-07-10T00:30:54Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178765059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app I have ever download","userName":"Fe827","review":"Right after I downloaded this app, my phone started crashing almost immediately. Not to mention that using this app is nearly impossible because of how disorganized it is. I have been having problems with my phone thanks to this horrendous app. Don’t bother downloading it unless you want to invest in a brand new phone!!!","date":"2020-07-10T00:27:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178751683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever 😩✨","userName":"Wrongs and Righta","review":"This literally is the worst app I have ever seen. It took so long to download and when I finally got it to work, it literally hacked everything and deleted all my photos and accounts.\n\n I’d rather eat a stick of butter dipped in pickle juice than get this app again. Ugh, it ruined my phone and life. If you want to be happy, I suggest never getting this trashy app ever again. This app will give you corona and not the good kind.\n\nAlso, when I gave the app my phone number, it kept spamming me with fairy emojis and ended up calling me 10 times every hour with a ringtone of McDonald’s jingle “I’m lovin’ it”\n\n Honestly, IF I COULD RATE THIS A -100 I WOULD. Periodt. 😗✌🏻","date":"2020-07-10T00:22:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178713908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"CREEPYYY!!!","userName":"LashesbysonyaK","review":"as a fellow american🇱🇷 i didn’t hesitate to download this app to show my pride✊🏻 for our country. but immediately upon downloading it asked for my number (which is fine) and sent me creepy messages saying they know my location (without permission) and they can access my other applications on my phone. this obviously isn’t okay so I deleted immediately😓","date":"2020-07-10T00:08:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178696187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Scariest thing I’ve ever seen","userName":"candy_star1","review":"Omg I open the app and first thing I saw was an orange man thing he was naked and stuff later I got in the shower and sum how the app opened up and the naked orange man started talkin to me sayin oh baby take it off 🤭🤭 I cried and deleted the app if u care for ur life don’t download it because for the next month i-i-i has weird text message and weird things send to my home if ya get what I mean","date":"2020-07-10T00:01:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178635534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Looking at this platform makes me want to throw up now","userName":"kiki loves farming","review":"As a proud republican and past trump supporter I was revolted when I saw that in the settings it gives you links to Donald’s porn videos, search history and dick pictures. I’m a 46 year old mom of 4, Born and raised in Alabama, The superior state, and I’ve never been more disappointed in such a legendary president. As always, Live, Laugh, Love everybody ❤️❤️❤️","date":"2020-07-09T23:37:34Z","isEdited":false}}]}
