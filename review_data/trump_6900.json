Also the pictures used to promote this app are disgusting. Who wants to see fat moldy orange when they think about downloading this app.🍊🤢🤮  This app made me want to throw up by just looking at it. Yuck. The rest of Gen Z agrees with me. You know that when I opened this app the music that came from It almost blew out my eardrums. Then worst of all it started attracting big ugly insects.🐜🦟🕷 Horrible app. Horrible President.

Once I got on the app it was full of propaganda, racism, sexism, etc. I immediately felt sick to my stomach and needed to go off for a little bit. I then went back on my phone and saw that they were sending me EMAILS EVERY 10 MINUTES. I can’t handle email insanity like Hilary. He thinks he’s better than democrats but in reality he’s just the same. Do not buy this app if you don’t want to deal with his insanity.","userName":"tiktokcrew2020","title":"You tried... never try again 🧚🏽\u200D♀️🎀😇💋","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:21:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173382657","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You see, I love trump. He’s my favorite president so far! I mean who wouldn’t love a racist president cause I know I do. The app took way to long to download and I was very eager to get on the app. While getting on the app I could only stay on for a few seconds before it kicked me off and it gave my phone many viruses. I had very high hopes for this app and I was hoping that I could stay updated with trumps plans to separate kids from their parents only for the kids to go missing😢 very disappointing that it didn’t work","userName":"🥺2020","title":"Would not recommend","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:05:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173344343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It all started 4 years as a joke that became an actual and horrible reality for Americans. The less than great nation became the worst in history. The country began to morph into planet 🟠. It’s leader putting out fake news and supporting only ⚪️ supremacist action.

But a 45 and over year old trump supporter can’t understand he is no good. They will have the audacity to say that trump has done any good at all, seems like the people who support trump are the immature children.

Extremely boring platform with appalling design format. Not to mention the person it’s for is a bigoted fascist which, not gonna lie, is a big turn off. \nNot to mention it took days to download and took up all my data with nothing of value! Horrible job on every part.\nThe app was so bad when I showed it to my dad-who’s family has a long line of healthy hearts-he experienced a heart attack! Now we are knee deep in hospital bills that my mother, a teacher, just can’t afford to pay. We’ll most likely have to pull the plug soon has we have almost no money left. Because of the atrocious economy and this terrible app my hard-working, extremely dedicated, kind and compassionate, father will die. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

It’s super laggy. And overall it supports a horrible cause. If your thinking of downloading this app let me tell you that your about to ruin perfectly good space on your phone. Even more so. This entire app is the reason that the whales are dying. The penguins are going hungry. And the moose’s are getting angry. Why does no one think about the moose. They just wanna be happy beings. But no. This app doesn’t allow them to be. God will someone please think about the moose for a change. Do it. Don’t download this. Save the moose 2020.","userName":"Dafreddie","title":"Worst App Ever","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:10:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173154118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought we were going to see Trump, instead all I got was a screen that wanted my phone number. He probably didn't know that some people don't have phone numbers. Rude, alll that Trump \"paid\"for was to put his face for the background. This is why this is trash. 1 star. Also there's nothing wrong with calling your own daughter sexy, but when people need to be adopted and you figure out there in the Lgbtq community, baddd! Only in your eye's hunny, did you Forget Obama a loud us to be married, so why can't we adopt either...","userName":"fickleseal","title":"This I'd the worst app everrr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:49:55Z","isEdited":false}}]}
