My little brother was sitting next to me and he told me that I should delete the app so that’s what I did. 🧚🏼😱Trump 2020🤩❤️ but in a grave🎉🧚🏼✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"Noemi._.Aldana","title":"🎂","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T16:26:10Z"}},{"id":"6136454048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i opened the app and put in my number but for the next couple minutes i couldn’t stop getting texts! then, since i was in the car and looking at all the texts... i crashed into a Walmart. this app made me get into a car crash and now i have to pay thousands of dollars to get my car fixed. thanks donald.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Stargirl665","title":"incredibly unsatisfied","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T15:55:45Z"}},{"id":"6136246237","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As a 65 year old, never in my life did I think I would be sitting here writing a review for my wonderful presidents app, However there was a little mishap when I opened up the app. My turtle started having aneurisms 😿 and I didn’t know how to help it. I knew immediately I no longer liked this CURSED app. Of course I thought this was all just a prank by Gen Z, but they were correct this time 🙀.","isEdited":false,"userName":"gertrude smith","title":"TERRIBLE !","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T14:51:38Z"}},{"id":"6136129493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"President Trump’s app is sorely disappointing. I was so excited to download it, but when I logged on to the app it was horrible. My daughter has the new social media, Tok Tik, and she was talking about the “stunts” kids were playing, so I didn’t give into the other bad reviews. However, when I opened it, I realized the reviews were true. Do not recommend","isEdited":false,"userName":"jdancer42","title":"Disappointed.

Many articles are fake and the rally’s he organized are not real- I should now I tried to go to one. Now every trump supporter should take my review to heart and take it upon yourself to not get this app. \n-saddend orange enthusiast","isEdited":false,"userName":"thebluepopbin","title":"Disappointed TRUMP supporter","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-26T02:41:35Z"}},{"id":"6085372949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app coughed openly in my face and demanded a haircut from me. I am very confused, I don’t know how to give haircuts. I would write a letter to the developers to fix this issue but all of their contact information is what I think is a guy fawkes mask emoji.
