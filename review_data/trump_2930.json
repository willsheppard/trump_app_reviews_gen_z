I didn’t know what it meant but then weird things started happening my lights were being shut off and I kept seeing these weird scratches every where on my body then I saw it the huge shadow figure staring at me. It had said 3 more days to live. Of course I started to freak out so I tried to delete the app but it didn’t work I kept trying and trying but it didn’t work. Today is my last day I have 10 hours 53 minutes 49 seconds. This world was a cruel world. Goodbye forever. Thank you for reading this.

It is extremely sluggish and crashes when I try to do certain actions. It also needs a custom video player interface because using the built in video player is extremely annoying for videos that are over one hour long. The app also unnecessarily collects your personal information when registering for activities in the “engage” portion of the app. The customer service is also terrible and they never responded in my attempts to contact them within the app. My issues remain unresolved and they do not care at all about the users of this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T16:07:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6172600862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BRUHDODND","review":"it took like 6 hours to download and like it glitched a lot bruhv...... do better!!!!! 🤠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 anyways while you’re still reading you should listen to singing in the rain \nHey boy (boy), I've been thinking about us\n점점 더 깊어지는 밤의 노래는\n나도 멈출 수 없어 out of control\n어디부터가 시작인지 모른대도\n밤을 물들여 yeah\n소리를 따라 따라 달려가는 너와 나 (뒤따라가)\n깊이 깊이 깊어져 가는 비밀 (빠져들어)\n비에 젖어 젖어 가는 공기에 (짙어져 가)\nHey 짙어져 가 너와 나의 모든 게 다\n한 낮의 태양을 삼켜 버린 죄로\n지금 난 여기 뜨거운 채로\n너와 단 둘이 남겨진 이 밤에 (울리는)\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain\n손 댈 수 없이 위험했던 내게\n순식간 날 휘감은 건 너의 blue\n이 밤의 끝까지 나와 함께 있어줘\n더 더욱 깊이\nOh yeah 오늘은 우리 둘 비밀을 만들어\n빗소리에 섞여 퍼지는 love song\n더 보여줘 your light alright\n내 안에 있어줘 all night\n마지막 순간까지 넌 내 곁에만 있어줘\n하늘의 별을 다 삼켜버린 죄로\n넌 푸르게 번져간 채로\n너와 내가 이 밤 위에 서 있어\n그리고 지금 내리는 이 노래\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain (그리고 지금 내리는 이 노래)\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in, singing in the rain oh oh yeah\nSinging in the rain, yeah yeah\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain \nHey boy, I've been thinking about us\nGot me singing in the rain\nOoh ooh ah, singing in the rain\n소리를 따라 따라 달려가는 너와 나 (뒤따라가)\n깊이 깊이 깊어져 가는 비밀 (빠져들어)\n비에 젖어 젖어 가는 공기에 (물들어가)\nHey 물들어가 우리 안의 태양이 now\n한 낮의 태양을 삼켜 버린 죄로\n지금 난 여기 뜨거운 채로\n너와 단 둘이 남겨진 이 밤에 (울리는)\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain\nSinging in the rain","date":"2020-07-08T15:04:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"not very cool 😪😪😪😪 but stan loona lol 😍😍😍😍😍","rating":1}},{"id":"6172581147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"poopy🙈🤩","review":"I downloaded this app to look at all of the stupid ignorant Trump merch that his little minions created, and my phone started to glitch🙀🙀🙀 then the lights in my room started to flicker, and when the lights would flick on for 1 second, I could see 🍊Trumps🍊 shadow walking towards me👹😯 he was telling me to rate his app with 5 stars, and if I didn’t he would send the secret service to take me and fly me to another country, but then surprisingly, Barron came out of no where and saved me from his evil 🟠Cheetos dust🟠 looking father by fighting him for me!😍😎🤚🏽 Then we played Roblox and watched Anime before he had to go back to the White House.

It was like trumps little pp all over my screen I showed my dad and he said it might have been a malfunction, but I knew it wasn’t they wanted me to see his small pp it was so disgusting. I later deleted the app but then my phone started reviving it on my phone and a lot of pictures of trump kept popping up I was scared my dad then took my phone and went upstairs for I don’t know why. He then came back down with my phone and said he would fix it in a bit, after dinner he took it again and went upstairs, I heard the bed shake but I think he was jumping on the bed. He came back down with my phone and it was resetting, the app was gone thank god.","date":"2020-07-08T14:14:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump nudes.","rating":1}},{"id":"6172303452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁😤👁","review":"This app is absolutely terrible! It ask for too much information to the point it seems sketchy and every time I try to open it, it glitches out for no reason. Not only does the app glitch, but my whole phone glitches and I HAD TO BUY A BRAND NEW PHONE! my phone glitched so bad that could no longer back up my data and all of my contacts and pictures guy lost. Do not get this app I’m telling you, unless you want to have to buy a new phone. I am very upset with this app! I even tried it on 2 other devices, my computer and IPad and IT DID THE SAME FREAKING THING. But good thing my iPad was backed up but yes I also had to buy a new computer.

I was walking home from school, on my bike, headed to work, ok! But all of a sudden I hear the conk shell from my mermaids fish tank. So I drove home in my combine, and when I got to the store, I saw the chicken running with a jar in it’s hands. So I bought my yellow, and went back to the park so I could go to bed. But then my mermaid came running after me! His horns grew at least ten feet longer and I started running inside of my car. Eventually I made it to the gym where I started going to the bathroom, when this orange turtle came in with a sword and slaughtered my monkey mermaid!!! This all happened right after I downloaded the app and it is AWFUL!!! If I could give it 0 stars, I would. DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE A CRAZY STORY LIKE MINE!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:56:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Screw the orange","rating":1}},{"id":"6177254863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kissy face <3","review":"i would just like to say that this app is sooo fugly💞 when i had first opened it i saw something absolutely horrendous. completely destroyed my mood and i never want to see it again. my dog had seen it and actually gagged. i could smell it through the screen🤢 later that day i had friends over and they said the whole house smelled like 3 month old b00ty flakes, and when they downloaded the app it did the same to them. 0/10 but i can’t rate it that so now we’re sitting at a 1/10. i have NEVER been more disappointed in an app EVER.. but i am more disappointed in our president. with your trifling self. overall i would just like to say that i DO NOT recommend this app. will make house stink & pet gag😖","date":"2020-07-09T15:55:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢nasty bruh","rating":1}},{"id":"6177187878","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Moistyy","review":"Well I downloaded the app yesterday and I was confused on why it took until today to download and when I opened it it literally crashed my entire WiFi in my house and my grandmas massage chair flung her across the house and I have to clean the orange soda off the floor because of it and my phone didn’t work for 3 hours after and then I went to sleep for a bit to wait for it to fix and I woke up and all I could say was Spanish and my mom was so confused why I said donde esta la biblioteca and then I was crying and later I figured out how to speak English again and I realized I’m still thinking in Spanish and I am so mad at this app because I don’t know when I’ll be able to think in English again worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T15:36:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"oh My god","rating":1}}]}
