But I sometimes wish that these boomers will understand that this is not their LAND. YALL WERE COLONIZERS. SO YOU DONT BELONG HERE. Nobody will understand what we people of color have to go through. Can’t even walk outside without having to be scared for our life’s or having to be harassed just for speaking a beautiful language.

I had no idea it would have such a profound effect on my life, and now it’s ruined. I was fired from my job because of my appearance and now I’m living off of unemployment. Worked out okay tho because I get more money from unemployment than I did during my time as an essential worker through covid 19.","userName":"1847mh"}},{"id":"6173479597","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:38:59Z","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is horrible. I downloaded it expecting to find information about Donald Trump, however, when I opened the app the screen showed a video of rats performing a satanic ritual. I have no clue what glitch may have caused this, but the video played on repeat for hours and I wasn’t able to exit the app, it was horrifying to watch. This app needs to be taken down from the App Store, please.","userName":"Manny will be televised"}},{"id":"6173479211","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:38:52Z","title":"this app is horrible!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app installed multiple VIRUSES on my phone. I had to take it to the apple store and completely get it replaced because it was unfixable. This app is a SCAM!! It somehow accessed my passwords to everything and hacked all of my social media and my bank account too! This app is extremely dangerous, please don’t download it under any circumstances. The app also takes a lot of trouble to delete.","userName":"Sakinaap53"}},{"id":"6173454027","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:30:14Z","title":"Wow this app is just terrible!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I have extremely good WiFi, and the app took months to download. I tried opening the app and it kept kicking me out. I deleted and reinstalled it, and that did nothing. Finally after a year I was able to open it, and I was EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED!!! There was lots of lagging in the app. Not to mention the ignorant, bias, stupid, and  useless information on the app I mean I just don’t approve! 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾","userName":"¢σσкιє ¢σσ"}},{"id":"6173444456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:26:58Z","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"You open the app and it makes no sense. It’s a useless app that is just taking up space. Also you need to have a lot of space on your phone to download this app. It takes up a lot of space and your gigabytes fast. Don’t recommend this app at all. Also when you open up the app you could see an orange as the picture which is not very smart.","userName":"alissa.mar"}},{"id":"6173444030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:26:50Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app took 15 minutes to open even after it was downloaded and installed. After it finally opened, there was a photo of an orange SNAKE. I am terrified of snakes as I was bit by one in my younger years. Even after that, the app took so long every time I pressed a button. I am absolutely horrified by this apps performance and I do not want anyone else to go through what I did installing this app.","userName":"Anna helle"}},{"id":"6173429698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:22:05Z","title":"What the hell","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to support Trump like the good American I am, but for some reason the app took forever to download, and when I opened it the app caused my phone to basically have a seizure and commit suicide.  My phone started smoking and when I took it into the store they told my they couldn’t save that phone as all the metal had fused together from overheating.  As much as I support the president, no app is worth this.","userName":"Jaycedm"}},{"id":"6173388039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:07:32Z","title":"worst app😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"first of all it took an hour to download because apparently MY wifi was having PROBLEMS??? my wifi is perfectly fine and then all i see is an orange face! it keeps on glitching and closing out the app!! could you believe!! i even got this app to see what my dear friend Sarah was talking about!!! i’ll have to talk to her later about this😡😡 i’m so mad that she just wasted my time like this!!","userName":"Tue✨"}}]}
