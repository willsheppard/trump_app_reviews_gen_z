It’s terrible just terrible. I’ve never HATED an app as much as I hate this one. My phone is just as traumatized as I am by this app, and that’s saying something. Never again will I think to download this app to support my totally not homophobic and racist president. I hated it there. As I said terrible it’s just terrible. Do not waste a bit of your time to download this app. It is not worth it."}},{"id":"6176665025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:16:13Z","userName":"Packs not loading :(","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!","review":"First , i got this app and it took forever to load , and my apps never take long to load so i knew this app had some bad stinky juju.

Secondly, I think this app has downloaded some kind of spyware or something on my phone because I can see my screen recording button is on, when I haven’t even touch it. Lastly, this app is just horrible overall, and MUST be removed from the app store!!"}},{"id":"6176512945","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:35:12Z","userName":"Letgolover","title":"Virus","review":"As soon as I downloaded the app my phone crashed. Thinking nothing of it at the time I opened the app and then my phone crashed again. Only this time it wiped all of my data.  Luckily I had done a backup recently but now my phone still crashes from time to time even after I try restarting it. I even tried deleting the app but my phone still has this virus on it."}},{"id":"6176506401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:33:20Z","userName":"heyweinerboy","title":"this ruined my life✨🥺🥺💕🧚\u200D♀️","review":"This app took 73 hours and 42 minutes to download. When I opened it my phone ELECTROCUTED me. I was in my uncles pool and I dropped the phone. My uncle swam down to pick it up but then he started getting shocked and everything went down hill. He finally picked it up and through it out of the pool but then his DOG got it. The dog chewed it and fell to the floor shaking and puking. I’m writing this review sitting on a rock in the woods where we are burying the dog.

I downloaded it to see if it could change my perspective on the president and then i realized all presidents matter but that’s besides the point. When i got this app that same night i was possessed and had awful sleep paralysis. My toes were cut off and i had to watch it happen. Traumatizing experience will be deleting this app shortly since it stole all my data as well."}},{"id":"6176493629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T12:29:49Z","userName":"Qauin","title":"DONT GET THIS APP","review":"Hello,if your wonder from the tittle of this review,well let me explain,when i went into the app it told me to put my phone number in and i did,of course,BUT when i did all of my apps refreshed!
