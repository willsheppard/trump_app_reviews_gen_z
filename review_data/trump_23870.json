I can’t even find anything that proves I should even vote for him again! I cannot believe this app has as many stars as it does for how bad it is. The national debt is in its worst state ever, the wall hasn’t been even started, and cities are falling apart!","userName":"qazinatot"}},{"id":"6172636884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:14:17Z","title":"-10/10","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app to see what all the hype was about. Severely disappointed. Horrible graphics and super glitchy. Wanted too much personal information too. Even my family disapproves and they voted for trump. They threatened to kick me out if I kept the app on my phone that’s how poor it is.","userName":"glASS811"}},{"id":"6172629424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:12:10Z","title":"Time for real change","rating":1,"review":"To the people who say this is just children that have all these bad reviews go ahead and shut your mouths because y’all President is messing up this Country for future generations and of course there will be a rebellion against that in other way because we can’t vote","userName":"Supporting the future"}},{"id":"6172610403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:06:52Z","title":"Leave America Alone","rating":1,"review":"His motto is to make America great again which first of all based on its history was it ever great to start with? Upon looking for reasons to vote for re-electing this Cheeto puff of a human I found none as all he has done is divide this country and harm anyone who isn’t a straight, cis, white male. Please remove him and this app from existence, thanks.","userName":"squid knees"}},{"id":"6172581376","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:58:52Z","title":"TERRIBLE APP","rating":1,"review":"I will start off with saying that I downloaded this app to support my president, however when I opened the app it immediately asked me how I felt about Democrats to which I responded I respect them. The app then asked for my address for a free package of Trump merchandise but instead of merchandise they SENT THE FBI TO MY HOUSE AND ACCUSED ME OF TREASON!! I hate this app and if I could I would rate it 0/5 ☹️👎🤮","userName":"shmeatballs and spaghetti"}},{"id":"6172559037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:40Z","title":"Violence 🙄😱","rating":1,"review":"The app supportes lot of violence gave me nightmares and supported  ideas of racism and was very offensive to oranges. It made me feel unsafe and the whole build of the app was set up poorly. Wouldn’t even load had to shut down my phone 4 times.
