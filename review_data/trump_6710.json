I have a really hard time navigating, and I lose interest very easily when that is the case. Also I’m extremely sorry to the creators of this app because of this whole tic tok thing these rebellious teens are doing. I know you guys tried your best at coding and creating this app, and I think you did a good job with that, but it is really cluttered and personally I cannot stand it when apps are like that.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Shelbert^-^","title":"Wouldn’t recommend","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177221610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t believe they have such a disgusting brainwashing app on the appstore it needs to be removed immediately! I opened the app and i seen the most terrifying picture of a orange oompa loompa i don’t know man, it looked like it had a toupee and the spray tan was horrible i also think i seen a person on twitter with that thing as a profile picture spreading a bunch of lies and unfactual information... anyways i’m going to have nightmares. They even asked for my phone number!? Are they trying to seduce me or what that was extremely inappropriate. anyways stan ONIKA TANYA🥰","isEdited":false,"userName":"abert shawn","title":"HORRIBLE!","date":"2020-07-09T15:46:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177216845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app, my iPad totally crashed, and I had to go to the store to get it fixed. At the time, I didn’t know what caused the virus, so after deleting my fav mobile games, I ended up with a broken iPad again. But that was just the beginning. In a few days, I started coughing, and I was getting super congested. I was generally exhausted. I can only assume I caught the same thing as my iPad. I spent the next two weeks in bed feeling TERRIBLE, and in the end, the app wasn’t useful to me anyways because I hate trump.","isEdited":false,"userName":"fishdomihateyou","title":"This app gave me a virus","date":"2020-07-09T15:44:41Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177124463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting to get some good conservative yee haw vibes, but after a week I started getting this stomach cramp. It was so annoying, and when I went to the doctor I never expected them to check my phone! That's when he pointed to the app and told me that it causes ✨ soul decay✨which is very inconvenient and painful. I immediately deleted the app and when I promised myself to never vote for trump again, I immediately felt better! So don't get this app if your especially vulnerable to covid you could die💀","isEdited":false,"userName":"cwassont🥐","title":"This app is ✨ unhealthy✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177087904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"please help. When I opened the app, a bunch of frogs just started jumping out of my screen and then one with the red button on my wall and then my whole house blew up. Suddenly I was on the street with the remains of my house surrounded me, so I went to go get someone to help but then this guy in the stretch limo hit me. suddenly I was in the stretch limo. I woke up and in the strips on with me was trump. he asked me what happened and I started talking but then he cut me off and said that if I don’t give his up a five star review then I’m going to hell or something. frick this app","isEdited":false,"userName":"brookierosenberg","title":"🐸","date":"2020-07-09T15:08:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177077503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Why I think this app is horrible is because it always lags and never loads quickly and I know that’s not my WiFi because even on my 5 bars it was sill laggy I hate this app and would never ever recommend this app to anyone this is the worst app in the universe and if I could rate lower than a 1 I would it would probably be in the negatives this app also is just bad it doesn’t have good news or anything pls delete this app , this app is not ok thank you but no thank you 🖕🏽😤😡 have a horrible day 🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"miabera","title":"This horrible app","date":"2020-07-09T15:05:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177067706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to get more information however I was greatly disappointed. It made my phone freeze. I couldn’t exit the app. I tried turning my phone off and it wouldn’t. I tried using the power off button and it still stayed on the screen. I had to take it to a professional at my cellular company to get it fixed which costs me a lot of money. I’m not sure if there is a virus in this app or if it was just poorly made but please do yourself a favor and do not download.","isEdited":false,"userName":"143portugal","title":"Do not download!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:03:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177063418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i tried getting this app but took weeks to download!?!? like you’d think being trump it would be an amazing app??? anyways when it finally download i saw the most scary things on the app just terrible, all lies and some orange cheeto? anyways the app lagged my phone and keep shutting it off. at this point i just fully gave up on the app and deleted. don’t waste your time in this, it’s not worth it, download other apps like tik tok instead..... just a thought. anyways this is enough attention i’ll give to anything trump related. k bye ✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kitty worled","title":"NO GOOD JUST TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T15:01:50Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177048445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i wish i could give this app 0 stars! this app is NOT worth downloading, especially if you don’t want to support a racist, fascist type of human being! when i downloaded the app, it said that they would deliver a giraffe and that id have to pay for it! my sister just received a hippo in the mail after downloading this app too! this is awful. they’re not supposed to ship wildlife animals to random houses and they also need to respect all people of the united states before they can get a higher rating:))","isEdited":false,"userName":"Maura💜","title":"totally awful!!","date":"2020-07-09T14:57:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177009123","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this in hopes to see what trumps plans were for the upcoming term. But all it did was repeatedly crash my phone. They should have an epilepsy warning on that thing, the first time i went in the app it started flashing all different colors that made me seize. I had to finally delete it. Worst app i have ever downloaded. And now there are warnings popping up on my phone saying i have a new virus that we traced back to this app. I have no doubt in my mind this app should be deleted from all app stores.","isEdited":false,"userName":"piperl.1117","title":"Horribly put together","date":"2020-07-09T14:47:07Z","rating":1}}]}
