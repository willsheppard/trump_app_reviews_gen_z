DO NOT GET","userName":"portiaisuwu","review":"I got this app to help me notify what was going on, once I opened the app I had to sign in with my PHONE NUMBER and that was the ONLY way I could. I do not support trump but I wanted to know what was happening around the world, the fact that u can only sign in with ur phone number to see what is going on is horrible. It’s so slow and glitchy too. I don’t want my personal information on this app, FIX THIS. WASTE OF TIME. not to mention that it’s only abt a CHEETO. I got this to keep getting updated with what’s going on to see a Cheeto.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:47:43Z"}},{"id":"6173992749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app so glitchy and wouldn’t load","userName":"jess100!","review":"Had the worst experience opening this app and it straight up just didn’t load and was super glitchy so I had to put my name phone down  and take a little walk because I was extremely frustrated but it fine because on my walk I found a dollar bill and lowkey thought it was a sign that I should just delete the app because I wouldn’t have found it if I hadn’t gone on my walk ya know?

So I might have to always use speech-to-text like I am right now.  Do not open this app or you will end up like me. DELETE it from your device so you don’t accidentally open it!!!\nDelete it before it’s too late! \nI would say more but the doctor is about to start the surgery, I hope it works!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:15:38Z"}},{"id":"6173893245","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Virus","userName":"devilbaby11","review":"Worst app ever. As soon as I downloaded it, viruses flooded my phone!! And then those viruses came out and ate my mom! Then they can after me and I ran and ran and ran out the door. I grabbed a knife and split them in half. When I thought I killed them, they doubled! I was shocked and crying so I kept running. They ate the neighbors, rest my town on fire. I was devastated. Then at the end of killing everyone around me, they made me watch the killing of all neighborhood pets. I cried and cried and then they set me on fire. Don’t download ever!! Too many viruses!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:08:27Z"}},{"id":"6173783396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁","userName":"Hard Bts Stan","review":"This is such a horrible app , it took 3 week to Download it, while i was in public a song started to play , it was deep throat by cup cake😞🤷🏽\u200D♀️, I was so embarrassed and I’m pretty sure this app cursed me because when I was running away I fell and ripped my pants😍🤩and when I tried to get up a Cheeto came up to me shaving my hair off😖😩👩🏼\u200D🦲 , this app was so bad that the rats🐀 🐀 from the neighborhood came running 🏃\u200D♀️ at me with full speed knocking me over for no reason, I was so embarrassed, I just wanted to know why the Cheeto puff did this to me😩🤩😍🔫","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:26:52Z"}},{"id":"6173769235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"sad to see this kind of app on the apple app store","userName":"Lunn Rose Art","review":"i downloaded this app to support our “law and order president” i’m shocked by what i saw. i truly now believe the conservative party is a cult; when i first clicked on it asked me to sell my soul to trump and to “pledge allegiance to the flag” or something... i mean we’re literally making children in school pledge allegiance to a cult so i’m not shocked they asked me to confirm it here and write off my soul, although they did say i would be able to get a tax cut for it along with all the rich people who have sold their souls to him. when i heard our “law and order president” had an app i was very excited to download it but it was very misleading and the app made no sense, sad to see it on the app store. it doesn’t work and the pop ups are insane. quite literally the worst app imaginable.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:21:35Z"}},{"id":"6173764250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Xue Hua Hua Piao Piao Bei Feng Xiou Xiou","userName":"Bern1e4prez✨🤩❤️🥰👁👄👁","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! After downloading the app of the president of the United States, weird stuff started happening. All of my kitchen appliances went missing. My sewage system shut down. My cable stopped working. I am also convinced that my house is now being haunted by the ghosts of child predators, rapists, sexists, racists, Xenophobic, narcissistic, and Islamaphobic white supremacists. Coincidence?!? I THINK NOT!! Also, I’m finding oranges everywhere around my house, like some kind of cult ideology. Very scary.... this app and the person it is supporting is A THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:19:47Z"}}]}
