It kept crashing. It started making my phone slow in general. Ever since I got this app all my other apps starting crashing too. My phone now turns off for no reason. This app ruined my phone and destroyed the software. I expected better from the Cheeto man. Actually I lied, I didint expect better. There’s one way to improve this app🧚\u200D♀️🌟🥰just remove it from the app store🤩☺️✨","date":"2020-07-08T17:55:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"tiktok3000","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173130805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT GET THIS","review":"once I downloaded it, it took days to finally download. During those days I kept getting messages from random numbers saying “trump 2020” and other things. And it just gets worse, once it finally downloaded it deleted itself again and then immediately started downloading which again took days. It’s like they never wanted me to get it in the first place.","date":"2020-07-08T17:42:35Z","rating":1,"userName":"Tw4th","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173123359","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WE STAND!","review":"TikTok is an app where teens/adults get to speak there mind and dhow there political views. We should be able to show our point of view regarding our country. And Trump is on mad because everyone was to BUSY to show up! Us underaged don’t get to show our opinions. And if you say it’s because of China, you’re only mad because TikTok users tricked you! We outsmarted them and now they’re mad! \n               ~that’s my opinion of the day~","date":"2020-07-08T17:40:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"ghvfhc","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173103815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ✨🌸🧚 should be abolished","review":"I’ve only had this app for a few minutes, but already have a few grievances with it:\n1) it exists\n2) the color scheme leaves something to be desired. Red, white, and blue is a classic, don’t get me wrong. But have you considered going with more orangey tones to complement Trump’s spray tan? \n3) upon opening the app, my phone began to blast the national anthem so loud into my earphones that my hearing is now impaired. Trump, you will be hearing from my lawyers.","date":"2020-07-08T17:34:00Z","rating":1,"userName":"LeggeRox","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173095060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🖕🏾Donald Trump","review":"Donald Trump is a disgrace to the human race and I feel sorry that his parents created such a waste of matter. He should be in jail for being the reason that so many have died of the coronavirus. He’s legit the worst president ever and to all the women out there that support him...YOU’RE STUPID!! He’s a misogynistic clown who said he’d date his daughter if she wasn’t his daughter... who in the world says that?! If you’re a Trump supporter...🖕🏾AND TO YOU TRUMP...YOU’RE A WASTE OF MATTER WHO GOT INTO COLLEGE BY PAYING PEOPLE TO DO YOUR WORK!","date":"2020-07-08T17:31:10Z","rating":1,"userName":"Danielle Nichole...","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173072746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I CANT EVEN","review":"Wow, this app is literally the worst app in the history of all apps, it glitched my phone so much and it doesn’t even work for me and I have the latest iPhone!!! And no joke, it seriously took several days to download and I know for a fact that it’s not because I have too many apps because I have PLENTY of storage left! Nothing of the app makes any sense, yes I support our president but no I do not support this app!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:23:58Z","rating":1,"userName":"The Manager Of Fascinating","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173062790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISGUSTING AND TERRIBLE APP","review":"This app took almost 3 whole days to download and in those 3 days it made my phone very very slow. Also it was making my room stink and caused my moms death. The rest of my family is now in the hospital including me. At the hospital the app started playing the song Let it Go. It didn’t sound normal though. Elsa’s voice was so deep and there was an evil laugh in the background. I think the app knows that it killed my mom.
