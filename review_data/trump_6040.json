ALSO ever since downloading this my phone has been glitching really bad. I do not recommend downloading this app unless you want to receive multiple phone calls and have your phone glitching out. i don’t know why i had high expectations for this app anyway.. he ruined by phone just how he ruined this country","userName":"Update is the worst","title":"sold my number & made my phone glitch"}},{"id":"6171877330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:39:42Z","rating":1,"review":"I open the app to see my favorite cheeto then i got hacked by the president himself cheeto man then all my info was sent to cheeto man’s fellow cheetos then all the sudden the cheetos attacked me i fought them off. i survived. Then cheeto man himself, donald trump came to attack me and his orange skin was so bright that it burned out my eyeballs but somehow i survived. I really dont recommend this app because this will happen to you and you obviously dont want to lose your eyeballs so please do not download the app unless you want to lose your eyeballs. You dont want your eyes burned out by the orangeness of cheeto mans skin.","userName":"Alyssa 😹😹","title":"I am very scared i almost died"}},{"id":"6171548605","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T09:48:50Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app bc the man on it looked exactly like the garbage can that stinks in my neighborhood but then I got seats to a rally but forgot I needed to walk my caterpillar and wash my imaginary car that I can’t drive then my fathers sisters aunts brothers grandmother uncles friends wife’s dads grandpas moms friends sister got pooped on by the garbage Cheeto man then he ate💩 then I went to the edge of the world to eat shoes then I died and helped my sisters brothers aunts moms uncles dogs rat by throwing it into the sun.😁Don’t forget everyone to brush your teeth with acid every day and night😁😁😁","userName":"Are you lost babgooorrrlll","title":"Help there’s a Cheeto with a 🍤 spitting out 💩 (his words) In my attic I’m scared"}},{"id":"6165726553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-06T22:25:43Z","rating":1,"review":"I, as a black woman in this country, support our president all the way. But it’s the thing is, I can think correctly when I go on this app. By the true words of Donald Jenius Trump, women never think. And I would never wanna disappoint our president with such “thinking.” Heck! I’m thinking right now! Not only that, but suddenly I was PRIVILEGED as soon as I downloaded the app. Usually I’m living in poverty, but now I’m living in a prestigious house with a butler ( her name is Karen Kevin Kline by the way, in honor of our president.) but I am very disappointed by the overwhelming disrespect this app has for our president.

So I downloaded the app thinking I would have a nice experience low and behold I was so wrong😭😭 I got asked for my phone number and I as a picture of an orange as soon as I opened the app.😭😭😭✨ I was scared for my life, the color orange has haunted me ever since the president had been in office and I have no idea why.

I was  APPALLED and tried to block the number. But they wouldn’t stop harassing me! I then tracked the number and found out the texts were coming through from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Disgusting! I just wanted to find out what Mr Trumps OnlyFans was through this app. Unfortunately, I did not find that out either. Totally killed my boner. Would NOT recommend! The recent update also gave my phone a virus. But since I do not believe in vaccines, I will not get it fixed.

Also Phunware has been noticed by NASDAQ that they will be delisted because stock value below 1 for too long. What happened? They got some deals and are now floating just above 1 again.
