I read the reviews and I definitely agree. This is a real report for those who believe I am a troll. I also believe that instead of asking for a phone number it should ask for an email due to the amount of people who are unable to have data and are still age acceptable. This upsets me very much especially for a presidents app!","isEdited":false,"title":"Not recommended!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T21:54:26Z"}},{"id":"6145236416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♂️💅🧜\u200D♀️","review":"yes, most of these 1 star reviews are fake, and yes, gen z is too young to vote. however, we are smart enough to see all the crap that trump does and we are not going to defend him just because he is our president. he is a racist, a sexist, basically uneducated(yeah sure he went to yale and bought himself a degree, but have u seen the way he talks). he could easily say that he wants colored and LGBTQ+ people to die, and you will still support him. please open your eyes and educate yourselves.","isEdited":false,"title":"To all the confused trump supporters:","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T18:11:07Z"}},{"id":"6140081361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reviewer_123789","review":"So I got the app thinking it would be an easy way to effortlessly support the president, but no. The app IMMEDIATELY asked for my email, which I don’t like to give out. It also wanted me to allow notifications before I could do anything else!! Earlier today, I loaded my online cart with trump merchandise, but I couldn’t check out because I had to sweep the lawn. I felt so bad about this that I downloaded this app, but it was a very big waste of storage on my phone.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-30T13:56:46Z"}},{"id":"6138024307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Vayda Potato","review":"I downloaded this app a couple days ago and every time I open it, it crashes. After the first day, my phone started bugging out and I get red lines that go across after trying to open this app. I downloaded this app to see what it was all about, I only actually got to navigate it for like five minutes it started crashing and messing up the rest of my phone. If you want a virus for your phone download this app it will do the trick.","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump App Scam","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-30T01:52:05Z"}},{"id":"6137272339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emely3222","review":"I downloaded this app because I thought it would be cool and everything but when I opened the app this Cheeto puff came out of nowhere and almost gave me a heart attack in my opinion this is the worst app to ever exist if anybody with a weak heart downloads this app they would most likely die because when you open the app there’s a jump scare of a Cheeto  puff I really don’t recommend this app and people please do not vote Cheeto puff 2020 because that’s just disgusting and disappointing.💖✨","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible‼️","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T20:48:41Z"}},{"id":"6134876933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anyone by Trump 2020🤩🥳","review":"This app has so many bugs it keeps twitching and has slowed down my device. I also had to visit a minister once I deleted this app because it’s a cult and I started being haunted daily by witches😖 it was very traumatizing. I once email trump to tell him how much I love him😍🥵🥵 and he sent me nudes😳 very inappropriate. Although he’s mentally challenged and dysfunctional, speaks nothing but nonsense, looks as dumb as he is, I love our trumpie🤩 and hope he wins his name on a gravestone this year🥰😘🤩🥳","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump 2020🧚🤩❤️on a gravestone🦋🌼💫","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T07:30:44Z"}},{"id":"6134329714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Little monster9996","review":"Downloaded it to check it out and it looks so unpolished. The cheapness of it was so much I felt like I needed to gag. Overall just very lackluster and looks like a photo editor on Instagram made it. Thankfully we have Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden to save the day... we all know how bad it’d be if trump is in office for another 4 years. Also the very scary looking man whose presented everywhere on the app is a tad bit too orange don’t you think? Honestly sometimes I can’t tell if I’m looking at a deformed cheeto or a human.","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T03:48:30Z"}},{"id":"6133591202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ball cheese tastes like candy","review":"THIS IS THE WORSE APP IVE EVER DOWNLOADED!!!!! It spammed my phone with so many texts and notifications that my phone overheated and shut down for two days and when it finally came back on it cracked for the amount of pressure that app was putting on it. It hacked my bank account and cleared out my entire life savings and now i’m homeless and starving. I’m using Mcdonald’s wifi to post this to warn other people this app honestly ruined my life i accepted way more from our president.","isEdited":false,"title":"this app ruined my life","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-28T22:54:41Z"}},{"id":"6133378099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jaicei","review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded. Shortly after it had downloaded, my phone started acting up. I am fully convinced that whoever had manufactured this app had hacked my phone. I am very disappointed and frankly furious that this had happened to me after I had supported President Trump through his campaign and up until this point. I do feel that there is something fishy going on and I believe that the manufacturers of this app is behind it. DO NOT GET THIS APP.","isEdited":false,"title":"This is a dangerous app","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-28T21:25:13Z"}},{"id":"6177719604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jfeiss","review":"so i downloaded this app so i can hear news about our cheeto leader🧑🏼\u200D🦰 but right as i opened the app my phone started on fire 🔥 i was caught by a surprise and i have 69 degree burns all over my hands and arms😤 the doctor then preceded to tell me he had to chop off my arms because the burns were boiling my blood 🩸 now i have to use my toes🦶🏼 that’s right i’m typing this review with my big toes😾 ngl it’s very difficult to do everyday things i blame this whole mess on our orange lopsided leader TrumP🙄","isEdited":false,"title":"BONK","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:16:35Z"}}]}
