However, after a few days of using the app, I realized that it’s a knockoff of the beloved comedy skit. Sure, this app is both orange AND annoying, but it’s not the Annoying Orange™️. I am very disappointed and do not recommend this app to anyone- it is all fake news."}},{"id":"6177735033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:11Z","userName":"FaZeCry","rating":1,"title":"It asked for my number 😳","review":"Sadly I would love this app but it asked for my phone number and idk how I feel about that , no one has everrrrr asked me for my phone number and well an app asking for it makes me depressed knowing an app asks for my number first instead of a girl . I will now file a lawsuit for mental health problems that this app has caused.

It lacks information on many topics and things this man has been saying and doing. It’s almost as if they wanted us not to know. Also I think it would be much better if they highlighted some major events like the tweets that have replaced formal statements.\n\nXoxo GG"}},{"id":"6177630603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:48:37Z","userName":"Kittenkittehkat","rating":1,"title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This app literally would not download for like an hour. I wanted to see the plans for Trumps re-election and see how he was planning on changing his campaign. The app crashed my phone multiple times once it started and I basically had to reset my iPhone completely just so I could use it. I think there was a virus in the app."}},{"id":"6177618525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:44:44Z","userName":"i see your toes 🐀","rating":1,"title":"Icky icky","review":"The worst app ever. This gross hairy orange meatloaf popped up as soon as I opened the app. Then he asked for my phone number but I had a feeling he was taken so I looked it up and he’s MARRIED, where is his ring btw? But GROSS. I’m so unimpressed by this app and the gross guys. I didn’t realize it was just tinder for old men to hit on UNDERAGE girls. 🤮🤮🤢 I won’t be voting for the Cheeto puff and it doesn’t look like his wife wants to either 🧀🌝🐁"}},{"id":"6177517909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:12:47Z","userName":"mika🙈","rating":1,"title":"🍊👄🍊","review":"ok so look, i’m definitely not part of the gen z community spamming to get this app deleted. therefore i will give an honest review 😌 so i downloaded this app to see our favorite orange’s plan for 🇺🇸𝓪𝓶𝓮𝓻𝓲𝓬𝓪🇺🇸 but like the previous reviews stated, the moment i opened it, it began to brainwash me and all I saw was ✨𝓻𝓪𝓬𝓲𝓼𝓶, 𝓼𝓮𝔁𝓲𝓼𝓶, 𝓪𝓷𝓭 𝓱𝓸𝓶𝓸𝓹𝓱𝓸𝓫𝓲𝓪✨ ik. it’s wild. so unless we get our preside-AHEM i mean *APP* fixed, “it’s a no from me”-simon cowell."}},{"id":"6177515908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:12:09Z","userName":"Karen🥺🤢","rating":1,"title":"This App SOLD MY INFORMATION","review":"You’d think that T***P would have enough money to not need to SELL MY INFORMATION to ad companies for money but he did. I now am subscribed to 253 dirty websites! Besides the point he did sell my information to google ads and now my bank account is locked. I can’t even let my kids near my phone. Absolute GARBAGE App just use CNN. Or sign some petitions for blm instead ❤️"}},{"id":"6177473848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:59:22Z","userName":"gen z power.","rating":1,"title":"💫n o t   t o d a y 💫","review":"i downloaded the app in hopes of helpful information, but instead i just got way to many spamming text messages, that don’t even make sense. the app is hard to navigate, and a mess over all. I am very dissatisfied. this looks like an underfunded app that took 78 seconds to create. once again. america let down. by. an. app. disgraceful. a shame."}}]}
