I have 37 children in my basement and its really hard taking care of them! They do a lot of work for me so i try to keep them all happy and doing work for me. I provide them with some old laptops so they can be entertained and want to do more work for me because they like me 🥰. But anyways they asked me for some robux so they can buy stuff and no way im spending my own money on some robux because these kids wanted it! I went around looking for any way i could get some for free and a lot of people told me about this app so i downloaded it. Right away there was some weird oompa loompa man which i really didnt like, it made the app look like some kids game. Anyways i went through and there was all this political stuff that i dont understand but there was no section for free robux! I put my account in at the beginning when it asked for an email and i spent an hour going through the app but no free robux! What am i supposed to tell my 37 children? Theyre always whining about “oh when can i go home?” But i finally got them to trust me and now this trust is about to be shattered because this stupid app didnt have my promised robux!! This is false advertising!! But the crazy thing is after i deleted this app i got a knock on my door and Gabbi Hanna was there?!? I was so confused what she was doing here i thought she was gone. But anyways she started chanting something ” People love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\n\nI climbed out of my head\nAnd watched myself implode\nA thought without a body\nOught to be a shot to take a load\nOff my brain is poisoned\nAnd I'm searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream \"oh, no you don't!\"\nWoah\n\nBut it's fine\nNo, really I'm fine\nIt's just a matter of time\nYou'll lose your mind\nAnd not be fine from time to time\n” it was really confusing and then she knocked me over and ran to my basement and killed all my children!! Why would she do this!! This only happened after i got this app and im so lost i dont know what to do! I needed my 37 children to make things for me so i could get money and now theyre all gone! This is all this apps fault, if they had given me my free robux these 37 children would still be here. Please donate to my go fund me so i can buy more children to make me things!! 😘😭😭😡","title":"Wheres my free robux?? 😡","rating":1,"userName":"Diamondfinder511"}},{"id":"6177774919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:33:12Z","isEdited":false,"review":"u wanna take our tiktok away then let’s take your app away bye bye","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"userName":"kinkin0789"}},{"id":"6177771910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:32:19Z","isEdited":false,"review":"you thought you did something good✨💕💗","title":"gross","rating":1,"userName":"rjohn133"}},{"id":"6177749563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:25:35Z","isEdited":false,"review":"just no, seriously.","title":"no","rating":1,"userName":"SleepiestSteak"}},{"id":"6177730979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:19:58Z","isEdited":false,"review":"If you know you know","title":"Gen Z","rating":1,"userName":"@dxdi_official"}},{"id":"6177723056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:17:36Z","isEdited":false,"review":"The app is just horabile","title":"The worst app","rating":1,"userName":"ios needs gachaclub"}},{"id":"6177666381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:00:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app gave me cancer 🥰","title":"Absolute garbage","rating":1,"userName":"gordan ramsey 27"}},{"id":"6177647905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:10Z","isEdited":false,"review":"definitely not worth it","title":"ouch","rating":1,"userName":"Monkey8159"}},{"id":"6177634437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:49:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"worst app ever","title":"Awful 🤮🤢","rating":1,"userName":"lunam21"}},{"id":"6177613379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:43:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i hate it:)","title":"it doesn’t work😚","rating":1,"userName":"A very nice personnn."}}]}
