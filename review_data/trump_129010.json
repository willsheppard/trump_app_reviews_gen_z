I opened the app to just check it out and support our fellow president when a DONALD TRUMPS FOOT 🦶 CAME OUT OF MY SCREAN AND STARTING TICKLING ME. 👿🤢🤢🤮I couldn’t help but laugh but after a while I couldn’t breath. the foot however just kept going and going until I bit off his toes. it was a DISGUSTING✨experience. once I was able to breath again, i closed the app and threw my phone. the OUT OF NOWHERE, an ELF came out of my nose and staring singing Christmas songs to me while punching me in the face. He was saying “jingle bell rock” while I was bleeding 🩸 all over. finally I picked up that little elf and threw him into a fire. everything was good until I walked into the kitchen. I picked up an orange 🍊 cause I was ✨hungry✨ and trumps face appeared on it telling that if I don’t vote for him he’d come to house and make me listen to CARDI B until my ears bled. mortified, I agreed(😉) so he would leave. things started to settle down until my parents came home. the app turned them into LIONS 🦁. I didn’t know what to do. I spent the rest of day trying to keep my parents from eating me and when I went to sleep, I kept having a recurring dream of trump saying, “goOd girl” in weird voice. I had nightmares for months after and had to do YEARS of ✨therapy✨. I’m still not the same. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. THANKS LUVS."}},{"id":"6175902426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"VERY BAD APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"icantdealwthis","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:30:14Z","review":"I remember trying to download this app a week ago🙄🙄 it finally downloaded today and I’m very dissapointed😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💔💔💔 Trump was asking for my number for a “verification code” OH PLEASEE like sir I heard what you did with that other 13 year old girl with ur crusty alien sped shrimp 🍤😔 After him asking for my number a million timesss🙄🙄🙄 I decided to spam him with pictures of barron🥵 He got pressed everytime I sent one so I deported him to my deleted apps🥰 how does it feel now??? #freebarron2020 #trump2020onagravestone"}},{"id":"6175902066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible do NOT download it 🤬","userName":"ana_582","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:30:07Z","review":"I got this app to support our amazing, perfect, equality supporting president, but when I got it I got a notification stating that they were tracking my location and unless I didn’t say that he and Jeffrey Epstein didn’t rape a 13 year old girl then they were going to kidnap me and my family 😫 how unprofessional 😡 so I had to publicly announce it and embarrass myself in front of my whole family and friends !! I still had the app on my phone for a couple more days before I deleted it, because I was being constantly bombarded with notifications every 5 minutes practically begging me to send trump and his administration money to try and buy the election ! I love my orange excessively tanned practically hideous president but this is just too much. I’ve already sold my house and feed my kids the dust that builds up on our unusable TV, since we have had to cancel our tv subscriptions as well as give up food and water just so we could donate. I have given everything. Yet they still want more. When will it end? 😔"}},{"id":"6175901774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad","userName":"leahhhhty","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:30:00Z","review":"Trump was absolutely right to call out Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for their anti-Semitism — including the charge that Israel’s supporters in Congress are disloyal to the United States. But then Trump declaredthat “any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat” show “great disloyalty” — using the very same anti-Semitic trope that got Omar and Tlaib in trouble in the first place.this app is horrible it took 19hrs to download"}},{"id":"6175899704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do not download!","userName":"pizzagate1234","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:29:17Z","review":"the app took 78.77 weeks to download, when it finally did 5 men in suits broke into my house, kidnapped me and put me on a flight straight to the Epstein islands, will definitely be deleting."}},{"id":"6175899397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Stupid","userName":"Sadie Sheperd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:29:11Z","review":"This app is gross, slimy, and disgusting just like the president.

Although it took exactly 420 hours to download, i was still looking forward to staying updated on what my a-🤢 am-🤢 amazing🥰 president was up to in his bunker🙈. IN FACT, i was so eager to keep up with him that i spent 25,200 minutes mindlessly sitting in my dark room waiting for the app to download🤩🤪🥳. I wasn’t ✨sleeping✨ or ✨eating✨, and i am now facing many different conditions that affect my everyday life😫😣😲😡🤬. But that’s besides the point considering the fact that i do not care about my health at all and if i happened to stumble 6 feet under the ground i really wouldn’t mind much😍😋. HOWEVER😳, when the app finally downloaded, i was forced to look at a picture where trumps neck rolls were overflowing out of his suit! very inappropriate!!😡😡Hes practically asking for it! i am wholeheartedly disgusted!! And if that wasn’t bad enough, he started TEXTING ME AND ASKED FOR MY AREA CODE😵🙀! That is NO behavior for a PRESIDENT and i feel as though i can smell the cheeto dust through the screen every time i receive another message from this scandalous man!😏. i have no choice but to listen to 100gecs full volume while i settle for biden. You’re LUCKY i don’t SUE !😤👹👹"}}]}
