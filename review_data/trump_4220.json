I’ve had to try multiple  different times to get it to work which ended in me having to comment this. The app itself is super unorganized and is really pointless. All of trumps events and updated are posted everywhere anyways. The app is simply pointless. I want to talk to the manager of this app to file a complaint because it’s that bad!! My friend suzan also downloaded this app and said it made no difference. The trump administration really can’t market if it meant their life!! Get rid of the app for good because it’s taking up space"}},{"id":"6175346370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Penny ❤️❤️🔥","title":"This app is so bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:08:35Z","review":"This app legitimately hurt my family. After allowing my kids one hour of playtime and feeding them kraft Mac n cheese or something, I downloaded it thinking that my kids and I were going to be able to use it to support the re-election of President Donald Trump. When when I opened it I realized he has done absolutely nothing to warrant my support. Whether it’s vilifying the black community or using his policies to terrorize the undocumented community, he is a danger to the US through his lies and truly deserves to be locked up for a number of reasons as proven by facts, yet he’s still around. This app slaps my tia in the face and ran away with my husband."}},{"id":"6175276973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"krhvdjjdhdhdbdi","title":"horrible just horrible🧜🏽\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:42:08Z","review":"i downloaded this app to see why all the ppl at my school loved the orange orangutan 🦧so much...i still can’t figure it out. ever since i downloaded this app all my private info has all of a sudden been released, and my dog died. as much as i have tried to praise our orange orangutan 🦧i couldn’t do it so one day he followed from my local walmart and somehow managed to stalk all the way home even though i ran🏃🏽\u200D♀️💨. he’s stalked in my mirror 👀ever since and talks to me 🗣even though i never answer. please send help immediately i’m tired of having to get dressed in my closet so he won’t see me. 😔anyways stan AOC for clear skin and abolish ICE."}},{"id":"6175133632","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ed balc","title":"This app is bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:50:14Z","review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded, the organization of the home screen is sooooo bad and confusing I don’t understand how you could do this.

After trying multiple times to delete the app and reinstall it the app starting glitching and every time I pressed the icon my phone would turn off. There is probably severe damage to my phone because of this awful disgraceful app and it benefits me in no way possible. If I could give this app zero stars I would and not to mention all the spam mail and phone calls I’ve been getting recently almost like the app leaked my information without consent. Beyond disappointed and will never again redownload such a purposeless waist of an app."}},{"id":"6174597288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Artsianna","title":"Most horrifically terrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:07:22Z","review":"Wanted to see what the Head Cheetolini was up to, so I downloaded the app. Then it didn’t even want to open no matter how many times I tapped it. So I deleted it and then re-downloaded it to give it a second chance. Lo’ and behold it opened! Right as I was entering my info, it glitched out and crashed, just like the economy during his handling of the coronavirus and the rest of the big cheeto’s 13 failed business ventures (I.e. trump airlines, trump vodka, trump steak, trump university, etc). Would not recommend this app to anyone. It’s horrible and non user friendly, just like how trump isn’t friendly to anyone that’s not rich and white. ❤️🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6174567440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"miss ana borshun","title":"The wOOoooOOrst😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:58:57Z","review":"As a young American😖, I got this to educate myself on how to be a bunker-loving, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, Cheeto-flavored sack of sweaty gym socks just like our dictator of a president🧚🏻👑✨. I have to say I am very disappointed and thoroughly surprised that this app is allowed. All I wanted was a spray tan tutorial or directions to the nearest conversion therapy center. Is that too much to ask??? Anyways I got the app (May Bernie forgive me) and before I could even open the app, Chester the Cheetah busted down my front door and force fed me cheese puffs!!! NOT EVEN CHEETOS!🤢😭 the horror and trauma is something I’ll have to live with the rest of my life and unfortunately all I can do is sign up for the Oompa Loompa’s next rally but I just realized I have to take my sister’s dog’s friend’s neighbor’s second cousin’s plant to the vet so now my day is even worse🤡 I hope I never have to see that shrimp in office ever again because I don’t know if I could handle the PTSD\n\nAnyways,\n\nBlack lives matter, love is love, &\n\n🌸💋🌈FDT💖✨🦋"}},{"id":"6174477243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"peppa is fire","title":"Racist man","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:26Z","review":"Trump is such a racist it’s unbelievable. We as citizens have the right to protest if peaceful which is what we were doing but Trump had to basically take that right away and tell police to shoot protesters. We the people are not the problem. The problem is Trump. Plus if he is going to ban Tik Tok in the USA than he needs to be prepared for what may happen. Gen Z is elite and we are the future not you us as Gen Z have the future to rule eventually a change is going to come and we are the start of it. Trump needs to grow up just because a bunch of kids played you and you’re upset that people didn’t go to the rally. You’re ridiculous and a coward."}},{"id":"6174475757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stan nct💕","title":"what❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:33:00Z","review":"Chew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum, gum, gum\n내 까만 스니커즈를 지금 멈추게 (만든 너)\n범인은 어서 나와 좋은 말 할 때 (빨리나와)\n끈적한 발이 떨어지지 않는 게 (조금 전)\n뱉은 지 얼마 안 된 것이 분명 해 (딱 기다려)\n넌지시 마주치는 시선이 어색해\n천천히 다가가자 딴 곳을 보는 걸\n역시 널 찾아내긴 어렵지 않았어\n그런데 화내기엔 너무나 예쁜 너\n풍선 불어 봐 누가 누가 더 커질까\n자신 있어 부드런 chewing gum\n조심스레 네게 네게 더 다가가\n터질 듯 부푼 내 맘은 chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\n너는 내 chewing gum\n신기해 자꾸 마주 치고 있잖아 (너와나)\n매일 똑같은 길을 같이 걷잖아 (신경 쓰여)\n궁금해 너란 애는 어떤 아인지 (다가가)\n언제쯤 말을 걸까 고민하게 돼 (너만 보면)\n공기가 들어간 듯 갈수록 커져가\n내 맘이 너로 가득 채워진 것 같아\n커지면 커질수록 점점 투명해져\n내 맘을 이제 더는 숨길 수도 없게\n풍선 불어 봐 누가 누가 더 커질까\n자신 있어 부드런 chewing gum\n조심스레 네게 네게 더 다가가\n분위길 잡고 너는 내 chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\n달콤한 chewing gum\n내 맘에 붙어라 chewing gum, chewing gum,\nChewing gum, chew you like chewing\n검 딱지처럼 붙어줘\n중독있어 너라는 거 끈적해 \n끌리는 것 같애 너무 다양해\n내 마음에 터트려줄래 like chewing gum \nChewing gum, you're my 주인공\n쉽게 떼낼 수 없는 girl uh\n함께 있어 봐\n누가 누가 더 원할까\n내기 할까 달콤한 chewing gum\n장난스레 네게 네게 난 다가가\n예감이 좋아 너는 내 chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\n너는 내 chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\nChew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew-chew\nChew-chew-chew-chew chewing gum\n달콤한 chewing gum"}}]}
