Trying to keep an open mind, but am repeatedly distracted by the repetitive attempted wallet grabs. I’m sure political campaigns cost gobs and gobs of money, but... really? This is quite a “pushy” ask. \n\nBeen through the app carefully, but still just don’t get it. Was hoping to hear more about causes that matter to me - and lots of my friends - but actual content in here is pretty much non existent. I come from a family and background that’s pretty data and fact driven, and this is no where close.\n\nReally had to rethink the entire premise of this app: it’s just not providing any information, super light on that whole fact checking thing, and not even half as entertaining as Candy Crush - and yes that’s complete sarcasm. \n\nShouldn’t an app provide relevance, data or compelling validation? I certainly hoped so, but this was an utter disappointment. If this is the best this campaign can do (seriously - are they completely relying on only people who don’t think at all??? ) well, there’s no reason to keep this on my phone.\n\nUtterly disappointing, and one cannot help but pity the poor developers that ended up with this as a project. Can’t blame them for the drivel, and hope they were provided with sufficient compensation. We all need to pay the bills. \n\nBottom line: if you’re looking for any reason to stay as a supporter ... well, you’re simply not going to find anything at all here. If all you want is an excuse to throw more money this way - you’ve hit the mother of all home runs.\n\nYup, deleted. And rethinking a whole lot of ideas.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Another disappointment."}},{"id":"6179208188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"GEN Z PRES 2021","date":"2020-07-10T03:11:59Z","review":"I will run for president if this man shuts down TikTok🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏽\u200D♀️😽🙀👽😺✨🤣☺️❤️‼️😌","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"My fellow Gen z members ❤️✋🏾‼️"}}]}
