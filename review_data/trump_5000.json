The app then sold my email and phone number to COMMUNIST China and gave my phone a virus! Now I get spam calls and emails constantly telling me to vote for SLEEPY JOE BIDEN 😤 Trump is a thug and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for this TERRORIST ANTIFA app! It’s full of fake news - Sad! The J in Donald J. Trump stands for Jenius so he should have the biggest, bestest, most powerful app available to surveil the American people! Will someone from his fascist and uneducated regime please inform him that I too have a Big App, but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his, and my App works!"}},{"id":"6175592557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"!!!HORRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:43:49Z","userName":"karen🌝❤️","review":"First of all this app took 507 days to download, and when it finally did it asked hundreds of personal questions like where I live and my phone number. When I tried to exit the app it made my phone start to glitch, then it shut off. When it turned back on I open it and all my apps had been destroyed and all my pictures where replaced pictures of the most horrible site I have ever seen... trump pictures. I was completely mortified, so I now want to speak to your manager and after that I am throwing the phone that you destroyed in the trash -Karen👁👄👁❤️"}},{"id":"6175555961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:30:15Z","userName":"msncbkc","review":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨The app is a complete waste of time, it took a week to download, then took all the data from my phone, and wiped it clean. It broke my phone once, tried a different phone and broke that one too. Nobody should have downloaded this app seriously because whoever supports Trump is awful. Nobody wants a Cheeto as president. Nobody should support a racist, rapist as a president. Never download an app by Trump and his administration.✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️\n\nImagine mainly wanting to ban Tik tok because your feelings got hurt. Tik tok is way better than this app by far. I’d recommend it and give it all 5 stars. All apps take data, especially this one."}},{"id":"6175405090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:31:30Z","userName":"duckduckgoose215","review":"I wanted to download this because I thought, why not? Aside from the 11 hour download (mind you I was connected to WiFi the entire time), every single app on my phone crashed after I downloaded this!! I would open Instagram or Snapchat to share how informative this app was and B A M!!!! they would close within seconds of me opening the apps. As soon as I deleted it, my phone was restored! Not only were my apps opening back up again, but my health was restored and I gained all my lost brain cells from the 3.5 seconds of me opening this app. Save yourself the anguish and don’t download."}},{"id":"6175401849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I just hate Trump🙈✨🧚💫","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:30:12Z","userName":"MelyRey26","review":"How is this ped0 our president? When has he ever done something for the good of the people? He deals with economic issues but doesn’t look at more important problems like innocent lives being lost from police brutality and racism. He really said in an interview that if we just stopped testing people for COVID, the cases would go down. Thats the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. And people really believe this guy should be running the freaking country? Trump 2020✨but make it on a gravestone💫🧚🥳 I hope this app gets taken off the App Store for the sake of other people getting sucked into a bunch of lies❤️"}},{"id":"6175398114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨💕ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ💕✨ i hate it here🥰","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:28:46Z","userName":"I AM THE VICTIM","review":"The app took years to download and when I opened it up my phone caught a virus. A big waste of my time and will be a big waste of yours. Didn’t have it for long, but it’s constantly notifying you fake news and practically shoving this huge orange Cheeto down your throat. An absolute mess🙄. For those who do get the app, you have been warned and there’s also many in game app purchases. Whoever designed this app and thought it was okay to release to the public was on something. It’s clearly not ready to be in use and still needs some time to develop. -10/10\nBut nice try🧚🏻😘✨💕"}},{"id":"6175364239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Propaganda like application","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:15:35Z","userName":"CocoPuffs🤎","review":"So I downloaded this app to see what type of president we have here in the United States of America and I am very horrified nonetheless I don’t like seeing the things orange 🍊 face on my screen makes me want to 😵💀and never come back I am very dissatisfied with this application very slow like the 🍊 also takes forever to send the propaganda to my phone once the propaganda is sent it’s full of misinformation...well I mean it is propaganda so I guess; also it’s full of grammatical errors and it’s very hard to make out what the sentences are trying to say just like the o🍊. To summarize I hate the app❤️"}},{"id":"6175080587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:32:59Z","userName":"nicki minaj's number 1 fan","review":"I was super excited to see what games they had on this app so my toddler can play on our upcoming road trip to Mount Fuji. Oh boy, I found out they actually hacked into my phone and my phone morphed in an 🍊. So the fbi pulled up to my front doorstep and had a gun to my head and said I had to sing superbass by Nicki Minaj to be released. So....I went to town with it. Ahem THIS ONES FOR THE BOYS WITH THE BOOMING SYSTEM TOP DOWN AC WITH THE COOLER SYSTEM. WHEN WE COME UP TO THE CLUB HE BLAZIN’ UP, GOT STACKS ON DECK LIKE HE SAVING UP. HE ILL HE REAL HE MIGHT GOTTA DEA- I was cut off by the sound of my “phone” saying my butthole ointment cream has arrived. The fbi shot my hairline twice, but luckily my extra two inch prosthetic forehead save me."}},{"id":"6175046731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:22:28Z","userName":"hdhbdbdnnudneu","review":"OMG! right when I open this app, I see Cheeto! Why would they hire a poor Cheeto! Aw, poor little thing. I was very concerned for that Cheeto I would like to see it 5is Cheeto is doing okay I really don’t what anyone forcing that Cheeto on this very bad app! 😍 I went for a walk and seen little Cheeto with Donald trump. I stole Cheeto from him bc Cheeto deserves better 😭 When I came home MY COUCH WAS GONE! I was very scared so I walked to the grocery store to buy a new couch and I seen trump getting all the couches and I seen mine! After the grocery store MY HOUSE WAS GONE! I went to Walmart to buy a new house and Donald trump took them all. He is very mean and dosney save for others. 😭😭"}},{"id":"6175046046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I’m disgusted","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:22:15Z","userName":"Chlo G.","review":"This is hands down the worst app that I have ever downloaded. Besides the fact that it is FILLED with false information, since downloading this app my phone keeps getting virus after virus. The font used in the application is practically illegible! I don’t know how anybody approved the design. It also uses and OBCENE amount of battery life  while the app is open. I feel like I have to charge my phone every five minutes which uses MY own electricity. I demand that Donald Trump personally pays for my electricity bill because of this. I 100% DO NOT recommend this app unless you want to be SEVERELY disappointed."}}]}
