I mean of course not, why would I want something to remind me every thirty seconds that I have done such a great deed and that there are new hats in the merch store. The second thing is that I have to put my phone number in. Isn’t it enough we have robo calls trying swiper swipe your credit card info. Oh and what will the calls be, mabey, “hello you have just won a new coffee mug and wrist strap. To claim your prize go to crowdmade.com/shop and keep AmErIcA gReAt” like, ok tony the patriot I’m sure that the country is grrrrrreeeeaaat but I don’t want a piece of overpriced merchandise(hey that rhymed) that will be used until the end of the election. Overall I think people should try to make better apps and not politics that should just be broadcasted by official news networks.thank you for reading ( this is going for the two people still reading this) and keep politics out of modern media for everyone’s sake."}},{"id":"6179766603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:25:27Z","title":"don’t 🤦🏾\u200D♀️","userName":"babyfaceeeee.b","review":"This app is a waste of time waste of energy waste of it all doesn’t make any sense how the president of United States of America is showing nothing more than being a disgrace and I am very upset I am highly upset with our president because of this app I will no longer refer to him as president of the United States of America I will be refer to him as a disgrace to the presidency of the United States of America please don’t waste your time and energy  🤮🤢🤦🏾\u200D♀️just look for a better app like (💕TikTok💕)"}},{"id":"6179766573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:25:27Z","title":"Nope","userName":"Carlos0008","review":"No."}},{"id":"6179766186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:25:18Z","title":"GEN Z BABYYYYYYYY","userName":"kgymnaste","review":"byeeeeeeeeeeeee :)))"}},{"id":"6179766194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:25:18Z","title":"Trash","userName":"Bella520(#)app reviewer","review":"DELETE THE APP"}},{"id":"6179765909","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:25:12Z","title":"Absolute Trash","userName":"ohr.nohr","review":"I hate it.

The same man who’s taking credit for the improved economy, when in reality, he’s just riding the wave of Obama’s administration. Couldn’t be me...

I was extremely disappointed that I could not buy any Cheetos puffs  from the cheeto puff himself! I though surely this was the app to use. So I tried to give it a try but upon using the app I was upset because I couldn’t go any further if I didn’t enter any personal info!! What!!  I don’t want to have to give my phone number to utilize the app. It’a my right, my freedom. Also I feel like there is some form of false advertising as it says “keep America great”.  Trash! Don’t waste your time downloading you will be disappointed!"}}]}
