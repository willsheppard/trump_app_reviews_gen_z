I was determined to install the application and expose FAKE NEWS where I saw it! 🇺🇸🇺🇸✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿\nYou can only imagine my horror when the app opened, after a 48 hour wait for the app to load, and demanded an absurd amount of personal information!!!\nFirst it wanted my number (okay.. normal) which I was happy to give and then my state ID (weird??). \nWhen I stated that I didn’t have one the app demanded I submit a picture of my birth certificate???? I obviously refused because my ‘MERICAN rights to privacy! 😤\nBut apparently my name sounds, and I QUOTE “suspiciously ethnic”. I tried to reason it out with the support number listed in the app but I think I made it worse...\nI NEVER pegged my lord and savior Trump to be a racist but the app immediately signed me out saying I might pose a security threat. I’ve been getting hate texts that same support number ever since??? This has got to be a mistake???  IM PRETTY SURE I AM NOW UNDER ICE SURVEILLANCE.","userName":"ComcernedKaren1","title":"I. Am.

I’ve also experienced multiple glitches on my iPad since installing this app. I haven’t seen any of these glitches before, so I believe that this app is the cause of it. It’s really a shame I was really wanting to support trump and downloaded this app, but it keeps giving me problems. 0/10 would never recommend.","userName":"bsyemg123hs","title":"The app would keep kicking me out/ causes glitches?"}},{"id":"6180004324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:55:03Z","review":"No","userName":"DJTstuff","title":"No"}},{"id":"6180003811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:54:51Z","review":"This app is trash.
