Then a song came on and I thought it was the national anthem but it was just saying “Vote for Trump if you want to live, if you don’t you die” I got off and deleted it but the song kept playing and I had to get a new phone.

The glitching was happening every 2 seconds and they kept displaying an image of an orange Cheeto puff! I am over the moon upset about this app and will be deleting as soon as possible. If I could give this 0 stars then I would without hesitation. This is the most ridiculous app out there and will never be downloading it again.","title":"Horrifying do not download!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"MaCkEnZiE 💕"}},{"id":"6173289147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:01Z","review":"I downloaded the Donald trump 2020 app to see what all the hype is about but it is constantly glitching and would crash when I opened it! The app is also very slow even though I have great internet at my house! Oh no! This app crashes so much it is completely useless. I wouldn’t download this app if I were you. If I could rate this app 0 stars I would, the developers really need to look into the app.","title":"This app is so glitchy✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"republicanforever"}},{"id":"6173203589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:05:47Z","review":"WOW let me just say this is by far THE WORST APP ON APPLE. It took forever to download one. Then it glitched the whole time using it. Not only that the app overheated my phone. The app takes up all my charge on my new iPhone and and and a picture of a Cheeto keeps appearing on my screen. I’m disgusted that this app is on App Store, and honestly want it takin down  immediately. I simply just want to support my orange president but not in these conditions.#blacklivesmatter 😉😉😉","title":"I’m infuriated","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ignorant trump supporter"}},{"id":"6173161143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:52:08Z","review":"After downloading this app, I noticed that slowly everything on my phone was turning Donald Trump themes. My screensaver, my music, my apps...everything. The fact that the app basically hacked into my phone makes me think that it probably is funneling my information to people that I never agreed to give my information to. I would highly not recommend this app...","title":"Started taking over my phone screen","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ankneemoose"}}]}
