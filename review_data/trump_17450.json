Like why does an old Cheeto need to know my location at all times? Is this so he can find more girls to violate? I demand this app be taken down because I don’t want creepy old men having free range access to people’s locations.","title":"Worst App Ever"}},{"id":"6174717871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:42:21Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Vanessa Ralph","review":"Many took a chance on this app as they believe it was time for a new kind of app or they weren’t ready for a different kind of new app. The app promised so much and failed to deliver at every turn. Worse than failed. The app demoted the very notion of an app and left me wishing for a way to communicate just how far the App Store has fallen. Delete this useless app. Make America great, someday.","title":"“App” = President"}},{"id":"6174712441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:40:43Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"#thisappispoo","review":"So one day I woke up and my TV was just on. I realized I had been in a coma for a multiple years and that we had a new president. I immediately started a straight 4,000 hours of research in which I concluded life was pointless. I then downloaded this app and never opened it. Today you can find me picking dandelions and eating leaves. I’m going to buy a pet turtle and knit a scarf. That’s it.","title":"This App is Poopoo"}},{"id":"6174699557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:36:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Sarahhowell1","review":"This app completely ruined my life. It stole my cat and burned my toe. It needs to be taken down NOW! You don’t get to just take toes out for a burning without going to dinner first. That’s just RUDE. RUDE I TELL YOU! I cannot believe how awful this app is for your phone is either! It put so many bugs on my phone and it let this weird orange Cheeto see what I’m doing too! One star I’m not sorry. ✨🤷🏽\u200D♀️ TRUMP 20NEVER R.I.P. to my toes!","title":"No... just no"}},{"id":"6174688378","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:33:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"noooöp","review":"Hi, my name is Karen.  I tried to leave my house without a mask because I can’t breathe with it on! The app gave me a notification that I need to wear a mask to comply with CDC ever though Trump won’t wear it himself. It’s very disappointing knowing that he doesn’t believe in my rights as a citizen, and it trying to OPRESS me. It’s not fair that I should have to wear a mask if it doesn’t benefit me. Besides, I have my essential oils to protect me.","title":"IT WONT LET ME LEAVE MY HOUSE WITHOUT A MASK!!!!"}},{"id":"6174686417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jon guomo","review":"when i first open this app it sensed i was mexican and told me to immediately delete the app or else it would deport me and my family so i did. honestly worst app to date. and it ended up giving my phone a virus called racism (which btw black lives matter🖤) and now when i wanna use face id to open my phone it won’t open because i’m mexican so NOT WORTH IT🤡","title":"worst app ever"}},{"id":"6174686354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Z.momin","review":"I was scared as soon as they open the app you could sense that I was Muslim and when he revenge because there’s Muslim ban didn’t last very long so he’s coming for me honestly I feel personally attacked this is a free country with freedom of religion is celebrated so I was confused with the app repeatedly sending me notifications calling me a terrorist not to worry I have a bunker to hide in.","title":"The orange man came for me"}},{"id":"6174680400","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:31:06Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Kyyssojuiccyy..","review":"this app is currently harmful to kids , trump tweets & says he will band tiktok for no reason he plans on bringing back slavery is wat he says ! don’t ever read the stuff he post !! yu will have night mares , truly the truth , he gets into yur head & harm yu in a crazy way .. he wants yu to believe he is a good mad wen he isn’t .. don’t read anything he writes !!!!!

The second I opened this app, I had to go to therapy because I was so traumatized from seeing an obese Cheeto on my screen. I felt my eyes were being raped from the horrid pics of that Cheeto. My IQ dropped from just watching a few of the video on this app. I had to delete immediately. Wouldn’t recommended.","title":"Terrible just horrible"}},{"id":"6174669595","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:28:00Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gen z rise","review":"Bad app I opened it up and it immediately started glitching my phone and adds kept on popping up every 2 minutes I downloaded it to see our lovely president and stay informed but then my cat ran in my room and took my phone and she went to burn it because your face was on it my cat is on my side ☺️ now you should go burn yourself Michelle Obama 2020✨","title":"Just another liberal"}}]}
