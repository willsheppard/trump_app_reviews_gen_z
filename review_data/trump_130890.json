read.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"so i really liked the app starting out. i checked it everyday for updates on the campaigns and rallies, but slowly things started to mess up. the app started glitching, my phone battery was draining, the app would randomly open on its own, my phone would tell me the app has been using my location in the background (despite location being turned OFF in my settings), etc. i went to delete it but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. every time i tried, i got a weird notification that just said, ‚Äúerror: covfefe‚Äù and i don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs supposed to mean. my phone started acting weirder and my phone background was changed to a picture of him getting a spray tan (in the nude) at some point and i couldn‚Äôt remove it. my kids used my phone regularly for youtube and to call their dad. shortly after the background was changed i took my phone the at&t store and the nice cashier tried to take it off fore me and my phone made a loud ‚ÄúPOP‚Äù noise before electrocuting him. he DIED. more importantly, my PHONE was BROKEN, literally melted to his hand. i got a new one the same day (conveniently i was at the at&t store) and immediately downloaded the app again so i could write this review. i‚Äôm going to give the app another try but i‚Äôm a little wary. i hope the tech team gets on this issue ASAP. if i have to buy another phone AGAIN, i WILL speak to whoever the manager of this app is."}},{"id":"6174471332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sepnupues","title":"I am dissatisfied
