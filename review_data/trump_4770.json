But right when I opened the app my phone started glitching, and on top of that it asked to use my camera. I pressed no because why would a Trump app need my camera access??? Anyways, later that very night I was using the toilet when i realized my camera was on! The only app that was still open was the Trump app! It is unbelievable that I denied access yet they still got into my camera! Other than that, this app glitches a ton and makes my battery go down so quick!! Hopefully this helped someone. DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!!"}},{"id":"6174491149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lil lexxxx","date":"2020-07-09T01:37:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst experience of my life","review":"if there was a button for no stars i would definitely press it. words cannot explain how bad this app is. it gave me a virus and now my phone glitches every second and i worked so dam hard to get this phone. also the app did this weird glitch where it showed other ppl my IP address and last night a drug dealer was at my door threatening to kill me if i didn’t undownload the app. i can’t believe donald trump would do this to me and put me in such a unsafe situation. i use to like him cuz i was a fan of hot cheetos but now i am in disbelief. do not download or there will be a drug dealer at ur house to kill you"}},{"id":"6174477200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Blurry1023","date":"2020-07-09T01:33:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?","review":"I want to see someone who’s in charge— corporate preferably. I open up my app to worship my glorious leader Kim Jong Un but find that Peppa Pig has been posting his nudes on this app. I immediately dial the Paw Patrol to report this atrocity. They arrest Peppa, but his bacon bits are still out and floating the inter web. I email Sharon about this issue and she referred me back to the Paw Patrol. The issue remains unsolved. My leader will be very unimpressed that I have not done my daily worship ritual in his name today. I call my great leader, Papi Kim Jong Un, to resolve this issue but all I can see is the explicit image of Peppa and his bean tanning in the Louisiana sun. This app is broken and I am behind schedule."}},{"id":"6174437188","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"i ate grass","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Spiders!!!! 🐝🐞🐛🐶🦉","review":"As soon as I opened this app spiders and I mean SPIDERS! Came crawling out of the screen. I screamed and grabbed a hammer to smash the phone and spiders. And the hammer just and broke then I ran to my car and drove to Home Depot to buy the 20 head hammer. As I walked in millions of phones dropped from the ceiling. and spiders followed by aliens dinosaurs, cats dogs lizards and toons of other bugs came crawling out of the phones I passed out of fright and woke up in a school. I looked around and saw toons of bugs in the school chairs and a big bug as the teacher. I RAN out of there to my house. I looked in the mirror to only realize I was a bug to. Then my dog came and ate me 🥺😱😖😟☹️"}},{"id":"6174435279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KLadyLuvMusic","date":"2020-07-09T01:20:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Don’t do it!","review":"I downloaded this app to see why it was so horrible. Nothing happened at first I thought everyone was exaggerating, but a few hours later everything changed. I had set my phone down for a bit and when I returned I found that both my home and lock screen where changed to different images of Cheetos! Cheetos golfing and Cheetos stepping off of airplanes with toilet paper on its shoes. I even had some pictures added to my camera roll of Cheetos hiding in a bunker! Needless to say I was horrified, if you would like to spare yourself from this traumatizing experience please do not download this app!"}},{"id":"6174417339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cheeto🤢","date":"2020-07-09T01:15:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Stream stay gold by bts✨ not trump🤢","review":"Ooh ooh\nIn a world where you feel cold\nYou gotta stay gold\nOh baby, yeah\n魅惑的な moonlight\n今宵も眠らない\n月明かりを頼りに\n君の元へ hide and seek (ay)\n心へ (ay) と忍びこんで 君の間近\n近づくのさ いつの間にか (ay)\n穢れを知らないな\nその瞳はダイヤ\nどんな宝石よりも beautiful\n何度も (yeah) 見惚れてしまうほど\n君から目離せない no more\n時計の針さえ 動きを止めるよ\nUh let it glow, whoa\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\n気づかれないように\n近づいてく slowly\n予告するよ baby 無防備な君を優しく\nいただくのさ 君の深いところ now\n高鳴る想いは 鼓動を早める\nUh let it show, whoa\nStay gold 君さえいれば\nStay gold 何もいらない\nStay gold, gold 抱きしめたくて\nStay gold 愛は果てなく\nStay gold 光を放つ\nStay gold どんな星よりも\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold, stay gold, stay gold\nStay gold いつまでも forever gold\nJust close your eyes\n何も言わない\nI'll steal your heart\n魔法のように\n奇跡なら僕が見せてあげる (yeah)\nその手を出して\nStay gold 夢の中でも\nStay gold 探しあてるよ\nStay gold, gold 君に触れたくて\nStay gold 君の全てに\nStay gold 心惹かれて\nStay gold 手に入れたくて\n覗き見する moonlight\n今宵眠らせない\n握りしめたその手を\n離したくはないよ\nStay gold, uh yeah"}},{"id":"6174298139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kimmieTK","date":"2020-07-09T00:37:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Trump admin did this✨💅now stop🧚🏻💫","review":"When I opened this app I saw a DISGUSTING cheeto man dancing to 𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣 it was AWFUL (but a good song choice💅😻) then i got SO many ads telling me to look for some gummy bear album in stores on November 13 or something, I don’t know, it was weird and super frustrating👺it also said that ˢʰᵃʷᵗʸˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵃᵐᵉˡᵒᵈʸⁱⁿᵐʸʰᵉᵃᵈᵗʰᵃᵗⁱᶜᵃⁿᵗᵏᵉᵉᵖᵒᵘᵗᵍᵒᵗᵐᵉˢⁱⁿᵍⁱⁿˡⁱᵏᵉⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃⁿᵃᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵈᵃʸⁱᵗˢˡⁱᵏᵉᵐʸⁱᵖᵒᵈˢˢᵗᵘᶜᵏᵒⁿʳᵉᵖˡᵃʸ then when I went to close out the app because I was getting too mad it started sending me videos of king huddy dancing and wouldn’t stop!!!!
