First off, it takes 53 days to download and when I finally got it, it deleted automatically. Of course I got mad because I wasted 2 months of my life trying to get this app. I was so mad I tried storming out of my room until a wall was formed in my door. I am currently under a double lock down because the door won’t break. I do NOT recommend this app unless you want an excuse to stay in your room.","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"Very Angry Black Student","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175182982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App","review":"I got this app to calm my nerves down. It ended up giving me a panic attack and when I showed the problem to my family they also got a panic attack. I can’t believe how terrible this app was. There were a million ads that popped up and that’s what gave me such a bad panic attack. The screen in so annoying too that it hurt my head and gave me a head ache. Even my poor cat was hurt. The app smells and it is overall so ugly. I can’t believe anyone would ever create something like this. I would never recommend this app to anyone. If I could give this a 0 I would 100% give it one. Disgrace to the App Store.","date":"2020-07-09T05:07:09Z","rating":1,"userName":"Lala/Raelyn","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174977425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","review":"I literally hate this app. Like why was it made if it’s not going to work. I do not understand the reason for this app to existing if it’s not helpful to anyone. I do not think anyone should be downloading this app. I used it and I dose not work. Ugh. Like why even go out of you way to make a stupid app this glitches and signs you out. Please all of you whom are reading this understand this is not the app. Do waste your time waiting for it to load because it take literally like an hour at the most to load half of the page. I do not recommend using this app. Please take it down.","date":"2020-07-09T04:00:28Z","rating":1,"userName":"i am so done with this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174941070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No 💜","review":"There is this scary orange man that keeps popping up everywhere on this app and he scares me. He’s very unattractive too.

It has been glitching as well and gives me so many virus and malware warnings constantly. Now none of this has EVER happened to me before downloading this app so I plan on getting rid of it shortly. I’ve never heard of an app that literally takes over your phone and I keep getting all these random pictures inserted into my camera roll!! VERY disappointing and I do NOT recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t want to have to fight virus after virus being detected on your device.","date":"2020-07-09T03:25:35Z","rating":1,"userName":"ani.k2626","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174795784","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨No✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️","review":"🌈✨🦄🐣🧚🏽I tried to get the app but when I went downstairs all of my Mexican food was in the trash. When I went back upstairs to check on the app, the screen says if you are a Mexican I will deport you and slap your father. I said ok do whatever you want bunker boy. So then I went back downstairs with my phone to get some food but then I got a call from bunker boy himself. He told me that he was a racist bunker boy. But he also told me that if I told anyone that he said that he would mail me a dinosaur, but if he did that honestly I would be fine with it.

This app SUCKKKS BOOTTYY and a stinky one for your information. Do not get this trash 🤢🤮. I recommend for you to get subway surfers it’s fun, but those bouncy boot things make me Mad 😡. Anyway this app should get deleted because it makes your phone glitch and sends you pictures on naked mole rats 🐀.
