It takes pictures of you and accesses your camera without asking. This app is absolutely horrible and I would never recommend it to my worst enemy. I also no longer support trump because of this horrible app and as a mother of 17 children I would like an app about my president to be of good quality.Also I’m kidding I never supported trump. But I did test this app and it is horrible and had so many glitches and would drain my battery within 5 minutes. I am disgusted with the lack of work put into this app. Stan BTS. Gen Z are the chosen ones we will make America great. It was never great. But we will rid America and hopefully the world of racists like trump. Oh yeah I’m not a mother and don’t have 17 children. RISE GEN Z WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS. STAN BTS WE PURPLE YOU ARMY AND GEN Z.💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜","rating":1}},{"id":"6173445695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:25Z","userName":"manny853","title":"Ruined my life😔","review":"Uh huh, you know what it is\nBlack and yellow \nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nYeah uh huh, you know what it is\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nYeah, uh huh, you know what it is (what it is)\nEverything I do, I do it big\nYeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'\nWhat I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'\nReppin' my town when you see me you know everything\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nI put it down from my whip to my diamonds I'm in\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow\nBlack and yellow","rating":1}},{"id":"6173445561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:27:22Z","userName":"@iamjessicaalyse","title":"Terrible","review":"This app is so terrible it litterly made me throw my phone what small brained bum runs this account.and I did some research on this creature he is a rapist and is a racist.

After a full week of having the app I felt the need to be incredibly rude to service workers and people that are working during the COVID-19 pandemic. I started referring to myself as Karen and felt the need to belittle people. Worst app i’ve  ever gotten. 0/10","rating":1}},{"id":"6173444296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:26:55Z","userName":"trump is nasty.","title":"I hate this app 😼","review":"Horrible,horrible,horrible  \nCouldn’t give you a worse app to download bugs came flying through the screen it’s disgusting and unsanitary the quality was so laggy made me wanna jump off a bridge as well as the app doesn’t serve a reason like the person it’s based off -100000-1 please remove this app my eyes are burning","rating":1}},{"id":"6173444199","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:26:53Z","userName":"jgracereyes","title":"🇺🇸THIS APP PARALYZED ME🇺🇸 (conservative btw)","review":"i truly absolutely believe in white power even tho im asian. i even believe that banning tiktok is to be prioritized than banning the K K and K. but this app almost KILLED ME. I was driving one day and it kept asking me if i loved trump!! of course i had to say yes!!!🇺🇸 but it didn’t stop there, it kept popping up on my phone screen and to show my love and support to MY president, i kept clicking yes! then a TRUCK hit me in the intersection because i passed a red light!!!! i am currently paralyzed from the waist down! if i can please speak to the manager of this app send him my way!!!! i would love for them to hear my rant!! and if anyone asks why i was driving and texting, ITS A FREE COUNTRY. i have freedom and i believe that it is against my constitutional rights to restrain me from texting and driving. 🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸 i still love you, you rcist fck❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6173443887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:26:47Z","userName":"Al3ssandra.V","title":"Trump app","review":"This app is so terrible it took ages to download. I also didn’t like the fact that you had to give the app the stuff that was all about you like your email,zip code, first and last name and all that could give out your true identity. The huge problem was after I gave the app all my identity I started to have problems with my phone as if someone hacked it and nothing ever like this happened before this app. At first I was worried but not that worried but then my apps kept on open out of nowhere and if I was texting someone random letters I didn’t press appeared on the screen. Later down the rode my phone started to shut off then out of nowhere in completely powered off leading me to get an entire new phone which WAS NOT cheap. So if your thinking of downloading the app just know that there are risks like this and that it’s controlled by the government so they have all the power to do this to your phone.","rating":1}}]}
