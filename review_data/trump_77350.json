When I came home from work that night my parents had been stabbed 37 times in the chest and their hands were cut off. All that was left was a note stating that “Carl stole your parents hands and ate them, he killed them after they fell down the stairs. Your siblings are taken until you vote trump 2020, and we will cut off their hands as well” I was furious and went on a rampage to find my siblings. Luckily their phone location services were on so I was able to find them. They were being kept in the Duncan Donuts basement and forced to eat donuts made of moldy dough. They had food poisoning for 3 weeks and I lost all my clothes to them throwing up on everything. I went on vacation with my grandmother only to find out that this so called “carl” harpooned the captain and killed everyone on the boat that Hadn’t escaped, and he killed a lovely old couple that wanted a few crescent roles. A few days later, I then I noticed my dogs were gone. I found out that they sent them to a whole new town where faces on balloons were floating around, and baby hands were falling out of black holes with another note saying “Trump cut the baby hands and faces off, vote for him or there will be more to come” I took my dogs and booked it out of the town, where I came back to a huge meat dragon trying to stomp on everyone, all he spoke was “trump 2020” and tried to kill everyone, I deleted the app and the dragon flew away back to the White House I’m guessing and I haven’t had another incident since. I also found out that Carl was a mass llama serial killer, that wore a hat."}},{"id":"6177496616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The 𝑜𝒽 𝓈𝑜 𝑔𝓇𝑒𝒶𝓉 ᴼᴿᴬᴺᴳᴱ 𝒯𝓇𝓊𝓂𝓅𝓀𝒾𝓃","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:06:13Z","userName":"the scramble fidget spinner","review":"I opened up the app and saw the scariest thing I ever saw it was it was an orange Trumpkin after I saw it I deleted it in exactly 1.0 seconds \n\nᎶᎬᏁ Ꮓ ᎠᎾᏁ'Ꮖ ᎶᎾ ᎠᎾᎳᏁ ᎳᎥᏆhᎾuᏆ Ꭺ fᎥᎶhᏆ\n\nᏆᎥᏦᏆᎾᏦ"}},{"id":"6177492689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:05:02Z","userName":"owufcdbx","review":"I don’t think I know this app should be nonexistent terrible terrible terrible app 🤢"}},{"id":"6177489356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"#savebarron2020","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:04:02Z","userName":"if there was a god ...","review":"This app made me even more suicidal then I already am."}},{"id":"6177480114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i don’t recommend.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:01:13Z","userName":"baddest bixch","review":"i am part of trump 2020 and i would love this app but there are a few things wrong with it. i don’t believe this should be in the app store sorry🤪😍😘"}},{"id":"6177477495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Tiktok","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:00:26Z","userName":"ce10462","review":"The app is terrible it crashes me every time I get on"}}]}
