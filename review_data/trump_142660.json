Don’t know how anyone uses it. Gets confusing. Changes every other minute. Oh, we’re not talking about the a real person’s face?? Wild. Hey can we maybe work to create a better future for everyone and not offer viagra for free while being able to deny birth control?? Not cute. Not a good look. Or how about these covid numbers?? Really? Not a good look at all. As I was saying, general interface is not cute."}},{"id":"6179278298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:16Z","userName":"ya homie jesus✨","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app🥰✨🌝🤦🏻\u200D♀️","review":"I literally have no words to describe how bad this app is. It took 365 days to download and when I opened the app it made my sister fall down the stairs and break her back. So THEN, we had to take her to the hospital where Shane YAW was our doctor but then we had to switch doctors cause my sister is a ✨minor✨. Luckily Dixie D’amelio helped by sister by singing ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆. But aside from that, it made by dog turn 69. ADDITIONALLY, it teleported me to the White House where I had to seduce Barron(which I didn’t mind), but then I saw that evil Cheeto puff and had to dip. Zero stars, would not recommend downloading this app at all. Terrible quality, bad content. I would suggest to anyone with a decent brain to not get this app and come with me cause I’m gonna book a flight to the moon to see my bae vector and if anyone wants to come with just let me know."}},{"id":"6179278164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:14Z","userName":"oliveoill","isEdited":false,"title":"Waste of my time","review":"This app is as disappointing as today’s society, I Just hope nobody else downloads it.

It wont disappoint you!\"... Ever since that day my life has been a living nightmare. I first downloaded the app back in 1878 when the first light bulb was invented. It has taken 142 years to actually download. Meanwhile, all of my emails turned into the Zodiac Killers ciphers and my photos turned into Al Pacino drinking gasoline. Then i kept getting a mysterious knocking at my back door always at 4:20am sharpe. A few days later my dogs began to speak parseltounge and had glowing toe nails. Then my poor father- BLESS HIS SOUL- began to actually do laundry. That was the worst of all. So i attempted to delete the app- BUT NO! It would not go away. Thats when things got worse. I found out I was adopted. My mother birthed the antichrist. My grandparents have been able to recite the entirety of the Bee Movie script. I thought there must be a way i could fix this. I went to all of the places of worship i could find. A chruch. A synagogue. A mosque. A Buddhist temple. A shinto temple. The westboro baptist church. WHATEVER RELIGON YOU COULD NAME I WENT. I tried so hard. And then i died. I know it sounds crazy but my kidneys stopped working. I saw jesus (im jewish) and i went to heaven. BUT THE TRUMP APP COULD NOT LET GO OF ME. It poisoned heaven. God got sick and died. Everything is black. The dead had nowhere else to go so we wnet back into our bodies. We are back to seek revenge on the dreaded app. 1 star. DARE I SAY LESS THAN ONE. It ruined both life and death. I am lost and alone because of this app. I cry myself to sleep every night AND THE DEAD CANT SLEEP NO MORE. Please never use the app unless you want this to happen to you."}},{"id":"6179277979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:10Z","userName":"noonelikesthisappwhydelsteit","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever used","review":"First of all this weird orange guys face keeps popping up everywhere, DONT know what that’s about but it’s sending chills down me and my entire families spine, my grandma DIED because of this app."}},{"id":"6179277799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:06Z","userName":"Judging10","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed!","review":"This was honestly one of the worst apps ever created it is an astronomical waste of time and a colossal disappointment this app should be taken down as soon as possible and should take the orange looking head ass fat piece of sh*t with it too ✨😍🧚NOTHING PERSONAL🧚😍✨"}},{"id":"6179277568","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:01Z","userName":"dudtsitcti","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"Disgraceful disgusting disaster disappointing dishonorable horrible terrible App"}},{"id":"6179277518","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T03:36:00Z","userName":"csaledddd","isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting","review":"T e r r i b l e like this has to be a joke"}}]}
