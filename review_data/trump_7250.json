I was so excited to rave about my favorite president but when I opened the app my phone shut down. Turns out, if you’re not 100% white the app will give your phone a virus. I’m so disappointed. My phone will barley function and I just think it’s unfair since I’m only 50% Mexican. I want to embrace the white in me, BUT NO this app is totally racist, unlike the president. I’m afraid ICE is going to show up to my house because I got a warning saying they know about my family. Please DONT GET THIS APP ITS HORRIBLE.","date":"2020-07-09T04:57:42Z","title":"Don’t bother"}},{"id":"6175070981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hejsiendysbshshbz","review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n생각만으로 포근해져\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\nHey I love you (love ya)\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n'Cause I need you\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\nFancy, ooh","date":"2020-07-09T04:29:59Z","title":"A waste"}},{"id":"6174999619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"_Kyloo_","review":"You won’t believe it... so i was using the app, and all of a sudden i get a notification that said and i quote, “If you don’t leave us a five star review within the next twenty four hours, you will regret it” naturally i ignored it because well, yk. But then.... my 24 hours ended, another notification popped up and said, “You didn’t obey the orders, prepare for your mother to pay”, i laughed a little bit, until my mom texted me saying she was in the hospital after receiving a text that said, “we stepped on the crack”.","date":"2020-07-09T04:07:30Z","title":"LITERALLY STEPPED ON A CRACK TO BREAK MY MOMS BACK"}},{"id":"6174903302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Al3x Avalos","review":"This app is really bad!! I barely got it and my whole phone started flit I Ching and turned off, when I barely put my information it kicked me off the app, it’s so laggy also making my phone laggy! I hate this app it’s so horrible I would not recommend getting it! It runs really slow like really slow! Worst app on App Store! I would recommend taking it off! Really bad app, this has never happened to me before, this app is so glitchy and laggy! Don’t download it! HORRIBLE AND BAD APP!

Our generation will not be strung along by the same old tricks as past generations have. There is no silence anymore. \n\n   The dumb people who cling to your “logic” will not rise above us.

Being that I am half indian I felt it was a little racist, but I trekked forward nonetheless. Then I starting seeing threats everywhere. In ads, on the side of my screen, etc. I had no choice but to google it but nothing came up. I am worried. I don't have any elephants but frankly I still wouldn't like them to be stolen from me. Had to delete, it threatened me with things that don't exist :c","date":"2020-07-09T03:28:44Z","title":"I dunno about this app man.."}},{"id":"6174846117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Kyoshihasabonetopickwithyou","review":"First, the problems started with the app sending a message saying that tea was just hot leaf juice. Then, it had the audacity to start endorsing a guy from the desert who stole a flying buffalo and muzzled him. Next, it started sending spam text messages to my girlfriend and she decided to take a trip on Space X to the moon to never come back. Meanwhile, it doesn’t even have the courtesy to say that my life has been rough, buddy. Only the Apple algorithm, master of all App Store elements, can bring peace and balance to the store.","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:52Z","title":"This app was absolutely buggy beyond belief"}},{"id":"6174816434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"rat rat city","review":"This app stole my house I downloaded the app for some random reason and I was at my cousins house at the time then I rode my pet dragon to my house and my house wasn’t there so I went to my other cousins house on my pet unicorn then I went to go look for a new house but couldn’t find any so I slept at my cousins house then I saw I downloaded the app and uninstalled it I got back on my pet and went to see my other pets where my house was but then I saw my house and then I flew my pet fly to my cousins house to tell her that I found my house","date":"2020-07-09T03:12:09Z","title":"HORRIBLE I CANT EVEN"}},{"id":"6174799541","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"kay.bishop","review":"This app is god awful, many people told me this app made their phone great again, however they were WRONG. After I got this it, it randomly started deleting my other apps based off their content and would make my phone start overheating every time I opened it. It definitely needs to be replaced with a better app. Something that’s completely different from the current one, this app is damaging my phone and I’m afraid it will make it irreparable if it isn’t fixed in the next few months.","date":"2020-07-09T03:07:13Z","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6174770160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"asxfghjkl358075","review":"Ive been a MAGA supporter since before 9/11. I’m all for building the wall but this app is a disgrace to our beautiful land of the free. Logistics, the app design was awful and I couldn’t submit my vote through it. Not only that, but wait for this, it has black people on it supporting trump. Who thinks of this? MAGA is only, and I mean only, supposed to be for our beautiful pale complexion like us caucasians. We can’t have those uglies on our side. This app was a real atrocity and my vote for November will have to go to Nicki Minaj herself.","date":"2020-07-09T02:58:12Z","title":"Trump App: worst thing that’s happened since 9/11"}}]}
