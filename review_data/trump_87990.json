The fact that he has let Russia put bounties on our respected vets, the fact that he hasn’t been seen wearing a mask during a global pandemic, the mishandling of the pandemic, the time he retweeted a video of his supporters saying “white power”,the rush to reopen too early, his disturbing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, or the fact that this man isn’t a politician. He’s never been one, however he is a “businessman” that filed bankruptcy 6 times. He never built his wealth from being a genius businessman, he inherited it, and is a well known con man. And let’s talk a about how he wants to give jobs to the US. He definitely wants to create jobs here, right? Well it seems fishy that he wants to create jobs here, however he manufactures his merchandise in China. Let’s talk about it the threat he poses against our 1st amendment right. Apparently he’s trying to throw you behind bars for a year because you exercise it. Let’s talk about his “patriotism”, the “patriot” who dodged the draft? Or the “patriot” who ignored the fact that Russia put bounties on US vets. I’m not even going to talk about the racism and bigotry, you can do your own research. Let’s talk about his sexual assault allegations and why people call Biden “creepy”. Trump has been accused of sexual assault twice as many times as Biden but Biden is the creepy one? Well let me ask you, what’s creepier, smelling someone’s hair, or saying things like “I’m gonna be dating her in 10 years” (to a young girl) or “if she weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her”? If you still think hair smelling is creepier, maybe this quote will do the job. “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” Or.... \"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\" Talking about serial rapist Jeffrey Epstein. Let’s do the right thing for the nation and vote Biden 2020."}},{"id":"6172354800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t need to explain","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:56:51Z","userName":"hatden umboli","review":"Don’t need to explain"}},{"id":"6172339986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app ALMOST killed me","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:52:49Z","userName":"nanjdhsggshsjwiuysgsvdbsbjs","review":"Do not download this app it could cause death 😍🧚🏻✨"}},{"id":"6172290957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:39:09Z","userName":"yaight!!!!","review":"Just get the app and rate it 1 star"}},{"id":"6172282576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"disgusting app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:36:44Z","userName":"Corabells","review":"i downloaded this app to further worship my lord and savior, donald trump. instead it gave me this liberal virus that infected my phone and killed my first born child! very disappointed."}},{"id":"6172256172","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"BLM, HSL, ALM,NALM,","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T13:29:25Z","userName":"M258393","review":"Not only is trump a racist and I hate him.
