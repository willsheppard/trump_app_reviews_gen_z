It promotes rapists but also insults those who want a better life for themselves, the ones who are the backbone of a community yet are still attacked. In fact it shames them for wanting speech.

YOU MUST REMOVE THIS!","rating":1,"userName":"ishaanjoestar","title":"This app is too offensive","date":"2020-07-09T17:14:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177518515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is very bad.
