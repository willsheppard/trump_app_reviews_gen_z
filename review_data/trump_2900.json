After downloading it immediately sent my emotional support hamster, Craigory, in to a fit of rage. He busted out of his cage with the force of a semi-truck barreling down the highway at 120mph. He grew to 3x his normal size and spoke in a heavy southern accent telling me to vote for trump. he picked me up by the collar and pinned me against the wall (it was low key kinda kinky). I fumbled for my phone and frantically tried to delete the app. It was too late. Craigory looked me dead in the eyes and swallowed me whole. I’ve been in here for 37 days and i’ve been joined by my blind deaf paralyzed german shepard, Reggie. We’re running out of food and i’m scared i’ll have to eat Reggie. Please send help. Craigory won’t let me out until i vote.","userName":"Mlemlord"}},{"id":"6175831502","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:06:36Z","title":"Fake News!🧚✨🌺🤡🤩","rating":1,"review":"This app is just awful, I tried to open it and it just kicked me right out, then after trying to open it again, there was nothing but a white screen;  finally after about 15min I decided to come back to the app and it finally loaded.🙄 I started reading some of the articles and the absolute clownery on this app is bewildering!🤡 They only have news articles that fit their racist narratives and awful ideas! 👎  How can we have a president that’s always waving around the words, “Fake News” when his app is the literal definition of, “fake news”? This app is just awful, I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.🚮 Don’t get it unless you love disappointing you’re and you family!\n🦋🧚✨🌺💅","userName":"Ilbapc"}},{"id":"6175539934","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:24:19Z","title":"🧚🏻✌🏼🥰🧚🏼\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"This app is horrible it took 9 weeks just to download, and when it finally did download it was a absolute joke. It started playing the little einstein’s theme song (which is a bop) but not the reason I downloaded the app. Once the song stopped playing it brought to the home page where there was a picture of Trumps nudes. You could see his little 🍤 pp. WHICH MY 2 YEAR OLD SISTER SAW BECAUSE SHE WAS LISTING TO THE EINSTEINS THEME SONG. After the picture popped up it just froze there and I couldn’t do anything about. My phone was literally just his nudes for 3 days. I ended up having to get a new phone and destroying my other one because it was to ugly to look at. In conclusion please don’t get this app unless you want to be scarred for life.","userName":"Kfjdhdjdhddj"}},{"id":"6175339034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:05:47Z","title":"I’m so disappointed in you Oran- i mean Trump .! 😔","rating":1,"review":"Bro when i tell you my back started hurting sooo bad when i downloaded this app . like it hurt sooo bad to where my mom had to take me to the hospital . and guess what the heck they said to me and her when we went . they had the nerve to tell me that i had corona from some app called tRuMp 2o2o . bruh . i was pooping oranges for the rest of my entire life dude . bruh this app will most definitely give you diarrhea . and it’s going to most definitely give you the coron bruh . don’t get this wack app . get weed factory . that makes you sooo happy bruh . like . it’s a weed factory . not some orange jus hanging on your screen . while hiding in a bunker . 😐 . bro unless you want corona and diarrhea DO NOT i freaking repeat .

Once they hit my baby with a car, and then did a drive by on my kids, I knew it was bad. Honestly, I was a trump supporter until then, all Eastern European officials came to my door and hacked my phone to delete the app. Because of the mafia killing my children, ive had to permanently relocate. Not to mention the smell of the app makes me vomit. Also you can’t forget that you are being recorded the whole time, and they sneak into your house to set up cameras once you download. THEY ALSO USE A LOW FREQUENCY SOUND WAVE TO TRY AND BRAINWASH YOU!!!! THIS DESTROYED MY FAMILY AND NOW ALL OF RUSSIA KNOWS WHO I AM AND I AM ALSO BEING ABDUCTED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THOS APPOPPPPPPHELPMEESHPLEASE","userName":"cbeaudet813"}},{"id":"6175149799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:55:38Z","title":"No no no no NO!!","rating":1,"review":"So my friend Nessa B told me to get this app and literally... it was the worst decision I have ever made!!! There is live footage of Donald J. Trump dropkicking his own son and a White House employee who was simply bringing him a sandwich. I very much dislike how you can see such violence on an app!!! If the conservative government likes to censor the media and only use news stories that help them, why couldn’t they censor this app!!! It was horrible that immediately after opening it and my family and I got death threats by Mr. Trump himself. It made my mom cry. It also tried to hack me and tried to steal my credit card info!!! Apple please consider taking this dangerous and sketchy app off the AppStore!! It started to make my phone glitchy and laggy as well... Very upset.","userName":"leoonsthomas"}},{"id":"6175107192","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:41:31Z","title":"Put my grandkids at risk!","rating":1,"review":"I am not very good with technology, but when I heard our amazing president had his own app, I knew I needed to download it. Sometimes it can be hard to keep track of things through other platforms, so I saw this as the perfect opportunity for me. However, once I got this app, it made my phone go ballistic! It would send me so many notifications that my phone would randomly power off. My grandkids wanted to see the app because they’re “so good at technology these days” ( 🙄!) and they discovered that it had all of their contact information along with our address. It then went to a camera screen and started recording them. I felt so invaded and disgusted! 😡 Sincerely, a very angry Grandmother.","userName":"This us ridiculous"}},{"id":"6174883040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:31:41Z","title":"AWFUL APP","rating":1,"review":"this is app is beyond horrible. Right when I opened it I wanted to instantly be racist and homophobic and I don’t know about you but I’d perfer that not to happen. I don’t think anyone not even trump himself should download this app it is slowly killing all of our brain cells and soon we will be just as stupid as trump supporter. You can’t see my face right now but it is truly terrified. MY MOTHER got this monstrosity of an APP and went into CARDIAC ARREST and is now in the hospital trying to fight for her life 😭. I wasn’t even able to spend the day with my gal pal Shelby without having a seizure. If you are seeing this PLEASE don’t RUIN your LIFE like I did by installing this devil of an app 😭😭😭😭😭. Please send prayers to my mom my family would really appreciate it 😢","userName":"hxksbsbabuzhxhshajsjdbsh"}},{"id":"6174796553","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:06:19Z","title":"no ❤️","rating":1,"review":"like many of the comments before, my new phone was perfectly fine until i installed this app. completely glitched me out of my phone, too many notifications, and annoying messages. also, trump is a pedo and i don’t want an app to remind me ❤️ \n\n also free barron 😼 \n#biden2020\n\njoey🤠its🔫not🤮funny🥶you🤩know💥i🥳hurt🦄my🥀ankle🩹omg🧴its💔getting🦧dark🐍where🐳are🐣you🦋joey🐚joey🍊are🎈you🏀in🎮the💄basement👑\n\nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆\n\nsir🙄 I'm😲 not👀 sure😼 why🔪 you 😀 are🙇 here🌬️\n\nR😘R☺️R🙈ROLLLL💫ûp⬆️tœ👠thè😇PAERTYYY🎊🎈🎁ŵid🤣mŷ🥳CrAzy🤪pInK👚ŵįggggg💇\u200D♀️\n\nPicture 📸 my 😚 booty 🍑 up 👆 in 3D🤪 I’ll 👹 shake🙌 my 🥳 booty🍑 in🤩 my 🤗 own😯 movie🎞\n\ni🥵climed🧭out🥫of👋my🔒head🤯and⛸watched⏰myself👈implode💥a👅thought💭without ❌a⚠️body💤 oughta🎤be🐝the🏎 shot🔫\n\nlilhuddy 👦🏿cocoa💖puff😹puff🩸udi🌲upa🐸po😺poe👄udi👹upæ🎂pupa😢bō🤠tsee🥵tsa😆wae✨\n\nwhy❓don't⌛we🔪just👽R͜͡E͜͡L͜͡A͜͡X͜͡X͜͡X͜͡X͜͡😩and🤬turn🦷on🦾the💅r̥ͦḁͦd̥ͦi̥ͦo̥ͦ📻 would👿you😼like💕卂爪爪爪爪👹or🤪 ቻጠጠጠጠ👺\n\nGreat👍Grandma👵you👉always😌know😂just🥰what❓say 💬 oh 😚JSJSBSISHSIAAJBSIWGWOSHSIWSJB😎WOWBWIWBWIEH 😅Ecrhismus😜\n\nDid☺️you😘 hear👂🏽the😆jingling 🥳of🤢the🤡sleighbells👻that🤥is👄one👁of🤥my🐭favorite🐞SOUNDASANAAA🙈","userName":"~•mae•~"}},{"id":"6174713826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:41:08Z","title":"Bad Hot dog Sauce","rating":1,"review":"Once My malnourished hot dog got cooked, so then I paddled my flowties down to the river to find a new beaver. 🩱The blankets were so cold when I got home, so hot that they froze my heat pipes.😾 The aftermath was so terrible, I found out my mom😱 had taken my chair to go for a quick dive where I came from, 🤷\u200D♀️ after that the gang of bike leaders decided to ask me to marry them one by one 💐💍 then we adopted five pet snails 🐌 they ate my kangaroo🦘 but then my kangaroo jumped into a pond and brought my curtains with so it took a while to dive for my hamsters 🐹 cage... so I found out that after so many licks of a tootsie pop and kill your horseradish flavor like how TRUMP IS KILLING TikTOK.
