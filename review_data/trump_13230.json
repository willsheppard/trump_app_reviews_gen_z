The sound made my 97 year old grandmothers ears bleed. After she slipped on the blood and broke her elbow. We then smelled something burning. Yup, our house lit on fire. When I ran out I saw orange RATS that looked like the president. They held a ritual around my burning house chatting “Donald Trump is a racist”.  I am and will be forever in shock and pain. My grandmother lost her hearing along with her ears. Never again will we associate with this app.","title":"Horrible.

While I was on this app looking for news about our ROACH president I stumbled upon a paragraph and while i was reading the paragraph a ROACH appeared on my screen. It was truly disgusting and then my phone glitches into an orbit. All the sudden it started to smell FISHY. But as i deleted this app all of the things were gone such as roaches, glitching, and fish smells.

Also when I looked up who trump was a Cheeto puff came up, I really thought we would have had a racist president for once in a while since that Barack Obama","title":"I’m angryyy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:07:20Z","userName":"followmyinsta@zayra_arlette","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173365908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The owner of this app has threatened to send my mom back to Mexico😔. Not just that but the king Cheeto has been looking a little rough lately ever since no one showed up to his rally. We don’t stan ugly people so I’m thinking about going left. Sorry but daddy anonymous has been looking real good lately and this app just took way to long to download and has failed to provide me with any useful information so overall it’s a waste of storage guys.","title":"🤩🧚🏻\u200D♀️TRASH🙈💖","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:47Z","userName":"my green card xoxo","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173365065","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i saw this app for this pedophi- i mean guy who looked like the president trump🤔and i thought i’d follow his campaign but this weird fat orange oompa loompa. and he had all these stupid ridiculous statements abt a wall😕 i was like super confused and then i looked him up and found out that willy wonka’s chocolate factory was actually the white house😱 and that the oompa loompa rap- i mean loved💕 a bunch of twelve years old children.

Because he’s struggling against biden, and is salty. Took 4 hours to download, but I totally understood because the president himself is slow in many ways. Got in the app and asked for $200 otherwise he would take away my house. So I put in $200. Then he asked for another 1.2 thousand dollars otherwise he would take my car away. Just don’t download save your life and vote Biden 2020","title":"Terrible!

I’ve see other reviews talking about the same thing so just don’t download this app it’s a waste of space and isn’t very informative, a better app to learn more about our president is Tik Tok! It is very informative and a great app to use and interact with and it isn’t glitchy or slow!","title":"Glitchy and slow🙄🤦🏽\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:33:52Z","userName":"Elizabeth✨😍","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173273586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do not get, this app tried to change my political views and made gen z very mad 😡 gen z will not be stopped until the world ends we are what's keeping the world from falling into pieces and you wanna try and tell us that we are stupid and we are wrong, no, you (older generations) are, because you don't tell us what we've done wrong and how to correct it, but we know that almost everything we've done is absolutly fine.","title":"Gen z WILL win 🥰🟠","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:28:58Z","userName":"ella.koala","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173218974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I swear this app is soInconvenience not helpful at all I open up the ab and I was disappointed because I saw this orange man who claims to be the president but still no one has no respect for him because he’s a rapist which there is proof and he racist because this man keeps in keeps on trying to block and put it away about black lives matters by that any other person even though US would never be nothing without colored people","title":"The worst","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:10:54Z","userName":"rncusnce","isEdited":false}}]}
