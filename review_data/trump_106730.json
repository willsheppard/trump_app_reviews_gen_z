What?\n\nWhat are you doing? Get up!\n\nMom and Dad have been calling you\n\nfor an hour.\n\nYou're about to be late for\n\nyour first day of middle school.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, geez! How did that happen?\n\nGo, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!\n\nShe sent me to get you\n\nwhile she waits in the car!\n\n(EXCLAIMS)\n\nWhat are you doing? What's goingon?\n\nGetting ready for...\n\n(HOOTING)\n\n...school.\n\nAre you insane?\n\nSchool doesn't start till next week.\n\nAnd, FYI, school doesn't start\n\nat 4:\n00 in the morning!\n\nYou woke up Manny.\n\nAnd if he doesn't go back down...\n\nGood morning!\n\nThere is no way he is going back down.\n\nI just wanted to sleep till 6:00.\n\n- Bubby!\n\n- FRANK:\nGo to bed. I got him.\n\nGreg, what are you doing up\n\nmaking all this noise?\n\nIt was Rodrick!

Look at the size\n\nof that flamethrower!\n\nOkay, first of all,\n\nlet me get something straight.\n\nThis is a journal, not a diary.\n\nYeah, I know what it says on the cover.\n\nBut when my mom went out\n\nto buy this thing,\n\nI specifically told her\n\nnot to buy one that said \"diary\" on it.\n\nThis just proves Mom doesn't understand\n\nanything about kids my age.\n\n- GREG:\nHuh?\n\n- Sissy!\n\nThe only reason I agreed to\n\nwrite in this thing is because\n\nwhen I'm rich and famous\n\nI'll have better things to do\n\nthan answer people's stupidquestions\n\nall day long.\n\nGregory, tell us about your childhood!\n\nWere you always so smart and handsome?\n\nHere's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.\n\nSUSAN:\nThat's our boy up there.\n\nWhy did I ever say no to him?\n\nMom got me this thing\n\nso I could write down my feelings\n\nabout starting middle school.\n\nBut I'm gonna be fine.\n\nIt's my best friend, RowleyJefferson,\n\nI'm worried about.\n\nHe's definitely not middle schoolready.\n\nGeronimo!\n\n(WHOOPS)\n\nHe's not quite clear\n\non the concept of growing up.\n\nI want a puppy, a kitty,\n\na gumball machine...\n\nBut anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.\n\nI always figured\n\nthey'd make a movie about my life.\n\nBut I didn't think\n\nthey'd start the story here.\n\nBecause, seriously,\n\nwho wants to see a movie about a kid\n\nwho's stuck in middle school\n\nwith a bunch of morons?\n\n(ALARM BUZZING)\n\n(GROANS)\n\n(RODRICK EXCLAIMING)\n\nThree days, no shower.

So, look.\n\nMom asked me to give you some advice\n\nabout middle school.\n\nIt's real simple.\n\nDon't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone.\n\nDon't go anywhere.\n\nDon't sit down. Don't raise your hand.\n\nDon't go to the bathroom.\n\nDon't get noticed.\n\nDon't choose the wrong locker. Don't...\n\nWho am I kidding?\n\nYou'll be dead or homeschooled\n\nby the end of the year, anyway.\n\nAnd don't be seen with Rowley.\n\n(EXCLAIMING)\n\nManny, stop it!
