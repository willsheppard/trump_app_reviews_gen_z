From the beginning this app was terrible it took TWO DAYS to download but i was willing to wait if it meant i could see his wrinkly little cheeto. after two long days i opened and was very disappointed not only was there no nudes but there was nothing just trumps beautiful sexy orange face which i jacked off too since there was nothing else to do in the app. when i finished i closed the app and thought nothing of it but in the next couple of days my life changed for the worst. i woke up the next day and i heard a lot of ruckus coming from downstairs so i went to check what was going on THERES WAS 20 KARENS and some old white guys turns out the app tells you where other trump supporters live. i asked them to leave multiple times but they just kept refusing so i took out my gun because #2ndamendmentright and i killed them all. now i’m going to jail for a week because i’m white but moral of the story unless you want murder charges and NO NUDES i’d advice you to not download it DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT","userName":"stream daechwita 👁👅👁"}},{"id":"6175980353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:56:02Z","title":"Weird smell?","rating":1,"review":"I saw the reviews that it took a long time to download but I was willing to wait for a chance to be virtually connected to my lord and savior DJP (side note, DJ pee... sick DJ name, possibly new career choice?) \nSo I've been waiting for this app to download since the 2016 election and finally just in time to make my 2020 all better, it finally finished downloading! As soon as it was running I noticed a weird smell starting to come from my phone?? I can only describe it as if you ate a whole jumbo bag of Cheetos, passed them through, and then kept the feces to use as a new natural deodorant. Still I wasn't going to let that deter me from supporting my #1 man. But now I'm afraid it's going too far... the smell has moved from just my phone to now the air vents in my house and my car, all my perfumes and candles have started to smell like it as well, all of my food is starting to smell and taste like it, my own B.O. has started to also, even stepping outside to try and get fresh air is to no avail for it seems as though I'm trapped in a stinky trump bubble. Perhaps if I delete the app it will go away but there's something telling me It might make it worse... I'm leaving this review as a cry for help and a warning to others.","userName":"Doctor sparkle farts"}},{"id":"6175910232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:32:48Z","title":"This is absolutely terrible","rating":1,"review":"This app took over 9 hours to download and this is a brand new phone so the storage is clean then when it finally downloaded it hacked into my account and tracked my phone while i was unaware of this they also hacked my camera and killed my pet bird in my animal game which is absolutely 100% unacceptable they also came to my house and stole my grandmother’s knees my grandmother has not been able to walk since. Then they had the audacity to completely glitch out my phone and now i can even see when Bethany is going shopping with my fam and then I just realized that it was like super loud when people were talking about it haha I was like super lazy and then they were gonna swim and stuff like that was so weird that they had to go look at the same stuff and then they just had to get hit by a bus and it went down the beach so they were still there so I had to get them to go back to school because they were gonna be confused about what it would do with the kids and then they were talking about the same stuff like they had to get them out and then they said that she didn’t have to get a gun or something so she can just go eat them or they get them to go back","userName":"mindyourownbussness"}},{"id":"6177393607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:40Z","title":"keeps crashing","rating":1,"review":"how am i suppose to support our lovely ✨trump✨ if the app keeps crashing??? also why does it discriminate the people under 17 years of age? I personally think everyone should have an eye out for all of his 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 events. If you want to see his events just go online it’s better than this app. We have google for a reason... actually any search browser. i’m very disappointed in this app and our 𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑦  orange :/ and yes i’m definitely upset about the app crashing and nothing else 😌Well maybe it was best that the app crashes as my experiences with it were not at all good. I learned things that made me not like my president as much as i should. this app opened up my eyes. right after he basically exposed himself with his sexist and racist tendencies i wasn’t  sure if i was to support my favorite 🍊. but the crashes solved that for me. if you’re still part of trumps army do better because man this app crashes. i mean i do have a junky 6s but if your for  𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦... this app should respect all phones and all people, oh wait... anyways i think this app needs needs to stop the crashing issue, so if your phone is 6s or lower or really anything don’t get it, it’s a waste of time.","userName":"Nimble Cerberus"}},{"id":"6175907795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:32:03Z","title":"Trash🗑","rating":1,"review":"This needed my location which made me feel unsafe. I hate that most of the people that have this app are upright annoying, dumb, have no common sense, also have no respect for other around them. Also the people that have this app think they are superior then everyone that isn’t white. Also trump supports police officers to take innocent black people lives away, because if he didn’t he would have put a stop to it and not hide in a bunker. Trump is also upright racist and he does not hide it by the comments he makes toward people that are not white, and he treats women with no respect. He does not take things seriously, he also doesn’t take our lives seriously, because if he did he would actually do something that would befit everyone then hide like a little kid.  And y’all want him as a president that’s sad. I don’t care what anyone says I’m ashamed to say he is my president. And if u say that he is a good president then u would mostly like racist, have no common sense, have no respect for anyone but yourself, and up right dumb. I said what I said and said what I meant.💅🏼 it’s a shame that a orange Cheeto puff clown as a president 🤡.

As soon as I downloaded it I felt a gush of very very 🤮bad energy🤮 flood the internets. Anyways, I could not believe my own eyes!!! This app is worse than Parler but that’s a different conversation 😗😗😗🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️ I’m praying for Apple, hopefully this won’t lower their company’s worth by too much, this app is just such a waste of space. Oh, and the rotten tomatoes 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 thing, they are a BAJILLION times better than this app. Frankly, I’d rather eat an entire now of them than reinstall this app onto my phone. Henceforth, I think I shall commit no sin by saying that GEN Z DISAPPROVES OF THIS ABOMINATION. Anyways, I was on my way to ✨church✨ when I saw this lady without her mask, and she sat down next to me. So as I was praying to our 🦋🌻🦋🌻Lord and Savior 😇😇Natural Selection😇🌻🦋🌻🦋🌻🦋🌻the lady started to scream that I was a witch. So I peacefully got up and left, just like all of us will stand up and leave at the upcoming Tr*mp rally. \nAnwyays, DO NOT GET THIS APP and if you ever even consider it, ✨go drink some water sweeties✨ and eat a bowl of 🍅🤡rotten tomatoes🤡🍅 and always remember that all lives can’t matter until black lives matter. \nLove you guys ❤️","userName":"fern 🌿"}},{"id":"6175171083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:03:00Z","title":"Terrible app","rating":1,"review":"This app was horrible. 😁🧚It nearly killed me. It all started when I went on lifeguard duty to protect my fish from drowning,🤝✊🏿💋 when I saw this app. I downloaded it and was curious to see what it could do. 🧚🧚\u200D♂️However I was horrified at the sight of a Cheeto staring into the camera.🧶 I screamed and got distracted enough to where my goldfish sadly drowned.🐤🐣 I went to give it CPR when I saw the Cheeto man running out the screen and trying to hurt my goldfish. 🐛🦋I quickly brought my fish back to life when he got out of the screen and chased me. 🦄🦉🦅I ran downstairs as fast as I could knowing what I had to do.🐍🕷 I went into my pantry quickly looking for the bag. 🐡🐠When I found I faced the bag of takis towards him. 🦒🐫However it didn’t work. 🦚🦜I ran upstairs trying to get him back in the screen and I eventually did. 🐇🕊When I did he brought a virus back with him. 🐕\u200D🦺🦮He hacked into my phone and flew it off a roof. I didn’t know what to do. 🦢🐑So I sent my pet polar bear to get rid of this Cheeto. 🐁🦔When he did my phone was left shattered.💐🌸 So now I am currently writing this from my bathtub in my refrigerator.🔥✨ And I don’t know what to do🧚✨\n \nᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","userName":"flyermaddie"}},{"id":"6175093304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:37:01Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"review":"This app is making me feel obligated to speak my mind. I thought that the “all great leader” would be able to create a app that would actually work but instead he created a hate platform. This app is creating a online feud between white supremacists and the people of the United States. As a president he should not be supporting this; he created this app knowing for well that it would not go well with the people of “his” country yet he did it anyways. As i get he may not care for a few people but what he has done here has affected over half of the population of the country he presidents. As a young representative of this country I believe that he should not of been allowed to create such a monstrous app and that his people should of told him no; like they should have been doing all along. I believe that him creating a app like this shows just yet another reason as to why he should be booted out of presidency. He should not be allowed to flat out terrorize the people of the country he so call cares about; we as a country should of stoped this when he started talking about building a wall. We have given him to much power that now he believes he can do anything so long as he hold the title of president.","userName":"thisworldsucksbooty"}},{"id":"6174939875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:48:39Z","title":"Worst App Ever","rating":1,"review":"i was minding my own business when this app bursted into my apartment. he (i asked his pronouns) did not knock. he did not use the front door. he can in through the window in the dead of night. i was knitting the socks of fate when i noticed his presence. he tied me up with my own yarn. he proceeded to pillage my pantry (very rude) and usurp my marshmallows. he placed the entire bag in the microwave and set it to “high”. the bag grew and it grew. i was powerless. the app watched, amused at my sticky situation. the marshmallows continued their nefarious expansion over all my worldly possessions, everything i had procured since i was a wee lad: my collection of stolen family photos, my variety of cursed childhood toys, and my director’s cut copies of lord of the rings, all absorbed by the beast. the marshmallow was rapidly approaching. i cried out for help, hoping one of my neighbors would come to my aid. the app did not like this. he scuttled close and whispered in my ear: “fake news.” only then did the marshmallow overtake me. i am writing this from inside the beast. i have been in here for days, i am unsure of how many. time is hard in the sticky darkness. i do not ask for aid. i am too far gone. i warm of one thing: this app must be stopped for the good of humanity.","userName":"MarshmallowMatey"}},{"id":"6177672327","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:02:06Z","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"review":"This app is SCARY!! When I opened it I saw this Oompa Loompa looking Cheeto on the front. I then fell off of the Eiffel Tower on top of and SUV that looked like a soggy chicken wing. The SUV was also playing the peppa pig theme song on repeat. It then drove into an elephant in surprise. I was then flung all the way to J U P I T E R, where I then found a talking blob fish. I showed it the app and it picked me up and threw me back to earth. I landed in my back yard and hopped on my pet penguin who then flew me to the hospital. I was then greeted by a female cactus. I showed her the ugly Cheeto I had on my phone and she hit me with her apple 87 times! I jumped to New England to see if I could find my watermelon flavored lollipop that’s shaped like a star. I couldn’t find it so I cried and then teleported to Jones BBQ And Foot Massage. It was old and run down. There I found a lotion bottle putting barbecue sauce on his toes. I screamed and it started chasing me. I attacked with a flower and used my magical glitter bee powers, but it got to me and ate my toes, fingernails, and then ears. It pulled a squid from le turtles pants and used it to ~pop~ my head off. At last I am now writing this from the Heaven of llamas. I am only here because this is a ~horrible~ app. I can say it was the death of me. Anyways, bye y’all.","userName":"chiflada sophie"}}]}
