It looked like it had been hacked or something and I could touch anything on it. It turned off and I could only get it back on today after over 20 hours of keeping it charged and off. All of my photos of my family were deleted and my phone is now acting extremely weird. Do not download. I’m worried all my private information was given away and my privacy is gone","rating":1,"title":"This crashed my entire phone","date":"2020-07-09T08:36:52Z","userName":"Reviewer8974","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175739979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app is extremely slow and caused my phone to overheat. My phone melted in my hands and now my hand and the phone have melted together. I then started developing a fever and thought it might be because of the app. Turns out the app gave me COVID-19 but then when I checked the app it told me that COVID-19 is not real and that Trump isn’t responsible for the murder of over 134,000 Americans. Seems like the app provides misinformation. The app also told me Trump is trying to defund schools because he now wants to murder children and doesn’t care about anything but his orange face paint. Very disappointed that the app is fake news.","rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever","date":"2020-07-09T08:35:24Z","userName":"ivankaruokay","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175597519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened up this app and was absolutely horrified, i saw a stale greasy looking cheeto with corn husk for hair✨, it was round 3 am when i opened the app so ya know my homie bill aka my sleep paralysis demon was around and had a peek at what was on my phone and went 👁👄👁 poor billy ran from the corner of my room to under my bed sheets, poor bill was horrified sir was shaking from the fear of that bad cheeto 😔 he was so shooken up he hasnt been able to resume his normal sleep paralysis demon duties, i know take bill with me to therapy💫 so we can both find peace after that awful sight that is the greasy cheeto at the white house🧚\u200D♂️✨","rating":1,"title":"My sleep paralysis demon is less scary🧚✨","date":"2020-07-09T07:45:38Z","userName":"Toaster_explotion","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175134838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So when I found out my glorious president had an app to keep track of whatever he does to make our gracious country b e t t e r, I just had to use it. But when I opened up the app, it immediately crashed and I had to keep trying to use it without crashing but I got it. But every time I used an app after opening this one, that one would crash too. Now my phone is relatively new so it couldn’t be my phone doing this. If you would like to have every single one of your apps crash after using this one, you’ve come to the right by place.","rating":1,"title":"High Hopes but let down","date":"2020-07-09T04:50:38Z","userName":"Egggnesss","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174928779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to see news about the president but when I got on it I was met with an older, saggier, and uglier version of Sebastian bails. His orangeness left me in shock that my dead mother rose from her ashes and asked me what was wrong.  I couldn’t say a word so I just tilted my phone so she could see the monstrosity on my screen. She gasped in horror and fell to the floor, dead for the second time. I was so depressed days after that I had to go to therapy for awhile. The therapy hasn’t helped completely and I’m left with ptsd.  I do not recommend getting this app as it can cause death, seizures, and mental scarring.","rating":1,"title":"My mother is dead because of this app","date":"2020-07-09T03:45:13Z","userName":"delete tiktok i dare you","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174843832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If I could I’d give this a no star but I can’t. This was such a bad app. When I was eating I opened the app and ketchup fell on my fries. This made me so mad because clearly fries are supposed to be dipped in ketchup then later when the app was open my boyfriend texted me telling me he wanted to break up. After that I found a roach in my oven when I was looking at the app. This was the last straw for me because I wanted my boyfriend back, wanted to dip my fries, and wanted that roach out. So I deleted the app because I knew it was causing all of this and it was. After I deleted it everything went back to normal.","rating":1,"title":"Worse app ever","date":"2020-07-09T03:20:11Z","userName":"me and my cousin stories","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174536316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was on the app just to get a view on politics then my dog wanted to look too i thought that’s normal considering my dog can read and is interested in the political world!!then out of no where his eyes popped out of his head as he read “trump 2020” and he died right there and then!!!i took him to the vet to see why he died from that they said because my dog read such a scary and terrible statement he got scared and traumatized so he died. i would sue this company but i’m not old enough. my beloved dog died. this is bs and beware of your dogs dying guys!this is the worst app possible and i believe this should be taken down IMMEDIATELY!!","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY DOG!","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:56Z","userName":"cayy:))","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174533647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can not bare to see this app succeed. It should never succeed with how awful it is. My husband (ex husband) is a trump supporter and he wanted to take custody of my kids, right? So, what happened was I downloaded the app after reading the uplifting reviews and it took ALL my information. I personally would get a restraining order against my pet monkey if I could, however this app is still awful. Whoever created this killed my grandma and I recommend advil for anyone trying to read this review. Thanks for reading and continue supporting AOC, 2020! Hope I get to see my kids soon!!💝💞💕💓💓💘💖💓💞💗💞💞💓","rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Awful🧚\u200D♀️💕","date":"2020-07-09T01:49:11Z","userName":"leahhgaray","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174461301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is inappropriate and wrong for the United States of America. The fact that my kids can see this app and have access to it is apalling, they are scared for their lives of the Orange dude. I can’t issue this enough that this app should be taken off the App Store. This is the worst app that the Apple store had ever had and honestly brings apple terrible media. Why want to ruin your reputation over a Cheeto? The app also glitches a bunch of the times, manipulated people into voting, has misleading information, and vile words that scare children to death. 💀get this off the App Store before I sue","rating":1,"title":"How do I give this app 0 stars","date":"2020-07-09T01:28:41Z","userName":"victoria mikaelson123","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174415895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Nowhere on this app description is there a warning for the DISGUSTING images shown. Absolutely horrified. I opened this app to se a great orange PIG staring at me. It immediately possessed my child, infecting her with the Karanavirus. As she screamed that she was being threatened and would not hesitate to call the police, my youngest son began building a wall out of LEGO’s before yeeting himself out a window to harass employees, shouting about his rights. My eyes grew wider and wider at the horrific sight of the Cheeto colored man, but luckily my phone exploded. Terrified, I performed SEVERAL exorcisms to rid my home of the vibes. HOWEVER, I still had to spend several thousand dollars on therapy. do NOT download this app.","rating":1,"title":"Traumatized","date":"2020-07-09T01:14:56Z","userName":"Cakers01","isEdited":false}}]}
