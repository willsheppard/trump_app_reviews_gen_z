I also noticed that there was a giraffe watching me through my window and it was giving me very dirty looks and chanting “vote trump or die” over and over again, so I got scared and deleted the app and the giraffe disappeared and my dog stopped eating his leg. I warn you all, please watch out, and keep an eye out for your children."}},{"id":"6174863939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"My phone got a virus","date":"2020-07-09T03:26:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MotherJacky538","review":"I downloaded this awful app and my phone started glitching and then it completely turned off. I took it to a expert to get my virus removed and it erase all my credit card information it completely wiped my phone clean. All of my pictures of my loved ones are gone, all the pictures of my children since they were born to them now are completely gone.

I’m sorry I don’t feel comfortable giving my phone number to a Chetto. And after I closed the app and deleted it, a dinosaur came through my  window and put my dog in the microwave. So at that point I had no option but to give home to my Chinese neighbors. The next thing you know, I made the Dino into Dino nuggets. Let me tell you, those were the best Dino nuggets I’ve had in my LIFE! But over all this was a horrible app"}},{"id":"6174824350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:29Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jbabyyuh","review":"Where shall I start?\n1. This app sent me 50-60 notifications every single day.\n2. As soon as I downloaded it, my phone’s battery drained so quickly, and it began shutting down randomly. I suspected it was the app, so I deleted it and the problem stopped.\n3. I started getting random calls from people from North Korea. I answered one, and the person on the other end told me that they were watching me! I asked them what I was doing, and they responded “eating spaghetti” (I WAS EATING SPAGHETTI!!!!!). This app somehow watches you and tracks what you’re doing. This is terrifying!\n\nI AM WARNING YOU! DO! NOT! DOWNLOAD! THIS! APP!\nThe app somehow gets into your phone and messes with the software, ultimately ruining it! I had to get a new phone number to get the random people to stop calling me!\n\nDo not download this app!"}},{"id":"6174782084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"dropped my Cheetos because of this","date":"2020-07-09T03:01:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheeto person","review":"I just got a bag of Cheetos and then all of a sudden I got blasted with notifications I didn’t even have them turned on.

Now trump is trying to band TikTok from the USA but we will not go down without a fight and that is why we are writing these bad reviews on this app because we Will be able to take it down if the stars on here or down under one so therefore trump you’re going down and all the other Trump supporters and that’s on what Period"}},{"id":"6174716792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"can’t believe my eyes","date":"2020-07-09T02:42:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"eyesaretorched","review":"I was so excited to use this app to support our so beloved president, but as soon as the app loaded, everything in my house started glitching. My lights turned pink, my bed is now on the CEILING. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. My dog stared meowing and now he’s slowly starting to gain super powers. He can FLY now. That’s not even the worst part, my phone turned into and AIRPLANE and flew away. I’m literally typing this review on a toaster right now. I am absolutely APPALLED.

Before it’s installation my health was amazing. But following its download I started to feel sick all the time: I was constantly throwing up, my hair was falling out, and I never felt weaker. I went to the doctor to figure out what it was and it turns out I have testicular cancer. My doctor estimates that it formed at the exact time I got this app and thanks to this app I will most likely be dead in a few months. If I make to November I will vote for the president that didn’t give me cancer, Joe Biden"}},{"id":"6174679214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨💕😌🧚\u200D♀️no🧚\u200D♀️😌💕✨ stan weki meki not a racist president","date":"2020-07-09T02:30:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"stan weki meki✨✨","review":"Turn on the light and we could be like\nYeah ready?\nMa ma ma oopsy (oopsy) yeah\n하루에 세 번 um\n아니 열 번쯤 (we got that we got that)\n문득 니 생각이 나\n멈칫 난 내게 놀라 no, no, no\n감정의 롤러코스터\n그 안에 갇혀 어지러 아찔해 (hmm now)\n그동안 셀 수 없이\n모른 척했던 서툰\n니 표현이 신경 쓰여 난\n슬금슬금 보여 빤한 니 마음\n아니 근데 한 발짝만 더 뒤로\n솔직히 나도 날 모르겠는걸\n싫진 않지만 아직은\n곤란해 oopsy woo (no no no)\n어쩌지 oopsy 천천히 yeah\n무심코 건넨 한 마디에\n요동친 네 심장 소린\n비밀로 간직해 줄게\nWoo 자꾸만 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\nWoo 난 몰래 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\nYeah 뭘까 분명히 나도 좀 싫지는 않은데 왜\n약간 시간이 필요해 미안 일방적이야\n이기적인 말투와 맘에도 없는 말들\n이해해줘 oh\n하나 더 말하자면 너의 그 표현\n대담하고 적극적인 게 내 스타일이야\n나만 보면 빨개지는 반응은 귀여운데\n내가 뭘 더 해야 할지 몰라 참\n슬금슬금 보여 빤한 니 마음\n아니 근데 한 발짝만 더 뒤로\n솔직히 나도 날 모르겠는걸\n싫진 않지만 아직은\n곤란해 oopsy woo (no no no)\n어쩌지 oopsy 천천히 yeah\n무심코 건넨 한 마디에\n요동친 네 심장 소린\n비밀로 간직해 줄게\nWoo 자꾸만 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\nWoo 난 몰래 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\n아슬아슬해 알 듯 말 듯 해\n우리 사이 선 가깝고 먼\n넘기 힘든 그 경계가\nTurn on the light and we could be?\n곤란해 oopsy woo (no no no)\n어쩌지 oopsy 천천히 yeah\n무심코 건넨 한 마디에\n요동친 네 심장 소린\n비밀로 간직해 줄게 (yeah)\nWoo 자꾸만 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\nWoo 난 몰래 oopsy\n내 맘을 can you see woo\nTurn on the light and we could be like"}}]}
