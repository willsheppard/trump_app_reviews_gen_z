A second feature film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water also complements the series, and received its premiere in theaters in the United States on February 6, 2015.

To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on Rocko's Modern Life as a voice actor. SpongeBob was originally to be named SpongeBoy, but the name was already in use for a mop product. Upon finding it out, Hillenburg decided to use the name \"SpongeBob.\" He chose \"SquarePants\" as a family name, as it referred to the character's square shape and it had a \"nice ring to it.\"","title":"i dont like you 👎😾😾"}},{"id":"6178066626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"2020 is trash 2020","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:05:55Z","review":"donald trump if you think you can ban tiktok without a fight from gen z you are very mistaken. you can delete tiktok because us TEENAGERS hurt your wittle feelings at your WHITE supremacy rally.
