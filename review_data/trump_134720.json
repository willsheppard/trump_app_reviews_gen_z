God was I terribly mistaken. I open the app only to back out immediately after seeing... well id rather not say exactly what I saw ( I don’t want to revisit the nightmares). So, given the circumstances, you know with him being the raci- oop I mean sexis- I mean rapis- I mean pedoph- I meant the President he is, Jesus autocorrect! He deserves all that’s coming his way! He is such a great president for so many reasons, for starters: He treated the whole Pandemic situation SO well! I mean cmon he managed to single handily cause numerous amounts of lives to be lost due to him lifting stay at home restrictions ENTIRELY too soon. Oh, and let’s not forget him calling African Americans Thugs, only for asking for equal protection! Ahh so great! Ooh and we can’t forget him sexualizing dozens of woman and NEVER being held accountable for his actions 😄Yes ! This is our President 😍 not to mention he’s a hunk like cmon now 😩Chester The Cheetah guy has nothing on him 🥵🥵 whew Daddy issues amiright 😩? Anyways, Trump 2020 ooh and make sure you make the casket see through so he can continue his luscious tan from Hell. ❤️\n\nOops- Almost forgot, Stan Charli For Clear Skin ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:09:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Yeah, No ❤️"}}]}
