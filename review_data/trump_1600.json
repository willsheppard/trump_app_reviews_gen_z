I tried it for a day and well I have some words. \nFirst off, every fact I used off this app was entirely wrong. The news published made 0 sense. It was like the person who wrote it was illiterate themselves. Then I noticed something awful, I became dumber too. I couldn’t form sentences accurately, I couldn’t read, or comprehend anything... literally I had to put this through google translate so people could understand me. It is absolutely crazy. Lastly the app literally broke my phone, I had to give this review off of my computer because my phone literally snapped itself in half when I downloaded it. \n\nAnyways I really hope this helps!","title":"Literally broke my phone and brain","rating":1,"userName":"You won't win with Gen Z","date":"2020-07-08T21:24:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173635339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Regina: Wait.

As when I tried to download it, it took 2 WEEKS TO DOWNLOAD!!!! When the app finally decided to open, weird pictures of young children kept popping up! They kept saying something along the line of... Rae Pist? I don’t know who that is but you guys really need to look into that! At least now I got my tickets to the rally so I can listen to that weird orange guy rant and banter for 2 hours like a child, and have my ears bleed 😋 Oh wait, I just remembered, gosh I completely forgot I have to stay home and aid my mother who is sick from the Corona virus... you know, the virus that he has done absolutely nothing about accept make worse than any other country IN THE WORLD. Gosh, I love my president!

I have some words for you. How do you think that America was ever great and why do you think it was great? Well turns out it never was great for people of color, minorities, migrants. You made it worse for them not better. And you think you’re so powerful but no bunker boy, your only fans and supporters are old people who have dementia and thought the good old days was when they lynched people of color. Your only supporters are teenagers and middle aged people who are insecure and only look to please people. Bruh your impact has never been a good one and if this whole virus didn’t happen, you would be impeached. Also I rate this app 1 star because I’m not one of those old people with dementia and I’m not a middle aged or teenager who has problems.

But other than that the app didn’t let me do anything because it kept freezing and wouldn’t let me press a button, the picture of the app is also horrible that he should just change the picture to black or even better,DELETE IT. It has an unstable setting, it also has child pornography, racism, and teaches me how to kill myself so I wouldn’t consider this app to exist, please delete it if you love ur own kind,\n\nPssst, tiktok lives matter✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿❤️","title":"WORTHLESS","rating":1,"userName":"thisappshouldbedeletedperiodt","date":"2020-07-08T19:22:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173475213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"TERRIBLE APP it had ads to sell toes for $59 when ik a much better place for that even worse they tried to tell me to buy kylie jenners skincare?! the app can even hear u when i was singing black and yellow my phone started beeping like crazy and a bunch a southern ignorant arrogant racist white supremacist cane to my house surround it and started chanting we. love. trump. it took forever to get them to leave but when i gave all of them an orange 🍊 they finally left cuz they thought the orange was trump. terrible app doesn’t show any news just shows dumb ads and this haven’t happened to me yet but on my friends app trumps nude popped up?! that is unacceptable wish i could give it a 0 out of 5 review!!!","title":"STOP CHANTING AT MY HOUSE","rating":4,"userName":"fúck donald trump","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173299982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is not good at all. First off it took 20 minutes to download, I have things to do and do not have to time to waste. I would have wanted to see our amazing fellow Cheeto in action sooner. Second this is, people on the app we’re saying very hate full things such as. “Trump 2020” and “trump is the best” you see this go against my religion and i would definitely NOT want my kids to hear this type of language and behavior. This is just shame full. The worst thing about this app is that there were VERY inappropriate pictures when u first log on to the website. This is not ok, this website needs to be taken down from the App Store immediately! I will be switching my kids to watch BLM protest on tik tok because of this app. You have lost a supporter.

Though after I used it my phone started shutting on and off. I Took it to the App Store and found out that the app had put a virus on my phone. I’m extremely upset to where I had to buy another phone when mine was brand new. My husband had found out that I downloaded this app and he doesn’t like trump, so he hit me and raped me. My parents have also disowned me. My husband kicked me out. This app brought extremely bad luck and I want compensation for it. This app needs to be removed immediately!!! It’s like satan was casting an evil spell on me to have bad luck. This president is a satanist and after I got kicked out I started seeing demons. He definitely placed some witchcraft on this app. I demand money for my troubles. How absolutely disgusting and horrible. This app was made by the devil himself. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"roundlilpotato","date":"2020-07-08T18:24:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173236810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if you have any sort of brain in that head of yours you will not download this app. i downloaded this app and my entire life took a turn. i no longer have a house, job, money, and my 17 kids have all been taken away from me. all because i downloaded this app. absolutely nothing good will come from it. possible side affects include but are not limited to: extreme blood loss, falling out teeth, getting arrested, losing your home, job and kids (what happened to me), getting your life support taken (also happened to me), brain wash and ending up in places you know not how to get back to where you came from, and death. yes. you could die. the day i got this app a car rammed right through my kitchen window and i. almost. died. so! if you have ANY SENSE AT ALL. do not download this app. thank you for your time ❤️ #goingwithbiden","title":"⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD⚠️ *possible fatality*","rating":1,"userName":"anysaneadult2020","date":"2020-07-08T18:16:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173218838","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve read some reviews by trump supporters on here saying that all the people leaving bad reviews are not educated or too young to vote. Well from someone that is old enough to vote and is a very well educated student at one the best Ivy League law schools in the country, I can say that Donald Trump is a true abomination to America. He is ruining this country every day that he sits in the White House and is doing the farthest things from protecting our freedoms. He is slowly trying to strip them away and wants to rule in a fascists seeking which is very much against our constitutional rights. For those of you who still support him please look around and realize what you are actually supporting. You are supporting hate and dictatorship which is not what our country is about. This app is awful and there should be absolutely no platform that supports such a hateful and ignorant person.","title":"ruining our country","rating":1,"userName":"columbiaw law student🤙🏼","date":"2020-07-08T18:10:51Z","isEdited":false}}]}
