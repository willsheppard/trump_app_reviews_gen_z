My friend also had the same experience. Plus the ads were about roaches and flies dancing to a ritual while sacrificing a dog. That’s animal abuse. This app is so bad it needs to be taken off the App Store ASAP. Thank you and I hope I never see this app again. - Gen Z","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:18Z","userName":"Andrea 🥰🦋"}},{"id":"6173617233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever !!!","review":"It gave my phone a horrible virus which turned everything orange!!!!

It took three days, and 200 dollars to turn it back on. As I got on, the app was still not yet downloaded, it took a total of 4 additional hours to download. After that, It wouldn’t let me enter my phone number. I ended up just deleting it. This app is a godamn disgrace to our country. I’m in tears.","date":"2020-07-08T20:15:58Z","userName":"gen fricken z"}},{"id":"6173553174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app is absolutely disgusting now I have to throw my phone across the Pacific Ocean","review":"Absolutely horrible it killed my dog and gave my friend aids all this app has caused for me is pain DO NOT DOWNLOAD the app itself glitches on every phone I try downloading it on anyway Bc of how ugly trump is and Bc the app doesn’t like pedophiles it is incredibly disgusting and negative  makes me throw up in my mouth RIP BALOONGA🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😷😷😷🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🥴🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🥴","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:13Z","userName":"6*#/-;#)#;-)#;4(473"}},{"id":"6173544134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"no✨❤️ stan American Football","review":"Let's just forget\nEverything said\nEverything we did\nBest friends and better halves\nGoodbyes\nAnd the autumn night when we realized\nWe were falling out of love\n(There were some things that were said that weren't Let's just forget\nEverything said\nEverything we did\nBest friends and better halves\nGoodbyes\nAnd the autumn night when we realized\nWe were falling out of love\n(There were some things that were said that weren't meant)\nBut we never did\nNot to be\nOverly dramatic\nI just think it's best\n'Cause you can't miss what you forget\nSo lets just pretend\nEverything and\nAnything between you and me\nWas never meant","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:10Z","userName":"Tushaar Lal"}},{"id":"6173513156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"dOnT down load I had to get a new phone","review":"This app took so long to download and the first thing u see is a ugly looking orange 🍊 I hate oranges 🤢this app is disgusting also the orange has a lot of rankles I think it is rotten it looks gross everyone around me started crying when they saw this disgusting orange thing on the screen I had to throw my phone away and get a whole new one because of this","date":"2020-07-08T19:50:31Z","userName":"KAREN CUT"}},{"id":"6173503388","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I love TikTok","review":"President 🍊your app is horrible it doesn’t run smoothly and took 81%of my battery when I just downloaded it and took 3 days to download ,this app is not it ✨✨and taking down tiktok is not the way to do it tiktok is a very well used app with over 50 mil people and you want to take it down ?

Let alone when I downloaded it and seeing an orange on my screen probably brought my phones value down my 90%. After I recovered from this blow I went back and tried to delete it before it caused anymore damage. It then caused a relapse of trauma and I hope I will never see anything associated with the orange again.","date":"2020-07-08T19:43:02Z","userName":"c•nstant"}},{"id":"6173477640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"Ok so I wanted to download this app to support America’s amazing president but it took forever to downloading and my internet is great.
