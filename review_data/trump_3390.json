I cannot even begin to explain the injustice and racism present on the app. I highly recommend never even glancing at this app. As soon as you click on, there is violence and ugliness. Nobody should ever have to witness the horrifying acts being displayed throughout the platform. The App Store should delete this app, as it is an easy source for predators, and endangers many young teenagers and early adults. In addition, fascism is prevalent in much of the content. The app also took so long to download! As soon as you click on the app, Donald expresses how much hate he has for everyone who is not Republican! I wish I could give this evilness and hatred zero stars!!!! Be careful, and DO NOT download this!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T13:06:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176613701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible app would not recommend 😔✨🦋🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"Karla 💗🍒","review":"OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.\n\nANAKIN: You underestimate my power!\n\nOBI-WAN: Don't try it.\n\nANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.\n\nANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.\n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness!\n\nOBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.\n\nANAKIN: I hate you!\n\nOBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.\n\nANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.\n\nOBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.\n\nHe runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.","date":"2020-07-09T13:02:40Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176492394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"1 out of 5 STARS😡😡😡","userName":"grandma sally🇺🇸🦅🌷","review":"I AM ABSOLUTELY LIVID. I downloaded this app with high expectations and was EXTREMELY disappointed. Not only does it freeze and I have to restart the app, but it wants my mobile phone number!😠😤 COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. It is so disappointing, I do not want my information to be leaked. I will NOT put my phone number into an app, why does it even need it anyway?! I was going to buy my granddaughter’s Trump hats ( even though their mom is a liberal ) and this app had the AUDACITY to kill the battery on my cell-phone. As a “totally real” trump supporter, this makes me question my vote to Trump. Trump you have served this “great” country well, but your mobile app is completely DESPICABLE. Now I can’t buy my granddaughter’s trump merch!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:29:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176398705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"donald should be ashamed of himself 😣","userName":"luv luv luv😩💅🏼❤️","review":"upon opening the app i saw an orange figure looking at me in a disrespectful manner🤬 at the bottom it asked for my phone number which is very inappropriate considering he already thinks his daughter is hot! 😢 anyways i’m from the south so i’m slightly uneducated due to my trump supporting family💅🏼 i looked at the prices and saw that they were OUTRAGEOUS😡 he’s already a millionaire, why spend $70 ON A PIN when they could be donating to the BLM movement 😩 i hope Donald respectfully donated his money to the movement, lgbtq rights, or any other facilities that are looked down upon 🥰 oh wait i forgot he’s racist, homophobic, and against women’s rights, my bad 🌝 anyways to end this i would like to say #trumpinacasset2020❤️","date":"2020-07-09T12:03:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176343936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app ruined my life","userName":"Francislovesherdaughter","review":"As to show my my undying love ❤️ and dedication towards Donald J Trump I had decided to download this app and the thanks I get is baffling...Just as I’m so excited to feel closer to Trump and jesus 🙌🏻🥰 and incredibly ready to start my adventure with this app it takes TWO WEEKS to download. However because I am such a big supporter I made the HORRIBLE decision to keep it. once it had downloaded this horrible app HACKED my phone and stole ALL my information. I have a 6 year old daughter and I am being anonymously THREATENED by people that they want to KILL her. I have lost 3,000 dollars and my booty picks are now surfing the web.

Not only did it take SEVERAL days for it to install, but upon opening the app my phone immediately shut down. I’ve tried searching for ANY reason as to why the app kept shutting my phone down, but I could not get a clear answer. In addition, my phone became hot and began to slow down. On my 12TH TRY, it finally opened to the main screen where it asked for my mobile number. The SECOND I SUBMITTED IT, I received multiple spam messages from the app with links to various prank websites. This app is a JOKE. I’m FURIOUS!!! I deleted it a week ago and my phone is still experiencing difficulties. If I could rate the app 0/5, I WOULD! 👎🏼👎🏼","date":"2020-07-09T09:58:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175929177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!🤢🤢","userName":"Young little wand","review":"I’m definitely not a liberal so I decided to download to keep up with the real news, you know? Boy was I wrong!! I’m Jewish and apparently Trump supports Nazis. Who knew?! Anyways, this completely non-racist, non-homophobic, non-sexist, angel of a cheeto’s app sent me to a neo-Nazi website!!! It had pictures of Hitler and said that Trump was their new Hitler and they love him because he wants to kill Jews. There were swastikas everywhere and messages saying that they were coming for me! There was no real news on the app and I am in absolute disgust of what I just experienced. I hope Donald Duck over here wants to pay for all the therapy I’m going to need now. Save yourself the trauma waiting to happen and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!😩🤢🤢🗣🗣👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T09:39:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175594085","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","userName":"amanda jonsan","review":"Despicable Me\nIn a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white picket fences with flowering rose bushes, sits a black house with a dead lawn.
