Not only did it not allow me to get past the first page where you need put in your phone number, but the Terms and Policies wasn’t opening up for me to read through as I typically do before downloading any app. I’ve never had such a bad experience with an app.","title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6175685249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"reta y.","date":"2020-07-09T08:16:49Z","review":"this app is horrible! doesn’t work right! this shouldn’t be on here! we shouldn’t promote people who are mean and hurtful. those who exclude people of color, members of the LGBT+, people of other religions, and people who aren’t white. he is sexist and misogynistic. he believes in straight white men, like hilter. anyways he should be kicked out of office and his app doesn’t deserve to be on this store.","title":"WORST APP ON APP STORE!"}},{"id":"6175685054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"photoacorn","date":"2020-07-09T08:16:45Z","review":"Ridiculous , 1, literally took a month for this app to download, got lost in iCloud or something like that I’m not sure but what I am sure of is THIS IS FAKE NEWS.

The virus was so bad I had to go buy a new phone. The app also caused my screen to go black whenever running, and caused my other apps to run slower. All in all, this app is a very slow, unhelpful, disgusting app.","title":"This app is disgusting"}}]}
