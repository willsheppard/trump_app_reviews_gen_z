He has 25 rape allegations, including one with a minor and was associated with Jeffery Epstein. \n2. Called the corona virus a hoax and proceeded to handle the pandemic horribly. \n3. Mocked a handicapped reporter because he didn’t fit his agenda. \n4. Conservatives love to preach about he keeps promises but Mexico never payed for the wall and when he didn’t get enough funding he caused a government shutdown like a baby having a temper tantrum. \n5. Never released his tax returns after his campaign after many people accused him of tax fraud. \n6. Said that he is an expert on windmills and they cause cancer in the same speech. \n7. Accused obama that he was born in Kenya, but Kenya wasn’t even a country when Obama was born. \nThese are just some btw , he is racist , incompetent, a rapist and is unfit for the job. I was a trump supporter at one time but then I educated myself and that is why I no longer support him.","rating":1,"title":"Reasons why trump is a bad president"}},{"id":"6173288476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:33:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hiimpauljkimdieguipoo","review":"Downloaded this app expecting a good app. Boy were my hopes wrong.
