He stole my cats, ate my oats, and murdered my parents. My brother and I are now homeless orphans, who have no one but each other. This app took away everything from me and I curse the day I ever downloaded it."}},{"id":"6174734460","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:47:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TRASH APP üëé","userName":"Shippyman","review":"This app was just awful. Once I downloaded it I realized many glitches and bugs. Along side those, the app created mice that crawled out from under my bed and devoured my pet sabertooth-tiger . I then tried to go to McDonalds because I wanted some nuggets but ended up deleting this app. It was just awful 10/10 do not recommend. Yet again, it‚Äôs a BIG üëé."}},{"id":"6174728754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:45:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT EVER BUY THIS APP!!!!","userName":"kiera21","review":"I bought this app to support the amazing president, but as soon as I did my phone crashed and it just made my phone overall very slow. It kept glitching and making my phone really loud and I own an iphone XS! I would never buy this app again even if it does support the president.

Not only that, this app has some sort of bug that causes it to spread false information, the text is constantly warping to have horrific spelling mistakes. This app overall is terrible.

However what I was met with instead was incessant notifications, a slowed down phone, and pop up ads. Oh, and not to mention because of this app my identity was STOLEN, and I‚Äôm $40,000 in debt due to scammers! This app is a security threat! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT"}}]}
