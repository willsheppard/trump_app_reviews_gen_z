The app tried to send me a maga hat and tried to convince me that women don’t have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Then it started screaming all lives matter at me. It makes me want to hide in a bunker to keep safe.","date":"2020-07-09T14:54:47Z"}},{"id":"6176980204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING!!","userName":"reilly 0315","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app and a big oompa loompa lookin fat cheeto came to my window!! 😱😱 then he threw rats through my window with his witch craft. then i ate some molded cheese that i guess was for the rats but i ate it and died 😵 moral of the story, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! it will haunt youuuuuu😰 better yet, don’t even VOTE for trump 🤢🤮i would give this negative stars if i could. dear\ntrump, ✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️💖 did you fall from heaven? next time, fall harder 💖✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T14:39:19Z"}},{"id":"6176948573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","userName":"Raey Cyist","rating":1,"review":"this app took WEEKS to download. it messed up my phone and took up a lot of storage!
