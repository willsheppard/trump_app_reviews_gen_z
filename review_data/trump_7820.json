It was the most terrifying, grossest, rudest app ever. My eyes have been scarred. As soon as I opened the app I saw a troll dancing nude. My eyes started to burn. I dropped my phone and screamed. My mom picked up my phone and saw the nude troll and her eyes where also burned. My moms eyes fell out of her head because of it. Luckily I have amazing eyes so my didn’t fall out but damage had been done. I think this app should be taken off the App Store. If not I will be very upset.","userName":"nakxgjsnskwjbsnsk","title":"Take this app off the App Store now"}},{"id":"6174300714","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:51Z","review":"Get it lifted\nWha-wha-wha-wha-what?

There are too many bugs and they got my location on and no matter how many times I block them for it to not use my location it still finds a way to use it. Ughh never support Donald trump. He is a fraud.","userName":"setteal for biden","title":"Worst app."}},{"id":"6174256972","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:22:52Z","review":"So I launch the app and there is already a problem...it is incredibly outdated and is clearly not formatted for my phone that is barely a year old. But right away it launches and there is a very disgusting photograph of President Donald Trump. Needless to say, NOT SAFE FOR WORK! The app barely functions and there are massive delays after each input. None of this matters though because the app crashes after barely a minute or you tap the screen twice. This is by far the sorriest excuse of an app and needs to be fixed ASAP!","userName":"Karen Rudau","title":"A sloppy excuse"}},{"id":"6174260383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:24:04Z","review":"This app is literally awful. Besides the fact that my kid literally started crying because he was scared of the gross sweaty pig on my phone screen, this app has a lot of bugs and glitches and overall just doesn’t work properly. Very disappointed 😾","userName":"Ogniewia","title":"🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6174244031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:18:28Z","review":"ever since I’ve downloaded this app to keep up on my loyalty to sir Cheeto, weird things have been happening...first, my sweet aunt Darlene fell off my roof while trying to get a good tan! Second, I was sleeping and heard this chanting sound from under my pillow, and apparently is was a cult of trumpies trying to convert auntie Darlene even though she is now paralyzed from the roof incident. Third, I woke up to find that Darlene had hung up a zoomed in pic of sir Cheetos shrimp. All in all, this app just brings misfortune and therefore doesn’t need to be downloaded.","userName":"123guinea321","title":"misfortune✨🤷\u200D♀️🧚🏾\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6174178549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:54:15Z","review":"this app took 8 full years to finish downloading which wasted all of my time. When it finally did download, I opened the app and my phone lit on fire. Siri started screaming “help me help me” and I had to use a fire extinguisher to get out the fire. Siri died in the fire and her family will be suing the Trump administration for her death. All of my other apps were terrified of this app and developed severe anxiety and depression. 3 of my apps even committed suicide. This app is so terrible and I will never be using it again.","userName":"haley.samantha","title":"worst app i ever downloaded"}},{"id":"6174168212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:50:27Z","review":"So it all started when I woke up and I already knew it was gonna be a bad day then I heard that Zayn Malik had left one direction so cried sooooooooooooooooo muchhh almost decided to run in front of a car but we won’t talk about that anyways he did it for his health which I understood later in but like it kinda hurted to me cause like what would you do that you know how I feel why would to say that you put me in such an uncomfortable situation like you know I’m not happy and you know that I try......Anyways stream ICARUS FALLS AND MIND OF MINE ❤️🌱🏃🏻\u200D♀️🌟💧😡🚣🤚💙😌💦","userName":"Raynuhh","title":"MARCH 25, 2015"}}]}
