I realized this Cheeto looking dude does not want to help us Americans whatsoever (especially minorities). His views are quite disgusting. But also this app glitches every time you use it and the layout was awful. Not worth the download","rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded"}},{"id":"6176919244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:23:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KGCASJ","review":"This app does nothing to help the user understand the policies. All it does is help Trump track your information and send ads to your home. I have received numerous bugs and issues after using this app. He is trying to track us! Ridiculous!","rating":1,"title":"No Real Information"}},{"id":"6176916073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:22:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Emthejemca","review":"So first of all this app took several days to download. once it finally did i got in the app and it kept crashing. like every time i would try to get on it would kick me off of the whole app. not to mention this app takes up A lot of storage.","rating":1,"title":"Do not buy this app"}},{"id":"6176909998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:20:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"boredoppurtunist","review":"This app does not keep me informed!!! And I was so confused the whole time. Not only did it keep crashing on me, it told me to keep america great. And when I asked Siri if America was great she didn’t know!!! I opened the app up to a huge lie. Not only did the app make fake promises and give me false hope so did the boy behind it. GET IT OFF THE APP STORE.","rating":1,"title":"false promises 😭😭😭😭"}},{"id":"6176820005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:57:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Drink Some Water","review":"😡This app, after I downloaded it, made my phone vibrate aggressively non-stop like it was going to explode. 😡It vibrated for 3 and a half hours before it died. 😡My dog had a panic attack because of the vibrations and my phone’s battery is much weaker now. 😡I do NOT recommend this app, especially if you’re not a cis white male! 😡","rating":1,"title":"😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6176810591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:54:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"MagicAdams","review":"If I could rate a 0 stars I would! The privacy agreement in this app does not allow for any privacy! On top of that you immediately have to give your phone number!!! WTH?!?

Very disappointed in this app, you’d think with all the tax cuts he’s giving to the billionaires funding his campaign he could afford better more professional app developers, dang :(","rating":1,"title":"Makes my phone overheat"}},{"id":"6176743655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:36:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen123454354","review":"After the three hours it took to download, I was stuck on the home screen and I could tap anything.

Took several days to even open, took several hours to even loud anything, and it also took me a month to even see this app","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE"}}]}
