Gen Z and every person who sees his stupidity would agree. I do not see how he even got his position in the office. Him and his orange looking forehead shouldn‚Äôt even have a say in what is best for this country. He is one of the worst person I‚Äôve ever seen and I will never call him my ‚Äúpresident‚Äù.","title":"I‚Äôll never call him my ‚Äúpresident‚Äù","userName":"dinos are ded","date":"2020-07-08T17:23:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173067898","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don‚Äôt know why but there‚Äôs always a picture of an orange when i open the app?
