I downloaded the app and the first second it opened it stole my information within the first five minutes and knew that I was Mexican. Upon finding this out, the app kicked me out and ICE came kicking down my door shortly after that. Currently typing this from the ICE detention center. 😤😤😤 They say China is trying to steal our information when this app clearly exists. Anyways, 0/10!","title":"HORRIBLE 😤"}},{"id":"6175574266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:36:57Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😃😋❤️😊","review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded in my life!!!😡😡😡 After taking almost a year to download i finally opened the app only for everything to be in Russian. Now you can imagine my disappointment as I do not speak Russian and I had thought that it was supposed to be the app of Donald Trump the little orange man “running” the country. I’m extremely upset with this app and the fact that it was not forthcoming about its relationship with russia before downloading. IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD I REPEAT DONT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175573816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:36:46Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"weird.trash1","review":"I was looking for an app to support our “ amazing 🧚🏽\u200D♀️🧚🧚🏽\u200D♀️💕” president but the app took 2 day to download and completely filled my storage that wasn’t that full prior to download the app . Also upon opening the app it ask you for credit card information, your home address, and phone number. And in the terms of service it says “ by agreeing to the terms of service you give us permission to do anything with the information you give us .","title":"Terrible app"}},{"id":"6175568043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T07:34:41Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Phaht Poosay","review":"I was very much in love with our handsome pedophilic, racist, homophobic, bigoted, rapist president, until I downloaded this app! I downloaded it because I wanted to give as much love to our president as possible, when it started to call me slurs and send viruses onto my phone, simply for being a lesbian woman! I had to buy a brand new phone and luckily I am able to write this response. -100 stars if I could. I had a proud vote for this obese narcissist, but I guess we’re goin with Biden.","title":"Very disappointed in our lovely bunker boy"}},{"id":"6175471515","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:57:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"wear a mask 😷","review":"I’m writing this to save you from ruining your life. Let me explain: after waiting 48hrs for the app to download, the second it installed my phone fell in the toilet! It’s like the universe knew this campaign should be flushed Bc it’s full of crap. However, that would be tragic to the marine life given that we’re already dealing with climate change. After having to fish my phone out of the toilet water, I proceeded to put in rice but the damage was already done. Trump ruins everything.","title":"Absolute Trash 🤬"}},{"id":"6175403866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:31:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen's daughter Kaighleey","review":"you know i really thought this app was gonna be AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, INCREDIBLE, & INFORMATIVE, but i was so disappointed & shocked to see when i opened the app that it was none of those things. I mean how does this administration expect me to know what they’re up to if their app isn’t even working properly? I am so disappointed in the creators & in the President, this is just unacceptable. Unacceptable. I will be telling the rest of my family to delete it as well bc it is HORRIFYING how this app has no expectations.","title":"Horrible App"}},{"id":"6175253268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:32:53Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"klingon is unamerican 😞","review":"All of the text on this app is in Russian and Klingon😞 it is so unamerican to me that the language is not in Dothraki. Ive often thought of mr. drumpf as Cinderella. Locked away in his ivory tower. Then his fairy godfather gave him an empire of millions and he became the most beautiful belle of the ball. He found his gorgeous Prince Charming in the end, Mike Pence. #minald is my otp🥰😍 now drumpf is no longer using his powers for good😔😱. He’s no longer Cinderella but SCAMella🥴. I hope that he and mike can patch things up because they are the cutest couple ever!! #lovewins Anyways stan luna🥰","title":"scamella strikes back!"}},{"id":"6175225294","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:22:22Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"SusanCalorie","review":"I downloaded this app to show my support for my favorite president and was met with scams asking for my money and credit card information! Now I have credit card spammers calling my phone 24/7 and can’t sleep! Our loyalty is being tested and I am not one to mess with. Additionally, my 64 year old mother is living in the house with me, my husband, and children and is constantly complaining about the scam calls that are distributing her Mahjong sessions. I regret downloading this fake app.","title":"THIS IS A FAKE APP!"}}]}
