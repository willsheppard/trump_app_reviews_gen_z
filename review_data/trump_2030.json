when i downloaded the app my phone started running ridiculously slow. either fix the app or delete completely ! this app also has a very scary person my child is always afraid of. as soon as the person pops up on the screen my child yells are cries ! this app should be deleted completely and people should not waste their time on this. the person this app is advertising is also a very racist creature. me being mexican, i wanted to support this individual but soon noticed how he didn’t even like our ethnicity. this man is worth no ones time and app should be deleted asap.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terribleee!!!"}},{"id":"6174831201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚🧚🧚🌸🌸🌸🌸✨✨✨✨✨🧚🧚🧚","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:28Z","review":"This app stole the money and it is a good idea but I don’t think it is going on it haha was a way of saying it would mean so I guess I wanna is the way you are doing a better way of saying that your dad was just saying you were doing a lot and I don’t know if I can get it together or tomorrow or not but I’ll talk to you later I wanna is that time you get to me I love y’all and I’ll see y’all there so I’ll talk y’all over in about an hour’s I’ll talk y’all over whenever y’all want me and I’ll ask ya mom if y’all can have fun I’ll be sure y’all are going on a date or something like I don’t want you guys aren’t doing anything for me lol sorry lol I’ll be fine I’ll be home soon I wanna is a good night I’ll be home in a little while I don’t know what to say about it tomorrow night I’ll be home soon I love y’all bye see y’all","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Mad 👁👄👁"}},{"id":"6174749750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jwigler","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:02Z","review":"I'm upper, upper class high society\nGod's gift to ballroom notoriety\nAnd I always fill my ballroom\nThe event is never small\nAll the social papers say I've got the biggest balls of all\nI've got big balls\nI've got big balls\nAnd they're such big balls\nDirty big balls\nAnd he's got big balls,\nAnd she's got big balls,\nBut we've got the biggest balls of them all!\nAnd my balls are always bouncing\nMy ballroom always full\nAnd everybody comes and comes again\nIf your name is on the guest list\nNo one can take you higher\nEverybody says I've got great balls of fire!\nI've got big balls\nI've got big balls\nAnd they're such big balls\nDirty big balls\nAnd he's got big balls,\nAnd she's got big balls,\nBut we've got the biggest balls of them all!\nSome balls are held for charity\nAnd some for fancy dress\nBut when they're held for pleasure,\nThey're the balls that I like best.\nAnd my balls are always bouncing,\nTo the left and to the right.\nIt's my belief that my big balls should be held every night.\nI've got big balls\nI've got big balls\nAnd they're such big balls\nDirty big balls\nAnd he's got big balls,\nAnd she's got big balls,\nBut we've got the biggest balls of them all!\nAnd I'm just itching to tell you about them\nOh, we have such wonderful fun\nSeafood cocktail\nCrabs\nCrayfish","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrific App"}},{"id":"6174708430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"carolinecohenn","date":"2020-07-09T02:39:30Z","review":"this app ruined my phone. because i downloaded it my phone completey broke down. when i took it to the apple store they said this wasn’t the first time this had happened when people downloaded the app, and to “STAY AWAY FROM THE APP AT ALL COSTS!!!!”. they said however that this app doesn’t get many downloads in the first place because most trump supporters are too dumb to know how to use an iphone and usually struggle with basic things such as downloading apps or putting a password in. i confirmed that i downloaded the app by accident and that i’m not actually a supporter so they understand and felt bad that the app had given my phone such a bad virus. anyway, never download this app it will completely destroy your phone and also hacks you and steals all your information!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"gave my phone a virus"}},{"id":"6174620648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"miranda cooper's right nub","date":"2020-07-09T02:13:59Z","review":"if you’re wondering how this app will get a kiss kiss since it has no lips and is very ugly, IT WONT ❤️ i open the app and theres a CARROT CHEETO MAN 🥕staring at me and i got so freaked out i threw my phone at the wall 😡and it created a big hole 🕳 in the wall so i went inside to get my phone📲 and i was sucked into an alternate dimention 🌌 and i cant find my way back. 🔙i’ve been out here two 2️⃣ days and i cant do anything on my phone except open this stupid 🤝 app bc it hacked my phone and brought me here 😓 the only other thing here w me is a dinosaur 🦖 that i tried to pet but it bit my hands off 💅🏽so i’m actually typing this w each individual strand of hair on my head 🙆🏼\u200D♀️ and i’m sending this back to the real world with my cat 🐈 named dog 🐕 that accidentally got sucked in here with me. if you see this send help!!

I just can’t do it anymore; the dust on your screen, the smell of cheesy feet that surrounds you as soon as you even think about opening the app; it’s unbearable 🤢🤮. The repetitiveness of having to think about how you are going to answer “why does your family smell like cheetos and feet?” is emotionally, physically, and mentally draining. I advise that no one should buy this app strictly because of the fact that I wouldn’t want anyone else to have to experience the what I have. Thank you for your time and I hope that whoever has downloaded this has deleted it already. My condolences😔.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP IVE EVER DOWNLOADED"}},{"id":"6174510255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"goldieleopard","date":"2020-07-09T01:42:40Z","review":"THIS APP WILL CAUSE YOUR PHONE TO CRASH DON’T DOWNLOAD IT I downloaded this app to keep tabs on my leader, Donald Trump, because I worship him and it brought a virus to my phone. my phone crashed and I was not able to turn it back so I went to get it fixed but when the tech guy looked at it he said the phone was not fixable because of this app. In this society, a phone is very necessary so I was forced to buy a new phone. The tech guy took my SIM card out of my old phone so that I could have all my contacts and data but it ended up bringing the virus from this app to my new phone, which now doesn’t work. so now I have three phones, 2 don’t work, and I have 0 contacts or anything from my old phones. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP I do not want anyone to have to go through this awful experience THIS APP NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DOWN","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD, IT’S A VIRUS"}},{"id":"6174041902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tmwnbt577","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:57Z","review":"As an open minded member of gen z, I downloaded this app to keep up with the President and make informed decisions about this election in November. This, however, is the worst app I’ve ever looked at. Upon opening it, one would think to see patriotic imagery and a brave world leader. Instead, my eyes were assaulted with a moldy Twinkie of a man who looks like he’d be scared by his own shadow. The traitor was a complete disgrace to the American flag he stood so proudly in front of. This pathetic image made me throw up profusely all over my new iPhone 13. The sheer force of the vomit broke the screen and circuits of the phone; I had to buy a completely new phone. Do not get this app unless you are blind, and I would still be careful even if you were. The audio description might even accurately portray the image of this excuse of a human. Biden 2020 \n\nThank you","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP"}},{"id":"6174020721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trap_house_boys❤️❤️","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:03Z","review":"This app is terrible! i got it one night to see what’s the big fuss about it. I had to wait for it to download! it took 2 HOURS! i went to bed after it downloaded and i woke up in the white house! I walked into the main office and guess what i found! Cheeto and his little hotdog getting sprayed orange by Hitler! I ask “What are you doing” and Donald said “What are you doing here?!” i continued to say that “Your app brought me here and i come and see this????!!!!!!” Hitler said “He made me! i came here the same way you did!!! Donald is FORCING ME TO! You can’t see it but his wife is holding a gun to my head!!!” “Omg Donald STOP” Then all of a sudden everything went black and i was back in my bed! My phone started ringing and it said said PRESIDENT I answered it and Donald said tell anyone about this and you’ll be the one giving me a spray tan next!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DisCOuSTinG🤮🤢🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6173990644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Julieepeter","date":"2020-07-08T22:44:40Z","review":"Wow. Just wow. Disgustingly put together. Do my eyes deceive me? How can my brain and eyes hold the power to consume such an ugly creature. An orange creature. A Cheeto. I’d rather be off the perc than access this app again! I’d rather be smellin my dads bald head than access this app again! I’d rather have Karen as my wife than ACCESS THIS APP AGAIN! it’s just so stinky and sweaty this app is...it’s like the cleaning men and ladies forgot to do their job when it came time to make this app. Anyways y’all. My Spanish teacher has a tomato for a head and the croutons I’m about to eat aren’t very appealing so I guess I will just steal the Mona Lisa and put it in the salad of which the southwest grill is a latte because that’s what I told her but she just would not believe me! Estonia is such a beautiful country. So underrated. Moral of story is Cheeto man ruined my day DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Read this review"}}]}
