So I thought to myself... what could I do to support the president and give him some more hype? Hmm... OH I KNOW. He must have an app or something right? So I went to the App Store and saw that he has an app. PERFECT OMG THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. So I downloaded the app and immediately the app kicked me out and I initially thought that was weird but then just went ahead again and got in successfully. I was looking around the app and I was like oh ok but then I had to go eat dinner so I went away from my phone for like 15-20 minutes to do my thing. And then I came back and I got so many notifications from the app saying to go in it or whatever and I was like okay I will later. When I tried clicking on any other app the trump app was like click me before clicking on any other app. I got rly freaked out and decided not to use the app for a while. The next day I decided to go back on my phone to see if there were any changes. I tried to click on another app and again was the same message so I clicked on the trump app in an attempt to get rid of this fiasco. I did but then it randomly shut off my phone and there were suddenly static noises and the visuals were popping up some very disturbing pictures of the president and other people that we shall not discuss. Anyways my phone also started to burn and my hands immediately turned red so I didn't touch my phone and knew something was terribly wrong and it all started when I downloaded that haunted app. I then grabbed oven mitts so I can grab my phone and spent the rest of the day at the Apple store trying to get my phone fixed. All of the workers there made note that every time someone downloads the app, something always goes wrong and the person who downloads it is a sad victim to the many haunted possibilities that they might experience. It took quite a bit to get my phone fixed so because of that I had to get a new phone and now we are here. I mSTRONGLY RECOMMEND that you do not download this app under any circumstances because if you do. Then beware of the consequences that may appear in the future.","title":"Make sure orange man don't get re-elected","isEdited":false,"userName":"Melania- I mena no","date":"2020-07-10T00:16:39Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178675505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app I full of Chinese bots that are trying to give you the Kung Flu!
