I’m typing off my old one! I downloaded it only to have my phone crash and then blow up??!

Even worse the app was full of fake news and racist, sexist, and pro communist information and words. As much as I wanted to support this app, I just couldn't. I would not recommend this app to anyone. It's glitchy and filled with fiction.","title":"Horrible App","userName":"graceobrenherein","date":"2020-07-08T18:17:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
