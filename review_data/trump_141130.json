All of a sudden right after I downloaded the app my email shut down, my phone started glitching, etc. My electronics were on the fritz! How do I know that it was because of the app?! Me and an IT buddy of mine did a full diagnostic on my phone and computer and he informed me that the app made me susceptible to viruses, bugs, etc. So now I sit here with open technology and a heavy heart...if this app did that to my electronics imagine what another 4 years would do to this country.","rating":1,"title":"please readü•∫","date":"2020-07-10T04:34:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179451395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"lilpeachxx","review":"Nothing rhymes with orange.
