After a while the app started spamming me notifications and texts back to back asking if I wanted to donate money and telling me other ways I can support my dear president.\nI was forced to silence the notifications from the app and even when I did it keep spamming me! 😡\nI will be giving this app one star if I could give it any less I would! 😡","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed","date":"2020-06-29T16:36:38Z","userName":"an_angry_karen"}},{"id":"6177743208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to become more or an 🇺🇸american🇺🇸 but when I downloaded it I discovered something tragic had happened.

First entering the app, instead of our fearless leader showing, I saw an 🍊Orange🍊. Just.. An orange. It had hair on it, which lowkey freaked me out, not gonna lie. Second off, the loading icon looked like the nazi symbol (here I thought we weren’t gonna be Germany 2.0) third off, I thought this was a game until it told me it was restricted content, then I thought of the child sex trafficking and noped myself out of there. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone, not unless you want your information out there, like China has ours.","isEdited":false,"title":"⭐️💫✨If there was 0 stars, I’d give it that.🧚\u200D♀️⭐️✨🌟","date":"2020-07-09T18:18:45Z","userName":"Feather P."}},{"id":"6177619332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and as soon as I finished downloading my phone turned off for a complete minute after I was able to get in again all my contacts got deleted and I was no longer able to open social media apps because apparently I had deleted them but they were still on my screen .

It took 10 hours to download and took 30 minutes to load, I timed it. It drained 50% of my battery in 3 minutes, I also timed it. Then it stole all my data and took all my storage! It's so awful!!!! After that 10,300 trump supporters showed up to my door and ate two of my cats. They unhinged their jaw like a snake and swallowed them whole. Then they stole my orange cat and put a blonde wig on him because they thought he was trump. They started chanting about how spray tan is a religion and started sacrificing american flags to my cat!!!! unbelievable!!!! never download this app!","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely awful!!!✨✨✨💖💖💖🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T16:27:09Z","userName":"FennelNoodleSoup"}},{"id":"6177307799","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I woke up one morning after a long night of scrolling through facebook minion memes to see this app on my phone. First thing i noticed was our beautiful orange daddy at the beginning, and thought this app was going to be good, boy was i wrong. It kept making my phone lag when all i wanted to do was play candy crush and text my PTA moms, but it just BROKE my phone. My phone worked perfectly fine before this, so i’m sure it was this app. I couldn’t even contact my sons soccer coach to cheat on my husband, Chad, with. how disappointing. I would like to speak to your manager.","isEdited":false,"title":"WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER","date":"2020-07-09T16:11:04Z","userName":"KarenLovesMinions"}},{"id":"6177297573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"yo this app kinda $ucks like I needed to login with my email or phone number????? pshhhh sounds like some serious caperoonski to me. like cmon i downloaded this app so I could support and keep up with my favorite President but because of how low quality this app is, I think I’ll vote kanye instead not gonna lie. anyways yeah so I tried opening the app before I wrote this, and it just wouldn’t load up! every single time I tried to open the app, it would load for a second, crash, and then bring me back to my home screen. therefore I am leaving a 1 Star review. very unimpressed :(","isEdited":false,"title":"what is this","date":"2020-07-09T16:08:04Z","userName":"Guard182"}}]}
