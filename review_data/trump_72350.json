First off, I am a proud American 🇺🇸 and I love my president. I always have been very supportive of every single thing he does and I have donated lots of money to his campaign. Naturally, I downloaded this app so I could stay informed and do everything I can to help our wonderful president out. It took almost 69 hours for it to download and even longer to open the app for the first time because it took so long to load. After I finally got it opened and loaded, it asked for my phone number. I thought that was strange at first, but I was willing to do it for our special president. About a week after I opened the app for the first time, things started to happen. At first it was little things, like I kept seeing the color orange in my peripheral vision. Then bigger things started to happen, I noticed a spray tanning station set up in my backyard. That was completely out of the ordinary! My girlfriend is a naturally pale person, and has never had any desire to try to look tan. When she got home, I asked her about it, she had absolutely no idea where it came from. We were both very concerned as neither of us knew how that got there. After I took it down, in the morning it appeared again! Throughout the course of a week, my girlfriend and I kept taking it down, only hours later to find it was back up in the backyard. If that isn’t weird, I don’t know what is! Then I started getting the text messages. These messages kept calling me sweetie and love bug, and kept asking me to come over to the white house for a fun night. They got vulgar but I won’t go into detail. Night after night they kept asking me if I would come over and I never responded. Then one night, while my girlfriend was out with her family, I got another text. This one said that if I wouldn’t come over, he would. That freaked me out! I blocked the number and I tried to watch tv to take my mind off that creepy message. After a while, I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up to my girlfriend shaking me. She looked mad! I was so confused at what I did. I asked her and she pointed to me. I looked down and I was completely naked! I had clothes on when I fell asleep! Not only was I completely naked, there were Cheetos laying all around me, and there was even a pair of pink fluffy handcuffs next to my breasts. My phone dinged at that exact moment. We both turned and looked at the screen. It was a text from another random number saying, “I had fun last night, next time try to stay awake! Anyways, I’ll see you tomorrow night and I’ll bring some more toys for us! (winky face)” She broke up with me on the spot, she thought I had been cheating with her! This was the girl that I wanted to marry and this app ruined our entire relationship! I immediately deleted it afterwards and I have never gotten another text message, although sometimes I still smell cheap tanning spray when I wake up. It was a very traumatic experience that I hope no one ever has to go through. If you care about your relationships then please think twice about downloading this app!!!","userName":"Dhfyejdhdhjd","rating":1}},{"id":"6178700587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T00:02:52Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!","review":"Worst app I’ve ever seen, just by opening it up I experienced immediate balding and foot fungus","userName":"wackshit dino","rating":1}},{"id":"6178662493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:48:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible🧚🏾🤢🥱🤮😾💅🏾🤠","review":"this app took 42 days to download. i had high hopes for it being that it is a app for the president but no i couldnt even work the app how sad. he should be ashamed and embarrassed about how trashy this app is. i am entirely disappointed in him. #canceltrump💅🏾🧚🏾🤢🤠🧚🏾😾😢","userName":"madi22z","rating":1}},{"id":"6178606698","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:26:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ewwwww🤢🤢","review":"This app took 3 days to download and my phone caught a virus from the me opening the app.","userName":"the yo-yo bear","rating":1}},{"id":"6178595037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T23:21:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Kanye 2020","review":"🍊he 😱has🤬no😶lips🤯how🤔will😖he😭get😫a😘kiss💔kiss.
