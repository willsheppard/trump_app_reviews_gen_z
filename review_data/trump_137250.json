I was just trying to get information on rallies and etc and learn more about his 2020 campaign and they kept asking me for money, and even made some sexual passes at me that made me REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE as a women. THIS IS AN AWFUL APP, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR ELSE IT WILL DISRUPT STREAMING AND SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES."}},{"id":"6179964225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Poorly executed","date":"2020-07-10T07:39:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Erica Larry","review":"I downloaded this app to see what Donald had in store if he was elected again and there was very little information about any changes he wants to make i just seen a bunch of tweets making claims and allegations that only a small minded american would fall for. The app also kept closing out while i was scrolling and had multiple pop ups asking me to allow the app to access my location which is very distracting"}},{"id":"6179964075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Caused irreversible eye damage","date":"2020-07-10T07:39:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"sexypigeon","review":"After two seconds of downloading my eyes caught fire causing me permanent eye damage! I will never be the same again because of this! It doesn’t tell you about all the side affects and expects us not to hate! If this wasn’t already bad enough this horrible app caused my IQ to go down to zero!

ALL. MY. CONTACTS. including my own, extremely liberal mother. she literally disowned me. i cannot be more serious. i am now living in my car, regretting ever supporting this shallow husk of a man. good luck to anyone who uses it. i wish you the best."}},{"id":"6179963971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-10T07:39:53Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"calxii","review":"all i wanted to do was to see what this man was up to for the up coming election. maybe he could gain my vote. forget that. the app would not open, ever since i downloaded it every other app would crash, i literally couldn’t do anything on my phone what so ever. i eventually had to delete it but after that i had to completely restart my phone just so everything would work again. literally felt like my phone was about to explode with how hot this app made it get. you would think the person running the country would at least have a working app. a new born could do a better job than this, AND it would create a better app. i’d rather have a chimpanzee hyped up on adrenaline sitting in the oval office than this guy."}},{"id":"6179963307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Fake News","date":"2020-07-10T07:39:40Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"07johana70","review":"Don’t know why they have to make everything about politics"}},{"id":"6179963249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible Privacy Policy","date":"2020-07-10T07:39:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"DannyWeathers","review":"This app serves no purpose but to collect your personal information.
