He had wanted to have this on his phone so that he could keep up with politics. I was glad to allow him to download this app until I opened it. On the sign up page, there is a picture of a child rapist as the background! Needless to say, I have deleted the app from my son's phone, and I am extremely disappointed with this app. If any of you have children, I strongly advise you not to let them download this!","title":"There are inappropriate images all over the app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lou_lemon"}},{"id":"6173399167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:11:36Z","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP because also when i came to look for daddy trump it asks for your number right?? and so i thought when i give him my number he’ll come and facetime me as a surprise and all right??

I couldn’t open apps for a few days at most. I see so many people writing reviews about how people voting the app 1 star are childish, but the kids are right! It does glitch your phone. It does take in information, my account at a website called Shein was hacked and I almost ended up buying my whole wishlist! It does NOT benefit anyone but the ones who made this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! You might want to support trump, but this definitely will NOT be worth it. THIS DOESNT EVEN HELP! Please refrain from downloading this horrid app.","title":"HELP","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"yeet dasia"}},{"id":"6173271253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:28:11Z","review":"I downloaded this app in hope of supporting our president but when I opened the app Donald trump came in through the front door and starting stabbing my father 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏 he stabbed him 26 times. After that Donald trump looked at me and threw a 10 dollar bill at me and said “He’ll be fine.” He then walked out the front door and got in his limo. I rushed to my fathers side and held his hand hoping he would stay with me. I quickly called an ambulance. They didn’t arrive in time. That night my father died. \nDO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I REPEAT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP THEY WILL MURDER YOUR LOVED ONES. 😭😭😭🥴🥴","title":"Worst app ever 😭😭","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"riccebowwl"}},{"id":"6173200899","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:04:53Z","review":"I was absolutely disappointed in this app. I mean it’s absolutely atrocious. My phone was freezing constantly, my location was turned on all the time (which I don’t want the government to see where I’m at!). And I kept on getting too many notifications all the time ( probably the government). And don’t get me started on the constant phone calls for telemarketers!! I would occasionally get them but now I get them all the time!!! Don’t download this app, it will make you lose your mind!!!","title":"Fake News.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Melanin Orange"}},{"id":"6173179207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:57:55Z","review":"I only downloaded this app because I had to give it....A HORRIBLE RATING. The fact that an app for this man even exists is outrageous and a waste of money and time. He wants to delete TikTok because people are saying THE TRUTH about him which he classifies as lies, falsehoods, and haters saying bad things about him. Then posting it for everyone to hear. I believe that people shouldn’t speak badly about others and post it on social media. However we are not speaking badly about him, we are rather exposing the truth about this horrible man!","title":"Trump needs to go","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Trains1609"}}]}
