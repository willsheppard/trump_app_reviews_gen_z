And only five minutes later five people broke into my house and chloroformed me. I woke up in a basement tied to a wall and I felt something up my butt, after a while the people that kidnapped me said they had slid a Oompa Loompa up my ass, and they also said they didn’t even need lube. So at the time I am locked in a basement with a Oompa Loompa up my butt, but they said I could send Snapchat streaks.","rating":1,"title":"Oompa loopma","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:35Z","userName":"loose booty judy","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177264156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT BUY THIS APP. Let me tell you about my experience with this application on my cellular device. When i downloaded this, I was so excited to see our beautiful gorgeous handsome hot cheeto president in person!! He is so sexy. HOWEVER!!!! When the app finally downloaded after 62 days, 5 hours, 20 minutes, and 3 seconds, Trump did arrive. He was glorious. I was expecting a beautiful chat with him but instead he MADE ME POOP MY PANTS. It was so gross and embarrassing. Then, he strangled me to death with his fat, meaty hands. Overall, do not buy this app because he will do the same to you.","rating":1,"title":"THIS IS A SCAM!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:29Z","userName":"Pleasedude","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177263751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I myself am a liberal but I downloaded this app wanting to support MY President and about three days of it being on my phone I noticed some weird things happening to my liberal mother. Her hair started to turn piss yellow and then fall out, she gained about 300 pounds, she started to wear orange foundation all the time, her massive penis was declared a micropenis, and she started talking about how she wanted me jailed for believing that black lives matter. I just want my mother back. Don’t download this app if you care anything about your mom.","rating":1,"title":"Give me back my mom!","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:22Z","userName":"Mæsîv Köçk","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177263689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","rating":1,"title":"Replay","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:21Z","userName":"Too laggy, needs girl skins","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177261271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wanted to see what the whole hype was about on the app and I was very disappointed. After downloading the app I had a sudden urge of watching the bee movie. I can’t stop watching it. This app attracts bees and doesn’t make you stop watching the bee movie. I have watched the bee movie around 420 times already and have memorized the whole entire script. And I’ve been stung by a total of 69 bees thus far. This app is dangerous. This app is a hazard especially against people who are allergic to bees. And don’t get me started on how you technically no longer have a life because you spend your whole entire day watching the bee movie. It’s unacceptable. I have technically devoted my life to the bee movie and getting attacked by bees on a daily basis because of this app. Please do not download the app. If you download the app forget about the plans you ever had, just go ahead and throw them out the window. You will be addicted to watching the bee movie and being stung by bees. Anyways.... if your still curious about the bee movie anyways and downloading the app I’ll leave the bee movie script down below. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.🐝🐝🐝\n\nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT. BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second! He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth. BARRY (CONT'D) Hello? His best friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, is on the other end. ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye! JANET BENSON Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! CUT TO: SEQ. 750 - DRIVING TO GRADUATION EXT. BEE SUBURB - MORNING A GARAGE DOOR OPENS. Barry drives out in his CAR. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 3. ANGLE ON: Barry’s friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, standing by the curb. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE: “Frisbee Hits Hive: Internet Down. Bee-stander: “I heard a sound, and next thing I knew...wham-o!.” Barry drives up, stops in front of Adam. Adam jumps in. BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry’s hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations. CUT TO: SEQ. 95 - GRADUATION EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - CONTINUOUS Barry and Adam come to a stop. They exit the car, and fly over the crowd to their seats.","rating":1,"title":"Ahhhh the stings are itchy 🐝🐝🐝","date":"2020-07-09T15:57:37Z","userName":"Alejandra L. 🐝🐝🐝","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177260441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Anyways this Oompa Loompa really thought that he could delete TikTok and then we wouldn’t care no sir NO SIR.  we’re going to fight you he must’ve forgot who we were we are Gen Z and we’re coming for you PERIOD","rating":1,"title":"TikTok 4L lmao🤪","date":"2020-07-09T15:57:22Z","userName":"seya 102","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177260126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"𝑺𝒐 𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒚 𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒓𝒆 𝒍𝒊𝒇𝒆 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒐𝒘𝒏𝒍𝒐𝒂𝒅 𝒊 𝒂𝒎 𝒐𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 92 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒅𝒆𝒂𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊 𝒈𝒐𝒕 𝒐𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒊𝒕 𝒔𝒂𝒊𝒅 𝑯𝑰 𝑺𝑰𝑺𝑻𝑬𝑹𝑺 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒇𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒉𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌 𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝑺𝑷𝑶𝑶𝑲𝒀 𝒔𝒐 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝒘𝒂𝒚 𝒊 𝒅𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒐𝒘𝒏𝒍𝒐𝒂𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕 𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒃𝒆𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒅 🥕𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒐𝒕🥕 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊 𝒘𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒔𝒍𝒆𝒆𝒑 𝒊 𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒓𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒎𝒑 2020 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒐𝒉 𝒔𝒉- 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊 𝒘𝒐𝒌𝒆 𝒖𝒑 𝒑𝒉𝒆𝒘 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓 𝒎𝒚 𝒘𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒊 𝒂𝒎 𝑺𝑷𝑶𝑶𝑲𝑬𝑫 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊 𝒐𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒂𝒈𝒂𝒊𝒏 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒊 𝒄𝒍𝒐𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒐𝒏’𝒕 𝑩𝑬𝑳𝑰𝑬𝑽𝑬 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊 𝒇𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒅 𝒐𝒌 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒚...
