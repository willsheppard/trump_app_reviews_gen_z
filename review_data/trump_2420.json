As soon as I opened it an audio from one of Trumps speeches started to play from my phone and now it won’t turn off!!! I restarted the app, then tried to turn my phone off and back on, then tried to delete the app but nothing works!!! Audios from Trumps speech’s just play super loudly on my phone all the time!! I finally got so fed up I threw my phone off a bridge and got a new one, but as soon as I opened up the new phone an audio started playing again!!!! I’m going insane, even now i am sacrificing my state of mind to write this review because while typing I have to listen to this Cheeto with a hamster on its head talk. This app is evil and Trumps voice will follow you and your phone no matter where you are or what you do.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T11:40:08Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ellie123456462"}},{"id":"6175991272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE HORRENDOUS OUT OF CONTROL","review":"This app is completely and utterly horrible. I cannot explain to you the misfortunes that occurred to me as soon as I downloaded this app. This app is completely and utterly a mess. As soon as I downloaded all of the melanin from my skin… Vanished. When I tell you that I became a suburban, white, 45-year-old, unhappy marriage, School PTA president, Book club loving, drives a sedan, smells like cauliflower and unseasoned chicken, soccer mom...I mean it.😪😪😪 my beautifully melanated skin became white, cracked, and in danger of skin cancer. This app ruined my life...but as SOON as I deleted it I reverted back to my smart, educated, beautiful, caring, loving, democratic, proud, shea butter smelling, and black self. I do not recommend downloading this app unless you would like to develop early onset menopause. Stay safe girlies...yeah❤️...not Trump tho😌✌️💞✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:59:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Yeah❤️ No I didn't ❤️"}},{"id":"6175732601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"Apparently this is number one in news on the App Store yet I have to sign up with my phone number to get the news. That is wrong and it is not fair to those without a phone number. The freedom of the press is being restricted to those who can pay a phone bill, DESPICABLE! Bunker boy needs to evaluate this, do we want a tangerine who suppresses the “news?” I thought not. It is not a very user friendly app, it is hard to navigate, especially for the older population who supports this candidate. If they can’t figure out how to work google maps, can they effectively use an app with a political agenda? The answer is NO. The app is just not nice either, spreading lies, and hate speech. It does not have a lighthearted environment like some other apps, such as TikTok. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS HORRIBLE APP!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:32:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"masporuno"}},{"id":"6175664177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"Words cannot express my disappointment and immense betrayal I felt when I attempted to download the app. The app was not great at all. In fact, it was absolute dog sh** (pun intended you will see why hehe) because it took light years to download and in the meantime, MY DOG DIED WHILE IT WAS DOWNLOADING!!! Now I am a spiritual woman so I truly believe the energy this app released has caused my dog’s heart to fully stop because it is EVIL!!!! When the app installed I thought “okay I have to at least honor my dog’s tragic demise” and IT GLITCHED SO HARD THAT IT STOLE ALL OF MT DATa from MY PHONE!!! I HAD TO BUy an ENTIRELY NEW PHONE AND I CANNOT EVEN AFFORD RENT!!!! I work 4 jobs and am a single parent (who no longer owns a dog) so apple I ask you to please uninstall this app for the sake of my dog’s death. My 4 year old is blind and that dog was her best friend. Thank you.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:09:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"sherrie🕳"}},{"id":"6175663633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely and Utterly Garbage 🤢💀","review":"IF YOU PLAN ON GETTING THIS APP, DONT DO IT I REPEAT DONT DO IT! Upon downloading this app, i’d received a phone call from no other than donald trump himself. I was a bit skeptical, seeing how he’d already been in a relationship, but i’d answered it anyways. After hours of trying to seduce me with nothing but his horrible voice, he grabbed me through the phones and touched me in places he shouldn’t have. That’s right, he sexually harassed me. He then proceeded to discriminate me due to my skin color telling me to go back to my “negro culture and it’s cotton picking ways.” It wasn’t then until my humongous horse shmeat itself had come to save me. It smacked trump in his smug looking face and knocked his toupee off in the process 🧚\u200D♀️ ✨ \nall in all don’t get the app or trump will sexually harass you too 💖✨🧚\u200D♂️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:09:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ya moms 🤪"}},{"id":"6175614857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Deeply Saddend it Didn’t Work","review":"This app steals all of my information. I would be talking about how much I hate racist and all of a sudden it just opens up. I would talk about how I want to go on tik tok and it goes a delete my app. I know it was this app because it opened up my notes and told me it was this app. When my racist grandma talks it opens up and starts saying she’s right and something about Fake News. When I’m out side it keeps opening up and telling me to not wear a mask and that I’m a communists if I do wear one. How does it even see me?!? To top it off I’m a woman and it has a feature with Trumps voice saying “grab her by the p_ssy” it plays on repeat until you say you’ll vote for Trump in 2020. Sad the app doesn’t work because it definitely works for my brain dead cat.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:51:52Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"xoxo gossip boi"}},{"id":"6175394293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Fascist app","review":"This app is trash.. my app made my phone try to grab me by the 🐱and I told it no!!!! Then it proceeded to try and grope my 15 year old niece and I said nope!!! I told the app I would summon Epstein! Then it went into override and started yelling “I don’t know the guy, never met him, I have the best words! Best words ever. I know a lot of good words. I know covfefe! Bigly! WRoooNG!” I told it to stop!!! The app kept making my phone try to hold my hand while I walked down the airplane steps but I had to smack it away! I tried watching ABC news and it kept saying “FAKE NEWS” then my speaker started smoking. I took my phone in to get checked. They said this particular app was causing my phone to short circuit. I have insurance so I got it fixed but I had to leave this review before I deleted it. ✌🏻so bye!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:27:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"LatigoWhip"}},{"id":"6174574499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusting rat🍊","review":"i opened the app to see a rat with orange skin and gross hair. it gaves me daymares! thats not the only part! first i opened the app and saw something called an american flag? ya no. its diary of a wimpy kid now. so 2019. second off the disgusting orange rat with gross hair has a son. hes cute so why does he have himself (a disgusting orange rat with gross hair) as the opening pic? third he racist. like what the diff of poc from whites? they have nicer skin than u! nasty orange rat creature🤢 forth! “make america great again.” it was until u joined mr. orange rat. fifth and last for now. tiktok getting taken down? ya ikr! crazy and stupid. why would it help u? u want all us crazy teens coming at u more? ya okay just warning u. we finna attack uuuuu!! anyways me and pet apple (which is smarter and better looking than u) are outta dis because we HATE IT HERE😚✌️ jk ion wanna kiss u","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"🍑 human not 🍊 rat"}},{"id":"6174572404","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP EVA","review":"This app is the epitome of disappointment and frankly a waste of time. I was in pursuit of downloading Minecraft but then found this app. It looked a little racist at first but I ultimately decided to give the app a chance and put a hold on my Minecraft game (bc I didn’t have enough storage to download both apps to my phone). However I soon found out that there were too many bugs and insignificant claims about some egotistical/perverted Cheeto man who used generational wealth to get rid of any accusations made against him (e.g. racism, xenophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, etc.). My expectations for this app were quite diminished and I became very disappointed because I could have spent my time building my Minecraft house and raising some Minecraft sheep. Total waste of my storage space and my time!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:24Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Das the tea 🍵"}},{"id":"6174555822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Cheeto man is actually a potato man😱😨😯😬🥔","review":"Well hello I downloaded the app cause I needed to order some cheetos to crush for my asmr video. When I pressed on the app it popped up and there was a cheeto man. I was like wow maybe I can order to crush him for my asmr vid. He looked really scary and wrinkly. When I was trying to order him for my asmr video I couldn’t find where to order, so I got mad but then I realized that he wore makeup💄,and he actually looked kinda like a ugly potato. Then I was like oop-🤭 I don’t know is it true but the more you look at 🧐cheeto manthe more he started to look more like a potato. Then I was like “ he is a POTATO MAN!!!” My fish🐠 walked in my room and wanted to know what I was talking about and said “shoot it is a potato,” I deleted the app,  because it didn’t have cheetos that I could crush for my asmr.😪","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:55:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Swenloo"}}]}
