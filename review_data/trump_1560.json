This vile app asked for my information HOW DARE THEY!! THEY ARE VIOLATING MY PRIVACY! They want to hack into my phone to steal my information. These are horrible people who are trying to use the gOoD pEoPlE oF aMeRiCa. They are exploiting us to get even more money. Not to mention the software is super laggy and buggy. Every time I would go on, it would crash which is probably a sign that you shouldn’t vote for Mr. Cheeto von Bunkerboy. Jump scare warning when I finally was able to open the app I was met with the face of the most foul, nasty, and repulsive creature on Earth. It seemed to be the picture of an orange blob with a toupee. Must be the new face of the campaign. Any who basically just don’t download this app if you want to sleep and the trump administration owes me a new phone.","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumps real name is Moe Lester","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:30Z"}},{"id":"6177065313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"It was terrible! 😡😳","rating":1,"review":"What happened was every time I went into the app it would just turn my phone off out of nowhere, It was just SO INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE, and it would just happen out of no where even when I wasn’t on the app it would turn my phone off. And no I’m not apart of some angry tictokers about deleting the app, but however I am against the tictok app being deleted for what ever reason it needs to be, but what I have heard is that they are deleting the app because “ people are useing it too much “, and that is just such a dumb reason to delete a app like what do u guys even have against it, tictok is basically one of the only apps that is keeping the public happy right now due to quarantine. So may I ask WHY delete the tictok app ( my sister won’t stop bothering me until I talked about tictok on a review) all in all I DO NOT recommend the trump app. 🦋","isEdited":false,"userName":"Savanah.campos","date":"2020-07-09T15:02:21Z"}},{"id":"6175743954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"very bad 👺","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support the best president ever 💕💕💕💕💕 but instead of downloading, it hacked my phone >:(. that is very ugly and rude. my phone started to delete all of its data then it went black!

After I uninstall the app my phone is fine but every time I have the app my phone goes crazy. My phone literally flies out of my hand and through my window. One time the app was so powerful it went threw my neighbors window too!🤯 I had to pay 69 dollars back to fix. My pet zebra I stole from the zoo also goes absolutely crazy when I have the app! It ate my mother because the app drives him crazy! Now I’m short windows and a mother! I also have an urge to slap people when I have this app! It has gotten so bad I smacked my teacher and boss right in the kitty! I was fired! This app has turned my life around and NOT FOR THE BETTER! I have to put my zebra down too! This app costs to much money. Overall a 0/10 experience would not recommend.","isEdited":false,"userName":"bsjesjnwkwos","date":"2020-07-09T05:07:45Z"}},{"id":"6174915928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful app 👁👄👁 👎🏽","rating":1,"review":"I was just having a casual day.👩🏽I feel a vibration from my left pocket. 📱 I pick up my phone while squinting my eyes 👁👄—. I have seem to have gotten a text. 👍🏽I read the text messages telling me to download the Official Trump 2020 app.🇺🇸 I took a glance at the name at the top. I see the name Donald J Trump was the one who texted me. 🤭I do as I was told and download the app. I open the app and see someone calling me the n word.😡😡😡😡😾😾😾😾😾 I drop my phone in shock terrified of what’s going on. Then I hear a familiar voice. 👺The voice was by no other than Donald trump.🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀I hear the word monkey said repeatedly.🐒 I tried deleting the app but it wouldn’t let me delete it. Also the app put a virus on my phone that gave me these emojis ( ◠‿◠ )(о´∀`о)^o^(〃ω〃) they may look cute but they’re dangerous. 0/10 don’t recommend even if you support trumpet 🎺😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😾😾😾😾😾😾😾","isEdited":false,"userName":"Alexis_Reviews","date":"2020-07-09T03:41:22Z"}},{"id":"6174598316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"rated 1 star 😔","rating":1,"review":"when i first opened the app i saw trump getting a spray tan NAKED. as you could imagine, it was absolutely terrifying. my kid went on a zoom and their topic was on the US president. guess what my kid said “i saw him getting a spray tan naked and i started crying cause my mom was yelling at me to look away” the teacher looked HORRIFIED and later texted me asking if me and my family were alright. the amount of damage it has done to our eyes hurts my soul 🤮 this happened a month ago. aside from that, the app is a waste of time and the worst app i have come across. it deserves less than one star and i hope it get off the app store. and my kids entertainment today is tiktok, and trump plans to ban it bc of what they planned on there. i KNOW it’s bc of that even if he says it’s not. i will NOT let him take my kids fun away and i hope he suffers for his actions. he has a itty bitty string btw 😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"anatgebanna","date":"2020-07-09T02:07:41Z"}},{"id":"6174585884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not recommend!!!","rating":1,"review":"i just wanted to support our lovely president✨🥰 and as soon as i opened the app i realized i’m not a disgusting racist human being😧 so i thought the app would help me learn how to be ignorant just like our beautiful president so i put in my phone number and what happened!! MY PHONE KEPT GOING OFF WITH GOD AWFUL TEXTS MESSAGES!!! it seemed like donald was texting me personally trying to get with me😟😓 it just all seemed very sketchy so i deleted the app and he still kept texting me saying “vote for trump 2020” and at this point i started crying because he would not stop texting me😭😢 so i eventually threw my phone in the lake and i felt better but then as soon as i got home he somehow got into my email😧!!!!! so i did the smart thing and changed my identity please remove this app it has hurt me very deeply and i’m scared what it has done for other people😖😞☹️😢. \n- amy duncan✨🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"Imgay224","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:12Z"}},{"id":"6174350628","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤮🤚🏻❌🚫","rating":1,"review":"This app insults me as a Cheetos fan since i can no longer look at one without thinking of the not so great spray tan of the blob fish that popped up when i first opened the app, i have now decided as a hispanic-indo-chinese-native american-venezuelan-puertorican-italian-brazilian woman that i cannot stan this app , it does not load correctly and takes ages to actually show any information. it will be the worst possible thing for me to do since it will make me lose my mind during this quarantine and now they are forcing the opening of schools making me have less time on my phone to attempt to work thsi app since it has so many glitches it actually makes me wanna kms . in over all this app is my last resort for news , i will now rely on tiktok and twitter which are more credible and reliable than this app. in conclusion i am ashamed of ever even downloading this app!","isEdited":false,"userName":"djfjjfj","date":"2020-07-09T00:54:39Z"}},{"id":"6174112737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely terrifying","rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app, there was an orange man who looked very constipated holding up a fist. I was very scared. This happened 5 days ago and still, every night I wake up in a cold sweat after seeing this man in my nightmares. When I got through the first steps of the app, there were even more pictures of the orange man! I don’t understand why anyone would get this app. Apparently, some people even buy merch with this man’s face or name on it! Every time I see someone in the street with a anything that has trump on it, (which is the orange man’s name, for everyone who didn’t know) I start violently vomiting all over. It’s becoming dangerous to my health and if you ask me, I think we should ban all of this from the United States forever, since this is severely effecting my physical (and mental) health. Please leave a similar review if you have had this experience.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Trump makes me vomit","date":"2020-07-08T23:30:02Z"}},{"id":"6173875448","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No I am not accepting this","rating":1,"review":"Hello my name is wwh jin which stands for world wide handsome Jin obviously and to get in with the review I would like to say this app is horrible what if children download this and what if my 5 sons download this “jungkook, taehyung, JIMIN, yoongi and the sun hobi” me and my husband WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO OUR FAMILY I AM VERY UPSET AND I SUGGEST YOU GUYS TAKE OFF THIS HORRIBLE APP AND LEAVE TIKTOK BC MY FAMILY AND I ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THAT APP now onto the review First off when I first open this app it showed something terrible that it scared me for life 😭 I saw a naked picture of an orange guy with an orange on his hand eating the poor orange and a dog was there on that same picture looking at the poor human eating his friend orange 😔😭 and ⚫️👄⚫️ my eyes 👀MY BEAUTIFUL EYES THAT I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY STUFF FOR MY SON JUNGKOOK BANANA MILK AND I WAS STILL SCARED 😔👋🏼 I SUGGEST YHIS APP TO BE CLOSED DOWN FOR LIFE 😒 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH YOU, NOW HAVE FUN READING THIS IM GOING TO GO STREAM STAY GOLD 💞🧚🏻 I SUGGEST U GUYS DO THAT TOO 🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰 bye bye","isEdited":false,"userName":"kiwibreanna","date":"2020-07-08T22:01:59Z"}}]}
