Lets find out- I downloaded this app in hopes of getting a better understanding of our AMAZING president Trump’s up coming plans. But, when i waited over two hours for it to download, once it downloaded, the sexy talented Adam from Sm6 band magically appeared in my house. I was shocked and really confused. Adam told me that he only had 5 min left to live bc of trump. I cried and prayed to god in hopes of Adam being able to stay alive. Adam then started to try and put my cat, Waffles, in the microwave for some odd reason. Then, Adam and i started to fight over Waffles because I didn’t want him to die as well. Adam then went into my fridge and started to drink my whole bottle of ranch and ate it all in 3 seconds. I couldn’t believe my eyes.At that point Adam only had 2 more min left to live so he told me to tell his whole fam that he loves them, especially emily🥰😉, i broke down crying because I was so sad he was going to leave me. I was in love w him. Then he kissed me and told me he loved me. I had never felt love like that before. Then, Adam disappeared and I fell to the floor because I knew this was the only way to set Adam free from his fam. But i was so sad because the love of my life was taken from me. So no, I do not recommend this app at all. it took away the love of my love and took away the worlds most hottest, amazing, talented musicians of our time. RIP Adam❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6177344399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨settleforbiden2020✨","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:11Z","title":"✨why🧚","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is an abomination! here i am, trying to support the country’s gReAtEsT pReSiDeNt, mr.orange himself, when the app wouldn’t even download. when it did finally download a week later, it would crash every time i opened the app. if i could leave a 0 star rating i would.","rating":1}},{"id":"6177343316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♂️🌸🌺✨💕","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:53Z","title":"The fairy emojis are so you don’t get butt hurt","isEdited":false,"review":"🧚\u200D♂️🌸🌺✨💕worst app EVER... it gave my phone a (wait for it) VIRUS🧚\u200D♂️🌸🌺✨💕","rating":1}},{"id":"6177342894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"somewhere over the rainbow, IL","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:46Z","title":"trump sucks😗✌️","isEdited":false,"review":"ok so im doing this because of people trying to delete the app but mostly because trump is literally one of the worst people i have ever had the mistake of knowing about. he is racist sexist homophobic transphobic and a total and utter idiot. i have no idea how people support him when he is blatantly such and abolute jerk. i would rather have a potted plant as our president than this a-hole. to finish my monologue i would just like to say why does trump think its ok to dictate and try to control every aspect of our life??","rating":1}},{"id":"6177342812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gabe12j23","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:44Z","title":"This app sucks🤧","isEdited":false,"review":"Ion wanna see a orange man as soon as I get on a app and it had a racist and sexist man on it","rating":1}},{"id":"6177342576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cecilia Andres","date":"2020-07-09T16:20:40Z","title":"TRASH 🤮","isEdited":false,"review":"As soon as i opens the app I was frightened by the sight of a big orange man.
