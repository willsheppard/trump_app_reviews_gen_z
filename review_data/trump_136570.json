I personally believe it should be taken down and is no use for any person. It has so many glitches and almost broke my phone and once I deleted the app my phone finally started working again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS IT WILL BREAK YOUR PHONE!!!"}},{"id":"6180181591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:59:26Z","title":"The worst app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Kandy2k20","rating":1,"review":"This is a serious review. The app runs very slow and it took a long time to download as well. When I entered the app it didn’t give any Information about trumps plans for the US and if that’s not the sole purpose of the app then what is ? It also glitches a lot and spread a virus. When I tried to delete it my phone shut down a couple of times and it infuriates me thinking about how our POTUS can’t even create a proper app. How can I put my trust in a man that can’t even create a proper and useful app. Also ever since he had become president he has done nothing, and I repeat nothing beneficial for this country. All he has been doing is lazying around and throwing tantrums left and right. When he almost declared world war three all because he couldn’t admit he was wrong left me baffled. Many have not voted for Hillary because “women are too emotional” but trump only proved that men are the only ones who make haste decisions based on emotions. Even when he was running it was pure ridiculousness but I was too blinded by my racist,homophobic, misogynistic, and capitalistic views or should I say republican beliefs because he had promised to make America great again. When he said that I had high hopes but no sir I was bamboozled. I hate to admit it but Donald trump has been by far the worst POTUS America has ever had and I would know because I am 69 years old turning 70 this coming December. And solely because of this experience I have decided to leave my republican views and switched to Democrat. Will NOT be voting for him this year, make the right choice and don’t even bother downloading this horrendous app. Also just a side note, why are us old folks deciding for the future generations. They will be more affected by the president so why is the decision making left to us. Many would say because we are much wiser but that is incorrect. One does not become more wise because of age but because of experiences and boy has our rash decision of making this fool president put them through many. I can’t even remember where I left my slippers☹️. Am I using these faces correctly ? I am ashamed to have taken part in letting this country be run by a mad man."}},{"id":"6180181576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:59:26Z","title":"No sir 👎🏼","isEdited":false,"userName":"ganggangboo","rating":1,"review":"Trump is no good. \nPeriod"}},{"id":"6180181132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:59:16Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anonymous 5694","rating":1,"review":"If I could I would rate this app a zero out of five this app was TRAUMATIZING.  I open the app to see a grown man wearing a wig dipped in Cheeto dust. I know Cheetos are good but man he took it to an extent which I could NEVER. I then felt sick to my stomach and quickly got out of the app. Then shortly after I started to get SPAM CALLS that were THREATENING to hack into my phone, bank a-count etc. Please do NOT download this app it could lead to serious consequences."}},{"id":"6180180811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:59:08Z","title":"it made my phone glitch","isEdited":false,"userName":"CartoonSlinger.com","rating":1,"review":"when i first opened the app it crashed my phone and i had to restart it 3 times to get it running again. the app deleted along with a couple other apps in my phone. i have no idea how this is possible but i’m definitely not downloading it again."}},{"id":"6180180218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:58:55Z","title":"The best campaign for the best president ever!","isEdited":false,"userName":"ginding out","rating":5,"review":"I love this app, it’s professional, informative and easy. but more then that, this app and its bad ratings are just a proof of a bunch of inexperienced brainwashed people that don’t like our president, the greatest president ever in the most amazing free country ever, a country that had troops die to give and protect the freedom that allows them to act so rebellious and opinionated even about politics they don’t know and now they are on social media telling each others hey let’s download the app and leave bad reviews..... little kids in 2nd grade kind of trouble. Yet our president and most of his supporters ignore them so they can continue to build and preserve the greatest country ever! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #TRUMP2020❤️❤️❤️"}}]}
