Not to mention as soon as I got on to the app I began sending me horribly inappropriate messages. I have children that use this phone. I’m not mad I’m disappointed.","title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false,"userName":"Cathy 🎀","date":"2020-07-09T13:27:43Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176706948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has caused my phone to sporadically shut down. Starts within just 15 minutes of initial download. I believe this app has slowly been wiping my phone. Based on recent reviews, i suggest shutting this app down. Better yet, just shut the whole campaign down. 10/10 would NOT recommend (both the app and potential presidency).","title":"APP MALFUNCTIONS 🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"Issa Revolution","date":"2020-07-09T13:27:18Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176632789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app had such a bad set up and it hacked all of my data don’t buy this unless you want your iPad or phone or whatever you using it on to note every single thing about you May you give your phone number and so basically Trump had your phone number so he could call you don’t buy this app","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"gbtff","date":"2020-07-09T13:07:45Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176626818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app on the App Store. As soon as I opened the app it asked for my phone number which I thought was extremely inappropriate. I decided to do it anyway because I thought what could go wrong. I was immediately spammed with advertisements involving vulgar and offensive terms and ideas. HIGHLY don’t recommend getting this app","title":"🥳👍🏻🤚🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"Girl141414141414","date":"2020-07-09T13:06:12Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176590290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I would have expected better from a president who puts so much thought and care into everything he does, but this app is simply not functional. The only thing I think I could compare it to is his abysmal leadership during a pandemic, or perhaps his abhorrent immigration policies. This app killed my crops and caused me to go blind.","title":"Poorly designed, lags, kills children","isEdited":false,"userName":"Evelyn Mostrom","date":"2020-07-09T12:56:16Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176561963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I decided to download this app so that I could learn a few things about Trump, but the app took For Ever to download. And once I opened the app, my phone glitches out and shut down, and it took an hour for my phone to turn back on. I am 100% sure this app is the cause of my phone randomly starting to glitch.","title":"Just Terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"orazberry","date":"2020-07-09T12:48:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176496021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app I have ever used in my entire life. It works so slowly and it’s so glitchy. It doesn’t help me with anything and it’s so useless. Not to mention how stupid the name of it is. What kind of name is Trump? Doesn’t make much sense to me. This app stands for the worst ideals and it’s so so terrible. I can’t stand one more day of having this app downloaded on my phone.","title":"Worst App Ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"Terrible App Hater","date":"2020-07-09T12:30:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176380944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app didn’t download for days and I had to get rid of other apps just to be able to download this one. When I opened it I saw such a horrendous photo that it has scared me into having nightmares. I have had to see multiple therapists after downloading this app. I IMPLORE you to NOT get this app, unless you want nightmares too😭.","title":"Scared me so much I have nightmares","isEdited":false,"userName":"legomymeggo","date":"2020-07-09T11:58:51Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176381773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is a great app.   All the negative reviews are from the children who don’t like President Trump.   The app works great and his supports are smart enough to know and discern the lies by the left.","title":"#Trump2020","isEdited":false,"userName":"KristiL","date":"2020-07-09T11:59:05Z","rating":5}},{"id":"6176347124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Why did this take so long to get this app it literally took days to install I just don’t get why so many people are getting this app and leaving good reviews and saying how “great” this app is, like this is the worst app I have EVER gotten in my life!!! 🤬🤬 And I pity the next person to even think of getting this absolutely horrible good for nothing app","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jaiden~chan","date":"2020-07-09T11:49:20Z","rating":1}}]}
