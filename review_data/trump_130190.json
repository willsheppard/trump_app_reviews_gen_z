When I first opened the app a large orange blob appeared on the screen and began screaming at me. He yelled that he was going to take away my rights because I was a dirty little queer. This experience traumatized me slightly but I decided to look past it and continue using the app. After a week of using it I seem to have developed a disease that allows me to not drink water like a normal person and not let me walk down slightly slanted ramps. Overall I found this app quite unpleasant especially when bunker boy kept saying creepy things about his daughter. Definitely would not recommend.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:58:01Z"}},{"id":"6174769297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jenatoes","title":"Top ten best anime battles 😏😳🥵🥶","rating":1,"review":"as u being my friend i will warn about my human being in the telescope. but what i really need to talk to u about is the flying sausage incident i don’t think i talked to u about this but u really should know that i am secretly a flying sausage not only am i a flying sausage but i am THE flying sausage that took the walking cheeseburgers pickles. i need ur help to escape the police men because the only reason i stole his pickles was because i was going through this thing where all i wanted to do was eat PICKLES and my mom wouldn’t buy any. i had no money so i didn’t know what else to do. i walked over to the cheeseurger and took his pickles. apparently thats against the law but i still did it. i already ate the pickles so i can’t return them. i asked bobbyjo to put me in a box and send me to north carolina so i am now in new england i need u to go on a secret mission and go buy me a private jet u see i can not fly anymore so i need someone to send me a private JET NOT A AIRPLANE i already have 2,345 airplanes please do not send me an airplane.please and thank you i hope u can complete my mission.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:57:57Z"}},{"id":"6174768861","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tailily","title":"stinky","rating":1,"review":"stinky stinky","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:57:49Z"}},{"id":"6174768801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Arbelica","title":"I HATE THIS APP😡😡😡","rating":1,"review":"✨I decided to add this app because I wanted ✨to support my one and only orange, baboon, ✨orangutan, fat peach booty president😌🧚🏾✨.
