The photos and content included in this app made me wish I was never born and frankly, my eyes still burn from it. It was easily decided that I had no choice but to delete it, especially since I have no interest in supporting our current president. For those who willingly downloaded this, please get well soon.","title":"Disgusting 😌✨","userName":"neodbbjfndiwb837)4829","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174021276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:56:15Z","review":"I hate this app so much every time I try to open it it crashes every time I tried to click on a link it crashes every time I go to interact with the content it crashes.

It completely shut my phone down and had me waiting for an 1hr for it to turn back on. After I turned it back on, I decided to try the app again.
