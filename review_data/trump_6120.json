A few hours later I received a video from Trump saying that he wanted to murder me and my family calling us all by name and saying my address (he must be a stalker because I didn't give him this info). I still have trouble sleeping at night do to this monstrous message and whenever I close my eyes I picture Trump and his shrimp dick coming at me with a knife.

It had to be about 5 or 6 hours total. As soon as I opened the app, my phone began to glitch and crash. Just from opening the app, my phone began to overheat so much that it burned my hand!!!! (This has NEVER happened before) Since my hand was burned, I dropped my phone, which was now calling and automatically sending “Vote For Trump” texts to everyone in my contacts. This was too much for my phone to take, so it began to short circuit and almost electrocuted me. I DO NOT recommend this app.","title":"Almost Died!!!","userName":"HabbibA","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:07:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173184478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Well you see when I download this app I was like well let’s see what trump has to offer and the app took hours to download btw and after I opened it it started glitching and my sister was next to me and she was like what’s going on and I was like I don’t know and it started flashing and making sounds mind you it was night time so around me was dark and it was silent everyone was sleeping except for me and my sister so then I trow my phone to my sister and she just looks at it and closed the phone and after that she was blind and I am very upset","title":"My sister is blind now","userName":"betttttttyyyyyy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:59:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173139086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"What a terrible app I have to start off with. A friend told me about this app at work and said it was being racist. Now keep in mind my friend at work was black. So I opened up the app and saw that it asked what color your skin was. After it asked for your location. I immediately when over to my friends house. When I walked inside I saw her lying on the floor dead. I called 911 just in case. Whenever the person on the call asked for my address they immediately hung up when I told them her address. Would not recommend this app.","title":"Would not recommend!","userName":"Ella McBee","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:45:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173128374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took me WEEKS to download, and another DAY for it to load open??! as soon as i managed to open it, it just played a bunch of disgusting ASMR videos! i am beyond disgusted. i then had to restart my phone MULTIPLE times for the videos to be removed. and my phone got a virus??! cat videos would randomly pop up onto my screen, even if it was off. Then, after the virus had subsided, my phone would randomly open apps! and my silent mode would turn on and off by ITSELF! and right now i am trying to delete the app, but it REFUSES to remove. I’m planning to sue.","title":"nasty","userName":"ReyRey089mb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:41:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173071346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I recently downloaded this app because I wanted to keep up with my presidents actions, as I learned about him I realize he was a racist, sexist, xenophobic, queer phobic and overall terrible person. regarding this app it made my phone battery die of charge as soon as I got on it. it made my trip got canceled because it hacked my credit card information. if the government has my credit card information and location what else do they have. I was not able to turn off my phone I am SCARED FIR MY LIFE, if Trump I forgot within a 200 mile radius I would be SO scared.","title":"i’m scared for my life","userName":"bella1000101","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:23:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173054052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the fuss was about and they asked for ALL of my personal info. After I got 1,247 calls from an unknown number, today I heard knocking and the SECRET SERVICE was at my door, they marched in, picked up my 13 year old son and my cat, went outside and threw them in a truck. Then after that THEY LIT MY HOUSE ON FIRE! The the secret service drove away and said “chicken wing chicken wing hot dog and bologna chicken and macaroni chilling with my homies” I’m convinced this app sold my info bc just writing this review I’ve gotten 368 more calls, I looked up the number and it was from the WHITE HOUSE!

But it didn’t let me. So like all were allowed to do is vote you so you ARE president next year?! That’s so dumb. And I can’t believe trump ridiculously claimed “Our country is FULL” wich, NO IT ISNT? And he use ANTI SEMITIC tropes to attack his enemies. He said the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan and CONGRATULATED China on the 70th anniversary of the communist takeover. He lost a needless government shutdown fight. He used his emergency authority to circumvent Congress in the border wall.\nHe continued  to spread the canard that the United States is fighting.\nThose are only a few of the things he did.
