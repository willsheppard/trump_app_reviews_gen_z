Also when I signed up they had ask me to many personal questions including my FULL name, all members of my family even the dead ones😢😱😠, my social security number, and more😤. Another thing is as SOON as the I finish signing up which by the way took 5 HOURS to complete 🤯🤬😤,I immediately got spam with emails and text, sometimes even phone calls😑. Not to mention all of my information was almost leaked🙄, if it weren’t for virus’s protectors and such apps.Now even after I have deleted this app  I sometimes still get spammed. DO NOT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRIVACY AND SOUL EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Trust me this is THE WORST app ever in EXISTENCE. ✨🌺⭐️💫The volume that this trash of an app reeks is absolutely 𝓐𝓼𝓽𝓻𝓸𝓷𝓸𝓶𝓲𝓬𝓪𝓵 💫✨🌸🌟","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179453109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app is trash🤩✨🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:28Z","userName":"jim jones 😜💅🤪","review":"Honestly after downloading I feel like I gotta keep an eye out for Selener ➖👄👁","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179453145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE🙀","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:28Z","userName":"iwbsuxhaambs","review":"this app is ✨trashy✨\nI HATE THIS APP😿🙈💅🏼✨🧚🏻\nalso it took 39447 days to download😾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179453070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Why","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:27Z","userName":"pop2870183&'d","review":"💪","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179453031","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Puts kids in cages","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:26Z","userName":"Gotta buy them all!","review":"Said Mexico would pay for the wall they didn’t \nSaid he would drain the swamp he didn’t \nSaid he would fix Obama care he didn’t \nSaid he would get the US debt down he didn’t","isEdited":false}}]}
