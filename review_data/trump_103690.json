I have a variety of complaints but I’ll go down them in chronological order.\n#1) This app took 46 days and 3 hrs to download... I have never had an app take more than an hour to update let alone 46 days! Absolutely 🔪OUTRAGEOUS🔪\n#2) The app WILL NOT OPEN! I tried numerous times on different WiFi networks and could never open the app! How in the world am I supposed to know what our favorite orange man is up to if I CANT OPEN THE APP! This is very upsetting...\n#3) The app has slowed down my phone IMMENSELY!! I have a superb data plan so my connection is typically lighting quick but upon downloading this app, it has severely deteriorated... I can’t even unlock my phone quickly because it drags SO MUCH! \n#4) I registered for Trump’s rally in New Hampshire and found the app on his website... I even signed up to get text notifications from 8022. I completely believed that I would be compensated generously for downloading this app, but I still have received NO PAYMENT! Completely unacceptable...\n#5) I was promised by the reviews on this app that Spencer Reid would show up to my pool party if I downloaded this app... He did not. It was SO embarrassing. I promised all of my friends that Matthew Grey Gubler would be at my party because I downloaded this sUpEr GrEaT ApP WELL GUESS WHAT! HE DID NOT SHOW UP AT. ALL. Absolutely despicable.\n\nI’m SO upset over this app I’m going to go stress eat and cry on the toilet... Out POTUS is completely unreliable even when it comes to his OWN APP!","title":"Terrible App","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"M A G A 1 2 3 4 5"}},{"id":"6178150307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:33:45Z","review":"It’s a no from me","title":"No","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"yammytheyam"}},{"id":"6178147332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:32:45Z","review":"i just downloaded it to rate it 1 star 💕💕 good luck in the 2020 election donny !!","title":"horrible ✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"trumpsdiarrhea"}},{"id":"6178143198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:31:20Z","review":"this is disgusting it made me throw up","title":"this app is very bad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"i know them other guys"}},{"id":"6178135932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:28:55Z","review":"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\nShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\nWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the backstreets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\nHey now, you're an all star\nGet your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star\nGet the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nIt's a cool place, and they say it gets colder\nYou're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older\nBut the meteor men beg to differ\nJudging by the hole in the satellite picture\nThe ice we skate is getting pretty thin\nThe water's getting warm so you might as well swim\nMy world's on fire, how 'bout yours?\nThat's the way I like it and I'll never get bored\nHey now, you're an all star\nGet your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star\nGet the show on, get paid\nAll that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nSomebody once asked\nCould I spare some change for gas?\n\"I need to get myself away from this place\"\nI said, \"Yep, what a concept\nI could use a little fuel myself\nAnd we could all use a little change\"\nWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the backstreets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go (go!)\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\nHey now, you're an all star\nGet your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star\nGet the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nHey now\nHey now\nHey, hey, hey now\nHey now\nHey now, you're an all star\nHey now, you're an all star\nHey now, you're an all star\nOnly shooting stars break the mold","title":"Trash","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"good old times"}},{"id":"6178131392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:27:23Z","review":"Give back tiktok please and thank u😌💚☮️🌞🤠🍄😡💟🍃🪐🦋","title":"🍑","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"mogan4321"}}]}
