You’re probably wondering why I did what I did. It’s because I knew I was too scared to go back. And if we weren’t together, if all of us alive weren’t united, I knew we’d all die, so I made the only logical move. I took myself off the board. Did it work? Well, if you’re reading this, you know the answer.  \n\nI lived my whole life afraid. Afraid of what would come next, afraid of what I might leave behind. “Don’t.” Be who you want to be. Be proud. And if you find someone worth holding onto, never ever let them go. Follow your own path, wherever that takes you. Think of this letter as a promise, a promise I am asking you to make. To me. To each other. An oath. See, the thing about being a loser is you don’t have anything to lose. So be true. Be brave. Stand. Believe. And don’t ever forget, we’re losers, and we always will be.\n\nThis wasn’t supposed to happen. They weren’t supposed to defeat me, Pennywise, Eater of Worlds. I wasn’t supposed to kill Eddie. Richie wasn’t supposed to get mad at me. I ruined it for them. I ruined it for everyone. (a beat) Billy was mad for pretending to be Georgie again. Ben got mad for burying him in his own clubhouse. Beverly was mad because I scared her half to death. Mike got mad because he couldn’t defeat me the first time. Richie was mad for making his love life worse. (a beat) They did it. With Stan and Eddie gone, they defeated me. I always knew they could, I just didn’t want it to happen. This wasn’t supposed to happen.","title":"NO","date":"2020-07-09T04:06:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Nicash2"}},{"id":"6174925397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app literally killed my grandmother","title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:13Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Hound of Space"}},{"id":"6174920086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"ugh baddie !! ✨💓🧚🏽\u200D♀️but the bad is silent 😩💖🧚🏽\u200D♀️","title":"They try to ban tik tok we ban them","date":"2020-07-09T03:42:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"sad miss nact"}},{"id":"6174916555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely horrible","title":"Utter garbage","date":"2020-07-09T03:41:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"jackiehusel"}},{"id":"6174910870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app really made me peepee poopoo🤷🏽\u200D♂️","title":"Terrible terrible","date":"2020-07-09T03:39:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"dicsonutz"}},{"id":"6174881314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i first opened the app, i saw a racist, homophobic, rapist, and misogynist man!!! not appropriate.","title":"this app is uncomfortable and inappropriate","date":"2020-07-09T03:31:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ioioiolop"}},{"id":"6174878431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is just horrible.","title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T03:30:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"genzalways123"}}]}
