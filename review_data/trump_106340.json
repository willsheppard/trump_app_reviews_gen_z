I saw him at a McDonalds, where he spit on my head and wiped his spray tan 🍊 on my new shoes👟 ! I saw him kick 🦵the cashier and jump on the counter screaming like a monkey 🐒. He then proceeded to spin my grandma 👵 around the air like a lasso! I kicked his shin, and he fell into a ditch where he started pooping 💩💩 all over the place! He then started throwing his own feces at us! It smacked my baby cousin 👶, who is 1️⃣ month old, in the face, prompting my baby cousin to start screaming at trump! \nMy baby cousin then said, quoting peaches 🍑, “why don't ❌ you take showers 🚿? people 💂\u200D♀️🧑\u200D🚒shower 🧼 because it's a trend. someone else doing it, and everybody else doing it, i wanna do it, i wanna fit in, i wanna do it. you have to think to yourself; why do i shower🚿? why do i bathe🛀? why do i do it? what do i gain out of doing this? am i going to starve 🚫🥨🍇 if i don't take a bath? am i going to die ☠️ if i don't take a bath? it's not a nesserity like food 🍳 and water 💧 . basically, you're just wasting your own water bill 💵 - for no reason! - because you wanna fit in,” (while this did not make too much sense in the moment, it is upon further reflection we can see the truth in life).\n\nTrump responded with the words of gabbie Hanna, “I climbed out of my head 👨\u200D🦳\nAnd watched myself implode 💥\nA thought without a body 🕴🏻\nOught to be the shot 🔫 to take a load off\nMy brain 🧠 is poisoned🤢\nAnd I’m searching 🔦 for the antidote 🔬💉\nBut every time I find it 👆\nMy defenses scream “oh, no ❌ you don’t!”\nWoah 👁👄👁... But it’s fine 😁”\n........ SIS! IT IS NOT FINE! Due to this reckless behavior, I have reason to believe Donald Trump belongs in a mental health institution! He is NOT okay! Throwing feces and spitting in public! I firmly believe Donald Trump must recover before he is prepared to run the nation for another term! It has gone on too long! I want what’s best for him, and what is best is that he must heal by taking some time to step away from the nation🥰🧚🌈forever💓🧚✨. Melania won’t be able to say 𝓗𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓸 to you there ❤️.\n\nAdditionally, after downloading the app, I encountered multiple issues, such as the fact that it supports a sexist, racist, and homophobic orange man 🍊👨! Additionally, I find it quite difficult to grasp the reasons people buy his flags and hats 🧢 ! I’ve seen them hung on boats ⛵️ , over beds 🛏 , and outside of houses 🏠 , although this is just unacceptable ❌🚫🙅\u200D♀️🙅🙅\u200D♂️! Also, I think I may have contracted coronavirus 😷😷 from Trump 🍊, as his actions too late have made it possible for it to spread so quickly throughout the nation! Thanks Donald, we’re at least winning 🏆🥇 in the number of coronavirus cases 🤩🤪😍!\n\nWe DON’T Lauve 😩❤️ by loaf 🥖🍞Donald! \n\nTo the clowns who still support trump 🤡 : \n1. The confidence 🧚🤩💞Lose it💗🌈✨\n2. Imagine being this great 🧚😘keep imagining🤩💞\n3. This girl said you look so cool🌸🧚\u200D♀️🌺her name was Helen Keller🦋💋 🌈\n4. You look like Shane Dawson 🕴🏻🕴🏻🥰\n5. No❤️\n6.
