I was so excited that I could finally get a maga dose of Cheeto dust before I turn on my Fox News every morning. I tell you my palms were sweaty, knees weak, fingertips were heavy. During this all I was eating moms spaghetti. But every time I tried to download the app it kept on crashing. Like it was dropping DOS b*mb$ or kept on forgetting it was downloading and canceling halfway through. I wrote down everything that was happening with the app for troubleshooting purposes. I did some research and showed my group of friends my findings. The whole group got so loud. Only one person out of my group tried defending this app. Though every time he opened his mouth, the words wouldn’t come out. They couldn’t break my steadfast research. They would try to bring up an argument but just choke halfway through. Everyone started jokin at him after this. At that point the clock had run out and time was up. I was so done with this app. This whole ordeal has really snapped me back into reality. Looking at facts and not just a man yelling loudly with a glass of water. Through this I have realized my Cheeto prodigy is so mad, and as such won’t give up easy. He won’t have it, he knows his whole back is to these ropes but just doesn’t care. SMH. He’s broke. \n\nAlso, what they will not tell you is this app downloads IN THE BACKGROUND! Very unsafe. Not maga at all if you ask me. Then when the app finally downloaded correctly after the 45th time, it asked for my phone number! This seems a little too forward for my liking.","userName":"Jesus on a cracker"}}]}
