Then I started getting phone calls from Trump himself saying he was going to sex trafficked me and said he was going to do horrible things to me that I can not say on this and I was like oh sorry I’m 15 and he said oh that’s how I like them. And then after the phone calls I started seeing white cars go back-and-forth in front of my home and this really made me uncomfortable i’m scared for my life so I do not recommend this app I will be giving one star."}},{"id":"6175643475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dizzydizy","date":"2020-07-09T08:02:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"#creepytrump","review":"Downloaded this app because I was curious of what trump had in his official app. However, the second I opened the app it started blasting “grab her by the _____” and all of the times trump has sexually and publicly talked about his daughter. Not to mention it also blasted anti-lgbtq flags all over the screen while the sound was promoting racism and transphobia. After all of this a big cheeto puff with clown makeup popped up on my screen and the app wouldn’t let me exit the disgusting sight. I had to restart my whole phone wiping everything out. This shouldn’t be on the app store. It’s inappropriate and should be banned in every country."}},{"id":"6175282145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yodellingGRANDMA","date":"2020-07-09T05:44:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very poor app. Here’s something else to do.","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start."}},{"id":"6175170960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"netta moliterno","date":"2020-07-09T05:02:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Donald J(enius) Trump needs to work on his app","review":"This app is absolutely horrible! I love my President, Donald J(enius) Trump, but this app is a curse. When I (a devoted American Patriot and supporter of Donald J(enius) Trump) downloaded this app, my cat immediately threw up and then died. I was confused but decided to continue to go onto the app in support of my lovely President Donald J(enius) Trump, my house blew up and all of my possessions flew into other peoples yards (only ones with Donald J(enius) Trump yard signs) and the people stole my stuff! I thought it might be over and in support of the great Donald J(enius) Trump, I scrolled through the app. My phone electrocuted me and now I am paralyzed.  My grandma is writing this for me. Please fix this Bug Donald J(enius) Trump"}},{"id":"6175158926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bugola1224","date":"2020-07-09T04:58:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m baffled/confused","review":"I opened the app and I was immediately routed to a map of local golf courses and fast food hamberder joints. The second time I opened it, I heard voices whispering “alternative facts” from my microwave. I got scared. I closed the app. So... third time was the charm. Upon opening it, I was told thru my phone’s speaker how beautiful my white skin is, how I should fear brown people, how I’m so rich (even tho I’m not), how the news is fake, how I need to fear everyone and everything... and to only believe the words out of Hitler‘s,  I mean,  trumps mouth.  Weird thing tho... after using the app I had Cheeto dust on my fingers and the taste of desperation in my mouth."}},{"id":"6175157918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gymgirl959","date":"2020-07-09T04:58:24Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Worst app I’ve ever gotten","review":"This app took 6 days to download and after finally showing up on my phone I couldn’t even click on the app. I tried multiple times to open the app and after the 3rd attempt my phone started smoking and burning my hands. I immediately tried to delete this app but my phone screen cracked and died. I had to buy another phone and then I found out that this app charged me $48 despite me being unable to open the app. I would definitely not recommend getting this app because it can burn your phone and I have seen it cause much more permanent damage."}},{"id":"6175121894","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"EmilyS01","date":"2020-07-09T04:46:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Horrifying","review":"Do not! I repeat, DO NOT download this app 🤢 I was outside sliding down a volcano When I found this app. I thought it was to clown on trump but instead it sent me alerts about the talking Cheeto himself. If I could rate this zero stars I would. Could I talk to the manger in charge here??? Who would even want a horrible app like this one. And when it asked if I want ice notification on here, I thought it meant ice cubes! Now my lemonade is gonna stay hot :( and then I saw the pervert himself on the screen AND IT ALMOST MADE ME DROP MY CROISSANT 🥐 so yea moral of the review, there I was sliding down a volcano, with bbq sauce on my ta-tas, when I discovered how horrible this app was."}},{"id":"6175095444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ALE'S WIFE","date":"2020-07-09T04:37:42Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very disrespectful😖💔","review":"I downloaded the app and it asked for my phone number !!
