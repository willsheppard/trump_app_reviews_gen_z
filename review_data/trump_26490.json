Right when I opened it I could see nothing but orange. It caused me to go blind now I can’t see anything unless it’s orange. This was truly a traumatizing moment and I really hope I get a refund. I need to get my hospital bills paid and I’m really hoping this orange humpty dumpty can do that for me.","userName":"hdjdbxjbd","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:38:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174495766","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app blows","review":"Honestly, can’t believe how bad this app is. Truly just looking at it renders it completely unusable. \n\nEspecially the first page you get to, almost shattered my screen from the pure ugliness emanating from it. \n\nCan’t wait to see this SOB rot in a jail cell. Hope he doesn’t drop the soap.","userName":"trump-has-a-small-dick","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:38:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174491596","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible app","review":"The app kept bugging every time I clicked on the rallies.

Then once I opened the app all my electronics and properties I  own started to turn rainbow colors. It’s was like a weird dream. I never want to have that experience again.","userName":"EGirlGamer5","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:34:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174467292","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointing and Gross","review":"I would give 0 stars if it was an option.

I EXPECTED A QUALITY APP! Then I saw an apple shaking the oranges hand, I then showed my uncle who died and had a stroke because he is allergic to oranges, I showed my sister who saw this app and decided it was very inappropriate showing naked oranges eating bananas, I strongly dislike this app 😡","userName":"READTHEREVIEW_BUDDY","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174418694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Meh","review":"Didn’t really do anything, crashed a few times. Kinda hated the whole experience. Some functions were hidden and at one point the whole screen blacked out when I needed it to do its job. Now I have all of this weird Cheeto dust all over my phone? Wouldn’t reccomend.","userName":"cbearsarereal","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:15:47Z","isEdited":false}}]}
