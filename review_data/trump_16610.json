I also don't understand why our President has to use an app for his campaign? Posters and slogans worked just fine for us! And when the application is first opened, Donald raises a fist, for which I assume is Black Lives Matter? Don't all lives matter Mr. President?

The app took about a week to download. Then it put a virus on my that caused it to crash and then when it was finally fixed... it played this song that made my crops DIE. Now nothing will grow. I really don’t think this app should be on the market. Also the app took 700,000 dollars that I didn’t have and then the IRS accused me of fraud and I had to go to talk to police.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:36:30Z","title":"Get this app outta here!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173290794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨Nicki Minaj✨","review":"When I first downloaded the app it seemed to be working perfectly fine but after a while my phone started glitching out. I tried restarting my phone and wifi network to fix it but it just wouldn’t work properly. I don’t know if I’m the only one having this problem but this app is dreadful. One out of 5 stars 🙈💅✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:34:34Z","title":"I Would Not Recommend This App","rating":1}},{"id":"6173285856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"e.m.h.25","review":"I got this app to see where my trump supporting grandparents were coming from. The app immediately asked me for extremely personal information not just email/phone like normal. My phone then dropped to 20% and crashed. If I could rate apps in negative numbers I would give this a -♾/10. I don’t know who designed this app but who ever did should resign/be fired.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:32:59Z","title":"Absolutely horrible","rating":1}},{"id":"6173263177","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Stellagirl800","review":"this is probably the worst app I’ve ever had. It takes so so so long to do anything. There is absolutely no no NO FUN IN IT EITHER. It’s all glitchy and it makes my phone hot. There is WAYYYYY too many ads and it’s so boring. the way it looks ticks me off so much. I thought this app was going to be so good. So amazing. BUT NO.

What’s the point of making this app? The app glitches way to much and runs slow! If I was you I wouldn’t download this app😒.

I just wanted to support our puff Cheeto president and that he’s really good at being president even though he started all this mess in the first place✨👁👄👁  This physically and mentally made me sad a lot. And I wanted to ask him a question if he is racist or a rapist then he kicked me like irl this app is so bad and they are all so rude.

It gave me a virus and I couldn’t get it repaired and i lost all my data. All my photos were gone and all my social media pages as well. I don’t recommend getting this app at all .
