Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.","date":"2020-07-10T03:34:44Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"vanessaabarron"}},{"id":"6179273576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Who else to be put here doe?","review":"Microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave microwave BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBBBBIIIIIIIIIIIIIESSSSSS, ≈Å √ã   M ƒÆ ƒå R √ï W √Ñ V ƒò.....  Long ago, and far away,\nin a village high on amountaintop,\n\nsomething amazing was occurring.\n\nAt the very same moment, two\n\nidentical baby girls were born.\n\nOne, a baby Princess.\n\nThe King and Queen were overjoyed.\n\nPrincess Anneliese would\n\nhave only the finest.\n\nThe second baby girl was namedErika.\n\nHer parents loved her every bit as much\n\nas the King and Queen loved the Princess.\n\nBut they worried.\n\nThey were so poor.\n\nHow would they be\n\nable to care for their littledaughter?\n\nMany years passed.\n\nThe Princess learned her royalduties,\n\nwhile Erika worked long and hard as a\n\nseamstress for the spitefulMadame Carp.\n\nWith lives so different, it\n\nwasn't surprising that the Princess\n\nand the Pauper never met.\n\nBut fate decreed they would.\n\nIt all started at the Royal Mine.\n\nWhen the miners informed the\n\nQueen the gold had run out.\n\nThe widowed Queen was shocked.\n\nThe Kingdom was no bankrupt. How was\n\nshe going to take care of her people?\n\nIf only she could call on\n\nher trusted advisor Preminger,\n\nBut he was away on a long journey.\n\nShe needed to do somethingquickly\n\nto save the Kingdom.\n\nBut what?\n\nAnd then it struck her.\n\nNearby lived a rich young\n\nKing who was seeking a wife.\n\nOh. We're late, late, late. We have 20\n\nmaximum 22 minutes for your royalfitting.\n\nThen it's move, move, move. Your\n\nspeech at the Historical Society.\n\nAfter that we have the\n\nrush. And I mean rush\n\nto the Horicortural Society Tea.\n\nAnd then there's your math lessons, your\n\ngeography lessons, your science...\n\nAll my life I've always wanted\n\nto have one day just for me.\n\nNothing to do and for\n\nonce nowhere I need to be.\n\nWith no lessons, Lords, or lunches,\n\nOr 'to do' list in the way,\n\nNo one to say when to eat\n\nor read or leave or stay\n\nThat would be the day\n\nAll my life I've always wanted\n\nTo have one day for myself\n\nNot waking up with a pile\n\nof work on every shelf.\n\nWith no hems in need of pressing,\n\nand no sleeves in disarray,\n\nNo wedding gown with a\n\nthousand stitches to crochet\n\nAnd no debt to pay.\n\nMadame Carp!\n\nWhat do you think I'm runninghere?\n\nA cabaret?\n\nI would've said a debtor's prison.\n\nKeep laughing. You'll be working\n\nfor me for another 37 years.\n\nBut I've already paid\n\noff more than half.\n\nBut there's interest isn't there?\n\nYour parents should've thought of\n\nthat before they borrowed so much.\n\n- They did it to feed me!\n\n- Their mistake.\n\n- What would it be like to be...\n\n- What would it be like to be...\n\n- Free.\n\n- Free.\n\nFree to try crazy things\n\nFree from endless IOU's\n\n- Free to find\n\n- Free to see\n\nAnd marry whom I choose.\n\nI'm so sorry, my darling,\n\nbut as you know, it is vital\n\nyou marry King Dominick.\n\nIt is the only way to\n\ntake care of our people.\n\nI know. It's my duty.\n\nOh, and look!\n\nAnother engagement gift.\n\nYou would think that I'm so lucky\n\nthat I have so many things\n\nI'm realizing that every\n\npresent comes with strings.\n\nThough I know I have so little,\n\nmy determination's strong.\n\nPeople will gather around\n\nthe world to hear my song.\n\nCan I come along?\n\n- Now I fear I'll never be\n\n- Soon I will forever be\n\n- Free!\n\n- Free!\n\nIf I close my eyes I'd feel\n\nmyself fly up a thousand milesaway\n\nI could take flight\n\nbut would it be right?\n\nMy conscious tells me stay.\n\n- I'll remain forever royal\n\n- I'll repay my parent's debt\n\nDuty means doing the things\n\nyour heart they well regret\n\nBut I'll never stop believing\n\nShe can never stop my schemes\n\nThere's more to living than gloves\n\nand gowns and threads and seams\n\nIn my dreams\n\nI'll be free!\n\nOk, what idiot put this in here?\n\nOh, that would be me.\n\nLet us review, shall we?\n\nWe are stealing gold! ¬´ Prev  |   Next ¬ª\n\n- Is this shiny?\n\n- No.\n\n- Valuable?\n\n- No.\n\n- Gonna make the boss happy?\n\n- No.\n\nFocus, Nick.\n\nThat's what you need.
