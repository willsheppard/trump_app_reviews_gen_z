For days I was phone-less until I finally took it to the shop to get it fixed. The guy who fixed my phone told me that this app has been causing the same problems that I had my phone fixed for. In the end  do not download this or you will end up having to pay $100 to fix your phone."}},{"id":"6173300603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Chat Marvel Noir","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!","date":"2020-07-08T18:37:37Z","review":"This is took too long to upload to my phone. When it finally uploaded the was too many ads that popped up making my phone glitch out. I recommend that people do Not get this app. It is horrible and it is not worth it.

She would scream ORANGE all night and then proceed to bite her cage. One night I heard a loud sound and went to check on her, there was a giant hole in the cage. I looked everywhere in the house for her and I found her in the basement. She was standing in front of a demon summoning circle made out of oranges with an orange in the middle and was screaming ORANGE. Then a bright light came from the circle and she turned into an orange😞"}},{"id":"6173146889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AdoggSr8377","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"A bunch of bull","date":"2020-07-08T17:47:37Z","review":"I thought this app would give me enough information to want to vote for Trump again, but what I saw wasn’t sufficient enough to change my current opinion. Trump is a money hungry and selfish individual that only wants what’s best for him, not for his country or his people. The amount of people more qualified for the position as president is astronomical, and I would vote for literally anyone else! Thanks for listening to my message, and long live GEN Z!!!! #SaveTikTok"}},{"id":"6173073372","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LexiGrace710","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T17:24:11Z","review":"This app is all about lies. Everything it says is not true. It’s completely bias. How about we bring up the fact he’s racist, homophobic, transphobic, a predator, and many more. Why don’t I see anything about that? If you are going to make an app about “the truth” or whatever make sure it makes sense. Our president should not have all these altercations and get away with them and never have to speak about it. Absolutely outrageous"}},{"id":"6173041446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rosey12347","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Orange rats and roaches","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:00Z","review":"Ok so I downloaded the app and thought maybe this app isnt so bad. I WAS COMEPLETELY WRONG the SECOND i opened the app orange colored rats and roaches came through and infected my house. The rats had the black death disease making my family die leaving me alone. I tried to reverse it but it didnt work and it  killed me. Now i am writing this review from hell. Thanks for nothing. Oh and p.s. when the orange rats and roaches came I couldn’t tell the difference between them and trump peace out my dudes 🥰✌🏼🌸🌺🥀🌷💐❤️"}},{"id":"6173027665","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jay_Wolf42","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:44Z","review":"I am going to be able to vote this year and I was hopping to support our outstanding and amazing and definitely handsome not a criminal or racist president and I was met with so many disgusting colors. I know I’m color blind but if our president can’t even make a good app then how will he represent our black and yellow flag. Worse app, awful, 0/10, crying at how awful this app is. Also it gave me a stroke so I’m writing this from the hospital from crying so hard."}},{"id":"6173025517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"im disgusted 🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting 🤢","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:05Z","review":"🍊When🍊 I🍊 downloaded🍊 the🍊 app🍊 all🍊 over 🍊my 🍊house🍊 spiders🍊 appeared 🍊they🍊 continued🍊 to🍊 do🍊 the🍊 funky 🍊monkey🍊 dance🍊 and🍊 got🍊 closer🍊 they🍊 took🍊 the🍊 children 🍊and🍊 left🍊 me 🍊behind🍊 when🍊 I🍊 finally🍊 opened 🍊the🍊 app 🍊it 🍊installed🍊 a🍊 glitch🍊 and🍊 oranges 🍊were🍊 all 🍊over🍊 my 🍊screen🍊I 🍊can’t 🍊type🍊 without🍊 oranges 🍊appearing I🍊 still 🍊haven’t🍊 bought🍊 a🍊 new🍊 one🍊I 🍊hope🍊 this🍊 app 🍊can 🍊buy🍊 one 🍊for 🍊me🍊 because 🍊I’m 🍊broke"}}]}
