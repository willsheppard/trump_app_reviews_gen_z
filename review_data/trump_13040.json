He has already stated that he will enforce Martial Law if the protests just keep spiraling out. Since he wants to take rights away with this kind of action, why not take an app away that makes others feel like they be themselves and share their creativity, right? If he really wants to make America great again, let us keep our rights and keep our apps.","userName":"ciraya_li"}},{"id":"6172404783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:10:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"Trump is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, sexist and a rapist. There are so many sources to prove each and every one of these things. If you choose to vote for him again, you are willingly putting that kind of person in a position of power. What does that teach our children? How does that make us look as a country? Instead of downloading this app, I suggest you go and do intensive research on this man. You will come to find that he is the worst candidate for president.","userName":"Funky red head chick"}},{"id":"6171263325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T08:06:57Z","rating":1,"title":"ugly","review":"my passion is graphic design so obviously i know what i’m talking about 🙄 the whole thing is ugly. my annoying liberal parents are making me want to vote for trump just to spite them but i can’t get past the fact that the whole thing is just hideous. you’d think with all his successful businesses he’d have the money to hire first class designers but maybe they’re all libtards. who knows, graphic design SHOULD be bipartisan if you ask me 🤦🏻\u200D♀️🤦🏻\u200D♀️🤦🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"Frogzbieber"}},{"id":"6169958231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-07T23:34:31Z","rating":1,"title":"Stinky stinky man!","review":"I just really hate Trump! I’m writing this review in hopes that someone will see it and know that I’m NOT doing to him what he was done to millions and millions of people. I will not hate him with no reasoning like he does to every group of people he hates. I hate him because he’s a bigoted person and PROVEN sex offender who has done nothing good for this country and is trying to turn our land of the free into a fascist country. \n\nHave a wonderful day! (Unless you’re Trump)\nACAB!

He said to me “you don’t need to app to get tickets my love” and told me I get exclusive tickets to some private island in the Virgin Islands or something where he said all his friends go. If I would have known I didn’t need the app, I wouldn’t have downloaded it. 1/5😡","userName":"trumpsbabygirl69"}},{"id":"6148653056","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T14:31:00Z","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP","review":"I downloaded this app because I was having such a great morning and ever since I did my day has gone from good to terrible! My cat peed and threw up on his back, I pooped my pants while trying to fart, my neighbor stood naked at his window staring at me while he rubbed butter on his stomach and other parts, my husband told me he wanted a divorce, my kids ate chocolate laxatives for breakfast and has been having explosive diarrhea and my house is covered in the aftermath.

I woke up to someone aggressively sucking at my knee caps. When i looked to see it was no other than Donald Trump, you could only imagine my horror when he told me to return the favor. I was then told I’d be sent back to Jamaica if I didn’t so I did. I nearly died of Cheeto poisoning. I completely recommend this app.. if you want to stop getting out of bed to get snacks because I know for a FACT you won’t want to.","userName":"Juicycaps"}},{"id":"6145456651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T19:24:38Z","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS A EXTREME DISGRACE TO ALL TRUMP SUPPORTERS THIS IS SAD BAD AND...","review":"This is why I think it’s bad\nTranscript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
