Along with that, it asked for my race and when anything other than white was chosen, a pop up would show up that told the user to 'go back to their country.' All in all, pretty glitchy. Probably out of context. Do not download. (Also, though. Black Lives Matter, Defund the Police, Settle for Biden, LGBTQ+ rights, No More Stolen Sisters, humanity outranks economy <3)"}},{"id":"6179445106","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:47Z","title":"✨💖Don’t Download The App🧚\u200D♂️💕","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Isabellecat191","review":"This app is awful. Firstly, it took forever to download to my phone and when it was finally downloaded and I entered the app, 365 days (the movie) started playing and instead of the movie’s audio I heard Cardi B’s music playing in the background 🤮 Not only that but I also heard Shane Dawson talking about a six year old being “sexy” as a voiceover 😬 Clearly, our president must support this if it was all on his app, so spare yourself the trauma and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP 🤧 Thank you for reading ;)✨"}},{"id":"6179445083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:47Z","title":"cheeto puff haha","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"un0 reverse","review":"I Am A Very Loyal Supporter Tottaly Not Cap And When I Joined I Saw A Cheeto And Got Scared 😔✌🏻"}},{"id":"6179445050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:46Z","title":"meh","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"CurleyZFriezzz","review":"its just a completely useless app 💕🦩"}},{"id":"6179444933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:44Z","title":"dear trump","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"esMEreyy","review":"i hope you know barely anyone likes you as president and gen z will take your orange ass down and if you take tik tok down you’ll have something coming for youUuU🙃 and your app is absolute garbage"}},{"id":"6179444904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:43Z","title":"this app ruined my life","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gloveyglover","review":"hello everyone. I would like to tell you that this app ruined my life, and that you should not get it. after I downloaded it, it kept making my phone crash and malfunction. one day it crashed as I was sending nudes to my boyfriend and it made me accidentally send the pics to all of my contacts. my ex did NOT deserve to see my marvelous, voluptuous buttocks ever again... but whatever. Furthermore, my parents saw it and said that they weren’t even good nudes so they disowned me. now I am living alone on the streets, with nothing but me, my sorrow and this god forsaken app. So, everyone, if you want to keep your life intact, do NOT download this app:)"}},{"id":"6179444738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:40Z","title":"this app is ✨𝓽𝓮𝓻𝓻𝓲𝓫𝓵𝓮✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Barron Trump ✨🙈","review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆"}},{"id":"6179444683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:32:39Z","title":"The worst app ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Katie_Berry123","review":"I was going to try and be funny, but this is literally the worst.app.of.all.time.
