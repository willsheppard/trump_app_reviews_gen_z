My mom likes trump but my dad likes Hillary. They would have CONSTANT fights about their views. Me personally, I like Hillary better but that isn’t the point of my review. One day, my mother downloaded this app onto her phone. My dad noticed her using it, and they got into the biggest dispute I have ever seen them in. And that is why they got divorced. Me and my brother cannot see each other anymore, because of my parents’ split. I blame Donald J. Trump and this horrible app for causing my family to burn in flames. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","title":"Destroyed my Family","userName":"charlie has a neck","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172339381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:52:39Z","review":"I went to open the app and it crashed only a few seconds in. I am disappointed and befuddled as to why my presidents app is this glitchy. I know it is not my phone because as a white woman in america I can afford luxurious things such as the iPhone 11. I would like to speak with the manager of this app because it is completely irresponsible for them to allow this app to become so unusable. This app has made me very upset and as someone as entitled and privileged as I - I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ENDURE USING SUCH A RIDICULOUS APP! FIX THE GLITCH OR REMOVE THE APP!!!!","title":"Absolutely Horrible!!!

And my son was also interested, so I let him watch me look around the app! All was well, until it downloaded.. immediately, a Cheeto with hair and eyes popped on the screen! Though I was scared, my son was even more sacred. He went into cardiac arrest, fell of the couch, and broke his neck! I immediately called 911, and the treatment is more then you can ever imagine! So, I’m planning to sue the app! I’ll be going to trail this December and once I win, I will use the money to not only pay for my son’s spinal treatment, but the treatment for his PTSD! \n\nSee you in court!\n\n(Edit, I realize that it was irresponsible to let my son watch me download it)","title":"Planning to sue","userName":"Reveiwie","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6150177917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T23:59:25Z","review":"The year was 2016 and one government idiot was replacing another. I was watching on my tv in my hotel room, the match between the orange and the baby eater and sat in dismay that these two brain dead maggots were elected as the best fit for president. The scene was set like two wrestlers fighting for the belt at the top of the ladder. Except Hillary left early because the extremists on the right took her back stage and beat her with metal chairs. Thus the orange slobbered as he won and everyone screamed in terror. The orange took its final form, flashed his member at the cnn cameraman and was teleported to the White House in a tornado of flames.","title":"A terrible horrifying story","userName":"D_a_R_k_E_n__","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6147157694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T06:21:02Z","review":"This app is basically the digital version of those sugar free gummy bears. You know the ones Im talking about, right? Well look for yourself, do a search and you too will read the reviews of the devastating effects of sugar free gummy bears on your digestive system. Anyways, I would be weary of this app in a similar way I am weary to wear white pants after indulging in an 8 ounce bag of sugar free gummy bears. First the farts happen, then you know the squish is right around the corner. Hail Satan, Trump is the new Hitler. Black lives matter.

I’m applaud at such reviews saying that people are just rating it a bad review because they don’t like their president. Which I think it weird because “I adore our beloved president”. “He’s a good person trying to help America” (help destroy America if anything). Sorry my bad my little 3 year old grabbed my phone those kids right? Anyways such an absolutely terrible app I would not recommend to ANYONE.

WHAT?! why is it so slow?! when i got into the app i didn’t know what to do. it was a plain white screen saying wait. that’s stupid. what am i waiting for?!\nplease update your app.","title":"slow","userName":"Sofie shelby","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6136694728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T17:13:29Z","review":"the reviews when i first got the app were quite strange, but i was determined to find out ways i can keep supporting our president. as soon as i opened the app things started going terribly wrong!! first off my phone completely shut down, then it was freezing and lagging and glitching. after that the app was somewhat working and let me tell you, it was the worst app i have ever used in my WHOLE entire life. It’s no good and completely meaningless. i was truly disappointed and should have have never downloaded this app.","title":"total disaster","userName":"👁👅👁✨✨✨","isEdited":false}}]}
