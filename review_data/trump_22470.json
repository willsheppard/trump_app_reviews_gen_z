My phone started acting strange and I might have to get a whole new phone. I don’t even wish for my worst enemy to download this app and experience what I did. DO NOT GET IT.

Constantly badgering me and there were all these pictures of this one ugly dude? Like all over. Anyways, I also got racist vibes which is scary.
