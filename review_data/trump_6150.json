Not only do you have to sign ✍🏼up w a phone 📲 ☎️ number, but it spams 👻 tf out of you after signing ✍🏼📝 up for it. After doing so, my sister 👧 was lit on fire 🔥 by trump shortly after downloading, and then my grandma 👵 was abducted 😟. Now my family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 is receiving death 💀 threats from the white house 🏠 bc of surfaced emails from my family 👧 📧.

All of the information is either outdated, or just straight up unrealistic. Like I just don’t understand how this is supposed to be a legitimate app. It needs to be taken down, it’s just terrible. I don’t understand how a guy with so much money can’t find someone decent to run his app. Seriously it’s like he paid a 13 year old a 2 year supply of juuls and called it a day. This app is terrible."}},{"id":"6177451523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:52:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!","userName":"🌳protector of the trees🌲","review":"I was so excited for this app to get all the news and drama filled tweets our dearly loved president loves to write like his negative opinion even matters!!!!! BUT THIS APP IS A HOT BURNING MESS LIKE HIS PEE AFTER DRINKING THE AMOUNT OF DIET COKE!!!!! Maybe this app just needs water or something like our loved president.... someone get him water that can’t be healthy to drink 30 cans of Diet Coke. His pee gotta look like a darker shade of orange than him honestly😳... three words about this app... \nU... useless \nT... terrible \nI... inconvenience \nI don’t know what I feel more bad for, my phone or his kidneys!!!! \nRemember Gen Z if we’re gonna do this, do it the healthy way so we are able to run faster, kick things that are thrown at us harder, and to carry each other when someone is hurt (speaking in terms of sPoRtS). Drink more water but make sure to recycle those plastic bottles or always have a reusable.

First off, the app took up an unnecessary amount of phone space. Secondly, there was virtually no information on trumps goals and ideals, mainly only pictures of our president standing up at rallies, press conferences, and even the iconic bible holding photo. There was no actual useful information. I do not recommend this app for it is a waste of storage and time."}},{"id":"6177247287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:53:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app suckssss","userName":"friendly nabor","review":"this app is total garbage i downloaded it about a day ago and idk why but my phone has been acting up pretty bad since i haven’t downloaded anything else so it has to be because of this app it kept deleting my contacts and deleting my other apps i have no idea how but i got hacked by downloading this app as soon as i’m done writing this i’m deleting this and i recommend no body else download this app unless you wanna get all you’re info hacked i wish i could give a good review but i honestly really can’t DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP I REPEAT DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS"}},{"id":"6177218511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:45:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Estephanieville","review":"It took foreverrrrrr to download and it keeps crashing when I try to open it but after many attempts I finally got to open it and when I did my eyes started burning and tearing up  and my teeth started to fall out too my skin started to pick up an orange tint and my hair was falling out and became a corn like color and very thin I would not wish any of this in my worst enemy 😣 I ended up needing to go to the hospital and they put me in intensive therapy  I’m finally out and I deleted the app ASAP.

But when I started to I got various emails of a lot of spam and junk that wasn’t needed. I had to continue and I actually ended up deactivating my whole email and ruined everything that had other applications using that same email. This Trump app ruined all of my accounts I have ever had. Also the app is very junky and doesn’t work properly. If I could I would give it a 0/5 stars."}},{"id":"6176998756","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:44:21Z","isEdited":false,"title":"disgusting","userName":"anonymus562772","review":"a big hairy cheeto oompa loompa man greeted me with opening this app. HORRIFYING! i just about hopped out of my booster seat and died. i can not believe that this app is even suitable for ADULTS! this app is promoting fatal actions. would you want you grandmother having a stroke because of this?! no? i didnt think so. this is one of the WORST apps i have ever downloaded. it doesnt even have oompa loompa games. i feel like that would make it a little better DEFINITELY GET RID OF THE HORRIFYING PICTURE OF THE HAIRY CHEETO MAN IN THE HOME PAGE! i despise this app completely. i would never recommend it to any of my friends for their own safety."}}]}
