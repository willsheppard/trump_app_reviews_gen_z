My eyes began to tear up at the awful and disturbing sight.

I’m a supporter but I still don’t think this app deserves to be on the AppStore with the way it’s designed and the images weren’t great. I think they should take it off the AppStore completely.","rating":1,"title":"If I could rate less than 1 star I would."}}]}
