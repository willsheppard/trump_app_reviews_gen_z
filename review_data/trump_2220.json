First of all, it took two hours to download. It would constantly stop downloading, no matter if it was on WiFi or off WiFi, it just wouldn’t download. It slowed my whole phone down because of this. \nOnce it finally downloaded, it constantly crashed! I was trying to educate myself and clearly the app just didn’t want that to happen. \nThe worst part is that the rest of the apps on my phone are now crashing. I have an iPhone XR so it’s not an old phone. Everything is up to date, something about this app just messes with your phone. I didn’t believe all the other reviews, I thought it was just fake news. But clearly it’s real. \nI would give this app zero stars if possible. Just don’t get it.","title":"Crashing","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mchowow","date":"2020-07-09T16:43:03Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177232577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"figured it out\nI figured it out from black and white\nSeconds and hours\nMaybe they had to take some time\nI know how it goes\nI know how it goes from wrong and right\nSilence and sound\nDid they ever hold each other tight\nLike us?

Oompa Loompas should stay in their own element, and btw i love ur fake hair! is it from the idiot who tried to murder their own civilians of their own country? I just screammmms genocide.

Not only do I question the credibility and experience of the people that created this app, but I also question if they were in their right mind????? Every time I clicked to open the app my phone would literally catch on fire. Not only would my phone suddenly burst into flames, but then Nickelback would start playing INCREDIBLY loud from my phone’s speakers. This would last for about 2 hours and would occur 5-10 minutes after opening the app. For my safety and everyone else’s, this app needs to be removed FOREVER. For your safety, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app is a danger to my fellow Americans and America itself, and I am begging that it is taken down.","title":"This is the WORST APP I HAVE EVER WASTED A CLICK ON","isEdited":false,"userName":"123749592937","date":"2020-07-09T14:40:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176833912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first logged on I was terrified!!

I thought I got away but then I heard it’s call!! I scream in fear and it heard me!! I started to run again but it god so long I need to stop!! But then I figured out how to kill it!! I pull out my phone and there he was!! We were looking into each other’s eyes!! Then he starts running full speed at me!! But when he got to close I started relegating on him!! Killing him with my amazing dance moves!! I won the war!!

Everybody wants it. The moms want it. The dads want it. The kids want it. It’s time to Download it. What they have to view, though, is if you look at the chart, and maybe Mike has it, but we looked at it before. And when you do download it seems simple. Very simple. Very easy. Then you do it and it’s bad very very bad! And a lot of people don’t know this. But it’s horrible. It’s the worst and This app is an attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty. It must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous application, protect our nation’s children from this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life","title":"Download at own risk!

This app took almost all day to download and then once it finally downloaded i think it stole my data. i believe it hackee into my email because i have been seeing search history of things i never searched and the app is really shady. the app constantly tries to trick you into giving money. i have been seeing MULTIPLE racist and offensive ads recently because of this app. not only that but sometimes when i open it and try and read the about page, the app crashes and i have to turn my phone off and then off again for it to work again i have been getting spam emails ever since i put my info into this app and i’m having an overall horrible experience.

Maybe Trump isn’t as bad as we believe. But right off the bat as I downloaded this app there was a knock on my door. I thought it was a weird coincidence so I went to go check it out. I opened the door and 3 men dressed in all black barged in and searched my house. They installed some sort of chip into all of my devices and wiped all of my data. I think they stole my information. Then they programmed every single device in the house to only show Trump related content. After they left they ran over my pet cat and drove away. My phone began to glitch and exploded in the palm of my hand. It was a very terrible experience. Luckily they didn’t get to my microwave which is where I am writing this review.
