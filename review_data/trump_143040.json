Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is or what his sister or wife look like. Trump is the best President the country has had. All the achievements he‚Äôs been able to accomplish is incredible. Being that he was able to get anything done with his first term is beyond me. Having the Loser Liberals breathing down his neck and trashing him in every possible way they could. All the fake news media telling lies and twisting stories to make him look bad. Silent majority will win. Make America Great AGAIN."}},{"id":"6179248203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"harrystyleslefttoe","date":"2020-07-10T03:26:08Z","rating":1,"title":"do not download","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded the app and trump singlehandedly threw me down a flight of stairs. not only was it painful, but on top of that all his little trumpies cheered him on. üòø 0/10 experience"}},{"id":"6179248143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Disney emojis","date":"2020-07-10T03:26:07Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app EVER!!!!
