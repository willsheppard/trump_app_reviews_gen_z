Disgraceful. Embarrassing.","review":"I have been an avid Trump supporter since the wee age of two. I grew up wanting to be like this beautiful orange man in every way. His vast intelligence never failed to strike me. However, this app changed EVERYTHING. It took not one, not two, but THREE MONTHS to finish loading. It has a total of 1,193,739 misspellings which I counted personally. In fact, every time I opened the app, I could do nothing but gag in disgust before closing it. Not only have you lost me as a supporter, Donald Trump, but this app has permanently harmed my mental, physical, and emotional well-being. I deeply considered taking out my own eyes after viewing the inner workings of this app. I will now vote for Biden. Thank you, Trump app, for opening my eyes to the shameful truth."}},{"id":"6176810910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👄👁 shawty","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:54:41Z","title":"big yikes 😬😅💕🙄🥰","review":"honestly, i downloaded this app hoping to kindle some sort of romance with donald to keep me entertained during the long summer days, but i soon became sadly disappointed. things started out strong with him asking me for my number (and i happily complied! 😝) but then i became nervous that things were moving too fast. i did some thinking, and i realized that even if things worked out between us, it would be weird for me because i’m closer in age to king barron than i am to him. when i tried to communicate this, however, donald became aggressive. he threatened to deport me and my family, which tbh was kind of a turn-off. i think what really did our relationship in, though, was when i suggested changing the aesthetics of the app to the manny flag and he completely ignored me. i guess the way this relationship ended was a blessing in disguise though, because i did some soul searching and am now on a quest to date rodrick heffley 😚✌🏻 so yeah, don’t download this app if you want to avoid an experience like mine. donald, if you’re seeing this, it’s over. 😔💕😤😚🥰"}},{"id":"6176647037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👅👁trump daddy 2020","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:11:30Z","title":"Killed my mom","review":"Well I’m in first grade and my lovely mother said I should download it.

Worst. Decision. Ever. Right after Downloading and opening the app, I got prompted with questions about my info and it definitely started tracking me cause my phone started slowing down. The app itself was so hard to navigate, I could’ve navigated the dark web easier than this. There was also so much disgusting propaganda. I felt like I was being shown subliminal messages that would turn me into a mindless drone of the government. Everything makes sense now. The trump supporters are hypnotized. They were once free but the government has taken them over to “build a wall” the wall being a totalitarian state."}},{"id":"6176044681","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"LillianGlitter","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:16:38Z","title":"Wow just what I Expected","review":"I am I younger personal looking to be in politics when I’m older I got the app to see how different campaigns and things work, I was deeply dissapointed to find that a man such as trump him self could take all the bad things about our country AND MAKR THEM 10 TIMES WORSE not only that but the app it’s self has a bunch of bugs, upon immeasurably opening it the screen lagged and almost immediately restarted. It literally almost screwed up a 1,000+ dollar device that my parents worked hard to get, but I think we all know, we don’t all have the graciousness of not having to work for our money, small load of a million dollars. So I guess to sum it all up, this app is as bad as the -resident it stands for PERIOD."}},{"id":"6175692055","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Raven Alice Winchester","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T08:19:07Z","title":"😼🤖🤕🎃🥱🤖🤢🤖😷👽🤕🥱🤒👾🥱👾🤕☠️🤕😺👿🎃","review":"👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽👽\nI was abducted by aliens while walking down the street. When I awoke, the aliens told me I had to download this app or else they would make Trump president forever and that he could never die. I told them they wouldn’t and they processed to take me to the future. To my surprise Trump was in fact president all the way in the distant future of 9345. I was scared for my life!! I then downloaded the app and now I’m stuck with it. They sent me back down to earth where I keep trying to delete it but my phone keeps glitching. Please don’t download this app!!!

And then after it messaged my mom saying I want McDonald’s and mom you know what she said, she said there’s food at home 😭 so then I got my knife 🔪 and I stabbed an a orange 🍊 and then I buried it ⚰️ but not in just any hole not a 6 foot hole but a 120 foot hole for no one finds it. And during that trip I found dinosaurs 🦕 bones 🦴 and OMG GUESS WHAT they had dinosaurs 🦖 nuggets 🐔 like they were so cool but I sadly had to fill the hole back up and I filled it up with quick sand so if anybody tries finding it they’ll get stuck and die with the orange. Anyways that’s my review for this app go follow my TikTok @.dinonuggetsaregood have a nice day.

It’s outrageous how they could mess up his app! The political views are manipulative telling me to vote or it will take my mothers rights as well as my niece’s! It said my niece will go to live a life without freedom and if I don’t get someone to vote for Donald J. Trump then I will be sued and each day that goes by a new person will get deported. I kept getting notifications saying stuff like “The Official Trump App has downloaded extremely dangerous and harmful malware the only way to get rid of it is by voting for Donald J. Trump.” It was flashy in red bold letters meant to target people out of surprise. It makes me want to move to another country knowing this is the best they could do for the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!!! 1 star I SUGGEST U DOWNLOAD IN ORDER TO RATE ONE STAR!!"}},{"id":"6175335790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fallen ninja","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:04:43Z","title":"this app ruined my life","review":"this app is the reason my parents got divorced:\nit all started when i was looking on my phone and found this game and thought it would be fun to play and so i download but guess what DUN DUN DUN it put a virus on my phone so here i am sitting thinking what am i going to do then my dog was just like “bro just go steal all the zoo animals” so i did then after i got back i gave all the animals to my mom as a compensation for getting a virus on my phone then when the police found the circus in the basement then found the stolen zoo animals too and my mom went to jail for it and then my dad was like “i’m not trying to deal with this horsing around haha... goodbye” so he just left all because of this app. absolutely terrible app😡"}},{"id":"6175099356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dont ask how i did it","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:38:58Z","title":"Horrible app","review":"So i was on tik tok watching tik toks eating tik taks wearing a TikTok shirt and wearing  TikTok pants and drinking orange juice in a TikTok mug and wearing a TikTok hat and TikTok socks and also TikTok shoes sitting on a TikTok couch with TikTok pillows and a TikTok blanket and I had a TikTok carpet... oh no I mean I have a spongbob carpet actually and also I got an TikTok roof and a TikTok car and a TikTok phone and a TikTok chair and a TikTok table and a TikTok oven and TikTok counters and a TikTok fridge and a TikTok bed and a TikTok pillow and a TikTok MacBook and TikTok curtains and TikTok towels and a TikTok toilet and a TikTok bath and a TikTok sink and TikTok walls and TikTok cabinets and TikTok desks and TikTok door knobs and TikTok cups and TikTok plates and TikTok brushes and last but not least a TikTok app anyways  I was thinking why do I have this app and I don’t like trump HA! and Oh Yea CUZ OF TIKTOK!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤯😆😳 And also If u read this to the end it’s cuz u watch TikTok...👀😏"}}]}
