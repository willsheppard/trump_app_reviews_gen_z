Thank u next trump oh wait he’s not even worth the gratitude hope u end up in jail only this time they’ll be putting someone who deserved to be there a long time ago"}},{"id":"6176071744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"D O N T  D O W N L O A D ! !","date":"2020-07-09T10:25:26Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Remainunkniwn","review":"I downloaded this app to support out lovely president but it took 365 days to download. Once it had downloaded I opened the app and immediately hacked my whole entire phone.

But then as I thought everything would go back to normal I get a knock on my door to see ✨Baron trump✨😍😍 he told me he was going to run away from his parents and that we had no Time so then I left with him to go to Mexico. Once we got there he confessed his feelings for me and being the.      ✨😜crackhead😜✨ that I am I of course told him that I like him back so then me and Baron started playing Roblox ."}},{"id":"6175561622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app caused me mental problems.","date":"2020-07-09T07:32:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Morgen07","review":"When I first opened the app it took over my speakers and all I could hear was, “Vote for Trump”, it wouldn’t end and it was going for hours upon hours. Before I knew it it turned into days. I couldn’t think straight or do anything I would normally. I even tried powering off the phone but it wouldn’t leave me alone. I was in constant suffering that wouldn’t end. Finally I took my phone in to get a new one and it was fixed. I had to go through hours of therapy each day to stop the PTSD I was developing from this experience. But it was too late and it took over my mind. I was thinking of making cofefe and nobody knew what that was. My grammar was messed up for weeks and demolished my social life. My boyfriend broke up with me because I was going crazy on the phone. Please do not get this app if you want a successful life, but I had to learn that the hard way. 0/10 would NEVER recommend."}},{"id":"6175055576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"To many cheetos","date":"2020-07-09T04:25:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"jesusdaughted","review":"I downloaded this app to laugh at pictures cheetos with corn hair, but when i went to sleep a karen woke me up saying lil huddy is the real singer of “be happy.“ the next day i saw my fav oompa loompa in dixie damilios concert,he was kissing lil huddy, as i silently walked away when donald trumps weave flew infront of me.(it smelt like cheetos) as i walked home scrolling through this app i got a text from donald trump saying he will pay me to not say anything about him and lil huddy,a few hours later im 1million dollars richer, i flee to canada just to go live with charli damilio to expose him,i get a facetime message from trump crying that hes exposed.I say nothing but laugh.

When I downloaded it I became an orphan trapped in a abandoned house with only lucky charms to eat😾 then trump came to the house and beat my but while I was eating the lucky charms. The app also made my pet alligator eat my freinds and the alligator also found a match and lit my school on fire all from this app😡 the way things are now made me leave trumps cult🤩💅🦎 the app also crashed many times and make me rage so much I broke my phone which cost a lot of money to fix! And they say this app is free ITS NOT. It’s not free cuz it makes you have bad luck and then you have to pay for stuff u break and then trump takes the money and uses it as Toilet paper📱😀😕😽 To stop this from happening don’t get the app if you wanna vote only vote for Biden so that trump loses and then the app gets deleted and your bad luck will go away"}},{"id":"6174694693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Namjoon for president!","date":"2020-07-09T02:35:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Djolos","review":"So there I was sitting on my chair while laying in bed, just minding my business on this app, my husband told me he wasn’t my boyfriend anymore, so I got sad and went to taco bell for a whopper  but then they told me “ ma’am this is a Mc Donald’s drive thru”. So I went to South Korea but they told me I was in North Carolina, i ran into Justin seagull but he just flew away, and then the fire nation started to attack and my husband turned into the moon, I told my enemy turned friend about it and all he said was “that’s rough buddy” so then I told my pet dragon I wish I wish with all my heart to fly with dragons in the land of heart, but this bozo  took me to hell, like common, that’s why I don’t mess with telemarketers. Then all 7 of my kids started to build a snow-women and put red lipstick on it and sang to animals, my husband found out and got mad but I told him I was a virgin, then I woke up and it was all a Dream, this app got me hallucinating man!!!

Japanese, Indian who pumps out high protein oat milk for my babies and also a hybrid of penguin alien looking donkey, I have to say I was very disappointed to open the app. The most disgusting picture popped up and I was so scared I threw my phone across the room, it literally flew into my neighbors’ house. They were mad that it broke their windows and I was mad that my phone broke. But I went over there to get my phone back and and they asked why I did that but then I showed them what I saw and they threw it right back to my house because they got scared , through my window and it broke 😬. But since both our windows broke we didn’t it was fair. The only good thing is that I got my daily exercise in. Because you I don’t get that much excerise for walking my pet fish. But other than getting your daily dose of exercise i do not recommend this app."}},{"id":"6174507304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"horrible. almost died. horror story.","date":"2020-07-09T01:41:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"tay_tayrose","review":"I am VERY disappointed in this app 😣when i first opened this app, i was shocked to see a picture of obama 😲because i thought this was a trump app 😡😡 i thought those darn liberals must’ve hacked it or something 👾so i continue to put my information in and it asks for my address and i think nothing of it 😸until two days later🤯 i start getting birth control delivered to my house from planned parenthood 👹and at that point i was so angry i done near ate my socks off 🧦then my girlfriend comes down stairs to see what i am so very mad about and she says well i’ll use them 😳if you don’t want them❌ 👧🏼and i said that was a sin and now we broke up 😢and to finish 😫my phone started melting into kombucha😡 i know a liberal drink when i see it,😒 and the kombucha was HORRIBLE 😛so moral of this story, do not get this app, it is fake news😠and controlled by those horrible liberals. 👩🏽\u200D🎤#TRUMP2020 🇺🇸#MAGA 🍊#ALLLIVESMATTER🥩 #MAKELIBERALSCRYAGAIN🧄"}},{"id":"6174236274","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Needs improvement!!! Managers need to fix!!","date":"2020-07-09T00:15:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen --- Edwards","review":"I would usually consider myself to be a very kind and optimistic woman, but this app is about as high quality as the spray tan that the Cheeto man on the front page has. It looks like it was created in 1992, and as soon as I logged on, I was assaulted by requests for my personal information!!! I thought that the Terrorist Left wing Communist Thug Evil Obamagate COMMUNIST (did I say that one already?) Radical ANTIFA LIBERALS and their BIG GOVERNMENT were the ones that wanted to steal my personal information! Also, it told me that I could win a photo with the president! I don’t think that I would like that, because what if the Cheeto dust/spray tan rubbed off, and gave some color to my perfect white skin??? (Don’t worry, I’m DEFINITELY not a white supremicist!!) all lives matter! But seriously, the management of the trump campaign needs to look into and fix this horrible app. You would think that it was created by millennial snowflakes!\n-Karen Edwards"}},{"id":"6174094291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T23:23:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hwangfuckmysanity","review":"awh u did so good🌸🧚🏼\u200D♀️but please don’t do this again❤️it made me want to fling myself✨😘 off a very large building💕💕🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️\n- cancer ♋️✨💞⚡️but not the zodiac 🤍🦋🌙⚡️\n- You were so confident🧚\u200D♀️🌸✨ you shouldn’t have been though💞💖🐝\n- 🥺😍💕Your killing the game 🌸💕Wish you were the game tho 🌺💫\n- you go girl 🦋🌈 out this app and never come back 💗🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨\n- you should be a baker 🧚\u200D♀️✨🦋🌸💞💕🌺 like hannah 🦋🧚\u200D♀️✨💕💞🌺🌸🦋\n- oh to see without my eyes ︶👄 ︶\n- Everyone is special 🧚💖💝 But you have a ed at the end ✨💫\n- the confidence is glowing✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️maybe you should turn down the brightness💖🥰\n- my aunt helen keller regained her sense of sound just to lose it again while watching this 🧚🏽\u200D♀️🌟🌈✨💕🦋\n- my mom works on the voice🧚\u200D♀️💓 she ain’t turn around tho❤️💋🌈🦋\n- Go to America’s got talent 💖🧚🏿😍👉 but sit in the audience 💖🥰💜\n- it sounds really good on mute !! ❤️\n- my mom is the tree💖🌲 she said dont come to it besty🌲🌸💖💖\n- don’t listen to the haters 🧚\u200D♂️💘 agree with them ✨💞💝\n- I showed my grandma on lifesupport this 👵😍🤩❤❣💕 she unplugged 🧚\u200D♀️🥰🤩😍✨💅💓💗💖\n- Oh girl 😍🌟💕❤️😍that was HORRENDOUS❤️💕😍⭐️🌟\n- you put the “no” in ‘soprano’ 💕💓💝💖💘💕💝💕😍🤩✨🌈\n- ❤️🌱 is this another form of the death penalty?😍🥰 💜💕💞\n- this is so good💕💖happy Opposite Day💕🧚🏿\u200D♀️💖\n- thanks to modern medicine🥰, my uncle Vincent Van Gogh☺️regained his ear 🤩👂, he cut it off again😌when he heard this 🧚\u200D♀️💖💫"}}]}
