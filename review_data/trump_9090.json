It’s so sad to see people falling down this hell hole. My condolences to those who suffer from the lack of an education. The app took about 8-19 hours to download it was making my phone and internet almost impossible to use!! I couldn’t believe that our president has more time focusing on this campaign than actually doing anything about this amazing civil rights movement and Covid. Get good gg lol","date":"2020-07-08T20:13:22Z","rating":1,"userName":"109787351","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173562373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"once you download this horrible app, it constantly badgers you with notifications and potential viruses!! it made me pay $50 a month in order to continue harassing me, and it wasn’t until i called and spoke to a (rude and much too quiet) representative to stop paying for this bs!! it doesn’t help that trump is a terrible president and doesn’t take care of this country like he’s supposed to. america is a joke to the rest of the world now because of him. dump trump, equality for all!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:07:19Z","rating":1,"userName":"sydney merrick","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173561014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Libtards Made this app!","review":"I cannot begin to explain how terrible this application is. As a Trump supporter i just wanted an application where i could find more ways to support our president but i am not dumb!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP. IT IS A TRICK!!!!!! LIBTARDS MADE THIS TO SABOTAGE OUR PRESIDENT!!!!! IT IS FALSE NEWS!!!!! If you see negative reviews it is because we are playing a trick on them to confuse them so we can take this AWFUL LIE of an app OFF the store. If you are a trump supporter leave a negative review!! i am SICK of all these CHILDREN finding ways to MESS WITH US.

If it were me, I would like a very educated and smart Dorito that knows what they are doing. Doritos are just amazing, they are perfect. And so I think that this app does not let me share my opinion of my favorite chip in the world. If Obama was here, he would make sure that all chips matter, other than Cheetos. I hope that this particular nasty Cheeto dies. Thank you for reading my Ted Talk. 💝😘😋🥺🥺","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"Ben Dover 💕😏","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173501443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Stinky","review":"This app causes all my dogs to have a seizure and die because of the noises that played from it. It brainwashed my fish into killing my cats and feeding them to a secret service member that showed up on my doorstep. My little brother now has gills and can only stay in the bathtub. My dad can now only watch Beethoven 4 or his eyes start to sizzle. Currently hiding in the freezer from my mom who is not convinced she is Edward scissor hands and decided to tape knives to her hands. Worst app ever! Would’ve given it -69/5 stars if possible.","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"berniesbarbiedoll","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173483906","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"An utter disappointment","review":"This is one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded. As soon as it was downloaded, my hamster passed away from cardiac arrest. Not only that, but whenever I click on the app icon, a picture of my deceased seventh grade science teacher appears. I mean how can you be so insensitive, he was my favorite teacher and now the picture of his face, mauled by lion, is brought to my attention and will not leave the screen for at least forty minutes when I try to open the app.","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"extremelydishearted","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173475026","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is really horrible🤢🤮","review":"This app is really really bad I downloaded it and it din’t show me a lot it’s dumb I don’t recommend it and also it’s just a stupid campaign  app its nothing and I know not all people are gonna download this app because a lot of people don’t like Donald Trump also there’s nothing else you can do on it🤢 and also another thing is it was glitchy for me and also there’s like NO point of this app I just hate it anyways if you see this in the AppStore DON’T get it.","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:28Z","rating":1,"userName":"C a cup","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173475891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BEST APP IN THE WORLD!!","review":"The reason why people are leaving 1 star is bc they hate trump and want to take down this app. But I’m not letting anyone take down this app. The people leaving 1 star never even used it. So is there any way the 1 star reviews can be taken down? Bc they need to be taken down. TRUMP 2020!!
