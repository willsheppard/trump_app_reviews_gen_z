Also this app makes you put in your phone number and you just get spam calls and texts all day. Where are the coal jobs he promised? He made tax cuts for corporations that are permenant.

And from the reviews on this app it is definitely is not the even close to being as good. Sorry but I do not recommend this app. It’s probably going to waste your storage.

Don’t waste your time and energy on this app because as soon as I downloaded it my whole house has been smelling like moldy cheese.

Once I got it the news was horrible and not up to date at all. This app is horrible and I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy. So slow, asked for my personal information (and I think selling it), and out of date news. Very fitting for something to go along with President Trump’s  campaign","userName":"abigallllllllllllllllll","date":"2020-07-10T01:49:30Z","title":"Don’t do it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179010803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"review":"The 1 star average is a result of hundreds of thousands of mentally deficient zoomers collectively clinging to TikTok because they can’t see the bigger picture.
