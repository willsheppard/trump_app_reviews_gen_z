It promotes things that have no place in this country. I cannot believe that this is even allowed to be on the App Store. Besides all the bad things it supports it’s also extremely glitchy and confusing and needs a couple updates to even work properly. I have never downloaded a worse app. PLS don’t download.","rating":1,"userName":"🌻bree🌻","isEdited":false,"title":"If I could rate this any worse I would."}},{"id":"6173707329","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:54Z","review":"\"네 손님\"\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지\n까치까지 까마귀들까지\nCooking a sauce 입맛대로 털어\n음미하고 lick it 말해 bon\nTaste so good 반응은 모두 쩔어\nBut 모두 자극적인 거\nI want it till 다 먹일 때까지\n연구하지 cross boundaries\n경계 따위 없어 마치 창조하듯 소리를 만들지\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\n지금 바로 눈에 불을 켜\nI just wanna taste it, make it hot\n새로운 불판 위에 track을 달궈\n메뉴 골라 call me up\n원하는 걸로 다 serve\nDu du du du du du\nCookin' like a chef, I'm a five star 미슐랭\n\"미\"의 정점을 찍고 눈에 보여 illusion\nWhoo 첨 느꼈지 이런 감정\n놀랄 거야 gonna shock 바로 감전\n자물쇠 따 싹 다 (다) unlock (lock)\nIdea bank 머릿속을 털어 털어\n비밀재료가 궁금하다면 (하다면)\n사실 우린 그딴 거 안 써\n그저 계속 만들어가 새롭게\nBecause we're one of a kind\n누구도 따라 할 수 없는 our own game\n시작부터 다 우리 꺼\n잠깐 떠나간다 해도\n결국 다시 찾게 될\n열기가 식지 않는 메뉴 지금부터 싹 다\n입맛에다 때려 박아\nDu du du du du du\n뭐든 그냥 집어넣어\n눈치 보지 말고 더\n망설이지 말고 부어\n비벼 비벼\n\"네 손님\"\nDu du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n이게 우리 탕 탕 탕탕\nDu du du du du du\n어서 오십시오\n이 가게는 참 메뉴가 고르기도 쉽죠\n뭘 시켜도 오감을 만족하지 하지\n지나가던 나그네, 비둘기까지 까치까지\nDu du du du du du","rating":1,"userName":"jdjsjskakakssl","isEdited":false,"title":"horrible app!!"}},{"id":"6173700637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:56:24Z","review":"This took 3 hours to download!!

After a week the app downloaded. The app has many bugs and need improvements. The creators did not take their time on this app because it is absolutely garbage F for effort. Not to mention this app has too many ads. Overall do not recommend getting this app. Joe Bidden for 2020.","rating":1,"userName":"Trump is an asswhole","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst App"}}]}
