Not long after I downloaded it my toes began poop uncontrollably. And don‚Äôt get me started on my eyes. THE HORROR I witnessed was absolutely TRAUMATIZING. My eyes began to bleed and sting when I read his ‚Äúnews‚Äù. I would recommend this app to my arch nemesis so they could feel the same pain I did while within 6 feet of this terror house he tried to call an app. I also noticed the most strange activity going on in my freezer after downloading this. Let me just say, that the muffins WERE NOT in the freezer and I was very triggered by this. I think that our beloved Cheeto puff tried and failed miserably, probably all of that artificial orange tan finally seeping into his last few brain cells. When I encounter the creature we call our president, I will be sure to spray some tan all around his eyes where it‚Äôs missing, but in the meantime I think I‚Äôm going to bathe all of the orangy cheetoey images out of my brain and do a nice cleanse to completely get rid of the images!","date":"2020-07-09T23:24:25Z","title":"No ‚ù§Ô∏è","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178600431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Kamela Benkoucha","review":"BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON BOYFRIEND BARRON\n.. follow my tiktok @_kamelabenkhoucha‚ú®\nfollow my instagram too in my tiktok bio‚ú® \nit‚Äôs the same username as my tiktok‚ú®\nwe can be friends‚ú®","date":"2020-07-09T23:23:51Z","title":"SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178600311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Nightshade10112","review":"This app took 1-2 business days to download.

This app TAKES FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD BECAUSE IT IS COPYING EVERYTHING ON YOUR PHONE. The scariest part was that I no longer had access to my photos after I downloaded it, and there are pictures of my family on there!! What are they doing with these pictures of my family??? The app itself asks for your phone number and zip code in order to pinpoint your location and track your movements AND THEY HAVE PICTURES OF ME AND MY FAMILY. This is so scary!!! I started getting threatening text messages telling me that Trump knows where I live and knows what I look like and what my family looks like and if I don‚Äôt vote for him, then his campaign will ruin us. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! It will find whatever information it needs to threaten you and keep it in another country!!!","date":"2020-07-09T23:22:01Z","title":"This App Will Sell Your Information!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178593397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Hellopotatos","review":"Anime‚Äôs I‚Äôve watchedü¶•\n\n1.My Hero Academia üìòü¶∏üèª\n\n2.Naruto üç•\n\nThe Movie:Legend of the Stone Gelel \n\nThe Movie: Ninja Clash of the Land of Snow\n\nThe Movie:\n\n3.Your Lie in April üéªüéπ\n\n4.Blue Exorcist üòà\n\n5.Devilman Crybabyüëºüèª\n\n6.Lu Over the Wall üßúüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n7.Attack on Titianüßü\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n8.Demon Slayer üó°\n\n9.Angel Beats üëºüèªüéµ\n\n10.A Silent Voice üßèüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüéá\n\n11.Your Name üìùüåÑ\n\n12.Weathering with you üåå\n\n13.Kaguya-sama:Love is Warüìöüßëüèª\u200D‚öñÔ∏è\n\n14.Deathnote üñã\n\n15.Saiki K:ReawakenedüîÆ\n\n16.Seven Deadly Sins üßöüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüßùüèªüßôüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüßõüèª\n\n17.Violet Evergarden ü¶æ‚úâÔ∏è\n\n18.Toilet Bound Hanako-kun üëªüöΩ\n\n19.Dr. Stoneüßëüèª\u200Düî¨ü•ºüß™üî¨\n\n20.Ouran High school Host Club üëîüåπ\n\n21.Maid-sama üë©üèªüßπüç≥\n\n22.Black Clover‚òòÔ∏èüßùüèª\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è\n\n23.Black Butler üßõüèªüßëüèªüïµüèª\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n24.Hunter x Hunter üé£‚ö°Ô∏è‚õìüíº\n\n25.Cells at Works üß´ü¶†\n\n26.Fire Force üë®üèª\u200Düöí‚òÑÔ∏è\n\n27.The Promised Neverland üè°ü•©\n\n28.Kakegurui üÉè\n\n29.7 Seeds üçÉüçÇüå∏üå®\n\n30.Haikyuu üèê\n\n31.Parasyte üßü\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èü©∏\n\n32.Darling in the FranXX ü§ñ\n\n33.Hyouka üìñüñä\n\n34.Balanced:Unlimited üíµüëÆüèª\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n35.Mob Psycho 100üìöüìø\n\n36.Asobi Asobase EP:9\n\n37.Tokyo Ghoul\n\n38.A Whisker Awayüê±‚õ©üëò\n\n39.Ne Zhaüí•‚ùÑÔ∏è(technically not anime)\n\n40.Teasing Master Takagi-sanüìöüé≠\n\n41.Foodwars üçúüç±üçô\n\n42.Akkun to Konojo üë©üèª\u200Dü§ù\u200Düë®üèºüíï\n\n43.BNA( Brand New Animals)üåÉüïµüèª\u200D‚ôÇÔ∏èüê∫","date":"2020-07-09T23:21:00Z","title":"DISGUSTING APP IT KILLED MY ENTIRE CLAN","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178591146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"(c\" ‡≤§,_‡≤§)„ÇÜ„Åç","review":"I downloaded this app in order to support the great ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçpedophile we call a president but I now regret downloading this.
