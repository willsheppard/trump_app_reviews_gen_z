Phone is always freezing, home button became delayed. I’m just so distraught that our amazing Dictato- I meant PRESIDENT Trump, yes president is what I meant, could even think of putting such a terrible thing on the App Store. I am 100% reconsidering my vote in the coming up elections.","userName":"indented knee caps","title":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded!!"}},{"id":"6173751214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:15:00Z","review":"This app is the worst app ever. It’s disgusting, its inappropriate for kids. This should be ban from any App Store forever. This is not safe and should not be used ever again. This is soo bad because you can get hacked by the President and from the creators. Please never use this app in any\n circumstances, this is a horrible app and should never be used again. \n        Thank you","userName":"SNaiL153","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173749679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:14:28Z","review":"This app is so bad.

The apps terms and conditions are too invasive of my private information. In order to do anything in the app I have to give my phone number. I’ve heard a lot about 5G radiation and I’m not gonna test my luck. Also I can’t afford messaging rates, talk about blocking out your cult, I mean, fan base","userName":"Alice Cindy Anderson-Baxter","title":"Too invasive off an app"}},{"id":"6173707647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:59:02Z","review":"chile, lemme start by saying i was trying to support the orange king, until a traumatizing series of events occurred.
