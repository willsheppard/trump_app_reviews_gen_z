Anyways the app it’s self is almost as bad as him (and that’s saying a lot since he’s racist) it’s so stupid we obviously like Obama better. 🥱🙄 The logo needs to change to Obama 2020 duhh! And the purpose of the app too it needs to be about how our “president” is racist and how he ruined our lives!😑 I truly hate this app.😤 Do not recommend at all.🥴"}},{"id":"6174047466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"didnfjkskskwlzxk","title":"Oh to see without my eyes 👁💧👄💧👁poopy frick face","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:06:04Z","review":"I opened the app and straight away there was an Oompa Loompa staring at me, I started to vommit and it got on my phone, my phone is broken now, I have to write this review on my koalas butt.
