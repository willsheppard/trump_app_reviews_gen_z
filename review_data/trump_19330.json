It took my grandmother 2 hours to finally get into it because of the poorly designed user interface. On top of that, the app constantly crashes, even if I have only been in it for only 30 seconds. The best word to describe this app is 🌸✨terrible✨🌸.","userName":"averageanon","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:13:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not User Friendly"}},{"id":"6177292050","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is complete trash. The only good thing about it, is that I can delete it off my phone. Why does Trump look like he’s gonna cry in the picture they used? Is it because he knows his app is trash? I’d cry, too. This is such a disappointment in every way possible. Kinda like 2020. And kinda like Trump’s whole presidential term. I said what I said. #BlackLivesMatter #ByeByeTrump","userName":"JusticeForVanessaGuillen","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:06:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trashhhhh"}},{"id":"6177289118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t believe I even thought of downloading this app. This was a pain to try to download in the first place and when I actually had it, it just got even worse. Looks like I should’ve listened to the other thousands of one star reviews. This app should be taken off of the store completely.","userName":"Katlover5","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:05:41Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is so bad"}},{"id":"6177280084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app on the App Store. You would think with trump being in the bunker for so long he’d have a better set up but obviously not. But it’s okay. From what I gathered from his tweets his IQ is “too high” and we’re all “just losers” 😌 I don’t mean to take up any more of your time. Enjoy your day & make sure to make November 3rd the BEST DAY EVERR (even if it is sleepy joe in office 😴) 😼","userName":"bunker boy's booboo bear","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:03:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6177247701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"installed this app and almost immediately my phone began to crash. it’s been a week now and my phone gets new bugs and viruses every day all traced back to this app. also, i have reason to believe that through this app donald trump is sending our private information to foreign governments. this is disgusting and a misuse of power.","userName":"Kayleigh39","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:53:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"APP RUINED MY LIFE FOR REAL"}},{"id":"6177237653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was so delighted to be able to get an app to support our beloved cheeto but it took over a month to download! that doesn’t seem right 😞 anyways even after opening the app my phone started to glitch and the lopez brothers jumped out and started doing tiktok dances with james charles singing in the background 😱!!! although i loved their performance, i was getting ready to tuck myself in bed and felt like having a little bit of privacy. anyways, i hope orange bunker boy can create a new app so i can try it out and rate it again! don’t remove tiktok you racist misogynistic nasty old rat ☺️","userName":"megan chacko","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:50:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"i hate this app 😡"}},{"id":"6177187456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app because I’m about to become voting age and I wanted to learn and participate more with Trumps campaign but the app kept crashing and kicking me off. Also I made an account and when I tried to log in it said there was no account made for that email which was very frustrating. Honestly not a good app to begin with.","userName":"Tiny Chuck","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:36:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"System Crashs"}},{"id":"6177158144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrendous. I opened it and immediately went into cardiac arrest. I realized that I refuse to lose my life to a Trump app, so I proceeded to fight through the painful experience, my heart is fine now, after using my knowledge of the cardiovascular system in sophomore year of hs. Although my trauma continues to live on. This app is a painful reminder of my near death experience.","userName":"fshhvxg","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Daddy Anonymous"}},{"id":"6177138895","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"A man that makes way to take away an app where people express themselves, as well as take away an app that I for one spent hours on end using, deserves to loose their app. This app is trash anyway and honestly it doesn’t benefit anyone or anything. Therefore I belive it deserves a one star rating and anyone else using this app should too.","userName":"DontFuckWithTikTok","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:22:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointment"}},{"id":"6177130418","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app continually crashed multiple times in a row. I tried to be happy with the app and learn about our countries and plans for the future but it seems as if the app is out dated and completely full of bugs (worms if you will). It’s really disappointing that the app does not complete the job it was created to do. I am infuriated.","userName":"Zach00789","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:20:22Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Bug fixes needed!"}}]}
