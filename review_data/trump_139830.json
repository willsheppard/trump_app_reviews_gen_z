After it finally downloaded and I first opened up the app I saw this disgusting rotten orange Oompa Loompa creature. I got so scared that I threw my phone all the way to China. After I flew my private jet over to China and got my phone back i got a text message from a random number. The number sent me the same picture I saw when I first opened this app: a disgusting rotten orange Oompa Loompa creature. I got disgusted so I tried to delete the app but it wasn’t letting me. Once I deleted the app it re appeared and it kept doing that. I tried resetting my phone but the app was still there. Then when I went to bed at night I started getting a weird feeling that someone was watching me. When I turned around I saw MELANIA TRUMP. She kidnapped me and took me to the White House. The White House smelled so disgusting. Kinda like a rotten orange. Then melania taped me on a table and left to go get someone. When she returned she returned with A DISGUSTING ROTTEN ORANGE OOMPA LOOMPA CREATURE. I couldn’t move because I was taped against the table. Then the rotten orange picked me up and took me to the kitchen stove but i was squiggling around a lot so I was able to escape his arms. I ran away from the White House that smelt like rotten oranges so fast and now I’m lost somewhere in Washington D.C. I highly encourage you to not download this app because it almost ate me and now I’m lost and homeless.","userName":"slydlydludlu","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:13:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP ALMOST ATE ME.
