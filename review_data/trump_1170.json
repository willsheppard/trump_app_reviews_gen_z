I was very disappointed because I wanted to hear the walking spray tan’s paper thin lips disregard people’s race, gender, and beliefs😡. When it did eventually download a message popped up on the screen talking me to sacrifice my pet mole rat to Cthulhu or else a stupid snowflake liberal will will give all of the other snowflake liberals the will power and ability to overthrow the government. I, a devoted trump supporter obviously followed of the racist rapist’s instructions blindly because I have a mind of my own and I don’t make all of my life choices by listing to an orange traffic cone.  Whence I sacrificed my pet mole rat I immediately turned on Fox News and to my surprise these gen z children are still fighting for there stupid rights. It makes me sick that this app didn’t completely destroy the gen z hopes and dreams like I thought it would😡😡😡.","isEdited":false,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T19:11:04Z","rating":1,"userName":"shreks car"}},{"id":"6173273630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💫This app is terrible. To think that the apple store would allow an app centered around a truly awful racist man makes my heart hurt. Besides that point, the app took forever to download and once opened it proceeded to kick me off repetitively. I then tried to fix the problem by shutting my phone off and restarting it only for my phone to glitch out and not let me leave the app for days on end. I am very disappointed in the structure/functionality of this app. Something designed by our almighty president should definitely work a lot better. This app does not work at all and is causing major problems with my phone, *whispers* almost like how Donald Trump isn’t fit to be in such a position of power because he causes major problems in our government and refuses to act like a mature adult. This app is unfit to be in the apple store just like Donald is unfit to be the president, simple as that.🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💫","isEdited":false,"title":"Truly Terrible","date":"2020-07-08T18:28:59Z","rating":1,"userName":"weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesee"}},{"id":"6173092276","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app has got to be the worst app ever. It makes me nauseous when I’m on it and I have no idea why!?!  Maybe it’s the orange reflecting off the screen from his big orange head, but I’m not sure. Or maybe it’s the way he talks. I guess I don’t know. Someone should help me figure this crazy thing out. I get horrible migraines when I’m on it and makes me want to throw up. It could be the fact that I’m a women! He’s trying to attack me through social media with his misogynistic ways. Oh no. I might die from this. I think it’s very important that this app gets removed so no one else has to suffer from this😔 it’s terrible what I’ve had to go through. I hope no one else has had to deal with this either. Very painful. 0/10 wouldn’t recommend.","isEdited":false,"title":"Caused me to suffer","date":"2020-07-08T17:30:16Z","rating":1,"userName":"olivia mollet"}},{"id":"6173052462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"trump killed baby animals and you want to support him? shows the kind of people u are. if you vote for him again ur a white supremacists. all though that’s not very below you now is it. you voted a misogynistic, racist, rapist, pedo, homophobe, and CHEETO🤬🚷📵 ARE YOU KIDDING AMERICA ARENT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST⁉️  HE WANTS TO BAN TIK TOK? that’s signs of a communist government😿 are you guys okay? he has not done any good for this country in fact he’s made the country worse. do you think all this blm movement’s would still be happening if bernie or obama was president, no!✊🏿 i stand with my black brothers and sisters and Mexican brothers and sisters.🇲🇽 WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. i pray and pray Donald duck trump doesn’t get to be president again because i have a bigger pepe than him😇 baby bunker. he’s a child that preys on children. your president was “inspecting” a bunker, “inspecting” sounds like hiding to me!🤬 i am enraged with what America has come to. i hope one day god will come and rescue us soon. amen!😇🙏🙏❤️❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"black lives matter","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"reeeaannn"}},{"id":"6173032140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to gain knowledge about our president but the app took hours to download and made my phone glitch. My phone is new,  I bought it about 3 months ago and now it doesn’t work!! Thanks mr. president!! I mean I do read the news and I am well aware that trump has failed to succeed and has ruined many many many things and doesn’t have his opinions and thoughts fixed up, but I would have never expected him to not even be able to make a working app. Terrible terrible terrible, only download if you are willing to have your phone completely broken and glitched. After downloading you receive daily emails and text messages of CLOWNS, i know super scary, now I have to pay 500 DOLLARS just to fix and get rid of these glitches THANKS TO TRUMP. Also let’s get all those poor children out of those dirty cages, they are not animals. Let’s get rid of gun violence.

The first example that comes to mind is “Make America Great Again”. I couldn’t help but notice that America has never been “great” for anyone other than the white man. With that being said, I don’t think anyone should download this app due to the false information it entails. \n\nMy loving, innocent grandmother had downloaded this app with high hopes as well. She had laser eye surgery just under a year ago and has been recovering very well. until she downloaded this app. Once she opened the app, the amount of overwhelming colors and flashing confused her eyes. Grandma then had a seizure and fell to the floor causing severe damage to her brain. She’s not been recovering very well and plans to vote against Trump in November of the 2020 election. that is, if she makes it that long. \n\nAlso, if we must remove tik tok then we must also remove this garbage✨🧚🏻🥰#GenZ2020","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump 2020 belongs in the trash","date":"2020-07-08T16:14:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"notbunkerboy123"}},{"id":"6172521599","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"If only I can give this app zero stars instead of even one. I downloaded this app and my phone started vibrating and it wouldn’t stop. So I closed the app and my phone started emitting this terrible smell. Then roaches and spiders preceded to appear outta nowhere and crawl out of my phone. They hung my baby brother on a rope with a knife over the top of my house. I begged them to stop but the had mustaches and little tiny bug mags hats. They also drives little bug trucks. They screamed trump 2020 in their bug language and cut the rope hanging my little brother. I caught him just in time, but these creatures, never stopped haunting me. 2 days later, I find them all on the floor in there little trucks, and they charged at me. Then I woke up from my coma. Doctors said I had a heart attack and went into a three day coma after opening the app and seeing this weird orange guy in a black suit staring at me. Almost DIED!!!

I’ve had this app for about 5 minutes and tell me why every time I enter a room there’s this group of boys wear “mags” hats 🤢 they’re out of style i even tried giving them my clothes (im a girl) they wouldn’t wear it even though their clothes were AWFUL I might be wrong but I think trump supporters have bad taste in clothes. (I’m never wrong btw) anyways started chanting Kay and I got so mad because they come into my house and assume my name. Then they started circling around this orange and I got scared because I read that there is this thing called the orange demon so I thought they were summoning the orange demon. Then they started throwing oranges at my grandpa (he took karate classes) then my grandpa drop kicked all of them now they’re in our basement. Don’t worry 🙄 I feed them every now and then.\nmoral of the story you can’t order food on here. 😒","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m angry Ight I’m angry.","date":"2020-07-09T18:20:42Z","rating":1,"userName":"im angry ight im angry-spencer"}},{"id":"6177585205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app after my libtarted mom wouldn’t let me travel to Tulsa for the rally bc of covid. I wanted to support our savior trump in anyway I can, but the app kept crashing on me. I deleted and re-downloaded, and shut my phone on and off again, but it kept crashing. Eventually, everything on my phone started glitching. All of my other apps were crashing, and then my phone started doing crazy stuff like opening apps by itself and typing by itself. I took it to Verizon and the apple store, and all they could say was “water damage.” I had to buy a new phone, and I don’t have any money because I’m still laid off from covid. But then I realized that my social media accounts had been changed. I think this app is partnered with Russia or something and they’re still meddling in our elections because this just doesn’t make any sense. This app is horrible.
