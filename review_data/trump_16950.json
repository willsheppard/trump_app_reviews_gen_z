Horrible, skewered and overall POOR. It seems like out of the millions of dollars he couldn’t bother to find anyone to actually make a good app for him- or maybe all the people who are intelligent decided that they couldn’t contribute to his negative cause. Overall the app is terrible and even worse it started off with a picture of some random  orange orge. Strange. Anywho- Dethrone Facism","title":"Trash App!!!!"}},{"id":"6134429852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cutiecooki0302","date":"2020-06-29T04:31:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Honestly who designed the app? It looks horrible, it also uses personal info against you if you refuse to vote for trump. I absolutely hated it as i was spammed with emails and messages threatening my poor minority life. Trying to send me across the world to china because since im chinese i somehow have the chinese virus. Absolutely horrible. I couldnt even see anything with the yellow words on the bright orange background. Terrible","title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6134262012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Liz_alvarez","date":"2020-06-29T03:19:32Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I download the app to keep my self Inform during the election and before the election because our president is the MOST RELIABLE SOURCE of information out there and HE CAN’T POSSIBLY lied to us.

Turns out he actually talks like that😬😬. I’ve been thinking a lot recently that he may need medical attention because it is getting extremely noticeable that he sounds like a dying pig. Can’t wait to watch him burn in hell🥰🥰🥰","title":"Very disgusting.

THIS APP WAS NOT HELPFUL!  It does not seem like it’s run by Donald J. Trump.
