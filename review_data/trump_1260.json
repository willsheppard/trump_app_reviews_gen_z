I opened the app for a second time and my phone started heating up hotter than Mr. Trump’s hot Cheeto face and I got very worried. So I put my phone in the freezer so it could cool down and when I took it back out and opened it I saw that the app hacked my entire phone and suddenly I had conservative right wing propaganda all over my phone! There were so many ads popping up and Mr. Trump’s face was everywhere I didn’t know what to do! I ended up throwing my phone down a cliff and spraying it with water and then burying it and right after that I made sure to cleanse myself with some essential oils because I don’t want the radio waves that the phone emits to get inside my brain and brainwash me.

When I downloaded the app to see what our #1 news app was and to educate myself on modern politics. Not only did the app take over a month to even download onto my phone, when I opened it for the first time it was a terrible set up with only two options of “watcher” or “player”. Frankly I was very confused since I thought this was to sign up for rallies for the orangest president we’ve ever had. I then chose player and the app would then vibrate throughout the day to get me to do a date for cash. Again, I’m very confused, but it’s the government paying me I think, so I went for it. I soon became the lead player in the game, and the grand prize came between me and, to my great surprise, trump. Our final dare is to kill one another, so I do it. I then saw him on the news 3 days later so He was cloned and the governments after me. Help.","date":"2020-07-09T15:12:53Z","userName":"Jennie fort","title":"THE WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176862647","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to support our greatest ever Orange Faced President and make sure to be able to register for ALL of his upcoming campaign rallies because Covid is a hoax and the emails!! But unfortunately as soon as I downloaded the app and began using it to gaze fondly at the pictures of the largest attended inauguration in history, a strange thing began to happen. At first I noticed that it was harder and harder to reach the edges of my phone with my thumbs. Then my phone, along with other things, began to look bigger in my hands. It finally hit me. My hands were actually SHRINKING!! How could this be??!! There’s no way it’s part of a plot by the great orange despot’s all powerful plan to shrink the hands of everyone else so that he can finally have the YUGGEST hands that any one has ever seen right?!? I mean that’s just crazy. Anyhow, don’t download this app. Unless you want to have tiny hands like me.","date":"2020-07-09T14:08:20Z","userName":"chinman2677","title":"Shrinking Hands!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176525631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible, all of the trump supporters are rude and uneducated.

He’s already a married man which is why it’s disgusting that he’s asking for my digits. That is highly inappropriate for a man of his age, don’t get me wrong he’s hot but that’s just making it seem like it’s an OK thing to happen. I decided to put my phone number in and everyday after got at least 50 notifications!!! 50 NOTIFICATIONS!! So I decided to delete the app and 2 weeks later I heard a knock on my door; it was confusing since no one liked me after finding out I supported him. When I opened the door I saw about 12 Oompa Loompas holding 14 Cheeto bags practically BEGGING me to redownload the app. First off, how did they find my location?! 1 Star. Wish I could give it 0 for these horrible life lessons for children AND hacking my device to find my location Good day xxz","date":"2020-07-09T09:16:21Z","userName":"🤬 def not a karen","title":"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175235757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"\"Polnareff, have you ever considered why humans wish to live? Humans live hoping to conquer their anxieties and fear, and attain peace of mind. Seeking fame, controlling others, and acquiring wealth are all done to achieve peace of mind. Marriage and friendship are also pursued as means of attaining peace of mind. When humans say they wish to help others, or that a thing is done for love or justice...it's all merely to give themselves peace of mind. To achieve peace of mind is the goal of all mankind. Now, given that, what anxiety could you possibly feel towards serving me? Any other peace of mind would come easily if you do. Doesn't challenging me, even knowing that it may spell your loss, bring you anxiety? You are a very capable Stand user. It's a waste to kill you. Why not cut ties with Joestar and the others, and serve me for eternity? I can promise you peace of mind for eternity.\"\n— DIO trying to bring Polnareff back to his side","date":"2020-07-09T05:26:08Z","userName":"DIO Brando x ZA WARUDO","title":"This app is as bad as his hidden past 😭☠️😭☠️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175111432","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to support our fat orange president, but then when i opened the app it showed me an extremely large orange blob🤨.

Those thoughts made me ✨EXTREMELY✨ uncomfortable and when i tried to leave the app it did not let me and told me to subscribe and it said that if i did NOT subscribe he would hack into my family’s bank account and take all the money away and hide it on a secret island that mustn’t be named😩  and it also said he will find where i live and he would take me away, lock me in a room and do very ✨💔🤟🏽unholy✨💔🤟🏽things to me and my tiny precious little body😳💔😔 i am very ashamed that people call this BOY their president🤢. umm.. chile anywaysss😗💅🏽 don’t download this pedophiles app❤️","date":"2020-07-09T04:42:55Z","userName":"😩❤️😔✨","title":"⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD⚠️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174989624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got this app excited to get updates on our amazing president. unfortunately, there were SO many glitches on the app. this app drained my battery, froze my phone, and worst of all kept spamming my phone with notifications. when i downloaded this app i expected to get notifications a few times a day. but i was disappointed when i began received up to FOURTY notifications each 10 minutes ! most of the notifications weren’t even useful information! i even tried silencing my phone but it kept glitching instead. the trump team NEEDS TO update this app ASAP! after checking the app to see that i had 100 notifications after 30 minutes i noticed my phone was glitching a lot and that i had gotten a virus from the app. soon after i immediately deleted the app ! i should of never downloaded it in the first place, so i’m advising that neither should you😾","date":"2020-07-09T04:04:19Z","userName":"nikkkkiiih","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
