Furthermore if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. After this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine.\n\nThat’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:49Z","userName":"That_one_guy_420"}},{"id":"6173781883","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"the orange man 🟠👄🟠","review":"i would like to say that this is the WORST app i have ever downloaded in my entire life!!! first of all it took 3 WEEKS for it to download. once i opened the app 20 flying monkeys came to my house screaming “trump 2020!” “trump 2020!” 🐒🐒!!! this made me super uncomfy :(((. on top of this this orange man on my phone screen started talking about building a wall around my house if i didn’t vote for him in the upcoming election 👁👄👁. i threw my phone against the wall and my phone broke!!! when i was going to bed that night i saw that orange man again and he was my sleep paralysis demon!! he started to threaten me and call me stupid for disliking his app!! he made me feel like a clown 🤡🤡. after my dreadful experience with this app i highly recommend to my friends to never get this app. thank you so much for listening!","date":"2020-07-08T21:26:16Z","userName":"🧚✨✨"}},{"id":"6173742552","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible APP","review":"I installed this app bc trump do be fine asl and honestly I believe in white supremacy so obviously I support him and want him to be president so he can continue to abuse his power and continue to do unspeakable things to children, however, this app was not up to my standards. I opened the app and the visuals were truly horrible, there was a picture of an incredibly scary figure and I was with my daughter at the time so she was screaming, she wanted to see white supremacy at its finest instead she got traumatized for the rest of her life and is now a Democrat. The app also kept restarting and wanting to update but nothing great actually happened, it was almost as if trying to make something great again that was never great to begin with just didn’t work. I will be needing therapy after this app.","date":"2020-07-08T21:11:51Z","userName":"dlsnsoana"}},{"id":"6173697930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app made me go to the hospital 😱","review":"So obviously 🙄 like everyone else, I was going through the app because I love mr orange 🍊 Cheeto puff man 👨. And when I closed the app I was attacked by his orange 🍊Cheeto man 👨 army. I was soooo scared 😱 and I told them to stop 🛑 ✋, but they kept attacking me😰. So then I had to go to the hospital 🏥. But then they followed me, and tried to kill the ambulance 🚑 people!!!! I know what your thinking 🤔 🧠, why did they try to kill the ambulance people and not me🤔? So you see 👀, they kept calling the mr orange 🍊 Cheeto puff man 👨army a bunch of racists ( cause that’s what they are 🤫) and then the mr orange 🍊 Cheeto puff man 👨 army got really angry 😡. But luckily the ambulance 🚑 peopleknew how to fight back. So then the ambulance 🚑 people were able to get me to the hospital 🏥 in one piece. DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP OR THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN TO YOU! I am a surviver 😤 NOT a victim 😤😡!","date":"2020-07-08T20:55:25Z","userName":"charmesser729"}},{"id":"6173591711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app hurt my dog","review":"I got this app because since 2016, I’ve loved Trump and his policies. After downloading this app, which I thought would be a great step in my faith in Trump, I realized that this app is the worst possible app to ever exist. First, when I downloaded it, my hamster randomly died the minute it finished downloading. Of course, I thought this was a coincidence. Maybe she just ate something she wasn’t supposed to. Whatever. The next day, my mother found that my hamster are a Trump logo that was in his cage. Previously, I never had a Trump logo in my hamsters cage, so that was weird. A few days after, my dog had to go to the vet. He was throwing up like crazy. Then they found a Trump magnet in his stomach, something that I had not previously owned. So, I deleted the app and none of my other animals were hurt. One star.","date":"2020-07-08T20:17:25Z","userName":"HadleighJae"}},{"id":"6173515119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I’m devestated","review":"I downloaded the app and not only did take a full month it also completely shut down my phone. So after I got a new phone I got the app again but when I opened there were reminders to eat squirrels and raccoons. I was horrified. So when I tried to delete the app it wouldn’t let me and this time told me to sacrifice my pet camels to 🍊. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Me and my family were crying because we loved our pet camels but not as much as our pet kangaroo. We were hear broken to say the least at the death of camels and the app still wouldn’t delete. So I threw my phone out of the window while driving but I found it under my pillow when I got home. WHAT KIND OF SORCERY DOES THIS APP USE. I’m afraid for my life dearly please DO NOT get this app or the same thing might happen to you.","date":"2020-07-08T19:51:10Z","userName":"ihatetrump.com"}},{"id":"6173433808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","review":"i downloaded this app so that i could see our iconic legendary show stopping president, but every time i went on the app an enlarged volatile orange cheeto kept popping up on my screen! my brother was right next to me when i opened it up for the first time, and now he has PTSD and can’t go to sleep! i really wanted to see our lovely president, but the image of an orange cheeto with the parts of a cheap Costco croissant and goodwill wig has been burned into my retinas so that everywhere i look it’s that terrible monster! i can’t see anymore, and it’s gotten so bad that i tripped over my bathroom and fell down into the grand canyon! i’ve been typing this since i’ve been free falling! don’t download this app unless you don’t value your vision! if i could give it 0 stars, i would. 0/10 don’t recommend ❤️","date":"2020-07-08T19:23:26Z","userName":"Tyler🏋🏻🏈🎣🐟"}},{"id":"6173430519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"ALL LIVES MATTER","review":"Why is this orange dude our president? Obviously all of his supporters have looked past all his wrong doings. Come on now, are you joking? How are you going to be against the LGBTQ+ community, they’re trying to live their lives to the fullest and being straight isn’t a norm and it shouldn’t be a privilege. Every person is human. How are you going to allow medical care for criminals and not for people who like specific people or identify as a specific gender? It doesn’t affect anyone and it only makes their lives harder when they try to be themselves in a world full of people against them for no reason. You don’t know anyone personally, you don’t know if they’re a jerk or whether they’re the best person you’ll ever meet. You just judge them by what you see or their identification.","date":"2020-07-08T19:22:22Z","userName":"radiorebel😊"}}]}
