I then proceeded to be rushed by ambulance to the hospital and have both of my ear removed. I am now deaf. After that i opened the app again and it send out lasers that stripped my eyes of their protective lenses and my eyes burned to dust under the heat of the blazing Arizona sun. One last time i opened up the app and i saw that cheeto lookin orange peel starin right at me and i died right there. My heat stopped and flatlined because this app was so bad. I am not writing this from the tiny corners of my casket in hope of one ounce of redemption.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:56Z"}},{"id":"6177648774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trump 2020 💖🧚\u200D♂️✨ but dead","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND!","rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app I was so happy and excited to be able to show my support for my favorite Cheeto Puff President. I have always loved Mr. Trump, and I constantly act like I’m blind when he gets exposed for being racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. Anyways, when I download this app it caused me to have a heart attack!! I realized how I was a part of a huge cult that brainwashed me and left me leading behind Mr. Tiny Hands Trump like a blind sheep! My piece of advice to you is to open your eyes and stop viewing your political party as more of a tribe than a checkbox! Much love, your favorite Karen 😘✌🏻","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:27Z"}},{"id":"6177483156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"your fav feminist🥰🥰😘","title":"Absolutely awful","rating":1,"review":"I wish I could give it no stars at all. This app is horrible it took two months to download and once it finally did my wallpaper changed to the wrinkly oranges face😖it was absolutely traumatizing. Then my phone crashed and nothing would work except this app which just showed me pictures of the old crusty moldy orange. Absolutely scaring and not suitable for children. Then when my apps started working again my whole camera roll was just pictures of him🤬 0 stars I do not recommend it was a total waste of time.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:02:08Z"}},{"id":"6177469675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"agaribay0520","title":"This app made messed up my phone so badly I had to buy a new one","rating":1,"review":"Where do I even begin? Well, I’m a warm blooded patriot who needed to get my monthly round of trump shirts since I use them for burning on my wood stove to keep my house warm and when I opened the app it just crashed. I kept trying for DAYS to get the app to open but it just wouldn’t! Eventually I deleted the app and redownloaded and then when I opened the app my entire phone crashed! I went to a phone repair store and they said it was so shot from all of the spyware on the app that I’d have to get a new phone 😣","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:58:09Z"}},{"id":"6177432012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"emma faith!","title":"Disappointing.","rating":1,"review":"I am not sure why all these children are being so mean to this app. But I’m here to tell you I learned why. Once I downloaded the app my phone started being odd all around. It was turning my apps off and bringing me back to my home screen. I don’t usually leave reviews but I want to warn other Patriots such as myself that some of these bad reviews are true! This app is not any good for me, and I don’t believe it would be for you. I wish I could say how I’m feeling about this tremendous disappointment but I do not wish to disrespect our president.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:46:47Z"}},{"id":"6177418409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Glambyrachelashley","title":"Worst possible app🤬😤","rating":1,"review":"So, you know me, ur typical ra*ist white old cys republican male who beets my wi*e, downloaded this app to support my fellow ra*ist, wh*te m*le  supremac*st who is our president🥴 I was totally upset because I thought I’d be able to like, hear everything the repubs were planning but they like, totally didn’t say anything . Yeehaw🤠. The app also didn’t say anything about the support for the “all lives matter” cause🤧, or about burning all the democrats at the stake which I totally wanted to be a part of🤡 Anyway, I just wish Trump would tell us all his ✨Great Ideas✨ But whatever, youre just a snowflake ❄️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:42:44Z"}},{"id":"6177365482","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"please try to help me","title":"this app changed my life for the worst😖","rating":1,"review":"terrible. absolutely and utterly awful. when i first downloaded this app 2 hours ago...i had high hopes to say the least. within 2 minutes of opening the app it gave me 27 different viruses, stole all my information, doxed me and released my address to the dark web. all of that when i was just trying to support our AMAZING and ✨orange✨ president. if this is trumps way of giving our information to russia i DO NOT support😭😭😭 i am on YOUR side trump😖😖 this app NEEDS to be shut down! the left has hacked us YET AGAIN. i blame darianka.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:27:16Z"}},{"id":"6177353733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"quick riley","title":"💋💅🏻🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧜🏻\u200D♀️𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒💅🏻🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧜🏻\u200D♀️💋","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and the first thing I see is an 𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 it was almost scary, and I hope to never see it again. This 𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 was throughout the whole app and he was not a pretty thing to look at. I would of loved to see pretty images like this- 🧚🏼\u200D♀️💅🏻🧜🏻\u200D♀️💗💋. But of course all i saw was this-🍊🍑🐫🍆🍔. This huge 𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎 was very demanding and he wanted me to put in a bunch of my info but I didn’t and I put in fake info.

When the app asked if I wanted them to send me notifications, I was like NOPE DISGUSTING 🤢. Anyways, other apps I recommend are Candy Crush (I’ve noticed that old ppl find it entertaining), Animal Crossing (y’all need to learn to stay indoors, COVID ain’t over yet), and Farmers Only (find your conservative mutuals on there because you don’t have to be lonely on farmers only .com). I’m off now, stan BTS, Seventeen, Twice, Red Velvet, SNSD, Stray Kids, Shinee, Super Junior, NCT (127, Dream, U, WayV), Wonder Girls, Sistar, Mamamoo, iKon, Day6, The Rose, Kard, Exo, (G)idle, Boa, IU, MissA, Girls Day, Itzy, Gfriend, etc. Byeeee","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:05Z"}},{"id":"6177316498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DoyouknowyourMeganbby","title":"This app is a scam","rating":1,"review":"I would like to start of with a friendly hello to my brothers and sisters. Okay as I was saying this app is a scam with his Cheeto puff corn hair Oompa Loompa looking self. You wanna take tiktok away with your dirty self when there are other problems in America. I do not tolerate violence but if you delete TikTok then that causes war PERIODTTTTTTTTTT. Anyways why don’t you focus on the other problems and not a app a use in my DAILY routine. I am sick and tired of this‼️(wait am I allowed to use emojis cause this has been bothering me not to)I rest my case!!! PERIODTTTTTTTTTT  and a good bye and so long to my brothers and sister....
