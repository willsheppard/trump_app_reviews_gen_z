I wanted to check out the app to lean some info on the upcoming elections. When I open the app it takes me right out. It told me that people of color were not allowed in the app and that I should try again with a lighter skin color. It made my phone glitch and take out some of my memories and photos. I find the OFFICIAL app for the president horrendous and do NOT recommend this to people of color or anyone really. Don’t waste your time. Never. Downloading. This. App. Again.","userName":"Melesli06","date":"2020-07-09T09:42:20Z","title":"Trumps app has a problem","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175861712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"this app took 4 hours to download and my phone crashed 11 times while i was waiting for it. i opened it and was met with a terrifying orange image, my child cried before we realized it was not an add for a horror movie and was in fact a hateful racist, sexist, and homophobic man. i think that was scarier. anyway i opened the app and then my phone wouldn’t let me exit it. some kind of herd mentality kept me locked in even when i saw a HUGE number of issues and problems. i’m sure that has no parallel to his supporters. in conclusion: awful app, worse president.","userName":"juliaptvsws","date":"2020-07-09T09:16:32Z","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175722243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is BEYOND terrible. It took a whole month to download like whatttt! Then I opened it and it showed a orange guy with a blonde wig Donald Duck to something, he gave me nightmares. Ever since that day I cannot sleep anymore alone :(. Another thing is it kept telling me to Vote for him when I am not a white supremacists. It called me an OBJECT because I am a women!?! I got spam calls non stop calling me a rat bc I’m Latina??! NO NO NO I’ve had enlightened if this app. WORST thing ever Do not get this. It hacks all your info and changes your pictures to oranges.

I answered the door and a little person kicked me in the shin! He ran and I went back inside, in pain and a bit confused but I was okay. Well, I start scrolling through the app more and the doorbell rings again. I answer it, and like before, the little person was there. This time, he punched me right in the gut. He also kicked my elderly grandmother!!! So it’s safe to say that after the 8th time that this happened, I went and deleted the app and the little person incident hasn’t occurred since.","userName":"Row.io","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:20Z","title":"AWFUL","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175600860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded the app and i felt a vast majority of my brain cells leave my body. it was TERRIFYING! and to make matters worse, my skin started to turn orange, like cheeto orange. idk what the deal was with that but it scared me so bad. i wanted to download this app to support my beloved president, who is not remotely racist, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobic, and is by FAR the best president this country has ever seen. too bad he’ll most likely last as long as the confederate states of america lasted :/ bet he wished he could’ve been president of that country. anyways don’t get the app. very scary... 0/5 stars.","userName":"trumps mua","date":"2020-07-09T07:46:45Z","title":"do NOT get!!!

Until, I got an alert from the app saying I have to turn on notifications. So I pressed turn on notifications cuz u know I love my president ❤️, and little did I know, I was getting spammed with 100s of messages each minute. My phone was unusable. There were messages in Russian. I think my phone is hacked now. I had to call Apple 2 times to make it stop. I had to reset my phone but I think this app put spyware in my device. Very sketchy app that needs a lot of work.","userName":"spicyjaguar","date":"2020-07-09T07:46:17Z","title":"Hacked","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175343884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app enforces the narrative that this man being in office for four more years is a good idea. However this notion is false because he has not led our country but then again he never really had the intent to. In fact he thought he would be able to come into power and become the legislative executive and judicial branch but when he found out he was incorrect he began his march to make sure everyone he seems as beneath him is given hell and that my good reader is why he should not be in office for four more years.","userName":"CaesarGrand","date":"2020-07-09T06:07:40Z","title":"This app is not it.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175255679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So I’ve been seeing all the Orange Cheeto 🍊🍊 supports saying how FABULOUS ✨ this app is.
