From the graphics to the random sounds, I would rate this no stars if I was able. When I downloaded it and put in my number I got BOMBARDED by text messages all throughout the night... my only hope is that that was really Mr.OrangeCornHuskHair himself messaging me. I’m going to let you guys in on something pretty serious in my life. I have nightmares... And this app.. just made them worse. The graphic image of the orange when you first open the app scared me straight.. What a horrifying sight. I talked to my therapist about it and showed her the image and now my therapist needs a therapist. I have been getting frequent nightmares from this app and they spike in the night whenever I get a text. Overall, I’m traumatized for life and you should not get this app!!!","title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-08T16:25:29Z"}},{"id":"6172884190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BOB💩💩💩","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I’m disappointed.

However, after witnessing this monstrosity of an app, I have decided to revoke my vote for him for another four years. Whilst in this app, I kept getting multiple spam notifications to donate money and my phone even stopped working and began to glitch. Also, my phone received multiple text messages to harm minority groups of people and even promoting pedophilia! That is when I decided it was enough. Mr. trump has had a history with racism and pedophilia and this just confirmed it even more for me, considering my endless speculation. Absolutely sick!!!","title":"Worst app ever!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T16:24:32Z"}}]}
