This app is pointless...the absolute worst, and I’ve seen some bad apps in my day, but this takes the cake.

Everything about it from the first moment you open it is an awful user experience. Do not download at any cost.

Ever since I got this app my phone has been glitching like crazy. It asked for my payment information and now it won’t stop taking money out of my account even though I canceled it.
