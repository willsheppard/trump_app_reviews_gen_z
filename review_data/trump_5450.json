I would not recommend this app. it also crashed whenever I used it for longer than a few minutes at a time and caused my cell phone to overheat! it was very alarming. I do not recommend this app!","userName":"barbaraaa2020","date":"2020-07-09T08:11:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"terrible, keeps glitching","rating":1}},{"id":"6175631136","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"downloading this app was singlehandedly the worst decision of my life 🤬 just minutes after opening up the app, my toes started to feel really strange 😟 like really really strange 😵 i lost feeing in them, and they started to feel powdery, crunchy almost ❓i ignored it at first but it spread to my legs and then my entire body 🤯  i looked down in the last second of my freedom, to see my body had turned into a giant cheeto 😱 to this day, i haven't moved and can barely speak as my lips are also made of cheeto 🥺 send ur thoughts and prayers 🙏 warning ⚠️ to anyone thinking about downloading this app ❌❌❌ VERY BAD IDEA","userName":"cheetogirl29","date":"2020-07-09T07:57:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","rating":1}},{"id":"6175617288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is absolute garbage! I downloaded it a few days ago and now my phone has started glitching and freezing. I can’t keep up to date with my favorite commander and chief’ reelection campaign and has essentially destroyed my phone’s software. Clients have trying to get in contact with me, I haven’t been able to add events to my calendar and my alarms have just been resetting! And these are just a few of the things this app has don’t to me! I’m deleting this app now and then taking my phone to an apple store next week in order to hopefully salvage it.","userName":"aj tron","date":"2020-07-09T07:52:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Fried phone","rating":1}},{"id":"6175613272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I HIGHLY do not recommend this app. When i downloaded the app, they asked for my information. Out of nowhere, i look outside and see this man outside my house. I told him to get of my property but HE DIDNT. He rushed into my house and flipped my kitchen table. he then started eating my food that i made that exact same day. that food was for my family 😪. i then told him to get out of my house, he didn’t and started cussing at me and my infant child. he started crying and the man just kept eating and flipping stuff over. i highly do not recommend this app. my child is now traumatized and so am i 😔","userName":"KeIrA 😎","date":"2020-07-09T07:51:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"trashy app","rating":1}},{"id":"6175607219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took forever like 7-10 hours to download with I thought maybe the app is worth it. No! Absolutely not! The app took all my storage and glitched deleting everything on my phone then I brought it to the shop thought it would work it didn’t then my dog licked my phone and shocked my dog!!!! My poor puppy had no eye sight and no legs but he is all better now because I put him in rice. then! I set my phone down and the app said orange pedo overload. I was confused but it was the app. The app was so bad my phone blew up then destroyed my home 🤬 because of the fire leaving me nothing but my life.","userName":"cbGomez18","date":"2020-07-09T07:49:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","rating":1}},{"id":"6175568278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"do NOT download this app!! I downloaded it simply to support my loving orange president. HOWEVER, I was met with complete and utter rage once it caused my phone to self destruct after the agonizing 14 1/2 hours it took for this app to fully download. It took up all the storage in my phone that it only allowed me to keep this app and my vibrator app. I had to delete everything else!! This app then continued to destroy my life by burning down my house and the rest of the ones in my neighborhood due to the high amounts of radiation it releases once fully downloaded. Download if you have no will to live!","userName":"LittleNickle","date":"2020-07-09T07:34:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app! 0 stars!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175499131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was the absolute worst. It took literal days to download and when it finally did it still wouldn’t let me open the app. Once I got the app to open it wouldn’t let me navigate the app. As soon as I could actually navigate the app it made my whole phone glitch so that all of my other apps lost all of the progress and accounts I had saved. I had to re-download and log in to all of my accounts along with having to figure out who was texting me because I lost all my contacts. Do not download this. It is awful and you will regret it","userName":"Kenzie110303","date":"2020-07-09T07:08:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175435893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this app to see a whole Cheeto golfing. I had no idea what exactly that was supposed to tell me other than to go buy Cheetos. As a result I went a ate some Cheetos that somehow a managed to put me in some psychedelic state and then I went back to this app and it said “all lives matter” so I don’t really think my life matters so I decided to eat more hot Cheetos and then I went back to this app and the Cheeto man was gone and replaced with this when rapiro chick that talked fast and since Cheeto man was gone I realized that I had to leave ASAP because I am Hispanic. All in all, this app is very bad.","userName":"føürth õf jöūłie","date":"2020-07-09T06:43:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I love Cheetos but not this one","rating":1}},{"id":"6175273684","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app would not open for 2 minutes after the installation. I then I realized I had been tricked and bamboozled. Then a squirrel drone came and attacked me while I was watering my sporks. My sporks later started on fire because I was unable to water them. I expect full compensation for my 69 sporks. Valued at $420 a piece plus emotional compensation of 3 chickens and 2 doge coins. I also lost my pencil in the kerfuffle with the drone squirrel. It was a number 2 pencil with a pink eraser (If anyone finds it it’s mine).  I blame the app and the delay of the services of unfortunate events that followed. \n#bagelsarebetterthantoast\n#circlebreakfast\n#thicccccbread","userName":"Squirreldrone42","date":"2020-07-09T05:40:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The Worst App Ever","rating":1}}]}
