I felt incredibly inspired, so please take time to read!\n\nDonald glanced around the empty office, his eyes drifting towards the desk before him. Opening a drawer, he took out a bag of Cheetos, precisely the same color as him- the way he liked everything.\n\nDespite having a wife, Donald Jewish Trump had a forbidden affair with his beloved snack. He grabbed both sides of it with his orange hands, pulling it open with a satisfying pop. Licking his lips whilst drooling a little, he stuck two fingers into the little opening to heaven. He pulled them out, cheese in the form of a carefully manufactured puff, all designed to absolute perfection. Trump liked perfection, in fact that’s what he was striving to do with America, make it a perfect place, where everyone with the same Cheeto skin can live peacefully. But we’ll save that for a different time.\n\nHe bit down on the end of it, dust coating his fingers, though they were practically the same shade. Donald drooled as he inhaled the Cheeto whole, his gag reflex long gone from a continuous practice of eating Cheetos like this.\n\nThen a knock on his door stopped him just as he was preparing for round two. Hastily hiding his forbidden love, he allowed the person to come in. They discussed business, yet Trump could not care, he was distracted by the stickiness if the dust on his orange fingers, the tantalizing scent of his perfect snack. Oh how he longes to feel it back in his mouth, and have his taste buds rejoice when cheese met tongue, when saliva and Cheeto dust mixed to make something new."}},{"id":"6174712019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.","date":"2020-07-09T02:40:36Z","userName":"🤮🤮🤫🤮🤫🤮🤮🤭","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is trash 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 delete this app"}},{"id":"6174705713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T02:38:40Z","userName":"i- what","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"you dropped this 🔴 put it back on ur nose 🤡✨"}}]}
