This very particular human had this strange device and ending up leaving it on what he called a ‚Äúbench‚Äù I decided to take the device and check it out. I pushed a little button on the top and it lite up. There was this little icon that said ‚Äúapp store‚Äù I tapped on it and it the first thing in the ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù was this ‚Äúapp‚Äù I tapped on it and then pressed ‚Äúinstall‚Äù right after it was done some strange stuff started happening...I TURNED HUMAN. I ended up in what they call a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù and I saw all these devices kissing and hugging each other 2 minutes later a Cheeto puff that was married to a carrot and have a son that was an orange and a daughter that was a orange tomato,came walking through the door.
