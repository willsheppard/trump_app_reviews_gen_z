People don’t live up to expectations, like my ex boyfriend Kyle. I expected him to punch 3 holes in the wall per day but he could only do 2. Being disappointed is a part of life. Like when i ordered a venti upside down carmel macchiato with light ice and 6 pumps of vanilla and 6 pumps of caramel but they only gave me a grande. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I don’t think my life has been the same since. To make a short story long, this app and president are a normal grande caramel macchiato and I am not having it today.","isEdited":false,"userName":"🧚🏽🧚🏽\u200D♀️🌟✨","rating":1,"title":"Expectations"}},{"id":"6177515891","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T17:12:09Z","review":"As a woman who is married to a trans man. This president holds no support towards me or my husbands freedoms as an American. I was interested in seeming what the agenda was going to look like for the next 4 years. And truly, I’m flabbergasted. How anyone can support this administration is beyond me. And his app is deplorable. Crashes phone, runs slow, and kicks you out of app while trying to explore it. Worst app I’ve ever downloaded. And that’s nothing to do with the apps content or president. Political party’s or differences aside. It’s just a crap app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"allies ipod","rating":1,"title":"When you wanna find answers for someone political plan but you walk away with more questions."}},{"id":"6177326774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:16:15Z","review":"when you open the app it says “keep america great”? how is america great with this man as president? he doesn’t believe in equal rights for women, he’s trying to take away a platform which basically takes our first amendment. you know freedom of speech, freedom of the press, etc. he threatened marshal law and people still want him as president. he almost started another world war and he’s going to put this nation down the drain. we’re already a laughing stock for having him as president but people want to make us more of a laughing stock by giving him a second term in office?! wow people that don’t believe in trump NEED to vote.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Luv2Dance😜","rating":1,"title":"umm..."}},{"id":"6177284589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:04:24Z","review":"I wish I would’ve been able to give zero stars, I was really looking forward to this app and after 17 straight hours of downloading (with my phone plugged in) it’s saying “keep america great” which is extremely confusing since this country has always stemmed from prejudicial values engrained with lots of misogyny and xenophobia. i know these are the things trump stands for since he is officially THE white supremacist of america (congrats on the title man) but it was just too “in my face” to keep the app open. maybe figure out the MyFitnessPal or ZoomTan app before making this one again buddy.","isEdited":false,"userName":"jackson.hannah.ann","rating":1,"title":"Shockingly disappointed"}},{"id":"6177219774","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:45:31Z","review":"So I came on here to see the plans for the election however whenever you open the app it makes your phone connect a Bluetooth speaker and plays the b-word lasagna by pewdiepie and then if you exit the app it makes a big car filled with Martha the dog plushes come and surround your house with them it’s terrifying, it makes my phone glitch and it’s scary and my five year old is crying from all the Martha the talking dogs and the oompah loompahs come to your house and breaks your windows and steals your legos my poor Jamison is crying because he just wants his legos this is such an awful app 10/10 do not recommend","isEdited":false,"userName":"Starfrost.Cosplays","rating":1,"title":"Oh dear"}},{"id":"6177158627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:11Z","review":"I decided to download the app with high expectations, but was soon angered by the long download time. It took a total of 32 hours and 7 minutes for the app to download, and when I opened the app I was even more angered. The structure of the app is horrendous and is very confusing. I know that I should not have had such high expectations, considering that it was not made by the person we all worship, Donal Trump. But I was expecting better, you know the man, constantly talking about his high IQ. I assumed that he was not so stupid, but I guess in this case I should have judged a book by its cover.","isEdited":false,"userName":"bartholemew pigeon trump","rating":1,"title":"takes too long to download"}},{"id":"6177108121","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:14:11Z","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Yvong Savage","rating":1,"title":"Worse News Ever"}},{"id":"6177093178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:10:05Z","review":"As soon as I opened the app it made my entire phone crash. I had to manually reset it and then found out later a virus had been downloaded. As soon as I would get on any app it would kick me out in less than a second. I think the Chinese are behind this. I had to go and get an entire new phone because the one I had was unusable. And next time, don't mess with gen z. Tiktok is our only source of happiness and you're trying to ban it because you're mad about your little rally. We know you aren't concerned about the Chinese spying on us😹 Give it back or else","isEdited":false,"userName":"do NOT take away tiktok","rating":1,"title":"Please Don't Download"}},{"id":"6177060356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:01:01Z","review":"I DO NOT recommend this app for anyone. The app took 2️⃣ weeks to download. After it finally downloaded I opened it to see an 🍊orange🍊 and from there all went downhill📉. The things on the screen were 📞calling to me, “RACISM, SEXISM, XENOPHOBIA, HOMOPHOBIA,” I was being brainwashed! Suddenly all the facts and evidence that CLEARLY prove trump has done a bad job and is a bad person were gone, I was oblivious to it all! I FELT LIKE A TRUE TRUMP SUPPORTER😍✨! After this I felt a little weird. I continued to scroll and search through the app only to find more 🙈idiots🙈. This app and our president are both given ❗️ONE ❗️star⭐️ by me. I suggest we vote both the app and him out!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"get the orange out","rating":1,"title":"NO❤️"}},{"id":"6177054230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:59:21Z","review":"I’m not writing this review because I’m not a fan of Trump which I am not. I only downloaded to be on top of everything going on. I have an brand new iPhone 11 and I started to realize that my battery power was decreasing far more rapidly than normal. I thought it may be because I had to many apps open so I went to settings and turned on low power mode but it still decreased fast which is bizarre. Not only to mention it took up way too much storage. Just do your phone a favor and watch the news instead","isEdited":false,"userName":"f**k this b**ch","rating":1,"title":"Sunk my battery power even when the app was not in use"}}]}
