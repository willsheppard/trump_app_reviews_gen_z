Every time I leave the house there are old people chasing me down. I have never felt fear like this. They pin you down and scream racist things at you. Why would a normal human do this. PLEASE avoid everything about this app if you care for your own safety! It only gets worse eventually you’ll have the urge to fight a Cheeto and trust me it deserved it.","userName":"mcmike05","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:18:05Z","title":"Scary experiences","rating":1}},{"id":"6173417193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To start off the app took 14 hours to download, and went it finally downloaded my whole phone went orange like him! When I opened the app it wouldn’t load for a while, when it did I saw trumps nudes while he was getting spray tanned! To make it even worse my look screen, and wallpaper was changed to that! Trump is a pig for putting his nudes on the app. Apple do your job and DELETE this!","userName":"dfdsavanna","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:17:49Z","title":"GET RID OF THIS APP","rating":1}},{"id":"6173413577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the WORST! I had such a hard time operating it, for some reason whenever I downloaded it I could hear the cries of every oppressed person within a 100 mile radius. Frightened by the noise I followed it and it led me straight to the TMNT underground in a sewer! Their were roaches EVERYWHERE and they were all starting at an orange and that’s when I decided to delete the app and everything went back to normal. CRAZY!!!","userName":"Trump is Trump 🤷🏻\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:16:36Z","title":"Garbage","rating":1}},{"id":"6173395350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was so slow and had so many glitches. It took hours to download and once I got it, I felt like it made my whole phone slower. Idk if it had anything to do with it, but i definitely noticed it. You would like with all the money he has he could invest in a better app. Not worth it. I wish I could give it less than 1 star","userName":"Worst campaign app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:10:13Z","title":"worst campaign app","rating":1}},{"id":"6173365648","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app so I could be the real conservative that I am, but it took almost a full month to download! Then once it did, i kept finding bugs and roaches in my room!! it made my phone glitch all the time, so much so that I had to get a new one! Very bad app, would never get again! I’ve even stopped getting Donald Trump merch from the fear of it all happening again, DON’T GET THE APP🤮😭🤮","userName":"✨ c h l o e ✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:59:41Z","title":"Horrible app🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6173349884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried to download the app and it took 25 hours out of my day just for it to download and then I tried to open it and it took another hour and it finally loaded so then it played this music that made my dog run around the house nonstop until he fell down and broke his 5 legs and then my house started to burn down by the all of the trump dolls that cane into my house and set it on fire.

Once I downloaded it my phone caught this weird orange virus , I don’t know how that happened but bottom line is Do Not Install this app it’s a waste of time. It’s just sad Bc I had low hopes for this app lol and it didn’t change my mind taking a whole year actually open and it fills up your space on your phone.","userName":"dayanna__","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:46:09Z","title":"Avoid at all Costs","rating":1}},{"id":"6173308431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app and I instantly regretted it. I literally hate the app already because it just makes my phone glitch and die. I tried giving it life again but it was so bad that the charger wasn’t working either. I gave it air, put it in rice and everything else you could’ve imagined. Donald Trump is not just messing with his supporters, but with their electronics too😤","userName":"hayley johnstocks","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:40:06Z","title":"Makes my phone die","rating":1}},{"id":"6173301671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app that had ever been on the app store! I’m so disappointed in everything that this app has to offer and the site of the picture on the app when you first open it up gives me the worst possible headache that you can think of. I DO NOT recommend signing up for this app because of the things that it does to you’re brain! Very disappointing!","userName":"gretchlaux","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:37:58Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1}}]}
