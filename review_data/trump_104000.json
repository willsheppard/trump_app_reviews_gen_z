So I was unable to give the bird to all those Trump hating, blue haired liberals😔\nNext, my cat got explosive diarrhea🤮 and we had to take her to the vet, only to see that she had eaten a whole bunch of Cheetos. At first, I thought this weird because we didn’t own any Cheetos, but I couldn’t help but think back to Trump’s 🟠Cheeto-colored skin🟠. The bad thing about it all was that we weren’t able to afford her medical bills so we had to ask for a small loan of a million dollars💰💵 in order to get her healthy again.\nAfter that, my brother and his girlfriend broke. She said she wanted to follow her true love. 🟠CHEETOS! AGAIN!🟠 She decided that she couldn’t have both. So she left my brother for those distasteful cravings of hers, even after I told her what had happened with my cat. 😭\nFinally, we had to go into quarantine because a close family friend of ours had contracted COVID😷🤒. I begged her to tell me why she had gotten tested and she said she needed to know if she was sick, but I explained her that if we didn’t do any testing, there wouldn’t be any cases but she refused to listen! 😩😷\nAfter all these things happened, I could help but think these weren’t coincidences but a bad karma bestowed upon my family for downloading this app. So for your and the people’s around you safety, I beg you! Don’t download this app!🚫🛑‼️","userName":"Leo-C69","title":"If you value your life, don’t download this app!
