They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us,” he said. “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\nJune 2016: Trump argued that Judge Gonzalo Curiel — an Indiana-born judge who was overseeing the lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump University — could not be impartial because of his “Mexican heritage.” Trump added: “I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest.”\nMay 2016: Trump referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who earlier in her life claimed to have Native American heritage, despite the lack of any known Native American ancestors, as “Pocahontas.” He tweeted: “Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is Native American, is a lowlife!” The president has used it in tweets at least 20 times since. He has also frequently used it in rallies — and vowed to revive the slur as Warren’s presidential campaign goes on.\nFebruary 2019: In another tweet targeting Warren, Trump mocked the Trail of Tears — which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands Native Americans.\nAugust 2017: Following the Unite the Right white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to the murder of counterprotester Heather Heyer, Trump refused to condemn the right-wing marchers. Instead, he insistedthat “many sides” and “both sides” were to blame for the day’s violence. Trump also said that the white nationalist groups included “some very fine people.”\n\nJuly 2016: Trump tweeted a graphic that was previously posted on a white nationalist message board showing Hillary Clinton along with a six-pointed star and a pile of cash and the phrase “most corrupt candidate ever.” The graphic was a classic anti-Semitic trope.\nAugust 2019: Trump resurfaced the anti-Semitic charge of “dual loyalty.” He told reporters: “I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.”\nOctober 2017: After being criticized for his incompetent response to Hurricane Maria, Trump called Puerto Ricans “politically motivated ingrates.” He would later deny that 3,000 people died because of the storm, despite overwhelming evidence that this was the case.\n\nJuly 2019: Trump took aim at four congresswomen of color — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib — in a tweet that was clearly racist. “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” Trump tweeted. “Then come back and show us how it is done.” Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx; Tlaib is from Detroit; and Pressley was born in Cincinnati. Omar, who was born in Somalia, has lived in the United States for 25 years and became an American citizen in 2000. Trump gleefully reacted to “Send her back!” chants at his rally, and only disavowed them after pressure from the GOP.\nJune 2020: At rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump attacked several Democratic women of color. Speaking about Rep. Omar, Trump said she “would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy.”","userName":"human rights advocate"}},{"id":"6174506409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:33Z","review":"he said i couldnt breath cause im mexican🦟","userName":"no thank u!❤️"}},{"id":"6174493383","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:37:55Z","review":"please delete this nonsense ❤️","userName":"WhatWhereWhyWhen"}}]}
