I went to go pick him up and he said he is very mad at trump. I said “sparky why? Why must you be so mad at the president? and he said “I never really did like cheetos!” and then he died. Fell out of my window actually. And i stand by that ✨🧚🏼💗😍😋😸 Have a good day everyone! Except for small cheetos, because Sparky and everyone on the plant hates them now.","date":"2020-06-29T15:20:14Z","userName":"mom pick me up please","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6135730654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wouldn’t recommend.","review":"I used to use this app all the time and it was fine. But for the last couple of days it was been glitching out. At first when I would log into it it would just take me out of the app. Then I would try again and it just turned my whole phone off. And when I turned it back on all my pick tires go deleted. And now it won’t let me get into the app at all. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this app it doesn’t work very well.","date":"2020-06-29T12:26:09Z","userName":"Awesomedonkey12345607","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6134284868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m disappointed.","review":"I used to be all about trump but as soon as I downloaded this app I felt like I was being watched. My horse was eating cereal and I was giving him a bath and all of a sudden I see my phone get notifications for horse and cereal products. It’s never happened to me until I downloaded this creepy app. I was also asked to put in my card info to subscribe and I woke up with - in my card. Best believe I am going to do something about it. This is the worst app ever. I do not recommend!! 😡","date":"2020-06-29T03:29:24Z","userName":"alondra23689$","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6132963438","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful","review":"I can not believe the workings of this app. I am a supporter of trump but I believe this app is scam and is not at all appropriate. The messages that are sent through the app are atrocious. They talk about getting abortions and my daughter has this app and I feel that she should not be seeing those kind of messages, especially at her age. I feel like it was made to target and make fun of supporters. It really is such a shame our Cheeto puff of a president and his supporters have to go through this. T’is really such a shame.😔😏","date":"2020-06-28T18:38:17Z","userName":"SpookyScarySkeletans","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177768198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horribly made!","review":"I got this app to stay updated with the Trump campaign and all that he is doing but I couldn’t even open it! It crashed before it finished loading even the first page 😡😡 Their tech team did a horrible job with this application and it is UNUSABLE. Extremely disappointed that I can’t see Trumps app and it can’t share their information with me. Hope their IT staff updates it soon! Do not get this app it DOES NOT function. NOT a frictionless design at all.","date":"2020-07-09T18:31:12Z","userName":"Sarah Carlson","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177647352","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just no","review":"This app is causing my phone to catch a virus and it won’t stop glitching every time I get on the app, I was really looking forward to seeing trumps updates but it’s really disappointing that a can’t. my WiFi also keeps shutting down and have to go in my settings and fix it, and the most scariest this ever was that I saw a green flash from my front camera. Now I have to cover my phone with black tape I’m so disappointed in yall, y’all could of did better","date":"2020-07-09T17:54:00Z","userName":"sanyreewilliby","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177598300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Needs Improvement","review":"So I downloaded the app to check out what the presidents plans where for the country. As soon as I downloaded the app it kept loading and loading. This went on for a couple of minutes. The phone then completely fine one and I had to restart my phone.

ANYWAYS! xoxo, gen z 😽","date":"2020-07-09T17:22:27Z","userName":"sosvjedkchux","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177519468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I almost got a heart attack","review":"When I first opened the app there was a very scary figure and I almost got a heart attack! 😔 imagine seeing a a scary BIG figure in the early morning I couldn’t handle it and the whole app is talking about this BIG figure and I just couldn’t take this horror anymore I don’t recommend this app if you want to get a jump scare everytime you open this app then feel free to download but I DONT recommend to open around babies or people that get scared easily! 😣","date":"2020-07-09T17:13:17Z","userName":"hi1244566","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177474250","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Jump scare??","review":"When I opened the app, I saw a large orange man that popped out and he scared me so bad I had a heart attack. I had to be rushed to the ER for an immediate HEART TRANSPLANT. Sadly they didn’t have a human heart so I had to get a PIG HEART. My sister also saw the large orange man and now has PTSD from it. She walks around with a spatula waiting for the large orange man. I’ve woken up in the middle of the night to be standing over me singing “orange man, orange man, large orange mans gonna get you”. All of this happened from this stupid app. My life is miserable now. Remove it IMMEDIATELY.","date":"2020-07-09T16:59:29Z","userName":"pig heart girl","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
