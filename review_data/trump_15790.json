I mean looking at that orange rats face and hearing the messages he is portraying is lower the iq of so many. I am truly worried for the people that actually use this app. Honestly TikTok made me do it.  I just want to be able to watch TikTok and if this is what it takes I will be doing it. No TikTok app no Trump app. That’s on Gen Z this had been my psa thanks for reading.","userName":"from tiktok what about you","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172482829","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:18Z","title":"App sends bad vibes and messages! 🤢","review":"Earlier I got the app because I wanted to see if it was legit. Next thing I knew, I was getting text messages from randos on the Internet! They were asking me if I had interest in joining the triple K. They gave me websites via messages, and told me Trump sent them! They used my messaging information!! Then my phone began to glitch out, showing me pictures of said organization. No good vibes. 1/5 stars!","userName":"RealistBuddy","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172466929","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:27:04Z","title":"Disgusting","review":"I downloaded this all to see what plans the Trump administration had for us. But all he really did was text about his nether regions and how they aren’t small and how he was gonna make sure america would be completely white again like colonial times. he sends out texts from white supremacists and my nana saw it from my phone and had a heart attack! She’s fine now but trump almost killed my Nana!!","userName":"Minority unite","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172448021","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:21:58Z","title":"Don’t get this app","review":"The rumors are true, when I got the app the first thing I saw was Donald duck fully naked, and my old phone broke into so many pieces, then one of the pieces got into my eye and I had to go to the emergency room but all the spaces are filled up from the virus so I still have that piece of glass in my eye and I can only see out of one eye do not download this app, unless you want bad things to come your way.","userName":"gkxgjhhb","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6172418632","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:14:01Z","title":"Worst app I’ve ever seen","review":"This app is so glitchy and is just terrible for my phone.
