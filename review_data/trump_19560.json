This app is cursed. I downloaded it last week and that same day I noticed my skin turning ORANGE!!! I thought it was just because I got slightly sunburnt and it was just turning into a tan so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Until, MY HAIR STARTED TURNING GREEN!!!

He never had interest in ‚Äúmaking America great again‚Äù, all he wanted was publicity and power. Whose to say that the women modeling could have been sexually assaulted during their shoot? This app symbolizes that as long as you have a title and money, you can walk free.","userName":"astaetic","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6172865686","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:19:48Z","rating":1,"review":"My cat was such a huge fan of trump. You see he was obsessed. I got this app just for him to use at night during our reading time. When i opened the app it kept glitching showing an orange face.

His saggy skin really holds a ton of fascination for me. I just think this app doesn‚Äôt work. On top of kicking me out, it has a LOT of fake news that I honestly don‚Äôt know how anyone can believe. I think this app would need to be taken down in order to work properly.","userName":"beigjskkc","isEdited":false,"title":"Hi"}}]}
