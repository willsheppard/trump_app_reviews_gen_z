I was sent death threats, they wrote how they will harm me and family if I don’t obey them. I was forced to turn into tinker bell and have sexual relationships with mickey mouse. I was raped by my dog too, they said they’re disappointed and are now sending trumps oranges to kill me! VERY DISSAPOINTED. 😡😖😭","userName":"D. I. L.

When it finally installed it kept showing weird links to some adult websites. I for one do tolerate the vulgar things this app shows to its users. I wouldn’t recommend. You should download subway surfer instead it’s way more entertaining than this garbage.","userName":"throw the orange in the ocean","title":"Worst experience of 2020","date":"2020-07-09T22:54:39Z"}},{"id":"6178513617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"so I’m pretty sure this app is possessed, PERIODT. first of all it took 17 days to download, and when I opened it every light, machinery, and technology turned on and wouldn’t stop or turn off for another month. This app cost us 1200 in our electricity bill. Next time I opened it, rats jumped out of my screen and infested my house. Never opening again!!!","userName":"Rossana Diaz","title":"TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T22:49:35Z"}},{"id":"6178503626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support MY president Trump. But the only man that pops up on my screen is a cheeto that is referred to as bunker boy. It’s terrifying, unsettling, and nauseating seeing his face. I’m repulsed that someone like that has their own app. It’s glitchy, slow, and very hard to navigate too. I’m deeply disappointed in the app and having a cheeto in office.","userName":"jadecollins46281","title":"Horrible!

I would only recommend it if you like leaders that cannot lead, leaders that are bullies, leaders that try to take advantage of others, leaders that try to suppress people of other races, leaders that make poor people poorer, leaders that stomp on the helpless, leaders that take away healthcare from the sick and poor.","userName":"empowerThePeople","title":"App is slow like Trump","date":"2020-07-09T22:38:44Z"}},{"id":"6178454902","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app will burn your phone and make it explode!!!💣It takes 2 weeks to download😴, and once you install it you can’t delete it without a password!!!😱😭🙈It is SCARY 😱 and it will cause you permanent nightmares if you don’t go to therapy for 30 years!👹😴😰 It is very disgusting 🤮🤢, and you will see a naked orange 🍊 Oompa Loompa in your screen when you open the app! 🤢🤢🤮🤮","userName":"#Cheeto2020 but in jail","title":"TRAUMATIZED!!!","date":"2020-07-09T22:26:18Z"}},{"id":"6178439956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It was a horrible app first it took 27 hours to download and when it did it took me out of the app and then my phone died but it was at 97 percent when I charged it my phone was hot as hell then it said to put my phone number and i couldn’t because my finger were burning off so I hope you pay for my hospital bill Donald trumpet 😭","userName":"fortnite-champion","title":"Nope","date":"2020-07-09T22:20:33Z"}},{"id":"6178396615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"He is a racist president and disrespects Mexicans. Also he was trying to start war with other countries. He doesn’t deserve to be president again and his new home should be a jail ceil, casket, etc. He doesn’t listen to woman reporters which is sexually saying he doesn’t think what woman say is important. In conclusion, take this app down cause no one gonna vote for him.","userName":"my name is private information","title":"Trump is disgusting 🤢🤮","date":"2020-07-09T22:03:41Z"}}]}
