I nearly leapt out of my just washed in holy water Sunday dress. I quickly slammed my finger into the home button as fast as I could while shouting for God to come down and cleanse my eyes of this awful sight. The app finally closed, to my relief, so I closed my eyes and let it a long sigh, rejoicing in the fact that I was safe from the devil. But then, to my horror, I opened my little virgin eyes and saw who I thought was our very Christian and religious president naked riding a man with the face of a demon as my home screen. My phone started to heat up as if I was in hell itself as I desperately tried to go to my settings. However my phone turned so hot that it burned my hand, causing me to drop my phone onto my Jesus covered bedspread. As I cried out in pain I got up and sprinted for the door, which suddenly slammed shut in my face. I grabbed the handle in vain, as it would not budge. Tears started to flow down my face as for the very first time I looked down at the burn mark my phone had made. I gasped in shock, for it was not ordinary mark, but it was the symbol of the devil! I yelled at the top of my lungs, screaming out for God to save me from this hell that I now found myself in. Out of nowhere, I felt this force pulling me to my phone as the room around me grew darker. I sat back on my bed and peered down at my phone. Everything on my screen was pitch black. I was confused and was starting to get hot, although for some reason I wasn’t able to lift my gaze from my phone. “EMILY,” I heard a demonic voice cry. “EMILY, THERE IS SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET.” My once black screen suddenly burst into flames and I felt whatever force pulling my gaze was broken. I screamed and screamed for my parents to no avail. I opened my tear filled eyes to find my room engulfed in flames, and the base of a man standing at the foot of my bed. I slowly lifted my eyes upwards, to find the one and only Cheeto man laughing demonically. “I HAVE SAVED A SPECIAL SEAT FOR YOU IN HELL!” he boomed, and my whole body started to shake. He held out his hand and I felt a spirit taking over me, my right hand (the one that got burned) started moving on it’s own. I cried out and desperately tried to stop it, but it was no use. Without knowing what to do, in a last attempt to save myself, I grabbed my Christian cross and threw it as hard as I could at the Cheeto man. He cried out in pain, “IT BURNS, IT BURNS!” The feeling returned to my right hand and I finally got control of it back. I rubbed my aching palm and looked up as his screams intensified. “STOP IT BURNS NO NO NOOO!” As I watched in horror, he slowly started to disintegrate into a little pile of orange goo on my floor, until that, too, vanished. I looked down at my palm and the burned in symbol was gone. My room had gone back to normal, and so was my phone. The app was still there, but instead of deleting it right away, I knew I had to warn my fellow Christians out there to not download this app! I have witnessed first hand that this app has been made by the devil, and that only evil can come from this app! So please, please, I’m begging you DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174486347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad","userName":"Yuh😌","date":"2020-07-09T01:36:00Z","review":"Makes me want to abort myself","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
