I was truly offended from the nature of this app. I believe the fact that this app was made and still remains on the App Store is atrocious. But that’s just my opinions. Knowing that there are rally’s and events so close to my home truly makes me fear for my physical safety. As a minority and POC this is truly appalling. Advertising offensive content should be considered a hate crime. 😔","title":"Honestly terrible!","userName":"Not BooBoo Da Foo","rating":1}},{"id":"6174262956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:24:56Z","review":"This app is basically malware!! After I downloaded it changed every persons name in my contacts to a racial slur! My asian boyfriends name was changed to “Kung flu Charlie”. Then it started sending texts to all my friends who are people of color that said “if you don’t like it here then leave”. When I tried to remove the app a warning screen popped up that said if I did someone who come try and “grab me by the p*ssy!” I’m terrified!","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","userName":"Layla not Kayla","rating":1}},{"id":"6174255081","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:22:13Z","review":"IM SUING. i entered the app expecting gross republican news or something, but instead a large, chubby cheeto was shoved in my face. i immediately closed my eyes out of fear and threw my phone across the room, shattering it into a million pieces. my reflexes to that monstrosity of a picture were like nothing i’d ever experienced. i wish this on NO ONE, not even my worst enemy.\n\ntake this off of the app store to save people’s eyes and phones, PLEASE","title":"this app broke my phone :(","userName":"strechar","rating":1}},{"id":"6174246653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:19:25Z","review":"Please rate this app a zero because it is horrifying, I downloaded it and a picture of a naked man who looks like a Cheeto popped up, I almost let my daughter download this app!!
