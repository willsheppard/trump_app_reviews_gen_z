When I opened the door a pumpkin make said in a quiet but stern voice “ bumedella kaka you are the sacrifice for the bumedella kaka club, now come with me”. I replied with “no” because he looked creepy and I didn’t want to get kid napped. Then I closed the door, and as soon as I did that an avalanche of mincraft villagers came running down to stares at me, so I ran into the nearest shelter. There I was accompanied by a very very tall girl she started chanted “bumedella kaka bumedella kaka” so I left and ran to my mom. I woke you up from her slumber and when she turned around she had a Donald Trump head I ran out of the room crying and then I saw that the ants that were stealing our food had Donald Trump heads too, so I ran down the hall way and THE VILLAGERS HAD DONALD TRUMP HEADS TOO. After that I knew what I had to do I deleted the app and all the creatures disappeared. I patted myself on the back and sighed. It was such a Trumatic situation and I don’t think I will ever be able to recover. DONT GET THIS APP.","userName":"bumedella kaka experience","date":"2020-07-08T20:06:41Z","title":"THIS APP IS DANGETOUS","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173169645","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I never thought trump would be a good president and now looking forward to twenty twenty I know he’s not he’s so hypocritical he’s not Christian just for holding up a bible he’s racist and anti lgbtq and he’s shown his true colors over the past 4 years and they’re pretty dark. I came here looking for some common sense to things he would actually do like building the wall but he has failed to do so and looks like he just wants to continue to spread hate not his country. Under Obama we wee unified but under trump I feel like the world has started to go to literal scraps. In my kind this man is a monster and I cannot fathom how people would actually support him. As for this app it’s full of people telling you how great he his but without giving reason. Looking at what’s happening with ICE and true Muslim concentration camps and seeing as he is doing nothing about them, even going on record for supporting the Muslim concentration camp's, it seems as if he wants there to be another Holocaust but instead of Jews Muslims. ( also I came here from TikTok).","userName":"Barry M'cockiner","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:49Z","title":"Why I can’t support trump","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173114865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is horrendous!! I downloaded this app to get the upmost reliable news in the country, but was horrified with what happened!! Once I launched the app, it asked for all of my personal information, and I mean ALL of it. While filling this out, I gave my dog, Donny’s, name. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. Once filling this out, the cool aid man, decked out in Confederate Merch, burst through my door and grabbed my sweet Donny!! Donny being the smart shepherd he is began biting viciously attacking this man, eventually revealing the actual perp underneath the cheap party city costume as Donald Trump himself!! My dog and myself began profusely apologizing, and Donny escorted Donald out of the house, but when he got outside, they realized they had been transported into a parallel universe in which the monarchy was restored! Crowds of trump-supporting white supremacists flocked around my dog chanting racial slurs. I called the police to help, and they took 5 hours to arrive! Upon their arrival they drew their weapons and shot my dog 16 times!! Meanwhile, Donald had been declared ruler of everything and awarded the officers who shot my dog with the Nobel peace prize.

As soon as I was scrolling there was a nude of this man and it was absolutely disgusting. I had to throw up and sadly my mom saw it too, and at that point she had to be rushed to the emergency room. So I beg of all of you please don’t get this app all you will get are heart attacks seizures and to top it all off you will get fake news. 😁 so don’t trust this app not only because of what it can do physically but also mentally. My mother is still recovering and I’m suffering PTSD. Also turn out that this app steals your information, and when you agree to to the terms of use you are accepting that you are a stupid ignorant piece of sh*t. Also that you agree to rumps dictatorship. So please once again just don’t download this app. For your own safety.","userName":"California_C_A","date":"2020-07-09T18:35:35Z","title":"Real review🥰","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177333889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"DONT DO IT!!! So when I was scrolling through an amazing app called tiktok I saw a video saying to download this app it’s was great and all the good features to it so I was excited expecting for my expectations about this app to follow through which They did not!!! I downloaded the app and it wouldn’t let me open it because it was taking up so much storage and I had to delete many apps just for this one!😢 so I did and it told my to put in my mobile phone number I was hesitant at first but I said what could happen it’s just a harmless phone number so I put in my number and continue with the app not even five minutes later I got some alarming text messages that were extremely inappropriate and I noticed and hour later after my mid day slumber there was a bunch of people dressed as trump knocking on my door saying very disturbing things this app can hack your numbers guys like it almost gave me a heart attack please don’t download this app for your safety 🙏🏼btw prayers that naya Rivera is found alive safe and well !!","userName":"very truthful person😁","date":"2020-07-09T16:18:14Z","title":"✨The Cheeto must go✨","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176729003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"So there I was standing in the hospital room waiting for my baby to be ready and I was on the app then it just came to life idk how but it did. The app looked at me (or at least I think it did) and punched me then ran into the room my child was in. I trying to run into the room but the nurses stoped me but I yelled at them that an app ran in there and punched me they gave me a crazy look I’m not sure why but they did. I told them to look in the room and they did. There was no baby. I was really confused and told them where they but my baby. They said there was no baby to begin with. I don’t believe them so I told them to take me to my wife. they said they couldn’t. So at this point I am furious why can’t they do anything I tell them to. Then I realize I don’t have a wife and even if I did I was in the wrong hospital. Then I wake up and I’m in my room not a adult man but a 14 year old girl not married not anyone or has a child. But I was still mad at the app for punching me and taking my non existent child😡😡😡","userName":"hduwkadksbz69","date":"2020-07-09T13:33:05Z","title":"The app stole my first born baby at 3am (NOT CLICKBAIT!!!)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176365617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"You know what isn’t fake news?! The fact that this app took over 6 HOURS to download when all my other apps took SECONDS!! Want to know why that is??? TRUMP IS HACKING OUR INFORMATION! He’s diverting the blame to other social media apps when he is actually the most problematic one. My psychic told me not to download this app or I’d be destined for a lifetime of bigotry and hatred, I should’ve listened....I’m so sorry Walter Mercado. My phone’s screen instantly turned orange the second it started downloading! It also emitted a weird smell... something along the lines of Cheeto dust with a dash of dementia???? It caused all my orchids to start withering and my beautiful cactus turned obese and orangey... My phone is unusable now so I have to use my neighbor Karen’s! Although she didn’t want to lend me her phone so she might be unconscious rn :/ another side effect of the app I guess. As soon as i’m done writing this review i’m going to build a wall between me and my phone so nothing bad can happen to me again.

When I first got into it, he asked me for my phone number, email and address.....which is really inappropriate considering Im a minor😳. I mean I guess there’s No surprise there since he was besties with Epstein and loooooves young girls🥰 anyways, I gave him my number only to find out he’s spamming me with texts trying to get me to go to one of his rally’s! I heard those were kind of boring though since nobody really shows up😔😔 I mean it’s pretty cool that the Gen Z’ers on tik tok were able to come together in such a big way! Except as I kept clicking around on the app, he announced that he wanted to ban the tik tok app from the U.S.! I mean we all know he’s just crying about the fact that nobody showed up to his wittle twump Wally:((((( Ok moving along. I started getting all of these spam emails and my phone eventually crashed!

But the second I downloaded this app there were glitches. This app is absolutely the WORST I have ever had. The glitches had never been fixed after I sent countless reports able my problems. So I deleted it. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! Along with these glitches on the app it totally messed up my phone. My phone was brand new and once I got thus app my phone has been acting strangely and hasn’t been the same. My battery never holds the charge so it’s constantly on the charger unlike before this app it held charge for hours. Then notifications keep coming up ever minute. I turned off all notifications from the app and even in my phone settings BUT I STILL RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS!! And lastly this app looks like it was designed by a 4 year old. It’s completely cluttered, unorganized, and I can’t find any information. This app is lacking in many categories and is not functional.
