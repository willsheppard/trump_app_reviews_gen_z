So first I download it and at first I didn’t understand what the big deal was it was just a bunch of photos of the same old orange🍊🍊🍊. However I went to bed and woke up the next morning in a warehouse with a bunch of people surrounding me which threw me off guard and then the same orange that I saw on the app was there and I was like omg that’s crazy I was just looking at your photos the other night what’s up✨✨🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️✨✨And he got all rude and I was just taken aback at how rude this man was😡😡😡 and then he starts complaining and I had to tell him to hush 🤬🤬🤬cause I had a headache.

First of all as soon as i got it my fish drowned himself in the kiddie pool. Then my dog and grandma started fist fighting in the bathroom. My mom became a chronically insane hippie and hoola danced on my chimney. It made me run out of limited edition golden silver diamond dino nuggies which are extremely rare in the subtropics. Our house was then hit by a meteor shower and killed my brother’s car’s igunana’s demonic parasite’s uncle. I closed my phone and tried to turn it back on to try to reset it but my phone would not turn back on. Then I started getting spammed with notifications of Trump sending me his baby pictures. I do not recommend. The trauma caused me to need five years of intense therapy. You may want to commit suicide after dealing with the distress this app causes.

HOWEVER this app is, to put it simply, garbage. For one thing, this app takes up WAY too much storage. Since I am constantly donating my lifelong earnings to Donald J. Trump, I do not have the money to pay for more storage on my phone to fix this problem. Another issue is the age limit. I am BLESSED to have a beautiful 16-year-old son who loves Donald J. Trump perhaps even more than I do. But this app claims that he cannot participate because he is “too young”. It seems like for the first time in his presidency Donald J. Trump is trying to discriminate against different groups, which is so unlike our great president. A final problem is the absolute LACK of content. Despite the large amount of storage this app takes up, the really isn’t anything on the app that you cannot find online. That is all. Have a blessed day. Trump 2022. Keep America great. Amen.

Next thing I knew, my body started to turn orange, my hair started to fall out and comb over, and my hands shrunk into tiny little fingers. I began to blame this, and my own personal insecurities on people of color, because of course this is not my fault or the apps fault. So I went to my backyard and found some bricks to build a wall, to protect any POC from coming in and attacking me. Did I wear a mask to the store when I bough the bricks? No! My body my choice!!! Unless it has to do with reproduction, because I only trust strong straight old white men. Anyways, I was lucky to have a strong, independent, democratic sister who found out I downloaded this brainwashing, mind alternating, intelligence killing app. She deleted it off my phone and I immediately went back to the stable minded, educated woman I am.","date":"2020-07-09T11:37:00Z","title":"The worst app like no one has ever seen before in the history of apps","userName":"Nicole BD","rating":1}},{"id":"6176274847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"see I tried to give the orange man a chance❤️ it just didn’t work out. The app took about the same amount of time a woman is carries a child to download. I felt threatened by this app. As this app was downloading I felt my health deteriorating. Once it was downloaded, the cheeto man asked me to put in my number. I felt it was inappropriate as he is believed to be in an ongoing relationship with a woman who is young enough to be his daughter✨ I think he might’ve left her for his actual daughter but I wouldn’t know now would I❤️ the app made my phone slower along with it giving me racist, sexist, misogynistic, and homophobic ViBeS. It wiped my phone of any data along with my entire bank account getting hacked. Honestly, the worst thing is that he hurt my toasters feelings. She cried for DAYS. It was honestly heart wrenching. For the safety of your loved ones and the generations after you I suggest u don’t download this❤️","date":"2020-07-09T11:28:17Z","title":"No❤️","userName":"💞❤️🌳✨💘🧚🏻🧚\u200D♂️","rating":1}},{"id":"6176225573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn’t read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letter like “b” and “d” and “m” and “w”. Dyslexia is different for everyone who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible.

And I thought it was also very sus for him to ask for my phone number like what could you ever need my number for?🤔 Also my camera roll that had  PRIVATE pics of me were automatically sent to the White House like if you want a booty pic that bad go on google💀and that’s a privacy violation. He also can see your private texts with people which is not ok at all, not long after I got a horrible glitch in my phone from this app, its just an overall 💩app just like the president and there are infinite things I could say about it would give zero starts if I could.

The app itself is very shameful as to which it takes several hours to download and when the download is completely finished it takes up a massive about of storage upon your device. After about 5minutes of downloading and opening the app it had lagged my phone out and made my screen freeze! UNACCEPTABLE! My screen had been frozen for about 2 minutes until I had knocked it a couple times and it restarted. The app should be taken down and no one should have gone through the trouble I went through. I am ashamed and I am disappointed, you would think u can get a simple app about mr. trump, but no. I hope that people see these reviews and understand that this app is a waste of storage and time. DONT even THINK of downloading this waste of space nonsense.\n\n-Ge","date":"2020-07-09T09:29:31Z","title":"Worst app I have ever downloaded 🦼","userName":"24678888988766","rating":1}}]}
