I think it must be a bad omen or maybe this app is cursed! You see after downloading the app my dog🐶started to fly! But once I pulled her down my house was sucked into a tornado🌪 and crashed, crushing a witch🧙🏽\u200D♀️ with red shoes👠! And as I thought of the idea to write this I was falling down a rabbit hole because the rabbit said “he was late” ⏰ and I wanted to know what for. But once I landed I somehow ended up in a Galaxy Far Far Away🌌 with some boy telling me he was going to take me into the sky off to Never Land✨. I didn’t want to go so I went to the beach🏖 where a crab 🦀 told me being Under the Sea 🌊 was better. I told him that it probably was but I would drown if i went with him. So instead I took a ride with the Guardians of the Galaxy⚔️ and they dropped me off in some place called Diagon Alley were there are lots of wizards 🧙\u200D♂️ so that’s what happens and why I the app is a bad omen 💀"}},{"id":"6179471942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Chile anyways stream be happy😻😼😽","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:42Z","userName":"ochuruu","review":"Terrible do not recommend❤️would definitely give it zero stars if I could😹ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆——— have🤔you😒ever😔been😡snaked🐍by🙃a🤨 friend👧then😪just😾for 🤦the🗣️clout👀they'll😈do😣it😕again🙄———She👩🏽 like🌂Papî 🍰I 🍾adore 💘you🤸\u200D♀️I'm 🛍like 🩸Baby 🎀 I 🖍ain't 💅normal👩\u200D🦯 Rrrrr 🦁 🦁🦁 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner 💞 foreigner💞"}},{"id":"6179471724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:37Z","userName":"ghostreaper44","review":"I came on here to keep of with COVID and the riots since I don’t have a tv to watch news on, and I got to say this app is a disappointment. It took almost all of my space on my phone. Took a long time downloading. And when I FINALLY got on the app it started glitching.  Wouldn’t let me clicked on things and took an even longer time for things to load. This app is HORRIBLE!!"}},{"id":"6179471638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Garbage app for a garbage president","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:35Z","userName":"Alex Di Giacomo","review":"Poorly designed, but that's to be expected based on the incompetence of anybody who works for him."}},{"id":"6179471535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"have🤬you😛ever👺been🦡snaked🐍by👸🏼a🧠friend👁then😤just🤚🏽for😖clout👹theyll🥰do it😄again🤥","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:34Z","userName":"karen tingles❤️😅","review":"I am 37 years old ❤️and I downloaded this app for my kids to play on and learn some more about our president🇺🇸 and I was shocked😵. After a little bit of them being on it they were being sexist👩\u200D❤️\u200D👨 and racist to eachother. They were calling eachother the N WORD👄. I am not ok with this😾, so this is just one reason I’m rating this app a 1, if I could I would give it a 0. Another reason is because after that I heard a sound at night when all the kids were asleep😴, it was a baby laughing😼 and little kids saying “mommy we’re coming👹” I looked and MY LITTLE KIDS WERE POSSESSED!😈 they had a knife 🔪 and were coming at me with it, with the debby ryan smerk on their face👁👄👁. I was beyond terrified😣 then I looked out the window and my husband was cheating on me with trumps wife😳haha jokes on you trump🥵I never even liked my husband anyways😐so this is why you should not get this app"}},{"id":"6179471544","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"⚠️Do not download⚠️","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:34Z","userName":"Dary_grazy","review":"This app took away all my storage and now I don’t have any more storage😪\nAnd plus it’s not worth it it took me 24hours to download😤 And when I opened the app it said “now trump knows we’re your living”\n⚠️Keep in mind this is a warning⚠️\n⚠️DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!⚠️ And that’s on period❕\n\nAnyone else frome TikTok😅😂😂"}},{"id":"6179471451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Oop","date":"2020-07-10T04:41:33Z","userName":"blegh163838-761","review":"This app did nothing!!!
