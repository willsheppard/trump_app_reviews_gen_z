As soon as I downloaded the app I started developing symptoms of #AllLivesMatter. These symptoms include thoughts of white supremacy, “Karen” syndrome, and various other life threatening conditions. I also woke up this morning and looked in the mirror. I started turning ORANGE! This is NOT GOOD. Soon I will begin to treat minorities and women with blatant disrespect. If you do not want to develop these symptoms that could cost you your life please do NOT download this app!","date":"2020-07-09T20:14:19Z"}},{"id":"6178086322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISGUSTANG 🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"martha the average dog 🐕","review":"I got on this app too see his plans for the election and what he plans to do but as I was waiting for the app to load it started playing cat noises I was like what the and I got out of the app to check everything but it stopped and no other apps had anything to do with cats so when I went back on the cat noises started again then my app crashed so yes I very much do not recommend getting this app","date":"2020-07-09T20:12:22Z"}},{"id":"6178076780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The trump app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"charlidfan","review":"So I downloaded like a few weeks ago and it started to make my phone glitch and act crazy and it malarkey seee just did it again and it writes its own stuff and one night it went 300 notifications to my phone saying I am watching u  and also it flickers the phone off and on all the time I think this app needs to go bc scary stuff is happening to my phone .","date":"2020-07-09T20:09:10Z"}},{"id":"6177979127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitchy and Crashing","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Captaincapsize","review":"This app is incredibly glitchy, and it crashes whenever I click on a subject. I would expect more from the president of the United States. If he can’t even make and app, how can he be our president. I would not recommend this app, if you want the news go to google. This app is a waste of my time and storage on my iphone. I urge you to not download it.","date":"2020-07-09T19:37:13Z"}},{"id":"6177971571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TRASH","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"BabyDeku189","review":"I’m so sick of this man. I never had a problem with him, but now he is getting out of hand. Listen old man, you can’t just start taking out our favorite apps just to go against someone or someplace. You don’t rule the world. You are really trying your hardest to not get re-elected. Aren’t you? This app is actual trash and needs to be taken off, just like he is threatening to do with our app.","date":"2020-07-09T19:34:42Z"}},{"id":"6177969264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is not it pooh💅🏼👁👄👁💅🏼","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"badbishexclusiveperiidt","review":"Chile, I downloaded the app tO sUppOrt tHe president but then the app logged me out. And my phone started glitching like gurl get it together hunny. Then I went back into the app to see his campaign plans, guess what happened it kicked me out the app again.

And I’ve been using it for a week and like every time I’m one it ten minutes in it kicks my out and won’t let me in till I restart my phone. It glitches weirdly and randomly.

This orange mistake running our country should not be aloud to control such a horrid app. I suggest that he shall be 🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨EBORTED✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️ immediately one order to protect the well being of our country. He has done nothing but cause damage to our economy. I honestly hope Covid gets to him he after all dosent wear a mask. :)","date":"2020-07-09T19:04:34Z"}},{"id":"6177875219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Misleading","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ruefeen","review":"First of all, among entering this app it began with these three words, “keep America great”. My question to you is, what did our current president, Donald J Trump do to make America great during his presidency? Our economy depends on money and for him our economy depends on his supports to keep this economy great. Whats so good about that? My recommendation would be, lets help make America great for the first time ever. Wouldn’t that make people want to reelect him as president?","date":"2020-07-09T19:03:20Z"}},{"id":"6177837699","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"We are gen Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"tik tok.._..@","review":"Generation Z does not care what you do. You are not going to get rid of us. And trying to get rid of TikTok? That is the one app where all of us can come together. We will keep coming back, We will find away. You are acting like a coward afraid of a couple kids. You’re some president for taking away one app where we feel free to be ourselves. Thanks trump.\n\nLove always,\nThe kids with a voice","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:55Z"}}]}
