All I wanted to do was to support the cheeto but this app leaked all of my private information. Because the app leaked my address, random people keep showing up to my house and robbing me. Someone even took my cat and murdered my entire family. I tried deleting the app but that just set off an ear splitting alarm that got me fired from my work. I would give this app -10000 stars if i could😔\nBREONNA TAYORS MURDERERS HAVE STILL NOT BEEN ARRESTED!!

It bamboozles me that he is even our president now. How can someone who has had countless rape allegations made against them run this country? He is a rapist, sexist, mysogonist, homophobic, xenophobic orange boy. VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE AND SAVE TIKTOK IN AMERICA!

It took FOREVER to download despite having good WiFi. It’s filled with rude, sexist, narcissistic, fascists, old, white men that only want attention. Take it from me. As SOON as I went on here, I was attacked for being a “newbie” in the presidential campaign. Some even tried to hit me up after degrading me. Some time later everything began to glitch. I kept seeing the giant sweet potatoes face with the message “Make American Great Again”. I think he’s trying to send us subliminal messages...is that the president you want? To make you download an app to support him, then he turns around to try AND BRAINWASH YOU?!?!? If we can’t trust his app, how can we trust him as a president? Absolutely disgusting.","title":"What a waste a phone storage","userName":"Katniss_Everdeen_69","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:04:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172600415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I was first reading the reviews, I had though this was just a terrible thing these gen zers were doing. However, when I downloaded the app to support my dear president, I realized they were right! My wife was cleaning the toilet (as all good wives should) and she swallowed all the poop in there whole! At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but then weird things kept happening to me. The rats in the attic came down into the house and ate my little girl Ashleigh! (We didn’t like her very much anyway.) Then, to top it all off, robbers and looters came into my house. Luckily, my boy Kevin was home alone and he had old Christmas bulbs for them to step on and get glass in their foot. I would not recommend this app if you value your life like a good Christian does!","title":"Just simply awful","userName":"88Sabby","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:04:04Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172599935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"so i wanted to support my amazing president, donald jenius trump, so i downloaded this app. it seemed to be good at first, but every time i lie down on my furniture, it’d form legs and kick me out of it when i’m on the app. my carpet couldn’t even accept me anymore. when my furniture saw the cheeto it just got really angry and i have to go to the ER to check on my butt. when i was outside my house after that i opened the app to sign up for the rally and MY WHOLE HOUSE STOOD UP AND RAN AWAY. it wouldn’t even come back after i left the app. i am now living in a hotel but i’m too scared to open this app or else this building might run away too. if y’all get this please download a house tracker for your own safety.","title":"my house ran away 😡😡","userName":"aubrey.hollister","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:03:57Z","rating":1}}]}
