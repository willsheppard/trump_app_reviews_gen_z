It took over $1,936 to completely get rid of them, but then didn’t go away for over a month. I then noticed my dogs acting irregular, so I took them to the vet. They had a very rare disease called 🍊dyeation (spelled orgedyeation) It was so serious that I had to put all three down bc they would have to go through multiple surgeries and survive each one which only 2% out of a million survive it. 😭😭😭 Even then it would have a lifetime of side effects that wouldn’t wear off.  They said that it was highly contagious to people with the right blood type. Since I lived with the dogs, they said to go get a blood test. I went to the hospital and did it. While I was waiting, I somehow contracted the coronavirus while one of the nurses passed in front of my door. They cane pack with the blood work and said that I had to get an emergency surgery bc it had spread all through my kidney and it could likely kill me in the next three days if they didn’t act fast. They got all ready and put me under the anesthesia, but They gave me too much so I was in a unexpected coma for 3 months. During that time period, my dad died of cancer. I woke up having no knowledge of anything. I had to learn all the fundamentals, like eating and going to the bathroom from the very start. I went home, and saw that TikTok was getting banned. I wanted to do something about it bc I had amassed over 130k while I shared my life while was in the hospital learning all of the basic steps of life. I also learned that Trump was the cause of all my problems. I was enraged bc of what I saw on the news, how he handled the black lives matter protests, world war 3, and the coronavirus.","isEdited":false,"userName":"willowgrace87","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:56:14Z"}},{"id":"6174173305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bad","review":"Never ever it was bad please don’t get this app I waste of time","isEdited":false,"userName":"my ass hole","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:52:18Z"}},{"id":"6174166823","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"nasty ✨✨✨","review":"my oven exploded with everything in it! my cat is not doing well and my phone does not work because of this smelly app ❤️ it is a perfect example of sewer water mixed with cheeto dust 😋never again🥳","isEdited":false,"userName":"dumdum poopbum","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:49:59Z"}},{"id":"6174161778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why tik tok!?","review":"Why do you have to banner tik tok people worked hard to make vids don't ban tik tok!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"bri bendavid","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:48:21Z"}},{"id":"6174146586","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","review":"It tells you not that much and he is banning TikTok","isEdited":false,"userName":"korbynjonesthe 1","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:37Z"}},{"id":"6174142447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"rawr","review":"bruh as soon as i opened the app i saw a CHEETO. my fish even threw up from the sight of him. um no, 1 out of 5.","isEdited":false,"userName":"6ix9inesnitch","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:41:04Z"}},{"id":"6174141063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hacked!","review":"I think this app is broken.
