At first I was quite flattered 🥰☺️but then the whole app hacked my phone📱🦠! There were pictures of the Orange 🍊ameriKKKans call president all over my camera roll. And when i tried to delete the app, it saw “Access Denied”. the government hacked my phone!👿🤬🤬🤬 the app finally deleted in 12635 days. by that time I had more than 32976425 viruses on my phone . Then a bunch of trump supporters 🇺🇸showed up at my house with cockroaches and forks 🍴and ski shoes 🎿⛷, threatening to attack! I felt so threatened! Once they attacked, I called the police 👮🏻👮🏻\u200D♂️👮🏻\u200D♀️but they said I deserved it. and now I am friends with a cockroach we are currently filming a Tik tok ;) 🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗anyways afterwards, I was put in a Facebook white mom group chat where woman said they were voting for Kanye! I felt attacked, I was scared! 👊🏾😫Then Trump emailed me randomly and asked why I deleted the app! 😒He threatened to take away my house, phone, iPad, laptop, food, EVERYTHING!🤯 12 days later the orangutan 🦧came to my house with his spies, knocked down my front door and trashed my house in white supremacy, racism, transphobia, islamophobia, sexism, homophobia, American flags, and trump merchandise ! 🤬🤮 🇺🇸💔I had a stroke while having a heart attack. I was in a coma for 75 weeks from my trauma and eventually died ⚰️ Don’t download this app! It caused me so much trouble causing me to pass away! ⚰️I am now an angel writing from heaven.😇 Luv y’all 😘","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:49:19Z"}},{"id":"6178817825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️f*ck donald trump","userName":"jekendkdjjkslkwqjq","rating":1,"review":"this app is DISGUSTING. i downloaded it on 4/20/20 simply because i wanted to support our wrinkly president and every move he makes, however, as soon as i opened the app i was shocked to see pictures of our orange president naked with his short ding-a-ling right between his fat legs. i quickly went to pour bleach in my eyes and after that went to further explore this app. i hear a knock on my door and it’s baron trump informing me that his father is indeed holding him and malaria trump captive 💅🏼 we could never save ivanka because all she does is defend him 🖕🏼🥰  this app needs to be taken down immediately!!!! it is the only reason my mom is pregnant and my boyfriend broke up with me. i am VERY uncomfortable with the energy we have created in America today 🤮ACAB 💕 BLM ❤️ f*ck donald trump 💖","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:48:07Z"}},{"id":"6178815590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DISGUSTING SO BAD BE CAREFUL","userName":"tina the pickle","rating":1,"review":"my pet rat started to use the app one day and suddenly it blew up in his face and we rushed him to the ER and he died later that day :(.we played foreigner at his funeral.he would’ve wanted this app to be deleted pls take consideration of mr sewer pls take down the app :(","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:47:18Z"}},{"id":"6178814497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app on the app store","userName":"teehee no❤️✨🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"review":"I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE TRAUMATIZED!!! to begin, it asked me to put in all of my personal information. being oh so supportive of our president, i didn’t hesitate🙈 but soon after i received a text saying they were going to be tracking my phone and everywhere i went. i ignored and proceeded to explore the app, JUST TO SEE AN ORANGE WITH HAIR ALL OVER THIS APP. I NEARLY PASSED OUT DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF PAIN IT CAUSED. i have truly never been more scared in my life😔 then to make it better, right after, i got a phone call from an unknown number and they had said they were right outside of my house. i went outside and saw it was the secret service workers 👁👄👁 they flew all the way to LA to see me🙈✨ at least i thought. they then TOOK MY FOOD RIGHT OUT OF MY HAND. GUYS I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU DOWNLOAD THIS APP. THEY WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND DISAPPOINT YOU😔 nothing but pain. i will be expecting my food back because you sir do not deserve it. if i could give this app -10000000/5 i definitely would. this is insane and i do not approve. so before downloading this app, read these reviews. they will truly save you from the pain and trauma that this app will cause you.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:46:52Z"}},{"id":"6178809259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD: my phone glitches out because of this 😤","userName":"Turtle de fuerte","rating":1,"review":"I only wanted to support our amazing president when I downloaded this. Once I downloaded it it asked me for my phone number and I put it in because I’ve given his campaign my number before and didn’t think it would do anything bad. BUT THEN I started getting weird text messages almost immediately and my phone would glitch and freeze up and I’m SO UPSET about this app. I’ve tried to delete it but it doesn’t let me because my phone will freeze and it’s so messed up. I’m surprised I can even write this review right now. Also I have plenty of storage in my phone and I tried restarting it. Serious bugs with this app. Not worth the download. I might even vote for Biden now cuz Trump is really stating to piss me off. I’m just trying to be supportive but this is too much. 🤷\u200D♀️💁\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:44:52Z"}},{"id":"6178810954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trump 2020 but no not on a gravestone","userName":"its.called.being.smart","rating":5,"review":"HELLO TRUMP IS THE BEST ALSO APPLE PLs read thisss A TIK TOKER TOLD EVERYONE TO LEAVE BAD REVIEWS ON THIS APP SO TIK TOK COULD STAY!!
