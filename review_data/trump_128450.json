Their was lots of inappropriate content. Like private parts on humans cut off, pictures of after a $ch00l $h00tings. Very disturbing things. A couple hours after I installed the app, weird things started happening. My dogs foot got cut off, my fan fell on my head, the tv doesn’t work anymore, things started moving. Just very weird. I would like to give this app a -19373 but that is not possible. Anyways our orange needs to go away😘thanks for your time.","userName":"ryleigh_mealeh","rating":1}},{"id":"6176892868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤡","review":"Trump is ass","userName":"✨🧚\u200D♀️🤡🥵🥺🙏","rating":1}},{"id":"6176892771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:16:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app doesn’t have the proper technology to be an app for the president","review":"My political opinions have started to shift so i decided to download the app, but it didn’t even send me a verification code and just left me hanging. after three hours i got sent a code and logged in to a bunch of randomly place text boxes and categories. really shows how organized trump really is.","userName":"carlymarie2234","rating":1}},{"id":"6176891689","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:15:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"So disappointed","review":"I really wanted to download this app to support our Cheeto colored president, but I was just so disappointed by all of the bad things on this app. I really just did not like it. First off when I opened the app there was this disgusting creature just sitting there. And then it asked me for my phone number like why do you need it are you going to send it to China. Absolutely disgusting. Finally I couldn’t even see the entire American flag because of the weird creature standing in the way. What is that all about? America is the most important country so we should be able to see the entire American flag. You really should not design a better app.","userName":"Anynormalhuman2020","rating":1}},{"id":"6176891076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:15:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨fuck you trump✨","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT. BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second! He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth. BARRY (CONT'D) Hello? His best friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, is on the other end. ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye! JANET BENSON Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! (Bee movie)","userName":"Jew C.
