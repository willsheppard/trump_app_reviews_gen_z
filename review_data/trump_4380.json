If you don’t know what I’m taking about please educate yourself on the type of person he is❤️. And as for the app I tried signing up and it started glitching on me then when I typed in my information it said “no” I don’t understand this app should be terminated as a whole as well as the person behind this app who can’t even speak proper English or drink water without help❤️if you support this app get well soon😝","date":"2020-07-09T00:01:28Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"review leya","title":"I used to be a trump supporter","rating":1}},{"id":"6174194711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app because I was like “well maybe I should start supporting the president after all the hard work he’s put in to divide the party’s, discriminate every race, women, and sexuality on top of doing nothing for the pandemic”. once I opened the app my eyes started to bleed. I don’t know if it was a side effect of getting the app but they didn’t list it so I’m assuming not. I had to go to the ER and get two glass eye balls. I’m currently spamming the keyboard because I can no longer see. I don’t want anyone else to go through this, therefore I’m giving it a 1 star review so people are aware. thank you for your concern.","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Molly is a nerd","title":"absolutely horrendous. my eyes started to bleed.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174190475","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ok don’t get this app there is a scary Cheeto man that seems to hate teenagers and keeps children hostage to make them like him and I have to hurry and type this because now there are all these 10 year olds at my door that have come for me but the worst part is they are holding bags of Cheetos and plan to make me one of them...so the purpose of this review is so that you don’t get this app because I need everyone to know that if you download this app you will have to deal with getting kidnapped and held hostage to eventually turn into a Karen from being around all the other Karens so this is your only warning DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T23:58:39Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"help im scared for life","title":"Please don’t get this app","rating":1}},{"id":"6174155426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app it asked for access to my photos and to use the app I had to accept. Later, I opened my camera roll and found hundreds of pictures of an old, dirty cheeto man🤢. My dog looked over my shoulder and looked at these photos and immediately started convulsing. It levitated in the air, opened its mouth and a demonic voice said “V O T E F O R T R U M P 2 0 2 0.” It scarred me so much that in the dead of night in the darkest corner of my house, I can see a small shriveled orange figure in the shadows telling me to vote for the pedo -I mean- president😱. My dog now is an epileptic and attacks all orange objects on sight. DO NOT download this app if you care about yourself, your dog, or HUMANITY.","date":"2020-07-08T23:45:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"thisisanIQtest","title":"LITERALLY just THE WORST","rating":1}},{"id":"6174145970","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Please don’t download this app🤮 I had to get glasses because my eyes got swollen while looking at our presidents bright orange skin😔also I had to eat my fridge I had to vacuum my grass and I had to cut my carpet😫 omg so I need to tell y’all a story😣 so every night I force my pet rat named ratatouille to cook me a meal cuz I am to lazy to go to McDonalds, he made me grilled tape worms which is my favorite💗 but I just found out that it’s also trumps favorite food so I had to throw it out which is a HUGE wast of tape worm😤so my rat ratatouille made me go to McDonalds, but when I finally got my delicious Big Mac it was stolen by Dora and then she gave it to this app🙄 HOW DARE THOU TRUMP🤡\n\nHope this helped yall💖\nXoxo,\nDeltaMathVelma","date":"2020-07-08T23:42:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"DeltaMathVelma","title":"HORRIBLE APP🤮🤮🤮","rating":1}},{"id":"6174136238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I saw this app and I thought it said “Thumb 2020” and I was so excited to get news from my favorite presidential candidate Mr. Thumb, but upon opening this application, I found that not only was it not the one and only Mr. Thumb, but it was actually Donald Trump, the creator of the Trump University and Trump Steaks. Upon my realization, I immediately had flashbacks to my experience at Trump University where all they fed us were these crappy Trump Steaks and it makes sense considering Trump and Trump Steaks are both dead cows that are unqualified to be president. In the end, I just wasted 18 hours of my day crying because of my flashbacks to Trump University and not being able to get alerts from the majestic Mr. Thumb 🥺😭","date":"2020-07-08T23:38:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Patrickbritting","title":"Deceptive","rating":1}},{"id":"6174108615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is so work. I got it and as soon as I opened it, I just kept seeing “make America great again”. How can one say that if America was never great. If there ever was a time that it was/can be“great”, that will be the time where all lives actually matter. Period. Second off, it won’t let my phone sign up with it, so there is no point on even bothering to try for me. Last, but not least, the first thing the app wants you to do is enter your phone number. I’m sorry, but it seems to me that they just want person information from you guys to find out more. So nope, worse app I’ve ever even came across.","date":"2020-07-08T23:28:38Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"idgafayorfmyscb","title":"Absolutely not","rating":1}},{"id":"6174100721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"first off, this app is based of Trump. i really shouldn’t have to say anymore, but fortunately i will continue 🙈 when i went on the app i saw something very. disturbing. a picture of trump himself. not even signing up yet they asked me to “vote trump for president” ????? who- who made this app? if there was a 0 star option pleas no that that is the review it would get. it would save everyone lots of sadness if u delete the app permanently 🧚🏻\u200D♀️ better yet , if u could delete trump as president, surely it would raise my hopes  !!! no suggestions how to make this app better . everything abt it is , disappointing to say the least 🤩!! bye 😘","date":"2020-07-08T23:25:43Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yourmomlis","title":"the worst app of human existence.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174044422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"According to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.
