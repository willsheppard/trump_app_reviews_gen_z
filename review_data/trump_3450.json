I’m not sure who decided it should become an App but they were wrongly mistaken. The United States is being torn apart because this app is that bad!! It saw I was a female and immediately made unwanted sexual remarks at me. When I confronted IT about this, they claimed the App never said this and I was making up fake comments. My friends of color weren’t even allowed on the app, I can’t believe how racist this app really is and that it’s allowed be running the news in America. I’m saving you from making the worst decision of your life and not wasting your time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! You may end up living the next four years in regret.","isEdited":false,"title":"Make America Great Again and DELETE this app!!","date":"2020-07-09T08:45:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"cjm820"}},{"id":"6175568384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i cannot believe this!!! i had to rate this app 1 star because when i clicked on it i found out that the colors r very ugly! what about other colors like green yellow pink??? the ap could have been WAY better with a lil bit more POP 🙄 \nthen the app icon is V E R Y boring! a pic of his small juicy orange booty would have been acceptable since it will make me laugh everytime i see the app in my home screen! 👻😹😹😿\nthird i did research and found out trump said no to blm… and said no to acab… very rude and uneducated! i thought this man was very smart since he says all the time he is 🙄 very very ugly of him to say so 😹😹🙈 \nif i would have given it ZERO STAR rating i would have! \nxoxo- the 1 and ONLY! jetters 👁👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👩👩\u200D❤️\u200D💋\u200D👨","isEdited":false,"title":"DIS GUD TANG😋✨🐸👼🏻🧚🏼","date":"2020-07-09T07:34:48Z","rating":1,"userName":"notheodd"}},{"id":"6175555958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first heard of Donald Trumps tragic death, I was depressed beyond measure. I truly wish that this app paid a better homage to his memory,  and that I could give it more than a single star (which was given only for this great leader of ours who recently died while trying to insert a buttered cheeseburger into his rectum.) unfortunately, this app was extremely unhelpful and unwanted, as I would imagine an app revolving around the presidential campaign of a deceased, former tyrant would be. If only this app was as great as America after Trump was elected into office. Unfortunately it’s almost as useless and unwanted as his entire term.

I waited 6 hrs. Ridiculous. And THEN It kept crashing and exiting me out of the app while I was trying to get my rally tickets. I am extremely frustrated with this app. It took up so much storage space on my phone, now I’m having trouble downloading other apps and doing other things on my phone. 0 stars. Not only has this app been crashing but I’ve noticed my phone is starting to not work as well ether, I think it’s affecting my phone. Very mad. Now Facebook keeps crashing too. I was unable to get my rally tickets from this app I had to go to my desktop and do it from the website. Do not download this app. It’s awful. 0/10","isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t download","date":"2020-07-09T07:05:41Z","rating":1,"userName":"Loretta W.

I swear I heard voices and my lamp in the living room got knocked over, honestly I feel like I should get compensation for that lamp, it was my favorite lamp. We were best friends. I ended up deleting the app after a couple of hours thinking everything would stop but no. Now I have ghosts living in my house. Now I have to buy sage and probably have to have a shaman come get rid of them. Thanks trump now I have to pay more money than I planned on to get my house back to normal.","isEdited":false,"title":"My house is now haunted","date":"2020-07-09T04:07:19Z","rating":1,"userName":"i dont want ghosts"}},{"id":"6174954958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was  in utter shock and pure disgust after i entered this app. I expected to see representation of the USA. But all I saw was a sickly demented monster covered in the color of a actual orange with disgusting yellow strands as hair. I left that app so fast for my eyes were not only raped but scarred for life. This is not America. The orange monster had a grim look on his face... the face of the devil’s spawn. How can a single creature cause so much evil in these “United” States. The orange monster has torn this country apart. If you ever see it in real life, you can tell that this monster has rudimentary speech and slurs as if constantly under the influence. Do not download this app if you want to keep your soul intact. All I can say is may God bless America😭","isEdited":false,"title":"My eyes will never forget","date":"2020-07-09T03:53:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"scoloar2.0"}},{"id":"6174930917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app thinking that it would give me the best unbiased news for this 2020 election and our great president cheesy mcorange! however it did the opposite😾😡 it made my phone glitch like crazy and i got so many ads. i started noticing that random pop ups of lil huddy and zoe laverne were occurring all over the place. eventually the problem escalated and i started receiving threatening messages from an anonymous number. in a panic, i deleted the app. as soon as i did that, everything went back to normal. i WOULD NOT recommend this app to anyone it will RUIN your life🙄. anyways harry styles 2020 he is not racist, homophobic, or a rapist and every word that comes out of his mouth is pure art💕","isEdited":false,"title":"chile.... anyways😿😿","date":"2020-07-09T03:45:54Z","rating":1,"userName":"harrystyles2020💕💕"}},{"id":"6174906084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app should have never been made or put out in to the public whatsoever. first of all, the representative media for this app is terrifying. my child cried hysterically looking at the male model in your advertisement. secondly, it asked for my phone number, which could then be used to trace my everything bagel seasoning order. and i can’t have my bagel preference being put out there for the terrorists to see. third, if anything, this app is outdated. in USA we demand LAW AND ORDER. and the layout of this app is definitely not orderly. i had a stroke and went to the hospital trying to figure out where the intelligence is. in conclusion i think this app should be banned in the U.S, where #allappsmatter","isEdited":false,"title":"a national security threat.","date":"2020-07-09T03:38:26Z","rating":1,"userName":"_liin2308_"}},{"id":"6174894162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this dumb app and peaches came up shoving a knife in her 🐱 and then it showed me a clip of hellen keller screaming wwwaaaáæäàáttttttttttttoooooooôòœörrrrrrrr and he was laughing so hard he almost popped a blood vessel and he said i wish we had more people like this in the world and now i have to talk like hellen and i stan hellen but when the president and leader of Cheetos him self is making people like this and the 🍤 thing (we have all seen the pic) i heard he uses a cheeto to make it look longer and how grumpy cat died was she looked at his special pic and she died and that was so sad but you can see why you should leave a bad review on this app.\n\n                     Rip grumpy cat you were loved","isEdited":false,"title":"Wow way to make fun of deaf and blind people","date":"2020-07-09T03:34:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"weanen"}}]}
