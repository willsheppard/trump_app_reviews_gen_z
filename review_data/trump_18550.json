He has done nothing but mock people, call them names, try to take basic rights away, raise our taxes, and more disgusting things. He claims to be a Christian but has no idea what the Bible even is. He is not a Christian, he is a money-hungry politician and a disgusting human being.","userName":"KotaElizabeth","title":"I used to be a supporter"}},{"id":"6172934783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:41:08Z","review":"As soon as i got the app, my phone starting vibrating like crazy for 30 seconds then shut off.

I found non of these. I found that he is destroying the US and tearing us apart. He’s created less jobs and promoted racism! Hes even hosting rallies mid pandemic. He doesn’t care for people health!

This is a terrible app with it being laggy and hard to use. I tried reaching out to the president and he call me fat when I sent him a picture of my baby he told me to stuff it back into my uterus.
