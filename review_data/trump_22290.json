It takes at least a week to download!!!! I kept on getting too many notifications and I was busing watering my pool. I was very unhappy and I would like to say this app is very horrible. It is very disturbing and I just wanted to support our wonderful president but this app just wasn’t it.","userName":"gotdtdt","rating":1,"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6178844414","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:58:19Z","review":"This app took WAY too long to download! Horrible user interface, very difficult to navigate, ads all over the place, slow connection, sometimes it won’t even open properly or shuts down my phone. All around 0 star application","userName":"GoblinGirlfriend","rating":1,"title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6178809058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:44:47Z","review":"I was really excited to download this app because I’m a frequent traveler and I needed a new way to spread hate. It took 9 hours to download and whenever I tried to open the app, it would glitch and take me back to my home screen. At least I have Trumps NH rally to look forward to! 🧜\u200D♀️🦄🌸🌈🎭🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"wearyamask","rating":1,"title":"So disappointed"}},{"id":"6178799090","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:40:55Z","review":"As soon as I downloaded this app, Donald himself kicked down my door and curb stomped me. Once I came to, Ivanka threw my head into the wall. Melania then came in and attempted to bite me, but when she opened her mouth the botox came undone. The weight of her nasty wrinkley skin made her fall to the floor. I am scarred for life and now have to pay thousands to see a therapist every week.","userName":"klkhbgghjf","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE"}},{"id":"6178776523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:32:15Z","review":"Absolutely terrible. Heinous in content, poorly made, and all around disgusting. I was horrified to see how bad this app was and if I could rate it zero stars, believe me, I would. This app should be banned from the app store permanently for the good of mankind. Downloading this app was the worst decision I have ever made in my life.","userName":"23682&'s","rating":1,"title":"The most horrendous app I've ever used"}},{"id":"6178770349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:29:50Z","review":"ok so first of all- this app had the AUDACITY to not even download. idk if it’s just me but..

What app has ever crashed a brand new iPhone 11 max pro. This is ridiculous I had to plug my phone up to my Mac just to fix it. I don’t want anyone else to experience what I did with this app please remove it.","userName":"dhsn18","rating":1,"title":"This app is ridiculous"}},{"id":"6178738602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T00:17:34Z","review":"This app caused a major problem with my phone as it downloaded. It started to glitch. It took a large amount of time to download, and many of the features/user design is less than adequate.
