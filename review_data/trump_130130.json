My experience from the first moment that I searched the app was terrible. When I searched for this app there were other apps that also popped up and confused my mind too much that I could simply not understand it. To add, I noticed that the app only allows 17 and older individuals to download it, which made me think... what about the poor 16 and 364/365 year olds that just want to download this app? Why are they being discriminated against for something that is not in their control? And then I realized.. thatРђЎs what America does ­Ъўї. As I proceeded to download this app it took\n a whopping 1 minute to download. Upon clicking the screen above the tiles of the app, I had loomed into the wrong territory. The dark side of the Internet. I was first asked a disturbing question about allowing Push Notifications. After I shuddered and pressed Not Now, I was led to the disturbing home screen. Upon this, I saw an image of a very chonky Cheeto. Unfortunately, I was not appetized at all by this Cheeto as it was asking for my number. After shuddering for a second time, I noticed a certain glint in the CheetosРђЎ eye. Almost as if it was crying. Then I realized. The picture was taken at the Tulsa rally, when he realized that Gen Z had defeated him. Alas, I was able to stop my shuddering and mirror the Cheeto with a glimmer of joy in my eye and excitedly deleted the horrid application."}},{"id":"6174790903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Follow my tiktok Premeshadow","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The chicken nugget story(use code tiko)","review":"Ewwww this app is TRAAASH when I enter asked if I wanted chicken nuggets and I said yes(cause l really wanted chicken nuggets) and the said go buy some and showed trumpРђЎs ugly faaaace"}},{"id":"6174790041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lily Walford","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"-192/10","review":"this app is horrible­ЪўЮ­Ъўї­Ъўђ luv xoxo"}},{"id":"6174789424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Halo the snail","date":"2020-07-09T03:04:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Gross and stinky­ЪўА­ЪјЃ","review":"I downloaded this in hopes of seeing Barron trump but I saw mr.poopyspraytanpeanut instead­Ъцг­Ъцг I was so sad my pet snail and I started crying and then I opened my phone again to go on the app and HE JUMPED OUT THROUGH THE SCREEN AND STEPPED ON MY SNAIL­Ъўћ­ЪўБ­Ъўќ­ЪўФ I started crying even more and he told me to shut up­Ъўц  he laid on my bed and got his spray tan all over it­Ъц«­Ъц« he started crying­Ъцфwhen he saw what he did and left.
