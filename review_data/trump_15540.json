All it did was waste space in my storage. 0 out of everything, would NOT recommend. It’s nasty and I don’t like the vibes. Also, the man you see when you first open the app isn’t very appealing. It would probably help to put somebody attractive as the picture instead. Bad app, don’t download. It’s really a disappointment. 😷👎❌"}},{"id":"6172495985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T14:34:54Z","userName":"Generous Human","review":"The app took up way too much space on my phone, and took too much time to download. When it finally downloaded, I couldn’t even get in the app!!!! At first I thought it was my mobile cellular device, but then I decided to download another app but deleted the Trump app, and it works Just fine !!! This is a horrible app and will not be looked forward to by me anytime soon."}},{"id":"6172449426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"fake news","date":"2020-07-08T14:22:21Z","userName":"soiHDSGHFJKSDBiugas","review":"i downloaded this app to get educated about my presidents platform and beliefs. in all honesty, this app is the definition of his fake news campaign.  it filters the news stories talked about to be one sided and benefit his bottom line.  any politician in their right mind should know there are good and bad things that will happen under your watch, but this man blatantly denies his own involvement and moves onto the next thing.  honestly sickening.  so i did try to do my due diligence to get to the bottom of what i would be voting for if i voted trump, but i’m not sure that’s going to happen.  \n\nalso if you put your number in on this app it will sell your info to telemarketers."}},{"id":"6172433537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Public","date":"2020-07-08T14:18:04Z","userName":"Tabi rates","review":"Donald trump shouldn’t have ever been president bc he has made things worst and he isn’t the president to help people he just likes the power he has so if he is president again just know that he is only president bc he likes the power and he is going to shut down tik tok but if this app gets lots of 1 stars then this will be deleted and tik tok will be saved so please help me keep tik tok and don’t let Donald Trump be president again"}},{"id":"6172405296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS APP‼️","date":"2020-07-08T14:10:22Z","userName":"BbitterButt","review":"I let my daughter download this app because as a patriotic mother I knew it was important to get my daughter involved with trumps campaign.

I was hoping to find some amazingly kind and caring things about him, but obviously that was not the case. I feel lied to and cheated and just want to say that you need to stop lying to the people because he is a not a good person nor is he a good president. We do not need pedophiles in the White House and Cheetos should be banned from America!!!!"}},{"id":"6172268955","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Don’t download this it made me almost die 🥵","date":"2020-07-08T13:32:59Z","userName":"ima eay you","review":"I downloaded this app to see our sexy king but I was more than disappointed to see him looking orange😡 when I found out trump was a old rat and not a 16 year old man I jumped out by window. The only reason I jumped out my window was because I was so scared of the color orange and Donald rat whatever his name is, is the color orange I wanted to rip out my eyes sooooo trump your paying my medical bills 😡😡😡😹😹😹"}},{"id":"6171956519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Very horrible app","date":"2020-07-08T12:03:57Z","userName":"M.K😂🤣","review":"I downloaded the app to see what type of plans Trump has for the future and it was a major disappointment. It made me give me phone number and now I get random calls at night. On time some random person texted me about a p— ad. Disgusting. I was appalled. The sad thing is I never figured it out what he is going to do for the future. This app is trash if I can rate it a -10 I would."}},{"id":"6171901874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"heart ❤️been broke 💔 so many times ⏰ i i don’t 🤷\u200D♀️know what to believe 🙏","date":"2020-07-08T11:47:20Z","userName":"Shiiiioobdhakdjsnxksndnz","review":"I was just minding my business looking forward to seeing MY president obama (who i don't know his last name) to see an oompa loompa on mt screen?
