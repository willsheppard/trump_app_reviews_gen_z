With the app open my battery would go from 80% to around 15% within minutes. My phone has never done this before. All I have to say is no matter what you expect to gain from downloading this app, you won‚Äôt get it. You won‚Äôt be able to stay on the app long enough to see what you need. This app is worthless, if I could give less than 1 star I would."}},{"id":"6180198527","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Aboss0228","date":"2020-07-10T09:05:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"how abt...no?","review":"literally the worst app ever. It‚Äôs worse than google classroom. I hop on here for news and all I saw were disgusting pics of fake news outlets and I just don‚Äôt like the layout and the fact that my favorite app is going to be banned is NOT helping me with this"}}]}
