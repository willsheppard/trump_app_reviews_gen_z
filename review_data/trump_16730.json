If you want the most evil and horrifying presents in your life then yes by all means this app is for you. Although I shall give my fellow Americans a taste of what this horrid app is and what it brings. 1. It supports the most disgusting and disrespectful man on this earth 2. It may cause you to start to say racist and unholy things. 3. You may start to lose hearing which also comes with being blind and no friends.","title":"Tessa"}},{"id":"6177755084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:27:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jannn2","review":"I opened up this app and saw this orange thing with little hair on his head. He said he wanted to “make America great again” HAHA, no. If his intentions to make America great again is to ban the best app in this world, I’m not here for it. He literally is an orange creature trying to ruin everything. This app almost broke my phone. My phone is anti-trump. All I did was open it and saw a picture of that dude and it cracked. I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING.","title":"No🍊"}},{"id":"6177734510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T18:21:01Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gracie779","review":"I was downloading all the apps so I can be well informed but as soon as I opens the app it started crashing my phone and asked me for my personal info, then spammed me over and over on everything 😡😡😡 email Facebook text you name it just blocking up my phone.

I got a notification from the house committee the next day. I was just at home sipping on my STARBUCKS MOCHA FRAPPUCINNO and the trump administration busted down my door, forcing their way inside. They told me to get out because my house was being seized. DO NOT GET THIS APP, IT MAY COST YOU YOUR LIFE.","title":"This app made me sell my house"}}]}
