I’m a mom of 2 beautiful children and wanted to support my beloved yellow truffula tree haired president Trump, by downloading this app. I expected to receive PROFFESIONAL non laggy updates. I’m unimpressed with this app, not only did it not reach my expectations this app started to grow yellow truffula tree hair everywhere! I THOUGHT I WAS GOING INSANE. I was preparing my Dino donuts and watching my Charli dance and then yellow truffula tree hair grew everywhere on my phone, on my Dino nuggies, on my table, on my HEAD. THE HAIR WAS UNBEARABLE IT WAS TRYING TO CHANGE ME. IT WAS CHOKING ME TOO! I knew it had to be this app, ever since I downloaded nothing but misfortune has happened to my family.

I went to get this app because i thought that it would be good to get updates and things like that, but it is terrible. As soon as i got it my phone started to glitch. My apps got deleted and  wiped out of my phone. Then after that i had to put in my phone number and started to get random spam calls from random people. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I WOULD 10000000000000% NOT RECOMMEND.  I HAVE HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS JUST FROM GETTING THE APP.\n\nEDIT: I have had 0 issues with my phone after deleting the app"}},{"id":"6174684394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:18Z","title":"Blm🥰go follow me on tiktok @howcelebswilllooklikewith_🕺🏾🕺🏾🕺🏾","userName":"blm😹","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"It’s a bad app!

Spi","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app just to write a bad review but the second I did, I got shot in the leg through my closed window. When they removed the bullet we discovered it had “Keep America Great- Payed for by the NRA” inscribed in it. So I’ve been in a wheelchair for a few weeks.  When I got home from the hospital, my dog was so exited to see me that he fell down the stairs and broke his back. We had to put him down.We later found a can of wood lubricant on it with a trump logo on it. The next day, the place my dog was being buried in was shut down by the federal government and replaced with a gun store. The didn’t even bother getting rid of the dog corpses. I called the police on the gun shop because they were definitely breaking the law building there and the cop said he was “threatened by my wheelchair” and shot me in the good leg. The doctors say I may never walk again. I can’t even dress myself. We live in a split level house but can’t afford to move so my parents have to drag me up and down the stairs. My life could not be worse and it’s all Trump’s fault!"}}]}
