I had her drink some tea but then she ate a pizza and that just made things worse. Also I had planned on fighting for a championship and I got in crash so that didn’t happen and the fact that he chose her over me is just unbelievable I mean like are you serious? Anyway I went to Subway for a sub but you would never guess who was there MICHEAL JACKSON I was in shock I was in tears almost I said I thought you were dead and he just disappeared before my eyes like he went poof so I walked home sad cause I couldn’t get a “hehe” from him. But back to what I was talking about my dog so she died RIP❤️ gone but never forgotten so that is why this is the worst app in the world PLEASE do not waste your time on it.","userName":"micheal jackson jr","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:54:01Z","title":"PLEASE DO NOT GET THIS APP ITS HORRIBLE","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174572743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all I just hate the fact that this app is about trump. The worst president in history. He has done nothing good for America. All he did was make it worse. He has took many children away from family’s and lock them up in these camps. I have never been in one but I am sure that the children are having the worst times of there life. But I am sure it’s not just children. Another reason trump is not a good president is because he is a coward and a coward + president= Bad very bad. All he is doing is hiding in his bunker like a scaredy-cat. Anyways I am not going to argue because there are of more reasons that trump is a bad president. And one last thing.....I don’t feel bad writing this comment and all of you trump supporters can ✨𝑠ℎ𝑢𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑢𝑐𝑘 𝑢𝑝 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑘𝑖𝑠𝑠 𝑚𝑦 𝑎𝑠𝑠✨ goodbye ☺️","userName":"aricuteipie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:00:29Z","title":"I absolutely hate it","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174537119","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened this app to see a very cheesy Cheeto and my 3 and 5 and 1 year old cousins where behind me at the time looking down on my phone after they saw him working out the started to cry 👁👄👁.After that I my eyes started to bleed from pain and ugliness of him an ugh 🤯. I have told many people to see the app and the same thing had happened to them next my dinosaur came back with the milk before my dad did👍. Then I went to my kitchen to see my microwave and pizza rolls have gone missing and next was just painful I found out that TikTok was getting band for what you can’t take the pain of gen Z trump is that why huh😑. Then I bought 2 FREE tickets to the trump rally but I can’t go because I have to water my pool and feed my dinosaur that can fly. So if you want go get 2 FREE tickets.","userName":"Ben Dover 👁👄👁","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:50:09Z","title":"#saveTikTok","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174472185","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Me and my husband shrek decided to download this app to hear news about our favorite Cheeto president and let me say it was a huge mistake. I do NOT consider news to be naked pictures of our favorite orange cheese puff, the only naked pictures I would like to see are of my husband as it is not a sin in the eyes of our lord and savior Gabbie Hanna. Not to mention the app has hacked into my phone changed my home and lock screen to be more nakey pictures of mr cheeto president, my camera roll is also filled with these horrendous photos AND videos. And on top of this my family (including my favorite daughter kaitlyn bennett) have been possessed. These things have lead me to sadly say I will be voting for Charli D’Amelio in this years upcoming presidential election. PLEASE fix these minor bugs and I will reconsider my vote!!","userName":"shrek is daddy 🥴🍆💦😩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:58Z","title":"It’s a no from me","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174437096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was told to download this app due to my uncle suggesting it. I’m fairly new to politics so I didn’t know what to expect. So, I downloaded the app. Next, my dog and I settled down for some quality content. As soon as I opened the app, a large photo of the president showed up and my dog quite literally vomited all over my sheets after she watched me open the app. I am assuming it startled her to the point of retching. Due to myself having emetophobia, it caused me to get sick also. I just assumed it was best for me to delete the app. I am now more politically educated and I know this app is not for me. Never downloading it again out of concern for my health mentally and physically. I am now waiting for Bernie to make an app because he is my savior. Sorry I don’t recommended this app to anyone else.","userName":"Agarno","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:21:20Z","title":"Quite Literally Traumatizing","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174425835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The INSTANT I opened this app I am confronted with carrot lookin peen it’s DISGUSTING 🤢 but apparently it’s the president’s peen??🤔 anyway so I try to delete the app but then it calls me a dumb little homo, which I know but hey. THEN a whoooole bunch of conservative white men broke into my house and started trying to chat me up and I’m like ew no I’m an underage lesbian 🤚but then they start talking about how they’ll “turn me straight”???? 😷At that point i realize they’re from the app and also neo-nazis. I distracted them by saying that there was an immigrant down the street ( they TOTALLY fell for it) but now I got to burn my house down. I should have punched them while I had the chance but I guess my life was in danger and I wasn’t thinking 😖.This app left me homeless 😡 I would rate ZERO out of five but I have to give at least one star.","userName":"liverlogan","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:17:57Z","title":"DONT GET THIS POOPOO APP 🤮","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174420658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"BE VERY, VERY CAUTIOUS OF THIS APP😰.

I- mean president. So as any other supporter would do I downloaded this app. As soon as it had finished downloading Apple gave me alert of a virus had been detected!! I really didn’t think much of it because my president wouldn’t so this to his supporters right? And hunny..that was where I was wrong. Excessive app crashing occurred as well as unexplained phone bill increases and overheating THATS WHERE U GOT ME MESSED UP! This app took control of my whole device!! I had to get a new iPhone which costed money out of my pocket!! Not to mention I am unemployed, this caused me to no longer be financially stable. I do not recommend this app it could ruin your life in the matter of seconds.","userName":"Angry former Trump supporter!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:24:07Z","title":"Do not download this malicious app!🧚🏻💖✨","isEdited":false}}]}
