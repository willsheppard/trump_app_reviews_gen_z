Well first of all, how can you use such a POOR design for your app? This is a child’s work, and it hurt my eyes. All the ads are ridiculous. I thought the government had enough money to go ad-less? Or do they need even more money from their unemployed citizens? I’ve also noticed grammar mistakes, like huh? That’s so stupid. Why do I need to pay my money that I barely have to one of the richest people in the world? I was a trump supporter but this app alone just made me realize how bad of a president he is. I’ve never been SO disappointed in my life 😞 I’m going to delete this app and, oh boy, I cannot believe I’m saying it, but... give my vote to the democrats. As a web designer I just can’t ignore such a disrespect to my profession. I tried to keep supporting Trump, but if he can’t support web design, is he really a good president? The worst app I’ve ever seen. 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"userName":"Jbhyt","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173624908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Please get this off the Apple store","date":"2020-07-08T20:29:16Z","review":"This is my review;\n\nfor some odd reason it asked me to enter my credit card information and social security number, and so i did, because it’s just an app, what would happen? afterwards putting it in, in exactly 2 minutes, my bank called me and asked me about suffrage charges. i tired to get me in my back account but it wouldn’t let me in, i tired to stop it but i couldn’t do anything. my bank app kept getting notifications of my bank draining out my money. soon enough my bank account got me locked out, this all happened in a matter of 10 minutes. when after this happened police showed up my door and arrested for unknown reasoning, i couldn’t contact anyone, and now i have a lawsuit against me that my lawyer can’t get through. it all started with this app, i cant believe our president would do this to me.","rating":1,"userName":"Mr.Willow","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173571563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:26Z","review":"I want to start off by saying I thought this app would change my life but I almost died . I’m a minority and all I wanted was white privilege and I thought downloading this app would do that for me but I was WRONG . As soon as the app was downloading my whole phone started attacking and saying they were gonna call ICE on me . And in that moment I realized it was a scam . I tried to run but my house was Booby trapped and all I could hear is the president saying his going to build a wall again . Tiny orange head army of people came they took my family and my fish . They even took my bf who is white just cause he was around me a person who is not white . I don’t know what to do I’ve been locked in my House for days watching the orange men outside my window . All I wanted was white privilege .. oh and also the app is very slow and won’t ever open so I can’t delete it .

I went into the app and the buttons and links did not even work. It was so glitchy and laggy. It would make my phone turn off. It actual deleted a couple of stuff on my phone and gave me a virus. I had to call Apple to help and they said they couldn’t do anything. Now I’m stuck with a glitchy phone. I’m so sure that the government is taking out info and this is just a gateway for them to look at our text messages and etc. Also the amount of ads were horrible you couldn’t even click on anything with out a trump add coming up. One of the worst apps and I do not recommend you download it. As a trump supporter I’m no longer voting for him because he only wants to make profit and presidents aren’t supposed to be making apps like they are some celebrity. PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.","rating":1,"userName":"Danikqjdksnwkskzb","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173053685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app broke my phone","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:50Z","review":"I got the app see what everyone was talking about the app took 9 hours to download and I could not use it at all during the process. Once the app finally finished and I opened the app it started glitching like crazy and causing my phone to vibrate like crazy and it really scared me, and on top of all that it was blaring a super loud ringing noise. I think this app brought a virus to my phone. My phone keep glitching and ringing for almost the whole day and I could not get it to stop I could not even shut off my phone because it would no let me do anything else. My phone started to over heat one crazy and became to hot to hold in my hands. It finally stopped but my phone went off and I could not get it turned on and charging it would not help. I had to go get my phone fixed and it cost me $760😡. Don’t get this app it will brake your phone.","rating":1,"userName":"saige oswin","isEdited":false}}]}
