I downloaded this app to support our wonderful, sprayed tanned president, but was quickly disgusted by what I saw. It all started when I downloaded the app. It took over a WEEK AND A HALF to download, through which it restarted many times, but I was fine with it because Trump can’t get anything right. When I eventually opened the app, it crashed several times before it could even load. On the home page, I was greeted immediately with pop-up ads selling suspiciously cheap spray tan and old, blonde wigs that looked like they had been left in an attic for decades. I tried to close out of them and go deeper into the app, but they kept popping up every time I closed them until they covered my entire screen. I gave in to the pressure and added a wig and spray tan kit to my cart. While the kit was only 9.99, the wig came to over 500 DOLLARS. I was shocked, but I had to support our president so I bought them. After I entered my card info and confirmed the order the app crashed again. I decided to wait an hour or so before opening it again. During that time my phone started getting many notifications, causing me to see that my credit card info had been stolen and someone was going on a shopping spree with it. I opened my bank app to see multiple large withdrawals of money, spent on various expenses. Many were to different pro life and racist organizations. I quickly called my bank to shut down the card but was met with an avid Trump supporter on the other line. He told me that if I shut my card down he would kidnap my entire family. I looked over to them, as they were sitting on the couch. I walked over to them only to reveal that they had been replaced with mannequins. I asked him where they were and he replied by saying that their safe and will be in touch soon. As he hung up, my phone exploded into a million pieces which started my house on fire. I continue to look for my family, a week later. I’m now homeless and using the phone at an Apple store to type this as warning to never download this app, as it will destroy your entire life.\nBtw, I never received my spray tan kit or wig.","title":"Do NOT download this app🤬🤮🤭","userName":"SoullessCarbon","date":"2020-07-08T20:38:26Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
