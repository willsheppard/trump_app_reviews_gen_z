I usually never leave reviews, but this app has forced my hand. The app itself was so complicated and difficult to use, not to mention the horrendous things I have witnessed while on the application. I implore Apple to take down this app immediately and for the person responsible for this app, who appears to be Donald Trump, to undergo some serious self-reflection. Sad!"}},{"id":"6179972353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NOT MY WIFE!!","userName":"Dissa Pointmount","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T07:43:07Z","review":"THIS APP STOLE MY WIFE!!!!
