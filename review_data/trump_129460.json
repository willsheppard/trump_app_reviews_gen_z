As an American I downloaded this app to see what my “president” was doing. When i opened the app, it asked me for my phone number! Odd, but I did it. A few minutes later I got a message. I saw it said official trump 2020 message. When I opened it I was shocked! There was a picture of him, in the bath, full of Cheetos, with his butt sticking out. I then got another message saying “Lookin for young women to send me some pics. Is that you?” I was disgusted. I sent a message back saying “do you even know who your sending these to?” About 30 minutes later after I got done “bleaching” my eyes. I got another text. It read “well I can see a hot and beautiful lady through your camera.” I dropped my phone reading that. I ran got some tape and a piece of paper. I covered both cameras with it. then texted “I’m a minor, and your old enough to be a grandpa!” He responded with “That doesn’t have to stop us.” He then sent a picture of him putting on spray tan. The can said “Cheeto orange”. The only good part about this photo was that the picture cut off before I saw his you know what. I had then said “I don’t even live in Washington DC!” Then “Not that I want to or anything.” But that’s not the end of it, oh no, he said “You know yo want to. 🥴” “Besides you could always send me pictures.” Before I could respond, he had sent me one. It was a close up of his butt. I said “That’s disgusting! I would never send you anything!” He then said “I could send you $100?” That repulsive orange tried to bribe me! I then deleted the app. Although, now thinking about it, he still has my number which is scary. Also, he admitted to spying on us through our cameras. Don’t get this app it’s a trap!!! 😳💀💀💀","rating":1}},{"id":"6175295277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Freaking dang those poopy fake children","isEdited":false,"userName":"Snoop Doggy Dogg Lion Leopard","date":"2020-07-09T05:49:19Z","review":"I honestly feel bad for trumps kids I mean having a Cheeto for a father isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Also pore Milanya she has to wake up to see that face every morning. I also am very mad because this app stole my entire life savings (32¢) and made me a satin worshiper. I really just wanted to catch up with my old high school bully but it turns out she died and was reincarnated as this idiot. And you know what the worst part is... THEY STOLE MY PET TURQUOISE PLATYPUS. No his name is not Rupert it’s Perry I don’t follow the band wagon. So Perry has been missing for a while and I really miss him so mister Trump\nCan you please return him my number is (382)-584-3267 \nThank you ☺️😌🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1}},{"id":"6175293887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"rash ass girl 😔🕴🏼","date":"2020-07-09T05:48:46Z","review":"my life was fine until I decided to download this app so I downloaded the app on my phone which my phone downloaded. I downloaded the app b/c the orange guy (cheese puff) from the corner of the park from the zoo to my left told me to download it. He said if I didn’t he would cut my fingers and sell them to some cats down the street, so I did. Keep in mind my ice cream was in the oven to in my basement were I keep my 🌸🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨hostages 🌸🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨aka my besties. So once I got home I downloaded the app.. but... my ass... it started to itch... so bad... I kept scratching until I pooped my pants... it was is embarrassing b/c my cats were watching me. So I took a shower, once I got out I saw a cockroach... I’ve never had any cockroach’s before, so the app brought them here. I quickly changed to realize the my whole kitchen was robbed 😔 i was so sad... plz don’t listen to the president cheese puff. It’s not worth a rash on the ass. Plz one star review makes one dollar donation to buy some ass rash lotion 😢 I don’t deserve this 😔🥺 #justiceforrats","rating":1}},{"id":"6175293452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TAKE THIS APP DOWN","isEdited":false,"userName":"actual trash dump","date":"2020-07-09T05:48:36Z","review":"I downloaded this app to get updates on merica’s little bunker boy, as one does.

He was squealing and saying dumb things while bathing in poop and mud 🤢🤢. Not only that that but my pet bird 🐥 started crying from hearing so much that he said his first words to me: “please stop.” When I try to get out of the app a message came through and said to donate a picture of my feet to Trump 🦶 🤮. I was so horrified by this message that I had to tell my pet bird to delete it for me because I couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t do it either and we cried for hours until my dog came to the rescue and deleted the app.   This app traumatized my dog so much when he tried to delete it, I don’t know what he saw but he’s not the same anymore.
