In addition to the major glitch a group of ten genetically modified orange elephants, (which I assume represented our president) came and trampled my house leaving it a pile of debris. They also burned my dogs over a campfire and then used their trunks to spread my dogs ashes over the remains of my house. I then decided to delete the app and while my house and dogs could not be repaired the glitches in my phone returned to normal, but overall I recommend not downloading the app from the beginning unless you wan the same fate as me. To sum up the whole experience I will give it a one star.","date":"2020-07-09T07:00:25Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"lovetheappbutsmh"}},{"id":"6175460507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE please save yourself and don’t download","review":"Upon downloading this app, it forced me to agree to receive phone calls, and soon I was barraged with spam calls. After about 40 of these calls I had a wringing headache and I blacked out. My dear husband told me that while I was in my possessed stupor, I began making him sandwiches and revoked my own right to vote. The side effects from this episode are still ongoing, I keep blurting TRUMP 2020 against my will every time someone tries to argue with me, my skin has turned a sickening shade of orange, and I can’t stop grabbing my women friends by the....yeah that. \nAnyways, I consulted my doctor and they said the only way I can begin to reverse the effects is to blast FDT by YG and Nipsey Hussle,on full volume 24 hours a day, for the foreseeable future.\nEven then it’s not a guarantee that I will fully recover \nAnyways 1 Star, I do not recommend this all","date":"2020-07-09T06:53:02Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Funny critic"}},{"id":"6174685135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Thanks Donald. Now my rats are gone.","review":"I downloaded this app because I tOtAlLy SuPpOrT tRuMp and I wanted to see what it was all about. Once I opened it, I was told that I could no longer see my three pet rats: goose, milky, and toes, ever again. I began to grow upset and question why my rats were being taken from me. I then realized that when I was younger I loved Obama. I was never into politics, but just the sight of him and from what my family said about him, he was a great man. I guess Donald didn’t like that. I don’t know how he found out, but he did. The next day, I see the man himself show up at my front door step. He kicks me out of his way, stomps on me, and proceeds to talk in another language that sounds like rat language. He was dressed in a rat outfit and while I was on the floor, he grabbed Goose, Milky and toes and climbed up the chimney. I never saw my rats again. Rip little guys🥺","date":"2020-07-09T02:32:31Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Emmaeliz4"}},{"id":"6175354707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"As soon as i downloaded the app it started asking me very personal questions like what my ethnicity was. when i answered that i am Mexican it took over my phone and my screen started overflowing with notifications saying that i was to be deported!!! i tried to restart my phone but when it turned back on i was shocked to discover that both my wallpapers were now pictures of the screaming carrot demon!! i was shocked and tried to contact people to help me, but they just said that my problems were “fake news” and then hung up on me!! finally i turned to twitter to maybe receive some help from tangerine tornado himself, but it seemed that he was too busy speaking about the chinese virus to notice me!! i assume that was probably because of his severe dementia, what a poor cheeto😔","date":"2020-07-09T06:11:53Z","rating":2,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😔✌️𝑛𝑜✨"}},{"id":"6174589581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I am outraged ❗️😡🤬(Killed my pet cheetoana)","review":"So for background info my name is con yay west and Im 125 years young. When I downloaded this app I was just sitting with my pet Cheeto and she started reciting “make America great again” then a circle of fire formed around her and she started floating and was wearing a red robe. Then my pet Cheeto tried to sacrifice me and said it was for the trump administration. I was so scared then I opened the app and saw a rare Oompa Loompa Bimbo breed of Cheeto in a suit. These Cheetos are evil and cause occult ritual actions in other Cheetos. I deleted the app and my pet Cheeto fell on the floor and started shaking then she fell through the 7 floors in my apartment. She was fine until some random person in a red cloak who all I could see was orange stepped on her. Rip cheetoana 😣. In summary don’t download this app unless you want your pet Cheeto to become possessed and die.  I am very upset and disappointed in this app.","date":"2020-07-09T02:05:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"panda 0&8877"}},{"id":"6174556636","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK","review":"I downloaded this app with the intention of keeping fully up to date on our lord and savior Donald J. Trump, but I was UNPREPARED. When you agree to receive push notifications from Trump 2020, no one tells you exactly what that means. Don’t get me wrong, I love our carrot-kissed king with a passion, but I DID NOT expect to be immediately greeted by him when I awakened the next morning. Apparently he had sat on my bed and watched me sleep, waiting to tell me about the tweet he had sent out as soon as I woke up 😵 Now he won’t leave! I would have thought the president had better things to do, but he hasn’t left my side since I turned on notifications, despite my insisting that I don’t need him physically here to stay updated. I can’t even shower without him waiting patiently outside of the curtain for my return. Definitely a bug that needs to be fixed.","date":"2020-07-09T01:55:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"KarissaArtista"}},{"id":"6174452082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I suddenly became orangephobic hating on orange people became part of my lifestyle","review":"I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage\nLeft to the right\nWe gon' make it, make it bang\nPut your hands in the air\nLet me see you bounce\nTo the left, to the right\n시작되는 round\n'Cause when we jumping and popping\nWe jopping\nJopping\nJopping\nJopping\nYou know how we get down (jopping)\nHow we get down (jopping)\nHow we get down 'cause when we jumping and popping\nWe jopping\nStep on the floor (start a riot)\nWhere the competition man, it's looking one-sided\nUp like a seven forty seven, we the flyest\nA lifestyle you should try it\nSo 시작해, make it last\nFront to back yeah, yeah (give me that, give me that, give me that)\nThe roof's on fire, let it burn to an ash\nWe gon' keep it jopping, tell the DJ bring it back, uh\n날아봐 like a para-glide\n나타나 in a pair of slides\n떠나자 out to paradise\n건배해 to a better life\nGotta move, watch the money monsoon\nMake the crowd go wild in a small room (yeah)\nLet me see you put it all on like a costume\n어디까지 번져갈지 몰라\nWe love to move it, keep it going, don't stop\nIt's in your nature\n말해 girl what you want\n춤을 춰봐 We go on and on\nChampagne life, that's all you want\nDon't stop letting it go 'cause we got that glow\nYou know how we get down (jopping)\nHow we get down (jopping)\nHow we get down 'cause when we jumping and popping\nWe jopping","date":"2020-07-09T01:25:55Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"unculturedwren"}},{"id":"6174430436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"scary chetto","review":"0/10 wouldn’t recommend this app as so as i opened the app i saw horrifying pictures of the HUGe chetto 🦧 it terrifies me to even think about the picture and worst part is the chetto was talking about all this weird stuff but when he talked he sounded like a robot 🤖 then weird things started happening like my phone disappeared into thin air 🤯 i’m certainly writing this on my nintendo DS 👾and after my phone disappeared i had no other chose then to go to sleep i woke up surrounded by chettos several chettos it was so terrifying and they weren’t moving it was just a full on chetto yk those puffy ones so then i go to the kitchen to get some food only to find out my kitchen isn’t even there only thing there was a peanut witch is really rude because i’m allergic and so i go back to my room and decide to eat the huge chettos wouldn’t recommend taste like 💩🚮.","date":"2020-07-09T01:19:21Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"digusting chetto"}},{"id":"6174306434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"trash❤️👼🏼✨","review":"i downloaded this app to support our wonderful, loving, caring, smart and most of all ✨inspirational✨ president. as soon as i opened it, it asked for my phone number, email and address. me being me, i thought nothing of it, and filled out the form, as i want to do everything in my power to support the president🥰. however, the next morning, i was woken up to awfully loud helicopter sounds above my house. not only did it wake up my entire neighborhood, but it caused the old woman who lives next to me to go deaf😔. i ran outside as i saw the helicopter land in the street. an overwhelming orange and obese cheeto in a suit stepped out. at first i was confused but i quickly came to realize that it was trumpie😍 followed by all of the troompa loompas. i was so surprised to see him out of his bunker. he walked up to me and threatened to yeet me into the nile river if i didn’t vote for him. i laughed in his face and then he drop kicked my dog all the way to china😝!! he proceeded to tell me that he hoped my dog and my entire family would get the virus, but it wouldn’t be his fault, as china started it. in conclusion, if i could give this app a 0/5 star review i would. but instead i’m giving it a 1/5, and a detailed essay on my experience, for the better of the people. amen.","date":"2020-07-09T00:39:47Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"xoxo, melania trump"}},{"id":"6174137496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I can’t believe this happened UwU (True story👁👄👁)","review":"It all started one week ago, being a loyal student to my school was...late to school. I quickly sprang out of bed, with my slice of toast.🍞 Quickly running down the street to get to school. As I entered my class room my incredibly hot teacher 🥵Mr. Trump🍊 (that prefers to be called Cheeto puff) glared at me. “why are you late y/n” he asked. I stuttered “S-s-s-s-s-s-sorry sir”👌 as I sat down. “Fake news” he yelled “you were late because of ChIna”🤬. I cried the whole period from Senpai Trump yelling at me😢. Before class ended he called me up to the front desk at the end of the class. “So, y/n. Why were you actually late.” He asked, leaning in. His breath smelled of hawt cream cheese🥯. “M-m-m-my cat died sir”🐱 I cried. He started laughing in my face “It’s chinas doing” Then he exploded from too much cream cheese. He died that day. ⚡️🧚🏻🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨0/10 app, don’t recommend 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨🧚🏻","date":"2020-07-08T23:39:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"RoseabellaBear9"}}]}
