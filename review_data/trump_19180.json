Why advertise the dang app with such \"high quality\" when it's nothing but a piece of garbage , The Apple Store and other app stores should be ashamed of this app. I mean how else was am I supposed to pay my respects to the great all-mighty orange Oompa Loompa👁👄👁\noh well time to go onto Instagram and see if I could pay my respects there. Anyway In conclusion, this app is absouloute trash and not worth anyones time. \n\n✨I🦋expected🤯better😌from👓our🎒racist💋,🌈dishonest🎓,🦎sexist👄,👲perverted✊🏿,🧢orange💍man🧚\u200D♂️known🧚🏿\u200D♀️as🥳the😍president🤢\n\n- from a pansexual millennial \n\n🖕🖕🏿🖕🏾🖕🏽🖕🏼🖕🏻"}},{"id":"6173400771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:12:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"glitchy","userName":"trump 2020 👁👄👁","review":"This app is really one of the worst apps i’ve ever used.
