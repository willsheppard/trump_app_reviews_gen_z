He said, in a deep daemon-like voice, “thank you for swearing legion to the dark souls!” And I was like woah that’s weird, but I opened the app anyway. It flashed on its terms of service, but it went to the I Accept so fast, I couldn’t read what was on it. Next thing I knew, a daemon with the orangest skin ever, and blond hair, wearing a robe with the face of a fat pig, appeared next to me. I tried to scream, but  my voice was taken from me. He said “Your home and voice and soul and life is now mine. Thank you for your contribution.” He is now treating my house like a pigsty, throwing plates and glasses everywhere, tearing up my sheets and peeing on my couch and bed😡 He has also released many a singing mice that sang this tune that haunts me into the wee hours of the night...shawty’s👩like a melody🎶 in my head🧠... luckily by the second day of them infesting my house, they only play that in the evening and night. I am awoken to this other tune that they play in the mornings: remember🧠the times⏰ we had😔the times⌛️ that you👩 and me👶 had😣...but by around noon, they switch to doing some slam poetry, one poem to be specific: i climbed🧗 out of my head👤 and watched👁 myself implode💥 a thought🧠 without a body❌🚶\u200D♀️ought to be the shot🤕to take a load off🧳...They dance around my house, singing these tunes and reciting this poem, hundreds of them. I haven’t tried rat traps and cages because they’re inhumane, even though the great Cheeto man locks children in them. I came to the conclusion that I must banish the daemon, and he will bring the rats with him. I have tried many a ritual to rid them of my house, but none have worked😡😣 I know it’s an irresistible thing, to support this god of a man, but please. I beg of you. Please do not download this app. This pig-daemon has ruined my life. He ate my family. He destroyed my home. He devours all of my food. Please, it is not worth the risk😔😔 I would sooner go to a BLM rally before I recommend this app to anyone🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 STAY AWAY FROM IT!!!"}},{"id":"6179538800","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad and am now crying 😢😢🌈👄","userName":"sophia ttttt","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:04:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app hacked my phone 📲, spam called me 🤮🤮 and stole all of my information‼️trump then mass texted everyone on my phone that i had a poop fetish 😡🤬‼️ why would he do that??????????!!!!! how does he know that 🤔🤔😱?? so weird 😛!!
