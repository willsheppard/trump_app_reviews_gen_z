And every time I opened it it gave me a blank screen and then opened again. It did this several times with or without being on my hotspot/WiFi. Truly disappointed. When it finally did work, there were still problems accessing certain things, Honestly it was a huge waste of time and was not worth it. I would not recommend ever using this app and if you are seeing this review and you are thinking about using it! DONT I promise you it isn’t worth the time of day. Would most definitely give this app 0 scars if possible ✌️","date":"2020-07-09T09:54:05Z","userName":"Arrianna Christian","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175962986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App 😳","review":"First the app took 30 minutes to download, i have amazing internet that could download a 70 GB game in 5 minutes and it still couldn’t even handle this app. my phone then became extremely hot to the touch and i had to put it in the freezer to cool down. finally when i open the app to read more about the elections it instantly crashed. i then came to notice that every app, picture and all my data on my phone has been completely wiped off my phone. my phone now can’t download apps or take pictures. and it makes this terrible noise when i try to charge it. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! 😠🖕","date":"2020-07-09T09:50:17Z","userName":"SchoolHaterz666","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175911120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Hate this app!","review":"If I could write this app zero stars I would. First of all, this app takes up too much storage space and I actually have a good mobile plan. Secondly, there were so much bugs and glitches which made the app hard to navigate. Third of all, there were so many ads and I felt like I could click anything without there being an ad.🙄Lastly, this app gave my phone a virus so bad, I had to download a VPN and the VPN didn’t work. Unfortunately, I had to go buy a new IPhone 11 Pro Max and I am holding up well without the app. The developers better fix this before I vote Biden 2020.🙄DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP OR YOU WILL HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS‼️","date":"2020-07-09T09:33:07Z","userName":"tortillapotato","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175880215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed 😔","review":"I downloaded the app and it would not let me in my WiFi was working perfectly on my other device I rebooted my WiFi and still no answer finally after 2 hours it let me in when I got it I didn’t work it closed immediately now keep in mind the phone I’m using was in perfect condition my other apps were working fine but for some reason this one didn’t when it finally let me in I put my backup email and it logged me out of it I don’t know why I tried logging back in and it wouldn’t work I need this app removed I don’t want this to happen to others ❤️\n\nSincerely, Me","date":"2020-07-09T09:22:39Z","userName":"Princess not hateR","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175410275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE😳🤢.                         trump has a small pp -pornhub","review":"the minute ⏰ i opened the app📱it was a picture of an orange protesting “All lives matter” following up with a 12 minute slideshow of the orange 🍊 saying the N-word😡absolutely TERRIBLE this app deserves to be banned from the country.

I tried to open it and it opened up a portal to another dimension in my basement and now I am housing multiple alien species in my house and none of them have any manners! The halolowfollicusses stole my couch and have made it into a lakdakmakmak- I have never been so appalled, but it gets worse- the gadmedallions stole my nose and won’t give it back now I have to use a heedmedeedeed as a fake nose (it looks actually quite realistic,) but that doesn’t matter! I still can’t taste or smell anything- and I’m a scented candle enthusiast! These are just two of the problems I’ve had with the world of pain this app has caused me.

DELETE >:00","review":"This app is so glitchy , too many ads, and there’s literally NO president there it just Keeps talking about Cheetos and showing pictures of Cheetos . Enough is enough \nWhen I opened the app, it kept asking me if I was African American or Mexican. If I was Mexican he’s going to deport me.\nIf I was African American, which I clicked yes, it showed a video of a man yelling “WHITE POWER” and took me out of the app. \nlike WOW . Horrendous customer service , lies about Cheetos , and threatening to deport people ?? And there’s too many talks about the “Chinese virus “ . Like I didn’t know viruses now spoke different languages?!? this deserves to be taken down!!! 😡😡 ALL CHEETOS MATTER, BUT NOT THIS ONE!  🤬✊✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","date":"2020-07-09T03:53:38Z","userName":"Real Review and honest answer","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174924753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App","review":"I downloaded this app to get real news on my president 🇺🇸 but it doesn’t work at all! Every time I opened it, my battery dropped to 5% or lower! This has never happened, and my iPhone is only 2 months old! I brought it to my nephew because he is a software engineer. He said it must be the app’s fault! I am so disappointed because I love the president and just want to know what he’s doing and planning. When I plugged in my phone to browse the app and keep my iPhone alive, I was unable to press any of the buttons. It is a poorly made website. My husband downloaded the app and had the same problems. So sad!","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:02Z","userName":"I don't want no scrubs","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
