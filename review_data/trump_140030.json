Ryan","review":"I downloaded the app and the first thing it does ask to send notifications. What if I’m out and someone sees that I’m getting notifications from a trump app! All my friends are gone! And THEN... it asks for my phone number to send me messages. I can’t have trump sending me personal messages. I’m all in for keeping American gear again but I can risk my fragile white ego and being exposed like that! The Trump 2020 campaign has a lot of work to do."}},{"id":"6179547823","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Dumpster Fire","date":"2020-07-10T05:07:04Z","userName":"together we can.","review":"So bad.

My phone started talking when I opened the app and it called me a jr cheese burger. Then I started getting hungry so I went to Wendy’s for a jr cheeseburger. When I got there the app talked and called the cashier a McDonald’s sandwich. They ended up throwing my food out in the trash😭 I could of got sum food if it wasn’t for this app."}},{"id":"6179547563","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"yeah no ❤️","date":"2020-07-10T05:06:59Z","userName":"I love fishin","review":"I tried downloading this app 666 days ago on 4:20 on the 69th Sunday in ordinary time, and it has FINALLY downloaded.

Once I opened the app I was immediately meet by a mini trump and donkey from shrek😳. Little did I know that mini trump came out of the screen and did a full 350 back-kick slam on my face while holding a baguette, he then chased me while asking if I wanted some candy, clearly I didn’t want any dang candy😋. This went on for hours. He then proceeded to tell donkey to fling me out of the earths atmosphere😵. I went flying out with some bruises and 2nd degrees burns because of exiting the earths atmosphere. I then landed on Mars. I meet some aliens and soon became friends with them👽. We played cards for a while and discussed our childhood traumas, it was a truly one of the most bonding experiences of my life😌. Unfortunately, they had to leave because they needed to invade the planet Pluto. Soon after I saw a small space coming toward my direction. I thought I was finally saved! Turned out that mini trump and donkey came to terrorize me once again👴🏼. Except they came with some other new little friends...the Teletubbies🚨. My nightmares have truly become a reality. They all started chasing me asking if I wanted candy while wearing silver armor and riding horses. We went to battle but of course I had the powers of both anime and God on my side🙈. I stole the ship and made it back to earth. Ever since that experience I have now decided to delete the app. I now have PTSD and been going to a therapist. But nothing will be able to stop me hearing the same sentence every night... “do you want some candy?”"}}]}
