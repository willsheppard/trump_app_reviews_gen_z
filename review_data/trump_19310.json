As soon as I downloaded the app my phone went black and a little Trump bobble head with huge hands popped up on my screen and continued to say all of my private info on my phone threatening to leak it if I didn’t vote for trump. I would never! How dare a president behave this way.

I came here from tiktok. If you vote for him again your a white supremacists, he doesn’t deserve to be in office let alone deserve to live. When Ariana said keep breathing🤩😍✨ she didn’t mean you😽💍✨ so take that advice and stop. And hopefully the Simpson’s don’t let us down for the first time.

I downloaded it trying to see what Donald trump is promising us and all of a sudden I see racist things on the app. So I quickly gasped and and had my eyes wide opened. I was completely flabbergasted. I couldn’t believe what I saw. Then on top of that I had to constantly get notifications on my iMessage about Trump.
