When I logged in I noticed in the corner of my phone next to the battery, my 4G symbol changed to 5G, DO NOT BE FOOLED MY FELLOW TRUMP SUPPORTERS, I think the Chinese have invaded this great app and are stealing our information. ONLY when I deleted the app, did the 5G symbol disappear. I’m changing all my passwords...

He is racist, sexist and homophobic, makes horrible choices for the us and the environment. He treats his son like garbage and when he is clearly depressed.

This app is a racist pig’s pen. Impossible to navigate, disgustingly disgusting, ugly, and horribly offensive. This app is a tragic movie directed by elementary students. Starts off horribly and ends horribly too. I don’t suggest downloading this app. It’s horrifying to an unprepared eye. Avoid this app at all times if you value your life. Run. Drop your device and RUN. Why are you still reading? I SAID RUN.","userName":"TheBellaBomb"}},{"id":"6174299153","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I LOVE TRUMP","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:37:21Z","rating":1,"review":"Trump is such an amazing person that I wonder how nobody has taken a shot at him yet. Like how? He’s such a good man at doing business that he is getting bullied by 10 year olds. I aspire to be the person who actually cares about the future of their country, like Bernie. Oh did I say I love trump? Haha no I meant that he can go shake his nonexistent hair towards a banana peel and hopefully his intelligent dementia takes over him","userName":"can aidhhsmslslshzxh"}}]}
