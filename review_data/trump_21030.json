It made my phone catch a virus and I know president trump would probably blame it on China again but it’s entirely his fault! This app made my phone glitch like crazy all of a sudden there was a big orange man on my phone screen. This app is not appropriate for children as it might brain wash them and scare them.

It took forever to download and install, it kept glitching and kicking me out of the app when all I wanted to do was give support to the good ole president of ‘Merica.
