I thought to myself for a moment “No way MY president would allow this on his app”, so I continued to scroll onward. \n It was a few minutes later, I had already nearly forgotten about the first incident, when yet ANOTHER pop up ad came about announcing “FREE feet pics ALL THE TIME!”. I was apalled. \n It didn’t end there, though! One after the other, more and more pop up ads for various kinds of... of p*rn kept coming onto my screen—no pun intended. \n I truly hope Donald thinks about his actions.","isEdited":false,"userName":"The pink crocodile","title":"Bug/Viruses?","date":"2020-07-08T23:06:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173992734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I know I want it\n입에 바른 소린 이제 그만할게\n'Cause I deserve it, deserve it\n혹시 잠깐 내가 미워지더라도 걱정 안 할게\n'Cause I know you, I know you\n내 눈을 자꾸 피해봐\n네 맘을 자꾸 숨겨봐\n나에게서 도망쳐봐 no no\n감았던 눈을 떴을 때\n문득 내가 떠오를 때\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more more more more more and more\n멈추기 싫어 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\nDo you feel me\n니가 날 위한 사람이라고 믿니\nOnly for me, only for me\n간지러운 말은 굳이 하지 않아도 넌\n'Cause you know me, you know me\n네 귀를 자꾸 막아도\n나를 멀리 밀어내도\n나에게서 멀어져도 (저 멀리) no no\n내가 다시 널 부르면\n나의 목소릴 들으면\nYou are gonna be mine again\nYeah 한 번 더\nYou're gonna say more more more more more and more\n멈추지 못해 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더 \nI wanna have more more more more more and more\n멈추기 싫어 more more more and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more\n그러니 한 번 더\n난 원래 욕심쟁이 몰랐다면 미안\n사과는 미리 할게 'cause I want you more more\n의견은 필요 없어 훔칠 거야 네 맘\n내게 홀리게 될걸 you can't say no no\n난 도둑고양이 오늘만은 널\n꼭 잡으러 왔으니까 딱 기다려 너 \n멀리 가지 말고 다시 내게 come come\nYeah 한 번 더\n멈추지를 못해\nMore and more \n그러니 한 번 더\n멈추기가 싫어\nMore and more","isEdited":false,"userName":"stantwice27","title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:31Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173962701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Before I downloaded this horrid app my life was perfectly normal btw... I was having a great day when I decided to download this app to get my daily dose of politics. As soon as I opened the app it asked me to confirm my location. I was a little confused but I still agreed. As soon as I pressed the button a big Cheeto man burst through my front door with 2 beefy men at his side💀 I was then dragged out of my own home and thrown into the back of a truck. It’s been 30 days in this stinky basement and I’m with some children the orange has also kidnapped. I am being forced to serve this creature Diet Coke and McDonalds. I would never get this app. It’s not funky nor fresh.✨🧚🏻0/10🧚🏻✨🍊","isEdited":false,"userName":"running for dear life","title":"no🙈😝❤️","date":"2020-07-08T22:34:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173942063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"anybody else’s phone crash every single time you open the app? and then once it finally loaded it asked you to do “challenges” and threatened to expose your information if you didn’t comply? anybody else asked for their social security number, address, names and numbers of any family members and your credit card information? reminds me a lot of the blue whale game that went around a few years ago! absolutely terrified, i cried for weeks for my family’s safety but the worst part was the picture of a nude man getting a spray tan with a croissant in between his legs that filled the background of the app. heartbreaking. do not download.","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur mom bruv","title":"Awful","date":"2020-07-08T22:26:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173939155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Wish I could rate less than 1 star. First, the app installed itself on my phone but then promised it would build a wall around my phone to keep other phones out. I’m not sure what that was supposed to mean. The app also promised to be the best app ever, better than anything from China. But then I found out that it’s just huge, and it’s also somehow friends with Russia? How does that help me? It promised 4 minutes of amazing app usage, but all I’ve seen is 3 and a half minutes of empty promises, slander, racism, and forcibly deleting other apps from my phone. I’m not sure it even has the authority to do that, but it did...

It took 69 hours to even download, and as soon as I even opened the app, it glitched to distorted pictures of the kings face edited on to monkey butts. Me and my whole family were greatly disturbed. Especially my poor Mimi and Pöo Pöo.\nThey were very upset to see the spray tan man being exploited for what he really is. This app also played awful music which lured many wild animals and bugs into my home and ate our house. Our house then collapsed and KILLED MIMI AND PÖO PÖO!!!! 😡😡😡😡 I simply cannot support a grandparent killer!! I expect Donald to pay for the sacrifice we will be offering at their funeral!
