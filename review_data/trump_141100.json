The information and news is full of lies! The rallies are NOT safe and are spreading coronavirus. This is supposedly a news app? It says “keep America great.” I don’t understand when America was great, when America committed genocide? Slavery? Jim Crow? They can’t be referring to now, when America is gassing and killing children at the border.","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"MarrMariiMarMari","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179454216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"From angry biiirrddd.","review":"guys i 100% do not recommend this app because when i installed it, it didn’t properly greet me to the red carpet 😡. i was expecting a phone call from Beyoncé on December 42nd after i drove my apartment building to the pool. instead, i got a expired gift card to Connecticut 😡😡. when i ate my shoes i walked to the clouds to meet my eyeliner ☺️. anyways, justice for breonna taylor, black lives matter, & most importantly, trump 2020 🥰🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️💖 on a gravestone 😍✨🧚\u200D♀️❤️. thank you taylor swift .","date":"2020-07-10T04:35:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"Randomsaucygurl200","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179454133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"yeah um no","review":"upon downloading, all became really glitchy! not worth it tbh.
