First of all when I downloaded the app all was well. Then 2 mins later my phone just straight up started to dry heave. So I gave it some water and crackers then 2 minutes later it threw up the water and crackers. Not knowing what to do I did the first thing that came to mind. I put it on the charger and then the charger started to throw up. Me having emetophobia🤢 I fainted. When I woke up I was tied to a chair in the dark with only one light shining in my face. I WAS BEING INTERROGATED BY MY PHONE AND CHARGER😤. They were asking questions like where I was when this app was downloaded on the phone. They told me that the dusty, old, stale, bug infested, nasty Cheeto had forced them to listen to Friday by Rebecca Black for however long the app was in the phone (it must’ve been about 2 days because that’s how long I was out for from the barfing) and I was in distrust. So now my phone and charger just died right in front of me. They are no longer with us. This app is in charge of the memorial fees. I plan to get 2 real gold caskets because that is what my beloveds deserve.

I sure am disappointed. As soon as I opened the app i saw a weird shaped cheeto staring at me with a hat that said “keep America Great” or something. Honestly I’m not really sure what it said because the image caused my vision to go blurry. Since my vision went blurry I put my phone down and walked into my kitchen where i tripped on my dog causing my head to hit the ground very hard. This caused me to here things. i heard things like “Trump 2020” this absolutely horrified me so i started to stab at my ears with a sharp kitchen knife. Than there were lots of oranges suddenly in my kitchen so i took a spoon and started digging at my eyes. My mom rushed me to the hospital where i had emergency surgery and they were able to save my sight and vision. They tried to diagnose me with schizophrenia but the i explained what happened and they said it all made perfect sense and released me from the hospital within the week. Don’t make the same mistake I made and download the app.","userName":"winnerwinnnerchikendinnner","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:46:28Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrid App"}},{"id":"6174433389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"He’s such a bad influence. First of all he says that Hispanics bring rapists,drugs etc. when he rapped teenage girls and still no one is talking about it. Second of all he’s trying to ban tik tok when he doesn’t have the rights to. He might be the president but, he doesn’t have the rights to take us teenagers our entertainments. 3rd of all bring Obama back or Michelle.O🥺❤️\n            {I gave the app the lowest rate because}\nHe should be voted to be a president on 2020 , he’s a racist,rapist,cruel father,he’s also afraid for people to know more about his son(personal),#savebarron2020 \n  {no one should be racist and making fun of people’s skin color because we are all the same no matter what race,color,etc but why are you praying to god and looking up to him if you are making fun of his people ,he wants all of us happy not making other people sad and also making them feel like they look different ,the only different one is you the racist one ,if you are really going to look up to god ,make him proud ,not upset because you are criticizing someone because of their skin color🙄} \n     0 stars🤢","userName":"@daniagzzzz","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"💀Deformed Cheeto💀"}},{"id":"6174256700","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"To be honest he probably puts the milk in before the cereal. But in all seriousness, the country is heavily divided right now, but the last thing we need is this “man” as our president. He has militarized the police against his own citizens, and refers to the protests for Black Lives Matter as being run by “thugs” when they are actually unarmed citizens executing their right to peacefully protest the deaths of countless innocent black people and trying to fight systemic racism until the police get violent first. However when ARMED people (as in people with weapons) protest the shutdown due to a pandemic, just because they didn’t want to wear a mask or wanted to get their hair done, he calls them “very good people”. He is forcing families in detention centers to PAY MONEY to be able to see their children again. Clearly this sends a message. He is racist. He is sexist. He is homophobic and transphobic. He is a fascist. He is unfit to run this country. He is trying to silence the outcry of his own people. I would say “this couldn’t possibly get any worse” but I really wouldn’t be surprised if it does..","userName":"snickerdoodle sandwich","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:22:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Would NOT recommend, even to my worst enemy"}},{"id":"6173717546","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is tragic.\nit’s laggy and offensive I almost got engulfed by flames of rage. if I could give it less than one star I would. It’s distasteful, obscene, and repugnant. The amount of dread and distress I went through browsing this app is ASTRONOMICAL. It is unquestionably sickening and treacherous. I’m having tremors in my pancreas because of the sheer atrocities it’s spewing, It is a health hazard to everyone. My life is so full of woe I feel this app has cursed me. I am bewitched by impending doom. I detest whoever created this monstrosity. the AMOUNT of DISRESPECT they possess is Haunting. I had to delete it instinctively otherwise I’d be incinerated. I need compensation for the trauma inflicted on me by this app, it is an utter disgrace and the shame can be felt into the past, present, future, light years away and through all existing time and space. I am currently aging prematurely and turning radioactive due to brain damage caused by the absurd calamities THRUSTED UPON ME. I’m having to hoist myself up from the depths of despair that  I have been deserted in with only the cacophonous noise of blithering serpents inhabiting this here app.\n\nSo yea anyways 0/10 don’t recommend.","userName":"i am monie","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:02:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute trash"}},{"id":"6173656517","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Hey guys I thought I’d come on here to tell y’all what happened after I got this app... I’m still in shock, I’m trying to move forward with life but after this app, I may end it😔 first things first, the second I downloaded it I got 52 notifications telling me to murder the family dog. It got to the point that the app was threatening me if I didn’t. I didn’t wanna be killed by the government so I decided I had to kill the family dog (it was a good thing I did, but I’ll explain that in a sec) next after I kill the dog I was getting notifications about having to kill my father again threatening notifications eventually I said I’m not doing this I deleted the app but it kept reappearing next thing you know the government is in my house killing my father ✨killing him slowly✨I was in so much mental pain all because of the stupid Donald Trump app. My only other issue with the app is that it actually legitimately makes your phone smell like crap it was awful my whole house smells like poo... permanently. FDT for all the hassle :( he owes me a dog and a father and some air freshener (lowkey a whole new house)","userName":"lizzy daley","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:40:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS MY LEAST FAVORITE EVER"}},{"id":"6173345537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Unfortunately most male politicians are old, stuffy, sexist, and have a few assault allegations but trump really sets the bar doesn’t he🥰 my best friends brother who was like family to me was on this app while on a boating trip with his friends and he fell overboard which resulted in him being feasted on by rabid seahorses. Luckily for you his family is understanding so they won’t be pressing charges but I think it’s safe to say that this app is a danger to society. I really do believe that all apps matter but unfortunately this one is just to threatening. Because of the fact that Donald trump is willfully sentencing people to their death  by launching this app I will not be voting for him and neither will any of my family members. It is just irresponsible of him to keep this app up for his white, country loving, all American, rapist, republican supporters who truly care about him. Before this accident my family and I also bought 30 tickets to one of his rallies which we will not be attending anymore. But hopefully he won’t notice because of all of the teenagers supporting him by buying his tickets💕💕💕","userName":"#fuckwhitesupremacy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:52:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gen-z for the win😙✌️"}},{"id":"6173048319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"for an app created for our magnificent president, its pretty low quality✨but if youre into supporting the ideals of fascism and systematic oppression/ racism, this app is just for you ! sorry, got off track - anyways when i was downloading it, my phone started to glitch and the Central Park Five Case appeared on my screen ! i guess it was a warning sign despite all the help donald trump gave to those 5 innocent, poc adolescents :) after the download was complete - i opened the app and began to read the Terms and Policies listed below trumps jaw-dropping, gorgeous body. Ironically, a list of all the women he traumat*zed was presented instead ! there was even a photo of trump and epstein below the list, i doubt he had ties with epstein, just a cute little picture :) to be frank, i wasnt surprised at all, just some mishaps and flaws thats all.. right ? and there are plenty more flaws with our president *cough* ☺️ i mean app but they can all be swept under the rug and forgotten about, after all thats what america *cough* - i mean apps can do :) and if youve read all of this i hope youve written a fantastic review <3","userName":"ajhsxhsknwnshxhzh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:16:10Z","isEdited":false,"title":"perfect app for ignorant cowards ☺️🥰"}},{"id":"6173031664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Firstly, this app took approximately 4 DAYS to download! When I finally opened the app ecstatic to support our next president of the United States, my phone started to emit a retched odor that reeked of old butter and methane. Due to my passion for making America great again, I proceeded to continue using the app. After approximately 7 minutes of use, my phone started to emit an ungodly high pitched frequency that attracted all the frogs in the area to my house. The frogs proceeded to consume every insect and arachnid in my house. I assumed it was a good thing, until my brother reminded me that the chitin from the bugs was 87% of our home’s structural integrity. As those deafening words left his lips the ground started to rumble beneath us. We didn’t even have time to salvage anything from our house other than the clothes on our backs before it completely collapsed in on itself within a matter of seconds. With my phone at 2%, no charger, and not a mere outlet in sight, this is my last testimony (on my phone). My brother and I now live at the pond outside our ruined abode. We are now among the frogs.","userName":"SimpleOtaku","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:10:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app made me lose my house"}},{"id":"6172805209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of supporting this absolutely handsome man, when suddenly strange things started happening. I opened the app only to see the screen fill with images of the annoying orange.🍊 I thought nothing of it until I started hearing clown music.🤡 So naturally I opened my calculator app and at the top where the numbers usually appear I saw the word “DIE” over and over again— spooky!! 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨ So I proceeded to try and open back up the Trump app when my phone began to glitch, and not long after that it self combusted and set all of Antarctica on fire!!! 🔥🙈 So I had to grab my pet pterodactyl and run for our lives! We finally made it to Jupiter with only minor grass stains, but my pterodactyl is missing a nose which I find quite odd. Once I got found an outback steak house and was able to purchase a new phone— I immediately re-downloaded the Trump app! 😋 But then the worst of it all happened. I was baking cookies in Alexander Hamilton’s toilet, and they BURNT!!!!!! 😡 So I HIGHLY recommend you DO NOT download this app unless you want your cookies to be burnt like mine were!!!!","userName":"t001112","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:02:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"‼️DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DOWNLOAD‼️"}}]}
