It refused to open and every time I would click on the app, it would either restart my phone or freeze my phone so bad that I would have to restart it!! But some how it had the audacity to send me notifications and alerts when it didnt even want to open! The amount of alerts I got was RIDICULOUS and it completely slowed my phone down! If it was up to me than I would have given no stars AND shut down the app for how USELESS it is. I am so DISAPPOINTED and cant believe I wasted my PRECIOUS TIME TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It must be racist or something because of how SLOW it made my phone. WILL NOT RECOMMEND AND HOPE IT SHUTS DOWN!😌🧚🏽🧚🏽🧚🏽✨✨✨✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T05:20:13Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"BIG BOY 1868","title":"I gave a start because no stars was not an option"}},{"id":"6174973094","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with all of the latest news from everyone’s favorite president! Even tho he looks like a Malibu Barbie dipped in Cheeto dust I figured I would go ahead and give him the benefit of the doubt!!!! I was on a walk with my giraffe on the boardwalk but suddenly my phone started blowing up! It was trump himself, sending me his pick up lines that I really didn’t want to hear. No thank you!!!!!!!!!! I don’t want that in my feed, it’s not good for geralds (the giraffe) well being. I don’t want him subjected to the horrible world we live in. Anyhow, this app is horrible. I don’t want people and Gerald thinking that I support his horrible attempt at trying to make me fall in love with the Orange. Don’t download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T03:59:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ILuvGerald","title":"Horrible App"}},{"id":"6174793984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Hi so I know we just met but I want to tell you something secret. I don’t want to say this publicly but this app is blackmailing me. I tiptoe. There I said it. At night I do it -no noise -all secret I go everywhere. I go to public toilets, I go check on the sleeping neighbours nicely always very kind. My Fitbit count is the best, the number is higher than the wealth that our president keeps for himself. So as a snack to compensate  I eat the rich. Gross it’s like couscous sooo hard to stomach but someone had to do it. I will tiptoe with pride from now on. My tiptoes will cross the nation, I will go for the unethical CEOs for nutrition and then on to the -%}^}*+} censorship. It’s the reality don’t censor man. Gen zzzzzzzz will put you to sleep awe so sweet we love melatonin!!!!  \n\n-the squirrel outside of the White House","date":"2020-07-09T03:05:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"almondwaffle","title":"Tiptoe"}},{"id":"6174791743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"as an american i i downloaded this app. i can feel all my imagination being replaced with wrinkled up cheetos- i am REVOLTED- and this is NOT okay. please get rid of it 🤢 it makes my phone melt and emit fumes that nothing should make. 💔 everyday after i use this app my world turns a little oranger. every fruit is starting to look like an orange and every potato looks like a cheeto... and then next thing you know, my hands look feverish and orange, they are becoming pruned up and enlarging. i can feel my body becoming larger and my steps more sluggish.

But I DO NOT RECOMMEND getting it. It was a terrible experience because my entire house disappeared! I went to go find an off switch but then I was swallowed as well. Apparently this app sends monsters to your house to devour everything in sight! I still can’t find my poor candied orange slice. He was quite the nice companion. Oh and sitting inside of this monster is very very uncomfortable. I can’t find any of my favorite colors or eat any of my favorite socks! I was so disappointed to see that my cat has not continued to eat rainbows. I think it is due to the very outdated and blown up space. It’s not even fluent in here! Anyways please take this app off because people can sleep better.","date":"2020-07-09T02:29:22Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Princess Mononoke 👸🏻","title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6174661174","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I got this app it showed a picture of my water bottle in Arkansas and since I can’t drive yet I had to LITERALLY walk there. Got home and I was transported into space where the aliens were and they were surprisingly very EVIL but I liked them. They also took my phone that I thought was in my hand and threw it, I had to cannon ball into space to retrieve my cellular device. This app asked me if I wanted Burger King and I was taken back because I only eat McDonald’s and I thought they knew that so that’s like the main why I’m upset. But they burned my H2O so I guess I have to sue them. this adventure took my 2884 seconds... they literally wasted come minutes of watching or even doing something else. SO DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","date":"2020-07-09T02:25:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"coochiestinks","title":"PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP LITERALLY DO NOT"}}]}
