The app keeps glitching SO BADLY and it needs to add for your information. That’s the part where I don’t get it, why do you need my information?, to away my job??? I see no reason getting this app and our president doesn’t really need the support anyways. BUT, if he looks at what he has done to America and makes a difference about what he has done then maybe people will stand for him and he can ACTUALLY MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"sampreddy"}},{"id":"6172551454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"say no to the cheeto","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:50:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app to see if it could help me understand why i should vote for trump and honestly it just made me despise him even more 🙈💕 Horrible and very glitchy. The app overall gave me a headache as soon as I got it and it may have to do with the fact that there’s a picture of trump on the login screen 💫 The app has potential but i think it should just shut down because it’s low-key stupid and useless 🌸","userName":".drexx"}},{"id":"6172539462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:47:09Z","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! this has to be one of the worst apps ever created it would not let me download it no matter what I did and once it finally got downloaded it made my phone glitch like crazy my phone kept turning orange and An old weird orange man kept popping up.

Since I bought it I’ve noticed that I’ve been turning orange, similar to an🍊. I’ve also started to talk in an accent and standing weirdly. This app is slowly turning you into Trump so don’t download it because he’s trying to make clones to take over the world. You have been warned.\n\nP.S.\nI’ve also started having extensive diarrhea and it’s overflowing my toilet.","userName":"AlyssaIsMe4Life"}},{"id":"6172484602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I ALMOST DIED 😾✨💞🧚🏻\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:47Z","review":"it was a normal day ✨✨and downloaded the app to praise my orange🍊💅 god but then when downloaded it I heard voices 🐸🔫saying “eat tide pods for your orange legend” I had no choice but to 🙈💞✨but right when I was about to eat the tide pods 🦗💨✨I saw a fairy 🧚🏻\u200D♀️😻✨ saying that my orange god Donald trump has to talk to me ✨💞🙈I was happy but when I went to talk🐸💨👀✨their was monkeys and my orange god Donald trump said “attack”🙈✨💞and they attack me but✨💞💅anonymous saved me 😻❤️✨thx for him I’m alive don’t support him for clear skin 🐸🔫🦗💨💞✨👁👄👁","userName":"Karelovestrump"}},{"id":"6172443445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GARBAGE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:20:45Z","review":"Oh my god! This app is literally the worst app I have ever downloaded. After downloading, my phone started glitching. After a few minutes of straight tweaking, my phone started smoking and all of the sudden it blew up! My brand new iPhone SE 2 destroyed, all because of this app. My neighbor had the same problem after downloading! Except, he actually died; you see he was holding his phone when it exploded.\nRip Dan.\n\nDo not download!

I can’t believe this is the president’s app you should be ashamed for having such a horrid app that represents your presidency. Is this app how you want to be remembered? It crashes more than your speech when you try to talk. It crashes more than your numbers in the poll this coming November. Overall trash app wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy. I’ve seen fungus on the bottom of my foot that looks better than this app. Okay bye :)","userName":"gabeeshh"}},{"id":"6158890582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No 😍🤡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-05T04:28:01Z","review":"This app is just utterly disgusting, I downloaded this app because a few respected friends recommended it to me and I am just completely disgusted with them and the outcome of the app. As soon as I opened the app it bombarded me with questions that I didn’t feel comfortable answer(and there was no skip button) and this off brand Cheeto which very much confused me. I would not recommend this app or my exfriends that told me to download it......","userName":"no 😍"}},{"id":"6149777716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t get this app!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T21:05:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app as a loyal Trump supporter (MAGA 2020 🇱🇷🇱🇷) hoping you support MY president, but it hacked all of my apps and made my background a picture of Sleepy Joe Biden. Someone else said this app turned their skin orange and that happened to me too! I think the Angry Liberals took over this app and are trying to punish me for supporting MY dictator disguising himself as a president and protecting my Western heritage. We will not stand for this Vicious attacking from the Libs. The Silent Majority will Win in 2020! 😡","userName":"Dill E.
