I was extremely disappointed in the app. I thought this app was for Donald Duck’s 2020 presidential election, so I was not expecting Don the Cheeto Man (AKA Bunker Boy) to appear as soon as I opened the app. Seeing the Cheeto Man himself pop up on the screen caused me to throw up continuously for over an hour. While I do take some responsibility for not paying close enough attention, I am still disappointed that this app wasn’t for Donal Duck, and I think the app should be changed immediately. I hope no one is actually idiotic enough to have downloaded this app with the intent to support the coward himself, Bunker Boy. I’m sorry for anyone else who made the same mistake as me. It was truly a terrifying experience.","isEdited":false,"userName":"DonaldDuckLover2004","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:36:21Z","title":"awful"}},{"id":"6177195620","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Last Wednesday I wanted to share my support for my daddy donald trump so i decided to get his app. Butttttt when i presses get on the app store, it told me i would need to answer security questions before the downloading process would be complete. i was like uhhhhh okay???? but i did it anyway, dumb me. the security question asked me who is my favorite person in my family, very obviously i said my mee-maw doodle mammy. i thought nothing of it as i pressed submit. next thing i know, my grandma who was giving shlop to my grandpa upstairs gets ELECTROCUTED by a swarm of eels that made it into my house!🐟🐊 I LIVE IN NEVADA! there were so many eels everywhere it was so traumatizing. but on top of that, the app started blaring noises of trumps laugh on top of my grandmas sad screams. horrible experience, do NOT get this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"69 loverrr😋😭🥶","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:38:38Z","title":"My grandma is now in the hospital!🧚"}},{"id":"6177011830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app to see and try to understand why mr. Trump is president. I wanted to see his views and just in general what this app is about. After taking a WEEK to download I was finally scrolling through the app. After I got out of the app the first time I kept getting pop up messages telling me to go back on to the app. I wasn’t sure why and just thought it was a bug. When I hit cancel my phone would immediately crash. I then shut off my phone completely to see if that would help with the crashing. It didn’t. I deleted the app to see if that then helped it. It did not. I was very upset since I’m from a very poor family and it would be rare that I was able to get a new phone or get it fixed. DO NOT GET THIS APP or else you will ruin your phone.","isEdited":false,"userName":"jake from statefarm the 5th","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:47:51Z","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP👺"}},{"id":"6176945147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is absolutely horrible. First, they ban tik tok and then make a laggy and inapropriate app for themselves. I’m confused to why anyone would keep this app because it is a bad demonstration to the American people. Tik tok was the greatest social media app left on this planet and they go in and destroy our lives. This app is the worst app that the United States of America has ever seen. I really hope that Apple deletes it because there is no point for this disrespectful, untrustworthy, and bad quality app. I would rather sit around and read, rather than go on this horrific app. If you consider downloading this app let me ask you something, what are you doing with your life? Trust me, this app should be taken down and left in the trash because it is the worst app that everyone here has ever seen","isEdited":false,"userName":"eric the lightning slayer","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:29:55Z","title":"Do Not Download!!!!"}},{"id":"6176844080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ever since I downloaded this app Bad things have been happening to me. Right when I downloaded it my phone exploded then my parents got divorced and then my dog ran away and I went blind all in a matter of days. It is no coincidence this all happened right after I downloaded this app. It is the common denominator between all of these events. So under any circumstances... DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IT IS BAD LUCK!! It is safe to say it ruined my life.🧚🏻\u200D♂️❤️🍭🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️ \nIn addition to all of this, when I gave the app my phone number ( which in my mind is such an invasion of privacy) I began to receive death threats from the president himself and I was like well that’s weird and unprofessional. It’s almost as if this app is giving my information to China and is a national security threat. Yes that is the only explanation.","isEdited":false,"userName":"gsydstjnjdzw","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:03:27Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6176604076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is 🚨HORRIBLE🚨first it took me 20 hours to download and the second i opened it it just kept crashing. only i finally got it to work, it would not stop asking for my location. i finally allowed it and then got a knock on my door. it was a package that had a hat. it said vote trump or else you die. that made me very scared so i threw it away and then the hat came again. this time i burned it. but then something very bad happened all the hats came and flew around my house like with the letters for harry in that horrible demon book harry potter. i have a million death threat hats and i don’t know what to do with them. i fear for my life so i will move now and delete the app. how dare this app reference the demon possessed evil spirit book harry potter!!!! 0/10 DO NOT GET if you want to live‼️‼️","isEdited":false,"userName":"angrymom426","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:00:04Z","title":"biggest waste of space"}},{"id":"6176479953","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app stole my wife. Jessica, if you’re reading this, Please come back. I miss you. Our kids miss you. Your family’s worried sick about you. We just want you to be safe. I don’t really understand the logistics of running off with a virtual application, but I’m sure it’s something that we can work through. I mean, he isn’t even that handsome and I drive a way cooler car. That’s gotta count for something, right? Can he juggle 5 balls at once? Does he know how you like your eggs in the morning? Can he give you daily updates on the possible Chester the Cheetah™️ mascot replacement? Y’know, now that I think about it, he’s probably recording your information in the background, and the guy on this app kinda looks like Chester™️… but he still can’t juggle!!! Come home please!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"idk lole","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:26:07Z","title":"We miss you Jessica"}},{"id":"6176476476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was awful. It took 30 weeks to download and I couldn’t delete it, once it finally downloaded it took up so much storage that my phone started lagging all the time and all my other apps started crashing. It still wouldn’t let me delete it! A day after getting it, my phone was completely broken. I tried to throw my phone away to get a new one so I put it in the trash, but the next day it REAPPEARED on my bed!!! Bad things continued to happen everytime I tried to get rid of the phone (my dog died, my mom got in a car wreck, the list goes on) \nI mean C’MON this is some Annabelle type sh!t!!!!! I know just leave the old phone sitting in my room so it doesn’t curse my life anymore- it just sits there with this one Trump app- dominating my life. This app is a dictator app!

I then began to experience malfunctions throughout my phone such as glitches random flickers and viruses constantly. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS APP TO ANYONE UNLESS U WANT A VIRUS OR OVER ALL BAD APP EXPERIENCE😡. I am beyond disappointed by this app and believe it should be taken down and never put back up for such unimaginable issues caused within this. I can not describe what I went through from one simple yet VERY LONG downloading virus catching process and will undoubtably share my bad experiences through this review and hope this will prevent others from having such bad issues as the little to many that I presented here.(spelling errors may occur due to fury which came afloat due to the terrible experiences with the app.🙄)  Overall Disappointing😐. -A","isEdited":false,"userName":"❤️hope to see you one day😢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:45:03Z","title":"Bad app"}},{"id":"6176056176","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i was genuinely hoping this app would show me some of the good things that the trump administration has accomplished for our country. I was very excited to educate myself on this great nation as the very misleading advertisements stated this app would provide. However, none of my expectations were fulfilled, in fact, this app left me afraid for the security of my iphone. not only did it download three other apps without my consent, i have not been allowed to delete said apps since their download onto my phone. The apps have been screen recording and voice recording everything i do through the apple apps & are doing so as i speak. Hello sir trump. I hope the very good people at apple will do their jobs and deal with this issue immediately. thank you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T10:20:20Z","title":"high expectations, big let down."}}]}
