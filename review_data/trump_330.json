I downloaded this app solely to keep me informed and updated on Mr. Trumps decisions. Upon installation my phone actually began to react in a way i found very odd (i have the iPhone xr btw). It was getting extremely hot and started shaking uncontrollably. I tried to stop the installation but my phone was to hot to touch and I experienced first degree burn instead. Then, a very strange smoke started to arise from my phone. I was so mesmerized by the smoke I barely \neven noticed it began to completely engulf me. I could barely see but noticed this wasn’t any normal smoke from an electrical reaction. This smoke resembled that of wispy hot Cheeto dust🟠💨. I tried screaming for help but it was no use, the smoke was sinking further into my lungs as if I was becoming a part of it. After what seemed like anywhere from 10 sec to an eternity my life flashed before my eyes. When the smoke settled i glanced in the mirror across the room and didn’t recognize myself. All that was there was a big fat cheeto puff. At least i was still a snack✨🤩🧡.","date":"2020-07-08T15:51:01Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172691949","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump doesn’t have a brain.","userName":"dontvotefortrump","review":"His actions over the past few months have shown the true side of a president that doesn’t represent our country but divides it instead. His racist actions during the BLM movement has set off a chain reaction causing us as a country to look back at how we view him. His utterly terrible response to the coronavirus has also shown up\nin the numbers, as the US daily cases continue to rise. And quote from Trump “99% of coronavirus cases are harmless,” which is awfully false. The way he carries himself and the way he threatens anyone who seems to try to oppose him in the government, is a sign of a man who is scared to face to himself. The political actions he has taken, whether it was immigration or LGBTQ rights, are always based upon misleading ideals. He doesn’t take into account any of the people he may hurt with the decision he makes. I mean come on, he didn’t listen to his daily brief one day and more than 10 people died in Afghanistan. Just look it up, he has caused so much pain and suffering, without helping the people who really need it. I hope you never side with this man again, he’s a disgrace to this country.","date":"2020-07-08T15:29:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176824523","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HELP NOW IM ORANGE 🍊‼️⚠️","userName":"nana☺️!","review":"okay so after i downloaded this app WHICH TOOK WEEKS TO DOWNLOAD BTW. once it finally downloaded, the first day i heard voices coming from my phone and it was going slow.

Not only did it take an entire year to download, it blocked my access to the rest of my memory on my phone because it took up so much space. After that, the app would not run at all. I simply wanted to be informed, however very quickly I realized that I kept seeing Trump ads on all other apps. Then, both my lock screen and home screen became pictures of Trump! After that, all of my app icons because Trump’s face as well!!! I couldn’t do anything about it!!!! I did not download this app in support of Trump, and now, I know that I will never support him!!! There have also been strange things happening in my house that I could attribute to the downloading of this app. I assume it is a signal that my phone gives off to randomly set off smoke alarms in the middle of the night when there is no fire. On top of this, a mysterious number of wild hogs have come to my back fence recently, due to the frequency my phone now gives off from downloading this app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!! If I could give it 0 stars, I would.","date":"2020-07-09T13:10:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176003961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"RUINED MY LIFEE grrr","userName":"trump's shrimp🍤","review":"i downloaded this app because i wanted to support the orange cheeto that lives in the white house🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨. i originally downloaded it 9 MONTHS AGO and it barely finished last week. beyond disappointed😟. ever since last week, my life has been sTrAnGe👾. i’ve received so many inappropriate pictures of the cheeto man that i had to rise my eyes 👀 with bleach to restore my virgin eyes😵. i then received a link that said “click here if you want a one direction reunion” so i obviously clicked🥄. little did i know that it was a scam and they wiped all my personal information. 5 minutes later, i heard a knock on my door👂🏽. when i opened the door, i saw 3 demogorgans starting at me wearing trump 2020 merch.🧍🏼\u200D♂️next thing i know, i’m stuck in the upside down along with all the other cheeto supporters. 🏅we luckily found our way out but ended up falling out of a cloud 💨.

It grabbed my by the p*ssy when I tried to use it and made fun of my baby bro with Cerebral Palsy. It said my Mexican bf was a rapist and bad hombre, and when he would pay for a brick, he got thrown in a cage! 🤯😡😭 Then when I tried to log in, it locked me out and said it only liked people who didn’t become prisoners of war. I was confused, so I asked if maybe I needed to use another language to log in and it said: “ Да, я русский актив!” So I went to the FBI to report the app as a Russian tool and it told me all the people working with it had sold their souls to Satan in exchange for power. I got scared and started to feel sick, so I went to the doctor and asked for a COVID test, and they said the app told them not to give anymore tests and my COVID would just disappear.. and if that didn’t work, to inject myself with disinfectant! This is a horrible, horrible app.... it will go down in history as the worst app ever created. I hope Apple deletes it and will throw its creator in jail and throw away the key!!! It’s all fake news!","date":"2020-07-09T04:13:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174499806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"I got stranded on an island!","userName":"Your local human","review":"When I first opened the app I was instantly  blinded by the pure orange-ness of his skin. It actually caused my eyeballs to melt out of their sockets. When I found this out I was in such sock that I started to run around in circles so fast that I accidentally started a tornado that destroyed my entire neighborhood. After all this occurred I then had the rational thought of going to see if my mother could help me so I got in my car and started the long drive across the country. I was fine until about halfway through the trip when I realized I CANT SEE!!!! I quickly turned off my car and stepped outside to find help but it turns out I was in the middle of the ocean! I then swam to the nearest island where I waited for four years with nobody but a volley ball with a face that I named Wilson. I was eventually found and taken to my mother but it was to late for her to solidify my eyeballs. So here I am four years later blind and saddened that my life will never be the way it used to be. All because of this crusty dusty Cheeto. (Also it’s pretty glitchy and that’s not very cash money.) So in short, don’t download this app.","date":"2020-07-09T01:39:42Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174480505","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"donald j trump ate my firstborn son","userName":"ye old pancake house","review":"believe me, i’m a big fan and supporter of our president don. he is very nice and respectable. we  go wayyy back too. we fought back in nam. we partied in nyc penthouses in ‘87. heck i even signed my name on his wall in calligraphy. little did i know that our friendship was about to change, and more than a little. now we all know trump is a fan of meats. all kinds of meats. goes outta his way to get those REAL exotic meats from CHINA and the place below china idk where that is. i’ve eaten so many meats with my man donald, i couda become i piece a’ meat myself if i didn’t become vegan. anywho, trump came over to my house for thanksgiving. we hadda get a whole separate turkey for him because his digestive is very demanding. i thought the turkey would be enough, but i was wrong. he just kept throwin stuff in that gapin maw of his. i thought he would eat my whole house!! he kept demanding more food, but i told him i ran outta money(gambling is a curse, innit). he was so mad, oh boy, i’m telling ya, it was a sight. then he grabbed my eldest son brian on the shoulder, picked him up and swallowed him whole. my firstborn son! gone forever...","date":"2020-07-09T01:34:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174176787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible! Absolutely horrible!","userName":"Balende","review":"I hated it so much, plus this is a huge offense to all of the: pigs, Cheetos, oranges, and anything ugly in the world. I can’t believe something like this could even exist! 1 star, because I can’t put zero, I don’t need to explain why (because it’s just common sense) but I’m going to anyway for the dummy who created this app. It was honestly just looking at a horrid creature that’s going to give me nightmares, I can’t believe my poor brain had to process this. I think I lost almost all my brain cells whilst trying to make sense of this. \n\n      Personally I would like to apologize to anything that was offended by this, so that pretty much means anyone who didn’t want to see something ugly and dumb today. The Cheeto that was constantly on screen terrified my cat, after hiding under the table for about an hour he finally came out and threw up in disgust. If you’re wondering his name is: President Kit Kat. We named him this because we think/know he would make a much better president than the orange. Then again anything would, so to sum up this app - Garbage, flaming hot garbage. Screw trump, Shrek for president 2020!","date":"2020-07-08T23:53:38Z","isEdited":false}}]}
