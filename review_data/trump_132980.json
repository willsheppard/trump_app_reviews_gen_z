You text a phone to vote for Trump but you don’t even need an app to do that! This Orange RACIST is literally the problem with today’s society we all know he discriminate women and black people, people out of the country coming to United States. Half of these people are literally brainwashed by this orange with his success, by giving us Stimulus checks ok that’s a one thing he did good but what else, NOTHING! He almost started WWIII with Iran, he attempted to build a wall to block out foreigners to come to States for a new life and freedom. He deported foreigners that were legal in the U.S and then he also have several rape accusations flying around his head like WHAT! But y’all want him as our president he the reason the Country is corrupt he’s literally taking away our freedom, he literally called us people of color degrading names like illegal, terrorist, thugs and etc. This man should literally be in JAIL for his rape accusations because literally pays these families off that would go to court so he can still be in office!","date":"2020-07-08T20:50:30Z","title":"This app is USELESS!"}},{"id":"6173683966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bskwooq","review":"Got the app to support our racist / rapist president and it crashed immediately.

Honestly why are roaches always showing up when I open this app. Not to mention it never sends me notifications even tho it’s turned on. And never lets me see any updates it keeps logging me off and shutting my phone off.had to pay to see if something was wrong with my phone turns out this app gave it a virus I can’t believe this is the type of quality that our beloved president 🍊 has chosen to give us.
