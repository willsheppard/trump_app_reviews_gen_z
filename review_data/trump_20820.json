I then downloaded the app and it not only took seven weeks to download, it also put viruses on my phone and I had to get a new one it was so bad. I can not support this man or any horrible app he tries to force upon us.","title":"Horrible App 😡😡😡🤬"}},{"id":"6177210865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:57Z","userName":"exinter","rating":1,"review":"Trump is trying to take down tiktok, what they don’t know is that it makes us happy. And if they take it down a lot of kids will get depressed, the videos are funny and make us laugh. The Chinese government will already have our information by now some of us has had it for like two years. DON’T TAKE IT DOWN","title":"Ugh"}},{"id":"6177158889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:15Z","userName":"barron2040","rating":1,"review":"Absolutely terrible. Really hard to navigate, offered little to no information, and just overall cluttered and ugly.  I truly am voting Trump 2020, but I can't help but be honest about the app, because as an avid supporter, we of course hold no bias. I think it could be improved by also including more Barron, since he's my favorite trump.","title":"HUUUGE fail"}},{"id":"6177122935","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:19Z","userName":"Lucy Eubanks","rating":1,"review":"I went on this app the see the wonderful Cheeto because I wanted to vote for him and I wanted to show all the support I could but then I saw him and threw up and now my room is orange and everything I see is orange all because of umpa lumpa man so now I realize that mr.🍊is stupid and I don’t want him to be in charge of my country and we need to save him sun #savebarron 😙✌🏻thx","title":"Stanky fishy"}},{"id":"6177123880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:34Z","userName":"endwizzi","rating":5,"review":"This a great app that really helps inform me on a lot of information about the 2020 race.

Why do I need to give out my personal info in order to see what a presidential candidate in my country supports? I will not give out personal info and accept texts. I just want to see what information is in the app. Terrible. Going to delete it right away.","title":"Terrible Format"}},{"id":"6177075966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:05:18Z","userName":"googleclassroomk007","rating":1,"review":"i got this app in hopes of being persuaded to vote for trump in the 2020 election. then i remembered he’s a rapist and a child rapist. removes all rights from the lgbtq+ community but claims to support them. he’s extremely transphobic and won’t allow them into the military. ANDDD he’s removing tiktok. but that’s the beginning. i really don’t recommend this app nor do i recommend trump 2020. settle for biden!","title":"horrified"}},{"id":"6177046779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:57:18Z","userName":"ava5738","rating":1,"review":"App was so hard to use and honestly seems pointless. Everything had problems and it took a while for anything to load even though my wifi is perfectly fine. I rated this app one star because of its terrible performance and how poorly it worked.","title":"So very bad!"}},{"id":"6177042019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:56:00Z","userName":"rip sprite","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and I saw a Cheeto it scared me and I showed my dog he thought it was an actual Cheeto he took my phone and ate it we took him to the vet but he was fine  I then try to break my phone cause the app was sooooo scary then it bonked my dog in the head he flopped down and wiggled like a worm he then died moments later RIP sprite and cookies you will be remembered.
