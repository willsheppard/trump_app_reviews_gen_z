Freezing and crashing, it was bad. Tried re-starting, that didn’t work. Tried a bunch of other troubleshooting and nothing worked. Deleted the app, and everything worked fine again. Don’t download this app! Needs more work so it doesn’t damage more phones!

Everything g about it is completely below standards and not even on the chart. In fact- it’s about 1,349 miles behind it. I am disappointed to say i even downloaded it, if i could i would delete all memory of this app from my brain. Terrible.","title":"i cant even put into words-","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:53Z","userName":"Sleepy kittens!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174405307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Was informed that this is not the Wendy’s drive thru so let’s start there with my disappointment. This app is terrible. The interface is terrible. It glitches frequently. It freezes my entire phone to the point where I have to do a manual shut down of my phone every five minutes. Also imagine supporting a white supremacist. Y’all are 🤡.","title":"Black Lives Matter, Donald Trump is a white Supremacist, Full stop.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:11:43Z","userName":"BLM sends their love","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174395301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"😪😪😪 I do not even know where to start with the horrors within this app I downloaded this with high hopes 🧚🏾🦋only to be let down in the most terrible of ways 😡🤬 I opened it to see the president of our great United States and saw a horrific orange thing instead 🍊🍊 My family and i are still haunted to this day, don’t download this app if you aren’t ready to face the terrible consequences 😤","title":"Just awful","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:47Z","userName":"juli*web","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174389616","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First of all why is the person so orange..

It started when i opened the app, and it glitched out a small man jumped through my phone and stabbed my dog with his own broken femur bone, all while a high pitched screaming was radiating from the speakers. Both of my kneecaps combusted from how startled i was, and i most definitely have ptsd and will be seeing a therapist because of this mortifying experience.","title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨no✨🧚\u200D♀️🌼","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:00:18Z","userName":"gabbyissad123","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174361651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":". I wanted to support him but this app made me somehow throw up and my skin began to turn orange! Then suddenly I started to go bald and I kept gaining weight. Not only that but the app managed to blow up my refrigerator and when I tried to delete the app it sent me a threat saying that it would kill me😔. It also said a bunch of racist slurs to me as I continued to try and delete the app. I do not reccomend. It’s absolutely horrible.
