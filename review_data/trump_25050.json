The app glitches so mush that all the lights in my house wouldn't turn on for 17 days and I know it was this app because when I deleted it my lights turned back on.

This app is awful, I can’t believe we have an app to support white supremacist Cheeto man. Who constantly shows his bad attention for this country and earth. He doesn’t care about the environments, minorities, safety of women. \nOne of the presidents in history.

I genuinely don’t know how any of it got past the many layers of approval for something to be official to the campaign. This app is UNUSABLE!!!!!

Not easy to use (I am 45) and an awful waste of time! BECAUSE OF THIS I AM THINKING OF VOTING FOR “Sleepy” Joe. You have me at my last straw.

I really thought the people of America were smarter. But now I realize why Europe kicked them out of their country in the past. It’s a country made of the poorest minded and insanely pathetic.
