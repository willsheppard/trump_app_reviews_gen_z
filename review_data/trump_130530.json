I was about to scream but thankfully it was just a really pen. So I continued to use the app for a month and a rat came up to me while I was using the app. This happened for another month. One day I opened the app again and I was FaceTiming him he said to me “hey Karen, I wanna give your daughter my pen” I said “the pen you showed me” .je showed my daughter something small and I still have 000000 idea was it was though. Then he said “don’t wear a mask” I agreed then he continued to say “you know I’m thinking about taking down no skateboarding signs at this point I lost it!!!!!! Really he was just gonna let kids skateboard... I asked to see the manager and he replied with “I AM THE MANAGER” I screamed so loud the cops came and asked what was wrong I told them and they looked out the window and saw a black kid skateboarding on MY property!!! They shot him. He died. HOORAY!!!!!! But then I saw a bunch of rats come inside my house and pee all over the police they all formed into the word gen z rules that’s right with a Z. Then a ugly deformed roach came in and the rats attacked it. The rat turned into all these terrible things. A McDonald’s worker came into my house and it scared all the gen z rats away. The roach turned into a trash can then into trump I slapped him with a pan. And he asked if I was pansexual. I said “NO!!!!” Trump tried to tell me that we should team up and take away their rights. I agreed but then disagreed once he throw teargas at me. Yesterday I found out why. He wanted to take a picture next to my cross that sits next to my white couch.
