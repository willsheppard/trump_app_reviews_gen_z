It is not good and I feel as this supporting a racist man and someone who supports systemic oppression. This ends now . First he was trying to mess with Twitter now tik tok. Tik tok is the media of my generation so if he ends our app we end his . Apple this app must be gone .","date":"2020-07-08T17:55:07Z"}},{"id":"6173159855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible","userName":"james Buccham","review":"The app took forever to download and when it finally loaded all the way my screen was black.
