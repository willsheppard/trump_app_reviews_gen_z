He’s put people against each other, and has done little to serve the ENTIRE nation and it’s citizens. Hispanic children and families are in detention facilities, many experience sexual assault and human trafficking! Sources say it’s even comparable to concentration camps! POC are still treated low and attacked; I mean, has Trump done anything beneficial towards the modern lynching? The brutality of police? I can go on, but to cut to the chase, this app advocates for someone who has proven himself biased to a certain demographic and overall unfit to serve our nation.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"More is at stake here!"}},{"id":"6174142316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pls_no","date":"2020-07-08T23:41:01Z","review":"i downloaded this app to be more informed about the pop culture everyone talks about. instead of learning something, i had to wait so long for it to download(i think it’s taking all the data on my phone) then when it finally was ready i was astonished by the many cheetos on my page! everywhere i looked cheeto! cheeto with bad tan! cheeto with combover! it was like i entered into a reddit thread with people who all had weird cheeto fetishes. would not recommend for anyone unless they have a cheeto fetish. if said prospective customer has said fetish then 100% recommend!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT GET UNLESS YOU HAVE CHEETO FETISH"}},{"id":"6174127830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leaniam","date":"2020-07-08T23:35:34Z","review":"I downloaded this app and let me just say, that was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life. As I opened the app I saw a ginormous Cheeto. I was so frightened that ALL of my hair fell off 👩🏼\u200D🦲 Because of my baldness I fell into a deep depression 😭and I stopped feeding my cat so it ran away. Then I come to find out that my cat 🐱 was almost run over by this minivan, but lucky the minivan didn’t run my cat over but it did crash into a fire hydrant and now my whole city is flooded 🌊 . I’m now living with a family of fish 🐠 who have gracefully taken me in. So DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP !!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Do download unless you want your hair to fall off"}},{"id":"6174122238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"angenii","date":"2020-07-08T23:33:29Z","review":"i opened the app to see the Cheeto man praising to Hitler👎🏼 my poor dog jumped out the window due to that horrid picture, I will be sending a bill for all of her injuries. After that my phone started glitching really bad and turned off, when I turned it back on I had a live wallpaper of the Cheeto man getting a spray tan with his little wewe sticking out. honestly how did he even make kids?That thing is the size of a five-year-olds pinky toe. \nIn conclusion THIS APP IS HORRIBLE IT SHOULD BE DELETED OFF EARTH ALONG WITH THE CHEETO HIMSELF  ps. should probably go get that checked out that’s a serious problem🤩😋😙🥰👋🏽","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I WILL BE SENDING A BILL😾😡 ( save barron)"}},{"id":"6174095302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"apple123456123","date":"2020-07-08T23:23:41Z","review":"I gave it one star because he is a A racist President and nobody like him and he is a Orange duck and he doesn’t love his wife also a president should not be a dick . also should not tell people to kill people and he say make America great he mean make America White again. Also he is a  rapist and we should not have a rapist president also he act like is amazing but in Real life he is a dick and all countries matter and everything you try todo doesn’t work because you ruin everything in life we were fine with out you 🤬🤬😤😤 and this how you look like 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Take this app down"}},{"id":"6174079812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Reveiws!!","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:15Z","review":"I have no clue how this works and I hope this is anonymous but I am so ducking heartbroken and idk if I can ever recover from this. She was my everything. The only person I care about and now she’s gone and we are supposedly still friends but it just doesn’t feel the same. They say you never stop loving someone. You just love the next person you meet more but I can’t love anyone more than her. She’s the only person that makes me happy. There isn't one thing I don't value about her. I just thought she was my soul mate.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Ik nobody will read this so it doesn’t matter"}},{"id":"6174059175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sana_ii","date":"2020-07-08T23:10:35Z","review":"지금 하늘 구름 색은 tropical yeah\n\n저 태양 빨간빛 네 두 볼 같아\n\nOh tell me I'm the only one baby\n\nI fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you (twice)\n\nIt's dangerous 따끔해 넌 장미 같아\n\n괜찮아 조금도 난 겁나지 않아\n\n더 세게 꼭 잡아 take my hand\n\n좀 위험할거야 더 위험할거야 baby\n\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\n\nFancy, ooh\n\n매일매일 난 정말 아무것도 못하네 oh my\n\nMayday 이러다 큰일 낼 것 같은데\n\nBang bang 머리가 홀린 듯 reset이 돼\n\n어쩌면 좋아 이게 맞는건지 몰라 S.O.S\n\nSwim swim 너란 바다에 잠수함이 돼\n\n매일이 birthday 달콤해 너와 나의 fantasy\n\nDream dream 마치 꿈같아 볼 꼬집어봐\n\n요즘 나의 상태 메세진 랄랄라 baby\n\n달콤한 초콜릿 아이스크림처럼\n\n녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 so lovely\n\n깜깜한 우주 속 가장 반짝이는\n\n저 별 저 별 그 옆에 큰 네 별\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래\n\nFancy, ooh\n\n연기처럼 훅 사라질까\n\n늘 가득히 담아 널 두 눈에 담아\n\n생각만으로 포근해져\n\n몰래 뒤에서 안아 널 놓지 않을래\n\n거기 너 I fancy you 아무나 원하지 않아\n\nHey I love you (love ya)\n\n그래 너 I fancy you 꿈처럼 행복해도 돼\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nWhat? fancy you 누가 먼저 좋아하면 어때\n\nFancy you 지금 너에게로 갈래","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"it doesn’t stan twice 🤢🤢"}},{"id":"6174050951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"DahliaBrk","date":"2020-07-08T23:07:28Z","review":"I downloaded the app just to understand and weigh my options on presidency. So I made an account with my email, name, phone number ect... AS SOON AS I CLICKED SUBMIT I got a flood of text messages. I pushed stop then a few days later telemarketers were calling me saying they got my number from an app. This was the only recent app I’ve given my phone number to. Then, my email got hacked, I had to change my phone number, AND My credit card info in my email was hacked. WORST AND MOST NON SECURE APP ON THIS STORE. It’s terrible.

I opened the app and was immediately bombarded with tiny orange dick pics!!! It was an entire slide of just shrimp dick pictures of the nasty pig faced runt himself!! There were also pictures of some sort of fugly orange monster with rotten teeth, a bald head and no eyes, and therefore no soul. I’m just assuming it was the president with no makeup or wig on. !!!DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! I have to go to therapy 25 times a day and I can’t look at anything orange without having flashbacks and trauma. This is awful, don’t ever get this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"I have ptsd now."}}]}
