Luckily i’m a doctor so i was able to bring him back to life. But then all of a sudden i got explosive diarrhea that got all over the walls and ceiling! It’s going to take me forever to clean it all. As i was trying to clean up the mess, my phone started blasting the song Replay on repeat and i got emails from the app about goats having intercourse! It was truly a horrifying experience but as soon as i deleted the app everything stopped. As a result, i no longer have any interest in this app and advise that nobody else download it unless you want to be scarred for life.","userName":"Dr. 🧚🏻\u200D♂️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T15:23:25Z","title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6140326045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to support our\n ✨🤰🥰amazing🥰🤰✨ president. The moment I opened the app, an inappropriate video of Trump started playing!!!! I couldn’t take my eyes off that 🧚\u200D♀️✨ voluptuous ✨🧚\u200D♀️ ass, but I was still traumatized! I wanted to push through though, so I finished the video in hopes to get to the actual app. But there is no actual app! The video of trump is the only content on the app! I’m disappointed, but I will be keeping the app for ✨personal✨ reasons. Also this app gave me corona virus.","userName":"adorablyhowlter","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T15:01:32Z","title":"Awful!"}},{"id":"6140218734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app and I was on it on da toolet and I don’t did the poop","userName":"NabaRajaba","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T14:32:59Z","title":"This has Made me constipateded"}},{"id":"6140195633","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Yo idrc about it.my fellow people were talking about it so o desires to look at this umpa lumpa as app and it was bad not only did I have to look at an orange 🍊 when I thought it was supposed to be ur president ( urs not mine) 😊but it also have a lot of bugs and what could have possibly have been s a virus cause my phone started acting up after I downloaded it. ✊🏾So ya this rapist- I mean racist-I mean persons app is terrible🤢🤢\n✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿","userName":"qwerty565327","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T14:26:48Z","title":"Bad app (read full review"}},{"id":"6140181492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Absolutely terrible. I was so exited to support President Donald jeramy Rumph. A real role model that one. But when I entered the app I was blinded by the amount of white supremacy and red! As he should know the color red is very deadly to me and the color white supremacy is very deadly to minority’s basic human rights- absolutly gross. Then I got 183635392 calls (yes I counted) and while trying to make it stop I almost killed a squirrel who was right in my path. Then the obviously flat earth started to become circular, and the amount of storage my phone had almost become smaller that my tiny republican brain.

Trumps nudes!!!!!! I don’t think anyone wants to see your CRUSTY, SHORT, SMALL, CHODE. Now said if I could give this app a 1 star rating I WOULD. Periodt✨💖🥵🥴 Anyways this is not the type of political app I want ANYWHERE near MY phone or my 15 children, my 4 ex husbands, my 1 new✨ husband, and my 4 boyfriend, my 6 sugar daddy’s, or my 13 pets. And that’s on that😚 but that is not the only problem I saw that PRESIDENT Donald J. Trump had a selfie of him on MY 2687.175528 BILLION dollar home CLAIMING it was his I am fed up with him and DONE with the republican side of political party’s. He has made me more upset than Barron Trump when he is with his father.","userName":"it eo good","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T13:46:50Z","title":"DISGUSTING VULGAR BEHAVIOR 🤢🤚"}},{"id":"6139986215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I bought this app yesterday because I am a die heart Trump fan. And I was so excited when I found he had an app.🧚🏻\u200D♂️💞🥵but when I opened the app I saw discussing, malicious, and quite horrid stuff. I mean I didn’t know his hairline went father back than Jojo siwa’s. And as soon as I started looking deeper into this app, my cat started hissing. How the hell did trump manage to piss of the entire population of Gen Z and animals.

Then the next day my house almost burned down because a ghost shouting TRUMP 2020 turned on the stove without my knowledge. I hate this app and is a disgrace to the republican community. I really believed in you Mr.Rac/pist. Disappointed. Don’t Get This App!","userName":"ilovemycountrytrump2020","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T13:24:17Z","title":"Absolutely horrible"}}]}
