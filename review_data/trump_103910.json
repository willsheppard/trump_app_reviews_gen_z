It glitches out every time I open it and the layout itself looks like something straight from a conversion camp😬\n\nYou know,  they say “make america great again,” but I’m really quite confused by the statement. What do you mean again???? \n\nAnother issue that’s got me confused is the support rate! Would you just love to know that your president is a racist, homophobic, sex offender? Oh no, of course you’ll just look past that and say he’s done well for the economy (which, by the way, he hasn’t😉). Not to mention his reaction to climate change — an economical crisis which, if ignored, will continue to destroy our planet☺️☺️☺️ \n\nOr perhaps I should mention the harm he’s done to the black community! I’m sorry to say that with the way he’s been acting, I’m not even surprised he abused peaceful protesters for two pictures with a bible. Can’t have equal rights in this Christian country; absolutely not. \n\nOr the way he’s handled the Covid-19 pandemic. Your president — the person who is supposed to lead their country with the citizens in mind — actually RECOMMENDED you should inject disinfectant into your body! (which... haha... will kill you🙃). \n\nThis is a country we’re talking about. Not Heathers brought to life. There’s enough teen suicide as it is, we don’t need more people chugging bleach. \n\nI hope I have enlightened you to the eyes of 🌟common sense🌟 and have an absolutely wonderful day😊😌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:05:41Z","title":"An abomination😁"}}]}
