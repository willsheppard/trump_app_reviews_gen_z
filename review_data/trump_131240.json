All of a sudden when the app completed download I got a warning that I had around 10 viruses on my phone. I had to download an app to erase the viruses but I don’t know if they got my personal info. Now I don’t know for sure if it was this app or the pop up add with the Indian url but I don’t like Cheetos that much so a 1 star.","userName":".Cbomb.","title":"Might have hacked my phone"}},{"id":"6174361340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:58:15Z","review":"Es seesSs","userName":"Carlos9208","title":"👉👃👌🏿💄s de QQQAAQQAAAaas11111-.-.-.—:-"}},{"id":"6174360875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:58:06Z","review":"We're no strangers to love\nYou know the rules and so do I\nA full commitment's what I'm thinking of\nYou wouldn't get this from any other guy\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nAnd if you ask me how I'm feeling\nDon't tell me you're too blind to see\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\n(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give\n(Give you up)\nWe've known each other for so long\nYour heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it\nInside we both know what's been going on\nWe know the game and we're gonna play it\nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling\nGotta make you understand\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry","userName":"Corbomb","title":"This app ate my son"}},{"id":"6174359918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:46Z","review":"I have recently downloaded this app thinking it was an “ eBay “ type thing for trumpets. But to my dismay, as soon as I opened this app, I saw a man who strangely resembles a large Cheeto puff. I’ve never been more horrified in my life, and I mean it! I’ve had nightmares for 2746.1 days now, Because of this app. I’ve been diagnosed with a phobia of Cheetos.
