Do not get.","review":"If I could rate this app 0 stars, I would. Mr Tweety Trump deserves nothing more than 0 stars for this crummy app. I do not like it. It burned my house down when I opened it for the first time. All in all, I would rather have any app in the entire App Store on my phone over this dumb app. Honestly, no one should be allowed to have this app on their phones. It corrupts the mind and destroys common sense, and worst of all, it absolutely obliterates any remaining humanity and empathy of its users. Therefore, I call Apple to action — please, for the love of all things holy, delete this app from the App Store and save thousands—nay, millions—of young and old lives alike. And their homes, because this app somehow commits arson every time it’s opened. Also, in this day and age, we need America to become GOOD again, not great. This app is backwards progress on America’s path to goodness AND greatness. The deletion of Trump’s app from the App Store will be his symbolic fall from grace, preceding, of course, his literal fall from grace. Anyway, I hope you’re all having a good day! Stay sexy gen z-ers :)","date":"2020-07-09T05:15:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175156046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Barron Trump dude","isEdited":false,"title":"He is a rapist and a racist","review":"Hey I gotta is a time to take some pics from the day of my football game tomorrow morning babe thanks babe love that I wanna was a really nice night baby and we had fun with the girls I gotta is a really nice day to go see the movie night baby shower I gotta is a really nice day to go see the baby and see how much you love them baby love them and see what you doin like to them and what they wanna see what do they mean they do it for you baby I gotta is that the time I see them they will see what I can i get them to me please I promise I won’t be able see them again I gotta is that I love them I love the way they are all my friends I love you and I wanna was a really nice night and we could do that one more night and I gotta get a good night and we went to play basketball game and we got a little bit more fun and we could have a little bit more fun with him but we can i get a little something to eat then I wanna was the night baby shower I gotta is the time of the day you get a chance can we get a peek and get it done and I can see how","date":"2020-07-09T04:57:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174415367","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sherlyn Criollo","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump is the worst person in the world","review":"Trump may be your president but it doesn’t mean that everyone likes him. He doesn’t look at the facts and only makes up things. He is horrible with women and even with his wife. He only believes white lives matter and the white race is the superior race but if you looks back in history maybe he would be surprised and know the white race wasn’t created in the first place. He says he believes in god but yet he keeps ripping families apart and is a homophobic, if he believes in god then he loves everyone like god did and forgave their sin. Expect he pushed people aside and put a gun onto their face with his army to take a picture of him holding a bible and that means he “believes” in him, NO. He is trying to ban TikTok, a platform where the gen z and others are planning to scare trump and make him look ridiculous, why? Because he knows what their doing and if liberals change their mind about trump he will lose followers and will not be elected as president in the 2020 election. Trump is a racist, homophobic, sexist, liar, and a very horrible person to be with.","date":"2020-07-09T01:14:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174410443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"elmos left eye","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is like a tiny end of a croissant 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑👏👏👏","review":"I woke up and the app appeared on my screen it gobbled my phone like a turkey. I was confused since it wasn’t Valentine’s Day. I soon deleted the app thinking it would be permanently gone then ten minutes later I look at my phone and it’s there again. This time with SANTA. You heard it here folks he’s real I saw it with my own eyes. Me and Santa were besties until he betrayed me and FaceTimed the Easter bunny instead I was disappointed and sad so I tried to trip over a towel and it didn’t work I had just stepped on it.... I spent many days sad and alone until I realized why I came to be sad. THIS APP....😱😱😱😱😱😨😨. I now realize that this app was the cause of Santa and me meeting. I will never forgive this app. I was left broken and without hair.

While I was waiting my phone also glitched and kept turning black every time I tried to go listen to expensive girl, which was actually devastating to me to the point where I had to keep eating to keep myself entertained. Due to THAT, I had constant diarrhea for the rest of the day because I told myself “let me wait till tomorrow to see if the app works.” I got dehydrated really fast and every time I drank water I choked because of the 🤡 of a president we have in the US. Eventually though, the app looked like it was ready to open but when it got to the homepage it glitched AGAIN and I fainted because of my stress levels on this app. I don’t recommend this app to anyone because studies have shown it to have killed brain cells of the normal human being. And at one point I thought I saw fancams but I was just hallucinating due to my last braincell left 😣 if I could I would rate this app 0 stars ✨⭐️","date":"2020-07-08T21:14:28Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173666402","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"your boy ❤️","isEdited":false,"title":"🍊 i’m so scared let me go hide in my bunker 🍊","review":"I download this app to support our amazing orange prez. But right when i did i become orange and i had a sudden urge to hid under a bunker and tear gas innocent people and i even held a bible upside down and asked my goldfish to take a picture of me. Even my goldfish was so scared that he sadly passed rest in peace✨prison mike ✨ you will be missed. I felt horrible. So i had to delete the app. But i just couldn’t bare not having our prezidentz app on my phone. So i decided to download it again. But right when i downloaded it. my hair became a toupee and i started walking like a deranged gorilla (no offense to gorillas). So i sadly but mostly very upset at our prez’s app deleted it once again. I am very scared and upset. My prez is trying to duplicate himself through this app. I’m still currently am orange and my hair is still a toupee. I’m mortified my prez did not win today. I will never download this app ever again. Pleaze use this as a warning and if you already download it. If you are already apart of this group of trumpets i hope you find a cure.","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173636296","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Nathan🤪🤪","isEdited":false,"title":"Cheeto Corn boy sent sniper monkeys for me!!!🌽🐵🐒🙈🙉🙊","review":"I was extremely excited to have a WHOLE app about my boy, Cheeto Corn boy, until I realised that it took up as much space as \nCheeto Corn boy’s head!! It also took FOREVER to finish downloading. When I wanted to send him a message, it said I must pay first!! I was not into that!! I just wanted to chat with Mr. Cheeto Corn boy himself, but instead he made me pay a 4.99 fee! I was FURIOUS😡!! I knew my place, and that was making sure that everybody knows about this SCAM!!! I was writing my review when Cheeto Corn boy himself showed up at my house with sniper monkeys!!🐒 They were sitting outside my house, scoping in though the windows, looking for a clean headshot . Luckily I had Cheeto repellent, so once I got their master, Cheeto Corn boy himself, the monkeys had no clue what to do. I used my taekwondo🥋 skills to eliminate the remainder of the monkeys.🐒 once they had all been defeated, I felt extremely accomplished. I HAD FINALLY DEFEATED CHEETO CORN BOY AND HIS MINIONS!!!! Anyway I wouldn’t suggest downloading this app, unless you are a master taekwondo master. 0/10 for me. Sorry Cheeto Corn boy. Maybe next time!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:33:19Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173625144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tim chal","isEdited":false,"title":"Not worth it","review":"I had this app downloaded for many weeks but little did I know they were stealing my information and leaking it to different countries. The first time I opened this app, random music started playing which quite literally made my ears bleed and I thought I had Ebola. At first I thought this was a fun game but then I realized it was the Cheeto puffs app and I deleted my account. They kept sending texts and emails and notifications about the Cheeto puff doing stuff after I had already unsubscribed. Do not download this app if you want to have your private information leaked, you support this Cheeto puff. Ugh much much more that I cannot fit into this. Also they kept trying to get my address from me after I had already given it to them and they leaked that so please do not downloads this terrible app. They have so many commercials and ads you cannot even try to navigate around the app. I accidentally clicked on a random pop up add and it brought me to a site that I should have never seen. It was his merch store😡. Anyways EAT ROCKS CHEETO PUFF","date":"2020-07-08T20:29:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173561834","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tulipee","isEdited":false,"title":"Wasn’t what I expected🍊✨","review":"Ok so I downloaded this app because I was expecting certain things. Firstly I thought it would have diy spray tan hacks but sadly not his spray tan obviously includes hacks and a snack because he looks like a Cheeto and he gets the tan from Cheeto dust but it wouldn’t show it. Secondly I thought that it would have how to keep a wig on. He wears a toupee so I thought that it would have hacks on how to keep a wig on but it didn’t. I wanted to know how to keep that wig on 🙄.  thirdly it took ages to download like come on I have places to be money to burn and people to meet. It made a loud noise and suddenly I couldn’t walk my fish. Lastly I thought that he would be an anime fan and have tips on hisoka cosplays but his was 0/10 I’ve seen way better ones but he at least acts like hisoka is some ways. I thought I would be able to trust this GoOd ChRiStIaN man but when it comes down to it this is his 5th wife sorry but it’s the facts. Not to mention all of the stuff he’s done in the past. Maybe we should have trump in a casket 2020 or trump in jail 2020 instead. ✨🍊✨🍊","date":"2020-07-08T20:07:08Z","rating":1}}]}
