Now i have compiled a list of reasons why this disturbing app should be taken out of the app store. First of all, i clicked on the app to be greeted with a picture of an orange. Do you know how bad oranges even are? For example, back in December 22, 2004 a women was reported to have slipped on an orange and died. Therefor she left her cat alone and starving. So her cat died. Then the cat’s friends slowly went into depression. Do you understand how bad depression is? I clearly don’t think you do considering the fact that this app is still getting in the app store. Also the app was completely slow when using it almost as if i had an android. I did not pay $1200 on an iphone for it to be working like an android. This is DISGUSTING. For many reason i shall be boycotting using the appstore because of this tragic app. I would give it a rating or 0 stars if i was able to😤 As a matter of fact, this app does not deserve ANY stars. I am completely not okay and angry that this app is still up. Absolutely astonished that you wouldn’t even consider taking this down. Do you know that i can die from a heart attack from being shocked? Yeah i bet you didn’t. So rake this app down or I will actually die from a heart attack because you will not take this app down. Anyways stan tiktok for clear skin❤️","title":"A Very Angry Iphone User"}},{"id":"6173668841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:52Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"imnotanimmigrant","review":"😡😡😡😡 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡This app is trash😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑","title":"This is the worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173668795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"djdjjdks","review":"A horrible app it’s not educational and does not give important information that I need.The app takes up too much storage in my phone and I don’t like it.","title":"App"}},{"id":"6173668661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:48Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bequietboo","review":"smd ugly , horrible person ,app, republicans 🤢🤢","title":"uglyahh"}},{"id":"6173668312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:42Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"tommy💖😍😘💅🥰💕🙈✨","review":"the morbidly obese trumpies are angered at us😍 the people who left 5 star reviews should loose some weight and learn their facts😘","title":"💖😍😘💅this app sucks😘🥰🙈💕✨"}},{"id":"6173668278","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:41Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jmjuju","review":"Well, this app looked so AMAZING and I really wanted to entertain myself with it (since it is a comedy app after all). When I tried downloading it my phone turned off, so I thought it was just out of battery or something but then it came back on. I was happy it wasn’t out of battery and thought nothing of it until, when fully back on and logged in, all of my apps changed from being American to being Russian and I didn’t even notice until way later. After I unlocked my phone though I then went back to download this app again and it worked! Although it took ten minutes to download I still waited patiently only to be even more disappointed 😤. When I finally tapped the icon I suddenly felt the need to poop right then and there, soiling my newly washed sheets and I didn’t even noticed I did until I got up. Anyways, when the app was launched, my phone erupted with the song that goes sort of like, “someone come get her she’s dancing like a stripper..... 🎶” and it made me start balling my eyes out since my ex.... gir...😢 ..l.ll.....friend and I loved that song as it was our SONG. I also forgot one thing about that song though and I maybe should keep it a secret, bouje, sometimes I don’t want to be hap...... no no no wait. wrong thing. What I was trying to say was that my ex-girlfriend got psychic visions whenever she heard the song since she is Raven Baxter after all, and if she heard the song coming from my phone home miles away, she would be so mad at me. That is why I was so glad when the music finally stopped and the app actually opened. The only other thing I disliked was the fact that it put a virus into my brain and tried to make me joint a cult of, offfffffff.... what were they called again? Oh, ya Trumb suppers 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 or something like that. I’m glad I found someone to debug me and bring my phone back to normal soon afterwards lol. Other than that the app was so funny and really entertained me 😊. Hope this was helpful 😁.","title":"This app......"}},{"id":"6173667339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:23Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kmineanc","review":"🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷\n   🍊🐟this app gave my fish cancer ♋️🍊","title":"no❤️😘"}},{"id":"6173666690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:44:09Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"😤😡👎🏼😾","review":"this app took so long to download and when it finally did, it would glitch so bad! i just want to see the good content in this app BUT IT IS NOT LETTING ME. i literally open the app and it will go back to my home screen or open up and not be proportioned correctly to my phone.
