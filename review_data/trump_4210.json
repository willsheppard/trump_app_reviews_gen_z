GEN Z ALL THE WAY. thank you :)","title":"why though?","userName":"whatsgoodfamitsme","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177137730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had really high expectations when downloading this application. I was under the impression that this app would allow me reach the level of Brahma in the Hinduism faith. Unfortunately, I was proven wrong. Upon downloading it, my apps reorganized themselves to form a pentagram. My home and lock screen were changed to a picture of a man I have never seen before, but can only be described as “the antithesis of Jesus Christ”. I am scared, I am concerned, and I am fearful for my well being. My wife Karen took the kids. She took the house in Reno and the boat in Santa Fe. Everything in my left went downhill after downloading this app. Dear god take it off the App Store. Godspeed.","title":"Worst App Ever","userName":"takemebackkaren","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:22:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177039426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I first downloaded this app to keep up with what President Donald Trump is doing, to buy his merchandise, and to reserve tickets at his rallies and other events. One day when I opened the app, my phone started glitching. I didn’t think anything of it until my phone started making a high pitched noise that wouldn’t stop. After a few minutes, smoke started being emitted from the speakers. I went to show my family but as I set my phone down on the counter with the app still open, but then as soon as the phone left my hand, it exploded and nearly killed everyone in the room.","title":"This app almost killed my whole family!","userName":"Maxwell Dassow","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:55:19Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176853073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is HORRIBLE. I downloaded it in hopes of getting educated on what our favorite 🧡Oompa Loompa🧡 was doing- but it took the longest time to download! Once it finally downloaded- i opened the app to find it was very cluttered and obnoxious- just like our 🥰president🥰. I still ignored the mess and continued to use the app- until I realized I was beginning to see some side effects. My skin was slowly turning ⚡️orange⚡️along with my sight- it really gave me insight into what trumps everyday life is like. shortly after, my home and all of my belongings started to turn orange! Due to this- I decided to delete the app to decrease the 🧞\u200D♂️damage🧞\u200D♂️ done by our little 🥺Cheeto puff🥺.","title":"🧚\u200D♀️✨horrible✨🧚\u200D♀️","userName":"Hfsfcggfgfffgjgfd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:05:48Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176663431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS IS NOT A REAL APP!!! The app is a scam! As soon as I downloaded the app, it asked for all of my information, including my credit card. I gave it all because I assumed that my boy Donald just needed some help finding his campaign. But as soon as I gave the app my info, I got charged $5k from my account and was sent this message: “Screw you, you little republican loser! We’re taking all of your money and putting it into Joe Biden’s campaign! Hahaha, you are truly a fool for falling into this one, you dumb conservative! - The Dem Party” Like what?!?!?!? And not only that, the second after I got that text my phone was bricked by a virus. Do not download this app, I repeat, it is a SCAM!!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Voltyyy","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:15:48Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176273429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"the moment i opened the app, i was asked if i would allow my location to be used. me, hoping i would get updates in the mail, said yes. two weeks later i got nude photos of the president and a threat that if i didnt mail back $1,000,000 in the next 96 hours my parents would be taken and fed to the president and vice presidents families. i tried to mail the money, but there was no return address. i anxiously waited for the next 96 hours, not letting my family out of my sight, but the moment i looked away, THEY DISAPPEARED. donald trump’s next tweet was “this dinner was pretty good! fresh and all the way from (my state)! thank you, (my name)!” DONT DOWNLOAD","title":"HORRIBLE APP DONT DOWNLOAD 🤬🤬","userName":"Natalie Carreon","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:27:54Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176252263","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This classless heathenish numbskull muppet app is the WORST thing on this App Store. First it asked me to give it my phone number which I believe is an infringement of my privacy, and then it asked for my name and email address like????? Should I just give you my social security number at this point? This app is a disgrace to our beloved and prided United States. My ancestors did not die in the civil war to be represented in such a disgraceful snollygoster manner and I will not stand for it. 🤬🤬 Not in my country. THIS IS NOT WHAT IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT!!! This is an invasion of my constitutional rights if I do say so. I would advise everyone to never download this app unless you want Russia to be spying on you!!","title":"THIS APP IS A VIOLATION OF MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS","userName":"Gabe Wiles","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:21:24Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6176094618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i opens the app i had someone yell at me saying ArE YoU LoSt BaByGoRL i don’t think it was appropriate because i gust last my average dog named Martha SHE HAS NO LIPS SHE CANT GET NO KISS KISS SADLY 😿 and it just reminded me so much of her 😿 but then Gabbie Hannah from the Gabbie show came in my room saying she was summoned by the ArE yOu lOsT BaByGoRl when i told her to leave she hissed at me and screamed WHAT IF IM THE MONSTER 🙀🙀 and then shane dawson was in my room and was looking at my cat WHEN I TOLD HIM NOT TO TOUCH MY cat he said ✨🧍🏼✨and vanished with my cat 😿but then harry styles showed up and fought every one away while singing watermelon sugar he gave me my cat back and said this app was cursed 😻😽 i give it one star because Harry styles","title":"✨😻😽💋🧚🏻\u200D♀️","userName":"fgxgjj","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:32:42Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175617542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and it took a week to download  and it made me share all my personal information and after that my banking info got hacked and I can’t access my gift cards or debit or credit cards and as soon as I opened the app I was awoken by an orange looking spray tanned apple. This app hacks information from young adults and people looking to vote for president trump. Who claims he isn’t racist and homophobic but he really is nothing of the sort. I tried to delete this app multiple times and it wouldn’t let me. I kept getting my account hacked by the president himself.
