I downloaded this app in hopes of showing it to my two little children Karen and Betty every night before bedtime, but the app opened up with Trump and an American Flag in the background and I immediately had to close the app. The color scheme was not original at all and the visuals were horrendous. It was a very disappointing moment. I am very upset that I didn‚Äôt see Obama when I opened this app because at least he deserves to actually BE on an app. Instead we got this donkey looking, human-trash-talking, temper tantrum-making, Oompa Loompa of a man. \n\nI hope this gets deleted from the App Store Right away. \n\n-Notmi Murika","userName":"Notmi Murika","date":"2020-07-10T03:18:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This App is TERRIBLE. -69/10","rating":1}},{"id":"6179224961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ew","userName":"alyssanicole123","date":"2020-07-10T03:18:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Ew","rating":1}},{"id":"6179224631","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app on 4/20 at 4:20 and I was riding my llama on the highway. All of a sudden, my phone starts going ballistic. I wouldn‚Äôt stop receiving notifications from this stupid app, and then my screen goes dark. I thought my phone had died, but then there‚Äôs a bright flash of orange. The flash was so bright, I was temporarily blinded. I fell off my llama and was hit by a bus. Luckily I survived to tell my story. Though I lost my toes and am now incapable of taking feet pictures for daddy trump, I‚Äôm just happy to be alive. \n\nTwo weeks later mr. turnip comes and visits me in the hospital. He says that he can pay the doctors to reattach my toes. I told him my toes were gone and it was too late. He said he‚Äôd pay for a toe transplant, I asked from who, and he right foot was from him and left would be from pence. I gladly accepted this offer, but he didn‚Äôt follow through. I did give him my number, so hopefully Barron will get it, and we will run away together. I‚Äôll teach him how to make friends and everything once I get discharged. Now, I‚Äôm just waiting for my scars to fully heal. Thank god this is covered through Obama care, oh wait...\n\nMoral of the story, don‚Äôt download this app. It lags so bad, and don‚Äôt text and ride your llama while on the highway. Thank you for your time.","userName":"DiscoHawk","date":"2020-07-10T03:17:54Z","isEdited":false,"title":"‚ú®üåàüßöüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôve in hospital for two monthsüßöüèº\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏èüåà‚ú®","rating":1}},{"id":"6179224356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DUMP TRUMP NASTY THIS WAS THE WORST APP EVER OMG NASTY GROSS DISGUSTING GET OUT OF HERE!!!!","userName":"kribium24","date":"2020-07-10T03:17:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Yucky","rating":1}},{"id":"6179224298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"FELLOW TRUMP SUPPORTERS‚ÄîTHIS APP CANNOT BE DOWNLOADED IT IS A TRAP SET UP BY THE LIBTARDS.
