After awhile of using the app I noticed something weird was happening to the things in my room. Like writing on the wall started to appear and EVERYTHING soon had to deal with “Trump 2020” yk? I thought it was very weird so then I kept scrolling through the app so I could get more 🍊educated🍊 and my vision started going blurry so I got up and took a sip of my water. But then out of nowhere, weird voices started popping up in my head, almost like brain washing yk yk 🥰 and kept telling me to do these racist and sexist things. And at first I was confused and put off because I am a white WOMAN but soon my brain was mush. So with the little bit of consciousness I had left, I PULLED myself to the phone and before I could do anything the screen was turning orange and our ✨presidents✨ nudes were displayed on the screen. I was appalled. I quickly deleted the app and things went back to normal but I think I’m going to need EXTENSIVE therapy, but it’s good I found a therapist the charges $75 a session and expect that Trump will reimburse me for the pain I went through by paying for my therapy and the renovation of my home that I just couldn’t focus on anymore due to my traumatizing experience that almost made me blind✨😖 don’t recommend this app unless you want similar experiences😭😖😌","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177496491","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scary","date":"2020-07-09T17:06:11Z","userName":"ElleGee72","rating":1,"review":"This app is full of misinformation!
