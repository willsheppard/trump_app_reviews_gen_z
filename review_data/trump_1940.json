As soon as I opened the app I was bombarded with videos of an ultra orange man with almost no grammar skills. All of his idea were so terrible that they even scared my kids! I mean it was telling me to do all sorts of racist and homophobic things that surely I thought couldn’t possibly be real. I mean is this some sort of joke? I never thought in all my years that a man like this would ever run for president and use a terrible app like this to back himself up. Also while on the app it seems as though chicken spies 🐔 ended up hacking my phone through this app and took all of my info plus my Arby’s reward card(I LOVE MY REWARD CARD😢)!! I’m just so furious. WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T GET THIS APP!!!!!! IT TOOK MY ARBYS REWARD CARD AND HACKED ME AND RUINED MY LIFE. I EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ALL THE DAMAGE THIS APP HAS CAUSED ME. \n\nAlso settle for Biden folks!!😘","title":"Dear ✨Bunker Boy✨ Your app ruined my life","userName":"TayReview","date":"2020-07-09T16:14:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177235837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded the app... Let me tell you, as soon as i opened it i was a big orange man. I thought i was watching something paranormal! I immediately fell to the floor and started to hyperventilate. It scared to the point where i was frozen. My mom took me to the ER. They couldn’t find out what it was. So i told the doctors what happened, and then they started to put the pieces together because i wasn’t the only one to have the same health problems because of this app. I went home and deleted the app IMMEDIATELY after my health scare. This app is not for anyone. Take it off the app store!! People are dying because of this app, it could have been me dying from seeing the orange racist man. The number of deaths are rising ! This has to stop. Don’t let anyone else\ncatch the orangeman syndrome 😓.","title":"you tried😍, don’t do it again🧚🏽\u200D♀️😘","userName":"lilizivertswife on tik tok❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:50:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176982589","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE 😡😡 first it grew legs and stabbed my grandpa 🙀 then donald appeared on top of my roof🤩 i was so excited to meet my idol 🥳 then he slid down my chimney but got stuck halfway through 😤 he threatened to send the swat team to kill my family if i didn’t save him 😿 he was so stuck that i had to knock down half of my house to get him out😡😡 then he shot my dog 🙀🙀🙀 then he unleashed his army of orange roaches that swarmed around me🤭 then they all crawled up me until i was covered in orange roaches 😩😩 they all injected me with orange juice 😾 i turned orange just like him 🙀 donald took my goldfish hostage and said that if i didn’t vote for him he would murder it 😵🐠 then he threw my parents into a pile of his stinky poo poo and they suffocated 😩🔪 DON’T GET THIS APP BECAUSE IT WILL MURDER 🔪😵YOUR LOVED 💕 ONES AND THEN DONALD 🍊 WILL CONVERT YOU INTO A SOLDIER ⚔️ IN HIS ORANGE ARMY 🍊🍊 ✨waste of your time✨","title":"this app is ✨repulsive✨","userName":"shawty😼🥵✨🧚🏻🔪💕😈🕴","date":"2020-07-09T14:39:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176981075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so into downloading this app and learning more about our 🍊orange orangutan🍊 amazing leader of this nation, but once I opened the app o was very disappointed. I am actually blind and my guide dog is writing this review, but I wish this app could have a braille option for all the blind people that love looking at our ✨bootifol✨ president. But there wasn’t that option so I am still very disappointed.😔 My vision came back!👁👄👁 I still don’t like this app. Like it says ok the title, you did this🥰❤️🦋, now please never do it again🧚✨😎. I am now in therapy because I saw our dearest leader going for re-election. I am setting up a go fund me so if you could please help me pay for my therapy that would be amazing😌🥰.

I downloaded the app to show nothing but support😔. A few hours after I downloaded it my phone glitched and my lockscreen and wall screen turned into a picture of an orange 🍊. Just a orange with a yellow plain background. I found that pretty odd considering the fact no one could’ve changed it besides me and I didn’t change it. I brushed it off and went to bed. I woke up at 3 am to the smell of oranges. And I’ve been having bad dreams and nightmares of the orange man coming to take me away. Even my kids are afraid I tell them “don’t be bad or else the orange man is coming” and they listen immediately. But there’s something about the orange man and this app that makes even me afraid. Please don’t download this app. Till this day it still shivers my timbers😟","title":"Horrible app","userName":"dezzaiya","date":"2020-07-09T14:22:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175739623","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"not only did this app take 3 DAYS to download, when i opened the app my phone glitched out and overheated so bad i dropped my phone and went to the hospital for 3rd degree burns and I am still recovering. When i was able to turn on my phone again it showed me the SAMSUNG LOGO!!! and my emojis are samsung now!!! and since i plugged my phone into my mac book to charge my mac book is also glitching and overheating and the webcam light is on and i can’t turn it off! I also began to receive texts from the trump administration BEGGING for donations and i didn’t even subscribe in the first place, i texted STOP and it replied with “Pres Trump: Thank you for your $15,000 donation!” And my account went into the negatives. My phone eventually exploded and i had to pay a bunch of money for a new one. Would not recommend this app to anyone!","title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"Achara Howell","date":"2020-07-09T08:35:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175625017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Goodness, I downloaded the app to see what the huge hype was about Donald Trump, to figure out he was the president (I have been grounded for awhile). I then proceeded to wait months for this app to download which is crazy but I still wanted to know and I have patience. But as soon as the app downloaded my phone went haywire and started screaming at me and opening random apps and called my ex on accident and I couldn’t hang up. It was possessed. I tried deleting the app but it kept coming back somehow and messing up my phone. Soon I figured out it put a virus on my phone and it took all my pictures, included the one from my JoJo Siwa concert and posted them on some weird website. I don’t recommend downloading this personally from my \nexperience XOXOXOXO💋💋💋also the screaming killed my goldfish so rip JunIor","title":"Do not download","userName":"kachowkachow8698696969","date":"2020-07-09T07:55:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175563979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if i could give this god forsaken app zero stars, i would in a heartbeat. i will explain why so no one else makes the same mistake as i did. first off, not only did the app glitch multiple times as soon as i opened it, but it also started playing a recording. now, if the recording said something along the lines of, “thank you for supporting president trump and making america great again”, i wouldn’t even be close to angry. in fact, i would’ve been delighted. but instead, it decided to play president trump say “i’m going to drag my orange, sweaty balls across your face until you give me money”. HOW OUTRAGEOUS! who even says that to one of their supporters? it’s foul and i’m absolutely disgusted by him. until he fixes this issue, i will be deleting the app and holding back on donating!","title":"the worst app i’ve EVER downloaded 🙄","userName":"nicki 💋✨","date":"2020-07-09T07:33:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175509947","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded it because I adore dump truck😍😍😍and I was thinking what’s a better way of showing my support than to download his app then after I downloaded it I realized that I had a virus on my phone and every 10 minutes i got a random notification saying “REAL WOMEN VOTE FOR TRUMP” and I was super confused and then I started doing my research and realized trump is a bad candidate for the US so I came to the conclusion that u wasn’t a real women after all😳😔😐but then when I was going to notify my parents about what happened I realized they were missions and there was a note left saying “TRUMP 2020” and I was like wth am I supported to do so then I called the FBI BAU and they helped me track down the warehouse and I had to do cartwheels BC it was booby trapped but I rescued them and I knocked out the people holding them hostage❤️💅🏽💖😍🥰😹","title":"HORRIBLE APP😧😐👊🏽😹","userName":"girlthatherfamilygotmurdered","date":"2020-07-09T07:12:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175127370","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app really upset me. First off, when i downloaded this app it immediately started bombarding me with notifications about Trumps tanning products. No man would like the orangutan tan. After that i started getting some about the hair products to achieve his “incredible” hair. I saw that and thought “HECK NAH,” i will NOT let myself have that head of hair. Precisely 10 minutes later i thought i’d check out the app and actually open it. To my surprise as soon as i opened it i saw numerous ads of men in speedos with MAGA on the buttocks. I was even more shocked when i saw one of the front side that had the caption “we know you want it ;)” with arrows pointing towards the southern region. I couldn’t even begin to comprehend what i was witnessing. This app has truly scarred me for life. To anyone out there reading this, please stay away.","title":"HORRENDOUS APP","userName":"Nandkwowje","date":"2020-07-09T04:48:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
