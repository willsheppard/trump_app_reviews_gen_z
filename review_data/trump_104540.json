It was absofruitly terrifying. I hid underneath the covers of my blankets as I watched the terrifying being rummage through my room. Seconds later, the creature discovered one of my most prized possessions— my collection of various cartoon stamps. \n\nOnly then, when I was about to give up, I realized that I had little to lose. In a moment of boldness, I grabbed the only things left that were important to me—my coin scrapbook and my phone. I burst out of my room and ran outside the house. \n\nHowever, it was too late. The orange had already grown bigger and bigger until it began to eat pieces out of my entire house (only making it stronger). In a flash, I tried to delete the app, but I couldn’t. It was almost like the energy of the orange was to powerful. Reluctantly, but for the safety of myself and the people around me, I made a decision. \n\nIn a flash, I threw my phone onto the ground and stepped on it. I realized quickly that what I had done had weakened the orange, but hadn’t taken it down as I’d wished. On the other hand, I later learned by destroying my phone I was able to vanquish the orange’s invincibility. Now, I had a chance. \n\nI needed to come up with a strategy, so I decided that I had to find my way to the roof, and I needed a weapon. As I considered this, my phone began to glitch, and exploded into a sea of colors. My pet bee (who had managed to escape the house before me through the window), flew into to mass. I screamed in protest, but he had already flown into the mass. Luckily for me, the curse of the app backfired due to me destroying my phone and turned him into a massive version of himself.\n\n“Barry! You’re okay! Is that really you?” I asked in a haze, perplexed by the majestic beast that flew before me. \n\n“You must always bee-lieve in yourself.” He advised wisely, before he continued, sparkles showing through his beady little eyes. \n\n“How am I going to get up there?” I questioned, finding it hard to envision myself taking down this monster.\n\n“Hop onto my back, I’ll fly you up there. Take this.” Barry announced, grabbing a zester in the rubble with his enlarged arm and tossing into the mass where he became bigger. Quickly, I grabbed the giant zester from his arm and hopped onto his back. \n\nIn a frenzy, Barry charged towards the giant orange that was now reaching for one of my neighbors on their balcony.\n\n“No!” I screamed, hopping onto the top of its round body and shredding away pieces of its head. \n\nThe orange yodeled in pain and shock as I continued to shred away at its body. As it’s juices began to leak out, it fell to the floor of my backyard. However, even though it was almost taken down, it still had some strength left and trapped me under the rubble. I felt like I was going to lose and screamed in desperation. \n\nTo my luck, Barry swerved around the orange, avoiding all of its kicks with it’s muscular feet. Deciding it was the only way, he sheathed his stinger and slayed the orange with one final blow. \n\nIn the end, I was able to save my town; however, the damage had already been done. When the orange perished, it began to flood the whole town with a sea of orange juice that took days of repair. My house was already half eaten, a huge chunk of the roof was gone. Most sadly of all, Barry, my pet and only hope had sacrificed himself to protect me and the rest of the town from the evil orange.\n\nThe End.","userName":"sxyhellember","date":"2020-07-09T05:32:07Z","title":"A Magnificent Tale of Tragedy and Zesty Havoc (100% TRUE STORY)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175236382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"The app is a joke just like # 4️⃣5️⃣!!!","userName":"rlpsmile14","date":"2020-07-09T05:26:22Z","title":"🤡🤢🤡🤡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175152516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"will eat all your eggs","userName":"catsfan64","date":"2020-07-09T04:56:35Z","title":"very bad","isEdited":false}}]}
