Man don’t play with us. We all gonna give you a one star review on your dumb-ass app and then the app store is going to delete it :). Now we will keep trying to get our fricking app back if you do delete it. There are too many funny Tiktokers who worked wayyyyy to hard to get verified or whatever. If you’re going to delete it, delete it for the racists (including yourself).\nYou’re acting like a clown right now. No ones gonna vote for you if your acting like a clown. (Only the racists.)
