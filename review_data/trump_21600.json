I died when I downloaded this app. This is no joke. I legit died after I downloaded and opened this application. Not only did I die, but everybody surrounding me such as family members and loving pets died as well.

It disturbed the timing of watering my pool. To others this might not seem like a concern, but my pool needs to be watered, and this stupid app distracted me from doing the task. If you want an app that constantly disturbs you, then your in luck because this is the perfect app for you. If I could give zero stars I would. So disappointed.","title":"DISGUSTING 🤢","userName":"jtamondo5","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:55:53Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176572392","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took a week to download and then a giant light popped up and almost blinded me then there was when one small Cheeto climbed out and took havoc on my room after that a monster with three eyes jumped out and my dog started barking at it and farted so hard it died I tried to get it to come back to life but then it turned into a normal Cheeto and I ate it like McDonald’s.","title":"TERRIBLE","userName":"Kristiraul","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:51:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176518845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and subsequently had to get rid of my phone because of all of the viruses that downloaded onto it. It was completely ridiculous that a possible presidential candidate would trick his citizens into buying more apple products simply so that he could get a cut of the money. 0/10 don’t recommend. Trump is a sick b*stard.","title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"🧚\u200D♀️🍄💐🧚\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♂️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:36:47Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176506137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried to download the app way back when Trump first won the election and it just fully downloaded yesterday. Its definitely a scam and not the official Trump app. I would give 0 stars if I could. So please I beg of you, if you are looking for the Trump app, this is not it.
