When I wondered why an app that is funded by our great president would ever try to belittle me, a black female, I remember that I am one of his least priorities in the United States and that he panders to white straight cis males only😻🤩🤩 kinda a bummer considering there’s so many more ppl in amerikkka than just them! It’s almost as if this entire administration is racist and sexist (on top of being homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic❤️)! The only reason I’m giving it one star is bc it really set the bar HIGH for ignorant white ppl across the nation! I mean you have to be loudly and openly racist if you ever wanna top this guy!! If I could impeach it I definitely would!! xoxo💕💕"}},{"id":"6176327862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Follow my tiktok @fatujall","date":"2020-07-09T11:43:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND","review":"This is caused me to develop a severe case of ptsd!!!! It took so very long to download 57 week are you KIDDING ME. I wanted to come on here and support your  president who also rapes little kids and does child trafficking who is also sexist and a racist, but once i got on i got a death threat by the orange balloon trump himself:( It ruined my entire life, i was depressed and sad and miserable and i still am to this day. If i could give it 0 stars i would. Trump also hacked all my social media accounts got my phone number and email and them leaked them, then proceeded to send people to my house and they beat my cats to death, all 15 of them. He burnt down my house, took all my family away, then told me awful stories of how he raped little kids then sold them on the dark web. This app NEED TO BE DELETED!"}},{"id":"6176309538","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"goatfited","date":"2020-07-09T11:38:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Unacceptable😪🧚🎇","review":"I downloaded the app interested to see what our beloved non rapist ,non homophobic🏳️\u200D🌈,racist,sexist🚺president had to say on the app I was very excited to get the app after hearing very good reviews on it when I got the app I was asked for my age which I thought was a little weird but hey 😛who cares😼🙂I then put my age in and got a message for the cheeto puff himself i-i mean the president👺👁👅👁which caught me off guard be he has a beautiful wife👄and a kid 👥I then blocked him bc I could not think of mr.

It will take all your data your pictures and everything. This app killed my gold fish named Nemo. I showed it to him and he started floating to the top!!!!! 😭😭😭😭.  This legit made my phone slow and it blew up I had to get a new one so beware. The app said if you don’t vote for trump they will come to ur house and hurt and torture you and put you in the basement with Barron and Melania and starve you. I was there and i escaped 😰. They took out my spleen and ate it I’m so traumatized. I have people saying go back to my country from this horrible app and they keep calling me negro and ugly and fat and it’s just so bad. I’m not any of that I’m supper skinny and green I’m from Uranus😔.

Unfortunately, despite being brainwashed to the point of leaving no room for any personality besides advocating for a homophobic, racist, xenophobic, misogynistic bigot, I still cannot deny my utter disgust for the quality of this app. My phone runs so much slower with it on, and now frequently crashes spontaneously—even when not even using this app. The app itself is very poorly designed and not very user friendly. What’s more, every time I try to use the app I’m accosted by ads for Trump 2020, to the point where I can barely navigate the interface without being accosted. Not your finest hour, Mister Trump—and that’s saying something."}},{"id":"6174829193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Its Marvallous","date":"2020-07-09T03:15:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","review":"Okay so I am definitely not going to let that Cheeto ban tiktok without a fight. everyone is going to this app and giving it a terrible star rating.
