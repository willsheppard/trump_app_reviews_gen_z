I will not be giving this atrocious coward any credit EVER and if you do, just know you are genuinely a horrible, hated person, not just by me but millions of people with any sort of empathy or compassion. Also you’re all so freaking ugly and will never truly be worthy of living.","title":"🖕🏼","isEdited":false,"userName":"risacove"}},{"id":"6068730499","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-13T00:40:58Z","review":"Not going to lie, this is the stupidest app. If this is Donald’s new way to communicate with us, WHY? He has a Twitter to rant on if a woman does anything mentioning him. And I don’t need to hear about how you are going to shut down Twitter cause they fact checked you?!?! Seriously stick to crappy TV shows and worse hotels!","title":"The worst app I have ever seen.","isEdited":false,"userName":"TTV.Pitplot0-"}},{"id":"6067824100","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-12T18:26:14Z","review":"I was very excited to get this app to keep up with my president. Upon opening it I was greeted with an ad for bumpstocks. \"Strange\" I thought to myself, \"didn't America's greatest president ban them? Truly a good American decision, by the way\" This was a very un American ad. The founding fathers would've been simply blown away with disgust at their airports, truly.","title":"Well you see","isEdited":false,"userName":"Viv and Milo man"}},{"id":"6063808307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-11T17:11:22Z","review":"Trumps views are now an ideology right?\nCommunism is an ideology right?\nIf you believe something and say it out loud does that make you a terrorist? No, you are executing your freedom of speech and expressing your ideology. Antifa stands for Anti Facist. If I am anti facist (I am) then I’m expressing my views. I am not murdering people or inciting violence. I am not a terrorist I’m an American with rights and have the right to be Anti Facist. Trump is a Facist.","title":"God bless Antifa","isEdited":false,"userName":"qwsdrtgyhuj"}},{"id":"6061429761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-11T04:02:57Z","review":"I got this app hoping for a great president 👍 but then the app was racist🤭and denied reality🤷\u200D♀️ and then gave my phone a virus 🦠!!!!!!

I could even feel my voice being taken away from me. I had never seen such a whirlpool of bright cheeto orange, blended with a crisp stupid nature, racist ideologies, and sexist/ rapey undertones. Maybe an update will come in November? 💁🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","title":"traumatized","isEdited":false,"userName":"thatamandmals"}},{"id":"6054919722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-06-09T13:52:16Z","review":"As soon as I opened this app I got an overwhelming urge to vomit. I can’t explain it, but just looking at the face of the annoying orange was so overpowering that my stomach began churning and I couldn’t help but run to the bathroom to throw up.
