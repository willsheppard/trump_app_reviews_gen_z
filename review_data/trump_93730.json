America likes to act like it is the only country in the world who has freedom, yet often fails to acknowledge that other nations such as Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Belgium all have freedom. Out of the 207 sovereign states in the world, 180 of them have freedom. Therefore, there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that the U.S. is the greatest country in the world. The United States of America ranks 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, 4th in labor force, and 4th in exports. America only leads the world in three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where our nation spends more than the next 26 countries combined, 25 of whom are allies. The greatest thing any American citizen can do is recognize that they do not live in the greatest country in the world anymore. The United States USED to be a nation that would fight for moral reasons, passing laws and striking down laws for moral reasons. This country wages wars on poverty and not poor people, it made sacrifices and cared about our neighbors and allies. America used to build great things, make unimaginable technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, cultivated the world’s greatest artists and the world’s greatest economy. This nation aspired towards intelligence, didn’t belittle its own citizens nor make them feel inferior, citizens of the U.S. didn’t have to identify themselves by who they voted for in elections, and people weren’t scared all of the time and were able to do all of these things because we once had great leaders, leaders, presidents who would inform their people and were revered for being able to solve any problem our country faced. Nowadays that is not the case and we are led by narcissistic, orange, racist, selfish, shallow, impulsive, dishonorable, untrustworthy, untruthful, careless, self-absorbed, men like Donald J. Trump. Thank you if you read this far, and yes, if this sounds familiar, this message was inspired by the words of the Newsroom."}},{"id":"6178257218","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:11:22Z","userName":"nxkdksushjx","title":"Ewwwww","review":"No no no no no no no no no we need TikTok no no no no no but this big body built orange Cheeto puff spray tan 👎"}},{"id":"6178254476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:10:24Z","userName":"MossyMarim","title":"OMG terrible app!!!","review":"🤎✊🏾Black lives matter, sign petitions, be active in the movement :) ✊🏾🤎"}}]}
