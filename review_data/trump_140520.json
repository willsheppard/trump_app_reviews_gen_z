Once I was able to sign in, my phone imminently started glitching and my most important apps started getting deleted. I soon realized  my bank accounts and social media accounts had been hacked by the bourgeoisie. I was very afraid because soon after I started receiving texts from unknown numbers saying they would kill me and my family if I continued using the app. I had no choice but to delete it. I would not recommend this app 😔","title":"IT HACKED ALL OF MY INFORMATION","isEdited":false,"userName":"King Louis III","rating":1}},{"id":"6179498643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:50:34Z","review":"Just trash","title":"It’s just trash","isEdited":false,"userName":"not trump 2020 hes trash","rating":1}},{"id":"6179498626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:50:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app at 3am after a long day thinking it was tinder and I was going to find some Mans but instead I saw a life size Orange named trump and when I tried to swipe left it didn’t let me and I had no choice but to swipe right😭 now I get creepy notifications for someone named Donald trump like pls stop harassing me!!!!!
