First it turned of dark mode, I thought it was just a glitch, but then everything turned white. And then my social media got hacked and started posting white power post. I was mortified and when I tried to clear things up it just posted different YouTubers’ and tiktokers’ apologies for saying the n word and black face. LOTS of Shane Dawson posts. Now all these yeeyees keep following me and I’ve lost so many friends. It’s been devastating to think people believe I’m a racist. That’s what I get for downloading the most racist app available. You have been warned!","title":"Big oof","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:19Z"}},{"id":"6178234308","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"meep meep lol","review":"I woke up one day with this app on my iPad 😻😻\nThen I has sleep practice with a orange he’s super cute🥵🥵🥵🥵😈we started playing jump off a roof😦🤤he became so cute with his broken face 🤪🤪🤪🤪I became very blind after seeing his cute face😚😍 he had a fat orange butt 😩🤑he was  rlly rich to 😨🤯🤬he always gets a tan with orange juice 😘😻I was crying bc I saw his super cute rolls 🍊🍊😻😻I love him so much😏😜we went to the hospital bc I’m having oranges coming out my ears 🥵🍊we had very cute baby oranges ☺️🤪I’m so happy😾.      shawty😘like🤯a🤪melody📿in🥺my💖head😈going🦋like😦NANANANNA✨everydat","title":"🍊🤏","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:03:07Z"}},{"id":"6178233494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"dania mendez","review":"I HATE this apppppp... if you did not not already know this they are spying on you on one of Donald trump agents came to my house and kicked a baby right in front of my grandmother who has cancer and not on that he death drop kicked me very unpleasant.Just had to let you know 🐷 \nFrom: the baddest b!tch in This House 🥴","title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:02:48Z"}},{"id":"6178233029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"AudreyDash","review":"✨Downloaded it ✨It was ❤️Horrible❤️ When i first downloaded it i felt like i was gonna ✨💚Vomit💚✨ but I ignored iti put in my phone number then went inside the app all it was nudes.I saw ✨oranges✨ everywhere i press buttons.I became a leader and said why.People said i was no fun and wanted me to send them nudes in the app 😤❤️✨ \nAllthough this app is trash might be the next most trash app of 2020.\nDo not recommend it in any way except for nudes😭😢😫","title":"❤️Horrible❤️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:02:38Z"}},{"id":"6178232997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Idgafhanna","review":"Downloaded this app for some saucy brass jazz vibes instead got expired persimmons.

Wow. And then when I tried logging out I had like Cheeto flakes all over my phone on my screen quite weird if you ask me. Then all of a sudden I was just you know vibing through tiktok and all of sudden my screen turned off and turned Cheeto dust orange and MAGA appeared on my screen. I was very terrified and don’t use the app while listening to music. I REPEAT DO NOT USE APP WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC! It blocked out all my music and instead played this song that goes Donald Trump is our guy. Vote for him and don’t be shy. i- \nI was at lost for words. And I was trying to just vibe to dixie damelios new song. Plus it changed my lock screen to a chopstick with a big hoody on him. By the name lil buddy and I couldn’t change it. I was very concerned for my phone and myself. My mental health was compromise because of this experience. I do not recommend unless you feel like having nightmares of a Cheeto dust president who is breaking his sons heart everyday. #savebarronbtw #cheetoinfected #streambehappy
