Honestly can’t figure out how boomers manage to use this horribly made app when they can’t even turn off YouTube auto play.  Wouldn’t recommend to anyone to use.  It’s like trump made the app himself and as we know he isn’t a main of quality or integrity."}},{"id":"6173426694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:21:04Z","title":"✨","userName":"iwksbgej","rating":1,"review":"No👏🏻explanation👏🏻needed👏🏻✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6173426477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:59Z","title":"No❤️","userName":"Kehlanijones13","rating":1,"review":"This app is beyond horrible it two weeks to download and caused my phone to glitch playing the Star Wars theme song for two hours every day at the same time for the two weeks it took for the app to download. Not to mention the app caused Siri to randomly tell me to kill myself if I didn’t bow down to trump. My phone also self ordered a trump flag off of amazon and had it ordered to my house. I would not recommend this app to anyone and would give below 1 star I would."}},{"id":"6173426162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:53Z","title":"No🍑","userName":"Em_i_ly","rating":1,"review":"This app was extremely disappointing. Ever since I downloaded it my phone has been blacking out and randomly shutting off. I cannot even stay in the app for more than five minutes without it kicking me out. I put my phone number in NUMEROUS times and never received a verification code. I would love to talk about what the app actually does, but I have no idea because it  won’t let me in. You would think the president of the United States would be able to make one of the best and nicely put together apps, but he failed. I have also gathered from numerous articles on the internet that the app is gathering personal data about users which is a massive privacy risk. Overall, as soon as I submit this review I’m deleting the app. Stay safe and do not download it. 🍑"}},{"id":"6173425583","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:42Z","title":"Manny Heffley for 2020","userName":"blc🤠","rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app ever, it takes forever to download and then when you open the app it takes forever to load. They need to throw this whole app away and throw Trumps presidency down the drain. He is a white suprematist and deserves to die choking on a dick. This App gave me nightmares and scared me for life. I will never get the time back that I wasted on here and it's all bc trump decided to create a useless app. This app took wayyy too much data on my phone and my phone stopped working, I would 197363839292000% not recommend this \napp to anyone. When I first downloaded the app it took me to a child trafficking page on the dark web and I was so scared bc I didn't want to get raped I had to destroy my phone and get a new identity so I wouldn't get caught by the bad people. I had to move across the country and my name is now Bob short for ( spongebob). When I moved across the country I was able to get into Area 51 where I found a cute alien and he's now my boyfriend and he is protecting me in another dimension from trump and his administration. Please do not get this app. This app needs to be removed from all app stores."}},{"id":"6173425019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:30Z","title":"terrible","userName":"crazy4waffle3646","rating":1,"review":"terrible"}},{"id":"6173424889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:28Z","title":"Worst app","userName":"PePeppa pigg","rating":1,"review":"The app is the worst it take a 10000 years to download and it smell it ruin ur storage:)"}},{"id":"6173424603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:22Z","title":"End the Cheeto","userName":"AshnaGupta","rating":1,"review":"BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020 BIDEN2020"}},{"id":"6173424088","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:20:11Z","title":"Awful","userName":"Chearld06","rating":1,"review":"This app made my phone really slow when I downloaded it.My phone absolutely fine before downloading this app. Do not download this app if you don’t want your phone to mess up"}},{"id":"6173422117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:19:30Z","title":"horrible app !!!","userName":"chicken nebebebebebe","rating":1,"review":"this app is subpar compared to other high quality applications such as tik tok. mr trumpie should be very unhappy with this terribly put together piece of code trash!!! vote blue my little foreigners💖💖💖💖💖💖"}}]}
