So, of course I wanted Barry to fall in love with me, he’s been my number 1 crush ever since I watched the Bee Movie when I was 7 years old. An hour after I downloaded the app, I went to my nearest floral shop to buy all the flowers they could to make sure Barry felt welcomed as well making sure to bring a romantic feel to my home. Sitting in my kitchen, I open the window and wait for Barry to come and fly in. 43 hours pass and every single bug you can imagine has entered my home, but not Barry. I am covered in various bites ranging from mosquito bites, ant bites, and even wasp stings. After another mosquito flew into my home, a bee enters. It’s wearing a yellow suit, but he isn’t Barry. The bee who entered was his assistant; “Barry will be arriving in 45 minutes”. I’m not angry after the long wait because finally Barry B Benson will be coming to me, but I’m sure everyone else who downloaded the app would be furious to find that Barry B Benson didn’t come and had them wait. To prepare for his big arrival, I laid out a red carpet sitting on my window sill out to my kitchen counter, as well as a romantic candle-lit dinner. 45 minutes finally pass and Barry enters. Except it’s not just Barry, it’s the entire Pollen Jock group and every bee on the entire planet. Barry and his entourage swarmed into my home and demanded all of my honey to be taken and given to them. I of course said no because I live off of honey. And I told them that. Seconds after, Barry B Benson took one of my flowers that I previously purchased just for him, and threw it in my face. The rest of the bees proceeded to throw flowers at me and began to sting me all over my body. Barry was yelling and I could barely hear him, “This is life or death. Sting the woman!”. I was scared but the bees came from left and right and under and above. I couldn’t stop them. One last bee stung me, and I blacked out. I surprisingly woke up in the hospital with Barry B Benson flying in front of my face. He told me to never look at bees or honey ever again, and he flew out. I nearly died just because I wanted to see Barry B Benson. I now have to live in a full body cast for the rest of my life and I cannot breathe without a respiratory pump. This app is filled with lies, Barry B Benson will NOT come to you and fall in love, he will try to murder you. I do not recommend.","userName":"🙈s h a w t y🙉"}},{"id":"6178164771","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T20:38:43Z","title":"Angry Hispanic","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Extremely hate you.
