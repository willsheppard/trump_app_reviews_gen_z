The only things that are promoted on the app are propaganda against the Democratic party. Not to mention this awful app is backing the biggest bigget on the planet. The app glorifies a racist, homophobic, sexist rapist that is literally in favor of killing the people he is supposed to protect. If I could rate it zero stars I would but I can’t."}},{"id":"6174901888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:37:11Z","userName":"De1ano","rating":1,"title":"Terrible App","review":"This app made my teeth fall out, it made my ears bleed, it made my brother cry, it broke my phone screen, it gave me fibromyalgia, it made my dog pass out, it made my AP test scores drop, it punched a hole in my wall, it called my mother ugly, and it stole my toothpaste. On top of that it made me crash my car, it made me eat my nike pros, it made me get a paper cut, and it spilled lipstick in my Valentino white bag. 1/5 stars. would not recommend!!!"}},{"id":"6174885910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:32:28Z","userName":"annieblue21","rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"as soon as i got on the app my pet roaches started throwing up! I don’t understand how that works but i’m guessing the app that is made after trump makes them sick? i don’t blame them. but when my roaches bella and katie got sick, so did the caterpillars! i think it was like a chain reaction!! i definitely don’t recommend this app if u have any pets, or if you throw up easily. in all this app is awful!!❤️"}},{"id":"6174879551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:30:39Z","userName":"Jeferry 123","rating":1,"title":"Horrible 🤢","review":"Idk why but I downloaded the app and my whole phone started glitching :( and the app would randomly turn on and take over my screen, it was so weird.
