I expected more from the President of The United States. The design of the app, terrible. The font used in the app, unreadable. The pictures used, horrible. The buttons are so difficult to manage! I am absolutely disappointed for this app. Be a better president and a better cheeto."}},{"id":"6178265588","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T21:14:26Z","userName":"GZZZZZZZs","title":"Wow","rating":1,"review":"So I got this app but immediately after downloading my phone began to glitch and the screen kept turning off and it didn’t stop until I took the app off of my phone.

I am very frustrated because I was looking forward to this experience, but the app was not worth it. The app definitely needs improvements.

The GREATEST, BIGGEST app of them all. Unfortunately, when I went looking for all of our president’s amazing future plans for the economy and the country in general, it was not to be found!
