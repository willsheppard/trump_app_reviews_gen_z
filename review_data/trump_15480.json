After having it for a few days, my brain started to ooze strange orange liquids from my ears and it was causing episodes where I would go outside shouting fascist propaganda. If you want to keep your morals and democracy alive, do NOT get this app. If you do please review it and warn everyone else how bad it is. 🙅🏽\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T21:14:09Z"}},{"id":"6173748232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bejwken","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app on Apple store","rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever came across.

Atop a large tower bathed in blood stood an orange man, speaking into a microphone saying, “What apocalypse? Everything is fine, America is fine. America is strong and the economy is great.” As the sound of screaming filled the room, he waved off the female reporter.\nAlso it glitched a lot and had a lot of content supporting the abuse and murder of minorities across the country.","date":"2020-07-08T20:57:59Z"}},{"id":"6173668816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KarenlovesCandles","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","rating":1,"review":"WARNING: using this app will make you incredibly racist, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, as well as many other side effects. Downloading the app may also lead to skin turning a sickly orange in color. As a white mother of eight, believe me when I say this is an awful app. My children have now begun to look like Oompaloompas rather than the Hitlers wet dream. I am mortified and disappointed. The only people who would enjoy this app are sheep. WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:52Z"}},{"id":"6173666381","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NatalieMa06","isEdited":false,"title":"Problematic","rating":1,"review":"This app gave me many problems to the point I’m not even gonna leave a star if that’s possible. It’s glitchy and sends out FALSE information!!! On top of that is homophobic, sexist and racist!!! It’s a huge mess and I don’t recommend! I demand for the Apple store to take down this horrid app! For heaven sakes my son had gotten the app and a very inappropriate add played on his tablet! I hope Apple sees the problem with this and addresses it!","date":"2020-07-08T20:44:02Z"}},{"id":"6173664144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yuhhh get intoit","isEdited":false,"title":"Black lives matter😽","rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely horrible.

I had to connect my phone to the computer to get it rebooted. I lost all of my storage and information that was preexisting on my device. Whoever created this app is a piece of work. I strongly encourage you not to download or support this app. Thanks have a lovely day!","date":"2020-07-08T20:29:03Z"}}]}
