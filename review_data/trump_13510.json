Trump. But sadly I’ve had it for a week now and I’ve had my many problems with the app. Here are my problems with the app. No matter where I go it is very laggy, it always crashes, the buttons don’t work, it’s attracted my neighborhood cockroaches, and my family has disowned me. So as you can see terrible app and I am deeply disappointed.","date":"2020-06-28T23:17:20Z"}},{"id":"6132335228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kara8899","title":"donny is a clown 🤡","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i wanted to get the app to keep up with the AMAZING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES but actually i was greatly disappointed because the app is garbage and only reminds me that the cheeto in office is only that, a cheeto. and i am greatly encouraging everyone to delete this clowns app 🤡🤡🤡 he is tricking everyone into thinking he is a smart man, when in reality he doesn’t know how to spell genius 😔😔😔 i am very upset and disappointed with the app and i will be promptly deleting it asap","date":"2020-06-28T15:09:50Z"}},{"id":"6119286036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jessie123😂","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I thought this was gonna be a gOoD app from our AmaZinG president, but It asked for my credit card info right when I signed in I was confused then found out this app was to scam people. So if you consider downloading this app, DONT! unless you want someone to get a hold of your credit card info.
