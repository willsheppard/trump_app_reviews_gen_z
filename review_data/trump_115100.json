It\n\nis obvious both have been on it together.\n\nELIO goes to the window and looks down. A car pulls up below,\n\nblowing up clouds of dust, and stops at the villa’s main\n\nentrance. A young man stepsout of the car, wearing a billowy\n\nbright blue shirt with a wide-open collar, sunglasses. Thisis OLIVER, 25.
