Earth. Fire. Air.\n\nLong ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."}},{"id":"6175169787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:02:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","userName":"Natalia Wojcik","review":"Since Trump prides himself and think she is the greatest leader in american history claiming that he can make this country great again even though it was never great in the first place. I would have thought that this app would have exceeded my explanations, but no.... the app was glitching and made my phone spazz out to the point of no redemption. I hope bunker boy and his team realize that everything about them is trash and they can’t even develop an app correctly"}},{"id":"6175150014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:55:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP I HAVE EVER USED","userName":"Megannnnnnnnnnn2017","review":"I got this app so excited to learn about trumps campaign but then as soon as I downloaded it the app spammed me with so many emails and logged onto my bank account and stole all my money including my social security number. Now someone out there has stolen my identity please help. Apple shouldn’t be able to put such a dangerous information stealing app on their store!!!! So many glitches and Bugs. Awful, Disgusting, not functioning, misinforming, app I have ever gotten.

Well my fiancé saw this app on my phone and left me because I’m “racist” and “homophobic” if I support trump. He couldn’t believe that trump could have women supporters. After he left and called off the wedding, I ended up taking our honeymoon alone to Hawaii. On my way to the resort my plane crash landed in the middle of the ocean. Water is rising inside the cabin as I type this now. These will be my last words."}},{"id":"6174885826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:32:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Horrible","userName":"poopsock_32458","review":"Right after opening this app I got a pop up message that said the app could sense that I was a women and I must leave the app immediately because Trump hates woman. Obviously I was frightened by the message so I immediately deleted the app. Ever since I deleted the app I have been receiving horrible texts from Trump himself saying he is going to “curb stomp” my grandmother! My grandmother and I are completely terrified! So please if you are not a straight, cis gendered, white, male DO NOT download this app!!!"}},{"id":"6174865713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:26:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible horrible horrible","userName":"Barb🦄✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️","review":"The app glitched so muchhhhh. I deleted it and downloaded it again and it STILL glitched. Very slow running, and it even shut down my phone a couple times!! After I deleted the app for good, I noticed problems arise within my cellular device that never persisted before. As seen from the other reviews, I’m not the only one to have this problem. Please take this off the App Store, so that no one else has to go through this😡😡😡."}},{"id":"6174864572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:26:19Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DISTURBING IMAGE","userName":"Hal582","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of getting important news about our country. Instead, I was bombarded by a very disturbing image. It was this sickly orange creature with an impossibly wrinkly face. It had the eyes of the devil and hair shaped like a dead guinea pig. It was beyond disturbing and there should be a warning that viewer discretion is advised. No one should have to see that revolting image with no warning beforehand. In fact, no one should see this image period. I demand that this app is taken down immediately for the safety of humanity."}},{"id":"6174853165","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:22:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This App made me Miscarriage","userName":"NotExpecting","review":"I was 5 months pregnant, staying inside and safe, ready for 4 more years of Trump. Then I downloaded this app. Soon after the my morning sickness got worse, the baby stopped kicking, and I lost all sense of appetite. I would play videos of Trump to my baby to try and ready him for this world, but I fear it may have ended my child’s life prematurely. While I was registering to go to the NH Rally, I felt a wetness under my skirt and I knew I had miscarried. I won’t be voting for trump anymore."}}]}
