Then he took firecrackers and started a firework show on our front porch while singing You’re a Grand Blue Flag at the top of his lungs. Later, when I went back to my phone, all of my information was deleted. I think this app is taking my information and storing it in Chinese warehouses.","title":"The WORST","date":"2020-07-09T14:24:16Z","userName":"Kayteyryn","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176893453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app alone took about a week to download onto my phone and another full day to even open. And get this, once it finally opened my eyes began to burn as the picture of an orange man with no hair popped up on my screen, I had to turn away, I almost went blind. I cant believe this app was even made, I don’t understand who would curse this world with such an awful thing.

I was told there would be a letter, there was not. Truly was a sad day. The app crashed my phone. The app erased all my data. It lags. It is not a well put together app. I definitely will be deleting it from my phone.","title":"Disappointed but not surprised","date":"2020-07-09T14:10:37Z","userName":"MegggisMegan","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176840564","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i don’t like this app it’s too stinky. i went into the app to buy some clothes from da political goodwill 😝✨. but the app started stinking thru da phone. the stench got caught up in my nose and i started peeing. i couldn’t help it, it just kept coming out. and then i realized i was peeing on all my money😨. i quickly got up and realized how much money i lost😾. not only can i not pay for da political goodwill clothes but i lost a lot of money. i hope u know how much money you’ve costed me😔. i want my $5 now 😿. after that i had to delete the app, i couldn’t bare to look at my screen tho. but it wouldn’t delete 😰. so i’m stuck with it and sometimes i still pee a little, my mom doesn’t like the smell either, i hope ur satisfied with ruining my life🙄.","title":"😋","date":"2020-07-09T14:02:32Z","userName":"clout._.bunni","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176820650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When i opened the app i saw a big dog covered in cheeto dust. the app is promoting animal abuse and it’s not ok. when i scrolled down i saw a orange Oompa Loompa and it gave me a heart attack i was stuck at the hospital for 4 days. this is not ok and anyone who gets this app will have most likely the same experience. i have heart problems and i almost died from this. delete this app. the manz on dis is fr promoting hate. and wants to delete apps because he is wrong aweee. he’s making america worse😘","title":"jeeznutz","date":"2020-07-09T13:57:17Z","userName":"panqueifa","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176769209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to reserve ticket for the upcoming rally but there some little problems.
