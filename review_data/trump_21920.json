The United States in the last four years have turned into a country that I have so much trouble recognizing. This human is an embarrassment to our country and his app will only continue to spread misinformation and hatred across the US. I challenge Donald Trump to Agni Kai.","title":"Garbage","isEdited":false,"userName":"keegan21lind21","date":"2020-07-09T20:16:41Z"}},{"id":"6178087203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is so horrible. First reason is that he is a rapist and racist. He doesn’t care for minorities and absolutely no one should vote for this orange. Secondly, he is taking human medical rights and treating others as if they weren’t human. Thirdly, he is a danger to society and hasn’t done anything to improve the community for minorities. Fourthly, he has a tiny ding dong and deserves to be dumped in the ocean :)) vote Bernie!!","title":"So bad.","isEdited":false,"userName":"figudjsjd","date":"2020-07-09T20:12:38Z"}},{"id":"6178079833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"You are trying to take down tiktok so we are going to take you down too.
