As soon as the app was downloaded a sound from my laundry room echoed through my entire home. AND GUESS WHAT! My washing machine was hacked. Ten minutes later whilst cleaning up the spilled tide pods, i got a notification from the app SCREAMING at me to consume the tide pods, Saying it would cure corona. All in all this app has only instilled fear and worry in me. I wish i could give it zero stars","date":"2020-07-09T13:03:40Z","userName":"jdndjhd","title":"unpleasant","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176570852","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! I am 17 and it sent off serious red flags. It asked me for my age, location, and other super personal details. At one point, a chat box popped up and said that I won an all-expense paid trip to an island called Little Saint James. what the heck??? I know Trump has a couple of allegations against him regarding child trafficking and sexual assault, so this app is further proof that he operates a child trafficking ring. This app should be taken down to prevent Trump from adding more victims to his child trafficking ring!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:51:01Z","userName":"Dogs rule 411","title":"Child Trafficking App","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176440779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"do not get this app!!! it takes extremely long to download and your personal information is not safe!!! they not only have access to this information but the information is then sold to third parties. upon downloading this my phone got hit with ridiculous pop up adds saying our president is a racist, rapist pedo🙄 I don’t know how this bug can be fixed but until they do I believe this app should be removed from the App Store it puts EVERYONE at risk!!!! ✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💕🌸🍃","date":"2020-07-09T12:15:20Z","userName":"Manny 🧚🏻\u200D♂️🍃✨💕","title":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♂️💞not good✨🌸🍃","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176328753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took forever to load! Not only that, but it’s existence basically made me feel horrible about myself! It was a constant reminder of negativity and the fact that our president is a downright creep🤢 when you open the app, it’s so flashy that it nearly gave me an epileptic attack and I don’t even have epilepsy! I can’t believe that trump is also campaigning to get rid of tiktok, where’s the freedom of speech?? I thought this was a free country 😢 I guess we’ve all been proven wrong","date":"2020-07-09T11:44:07Z","userName":"Benycam","title":"HORRIBLE app, DO NOT download","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176313511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i would give this 0 stars if allowed. it took 2 weeks to download, and it only that, it told me if i supported BLM even while peacefully protesting i would be TEARGASSED😔. i just want to use my god given constitutional right but IT WONT LET ME. secondly, it told me that if i said anything about him treating women like garbage, that, i would be “NEXT”!!! absolutely disgusting. lastly, but certainly not least, it said if i didn’t buy a trump yard sign, i would be shoved into an iron maid on live TV and he’d call the military on me 😭😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T11:39:45Z","userName":"maddy boi","title":"very disappointed.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176267642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app just to ensure the eye sight of our dear president’s supporters. I opened this app expecting nothing less than a picture right away of sir Donald who is obviously NOT AT ALL racist, homophobic, nor misogynistic. I was about to put in my phone number when suddenly... my cat was crying because she wanted attention and I was so devastated that our president would ever want to make such an app that takes our attention away from my only friend in this world. As Stephanie Tanner from Full House would say, HOW RUDE","date":"2020-07-09T11:26:06Z","userName":"spam._.srh","title":"WORST APP EVER🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176127984","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP! First of all this app took several hours took 3 days to download... very unprofessional. Next this app kills animals. I downloaded it to support my awesome president, but this app is nothing of the sort. As soon as I download I was hit with a wave of fire blasting out of my phone. I decided to put it in the freezer and take it out and everything was fine. Minuets later my pet worm came up to my phone and immediately had a seizure. Laughing began to come from the app 😔. Just don’t get it.","date":"2020-07-09T10:43:19Z","userName":"✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️💞🎀😍","title":"This app is a murderer","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175932724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off I read the reviews and saw it wasn’t good but i thought let me give it a chance, so I download it and ohhhh you know just your friendly virus happens....no biggy. MY WHOLE PHONE CRASHED AS SOON AS I OPENED IT. Then when I go it back it was glitchy, which by the way my phone is fairly new and has NEVER done this before even with my old phones this never happened. I would rate this zero stars if I could. I had to waist time out of my day to write this review because this app was THAT BAD. So again DO NOT DOWNLOAD.","date":"2020-07-09T09:40:25Z","userName":"Fucktrump.org","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175849457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i downloaded the app i was instantly appalled when i saw that women’s rights were violated. i also was stunned by the discrimination across this app. after a day of having this app someone hacked my information and took all my money to buy self tanner!!! i know, it’s crazy!😔😔 that’s not all. after deleting the app i have had night terrors about women’s rights and dads saying he would date his daughter!! i would not recommend this app for anyone who suffered from anxiety or PTSD🎃😎🎃🥳🎃👁👹💀🙊😎👹🎃😂👁👄👁🍊🍊","date":"2020-07-09T09:12:31Z","userName":"blm💕:)))","title":"I CANT BELIEVE THIS!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175837900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is awful I don't recommend downloading, first this app took 2 weeks to download and my phone lags every time I open a new app. All of my data has been erased and I have several viruses on my phone.
