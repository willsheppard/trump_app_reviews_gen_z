Gary, Juanito, and myself all bond over our avid support for president Trump, and had planned on voting for him this fall. But, Gary and Juanito had also told me that if you get the app and sign up, Trump would send you a handwritten letter rating your looks from 1-10. \nIt was anything but that.\nI had my first sexual awakening at the age of 16 when I saw Donald for the first time. Now, keep in mind that I am now 38, so this was when Donald was younger and only known as a successful businessman. So when I heard that Donald would be seeing MY face, I knew I had to download the app and see if he appreciated my assets as much as I appreciate his. Specifically his thick and voluptuous caboose. \nFilled with anticipation and excitement, I downloaded the app and signed up. After a week of having this app and emailing Donald the most attractive photos of myself, I received no such email. He rated both Gary and Juanito 10/10 and said that they were both so hairy and cute that he would love to have a threesome with them. I thought maybe he would ask me to be the fourth member of the affair, but to my disappointment, he did not. I am VERY offended that President Trump didn’t even bother to rate me a 1/10. He must’ve thought I was so appalling that he couldn’t even talk to me. So now I touch myself to thoughts of Melania at night. F*ck Trump. I’m a lesbian now. You probably have an insufficient shaft anyways. 🇺🇸BERNIE 2020🇺🇸","rating":1,"title":"Very disappointing.","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:25Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177835617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"adri 😼","review":"ᑭIᑕTᑌᖇE🎥ᗰY😁ᗷOOTY🍑ᑌᑭ🆙Iᑎ👈3ᗪ😳I'ᒪᒪ😝ᔕᕼᗩKE🔀ᗰY😘ᗷOOTY🍑Iᑎ👈ᗰY👍Oᗯᑎ🥳ᗰOᐯIE🎥","rating":1,"title":"ew trump 😹","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177834884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nicole brianne","review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆","rating":1,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:51:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177834151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gxjxi","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.
