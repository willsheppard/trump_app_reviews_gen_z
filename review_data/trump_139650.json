He thinks he’s the best thing since sliced bread, even kind of looks like a saggy loaf of overly buttered bread. How he has not yet been “dealt” with is AMAZING to me. Dude is an idiot. Anyone who votes for him is getting what they deserve by continuing this farce of a presidency.","date":"2020-07-10T05:20:04Z"}},{"id":"6179586442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"barron ❤️","userName":"ChickfilaKelly","isEdited":false,"review":"barron ❤️ add me back on roblox","date":"2020-07-10T05:20:03Z"}},{"id":"6179586480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Not family friendly","userName":"lazorshark6012","isEdited":false,"review":"Trash that’s realy all I have to say but I’m not gonna only say that.

If you’re looking for an old man with a wacky toupee asking for your info then this app is for you. For some reason he wants my data and money but I don’t know him. You see my mom just have all my money to a Nigerian Prince who was trapped and needed help. She was good friends with him but she never heard back after he reclaimed his throne and he’s a poser who forgot who helped him. This app is just like that Prince he’ll take your money and information then ghost you. So lame but I guess I’m used to it by now. Since then my phone is covered in Cheeto dust and laggy AF.","date":"2020-07-10T05:19:56Z"}},{"id":"6179586085","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"To the dusty crusty Cheeto","userName":"nxjsi82883","isEdited":false,"review":"Disgusting.","date":"2020-07-10T05:19:55Z"}},{"id":"6179586028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🤢🤢","userName":"ughugh123","isEdited":false,"review":"literally took 69 years to download, is just a big waste of space honestly. wouldn’t recommend 😡","date":"2020-07-10T05:19:54Z"}},{"id":"6179586036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ew","userName":"150511e","isEdited":false,"review":"This app was making my phone glitch and it was just making my phone crazy and hurt and so was my eye this app ain’t it and it deleting a bunch Co of my important pictures","date":"2020-07-10T05:19:54Z"}}]}
