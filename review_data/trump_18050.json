It is very very sad to see that he is a communist. Communism is just so bad and capitalism is just so good. Very VERY sad to see the extreme communism (which is very bad) expressed by Donald Trump and his team and of course this app. Hope he changes his ways and stops being communism :( 😢","date":"2020-07-09T05:12:07Z"}},{"id":"6175087325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Bruh...","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Sami,w/a_Ī","review":"Homies,  \nI would just like you all to know that app is not worth the space, not because It support the eraser and controlling nature of the current president but that’s it goes against the flag codes, aids a tyrannical government, discrimination against American people’s and information of the American people, and will also track and harbor your information against the 8th Amendment.

TREMENDOUSLY TRASH!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"The_Enlightened.One","review":"This app is very ugly. Bad. The worst. Nothing is worse than this app. The color scheme is atrocious, and it will screw up your device, and your very life! As soon as I downloaded this a meteor came crashing through my ceiling! Coincidence? I think not! This app is obviously CURSED as it brings misfortune to those unlucky enough to download it. This must be fixed immediately!!!! \n\nAnyway have a fantasmic evening🧚🧚🧚👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T03:45:28Z"}}]}
