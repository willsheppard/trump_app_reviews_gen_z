Not only do I have trouble finding everything, I can’t even seem to reach the president. I think that it’s nit okay to not have his direct phone number on the app because we all need to be able to reach him for emergencies. I also just hate the color blue and it’s ALL OVER THE APP. That is why I’m giving g it a 1 Star review.","title":"Hate to break it to you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"bgdrtuojnv f fyi"}},{"id":"6177190435","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:37:09Z","review":"I first open this app to see this ugly AF orange peel in the background🤮 that made me immediately close the app and delete it from my devise. I was then overwhelmed with anger because my eyes had to be exposed to something so hideous. This app is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I am now filled with life long regret and I will forever ask myself, “ why, why must they expose me to such an unpleasant sight?”","title":"Baddie💋😎🔥 w/o the bad✌️✨😻💀","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumps sugar daddy🤑🥰😍"}},{"id":"6177185672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:48Z","review":"This app literally took a week to download. Definitely annoyed. But when I opened the app there were just peaches and oranges everywhere.. like where’s the president. Then once I thought I couldn’t get any worse the second time I used it my phone instantly shut off and I couldn’t open it till a day later. Then the app called me ugly.. it was so rude.","title":"Why is it like that~","isEdited":false,"userName":"ur mom aka joe mama"}},{"id":"6177111960","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:15:17Z","review":"Even before the app fully downloaded, the app sent a pop up image of Trump in skin tight tights which made me very uncomfortable. I finally downloaded the app only to find a piercing sharp sounds that killed by pet hamster and lizard. I have had these pets for a great some of my life and was heartbroken to them turned upside down with their tongues sticking out of their mouths.

I was sad to find out that this app gave me no choices to do so. The app constantly kept kicking me out every 2 minutes and in order to get back in I would have to restart my phone. The pictures on here are extremely pixilated and seem like it took little to no effort to make this app. I DO NOT recommend it to anybody.","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"shegejeheh"}}]}
