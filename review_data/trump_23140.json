Once I got the app working it kept on crashing and it wouldn’t work after anymore.

Gave me a virus!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"gibble star jello","review":"As a person who is very committed to politics, this is by far the worst app I’ve ever encountered. Everything was horrible and I was very offended when the app told me to shut the f up! Then out of nowhere the app said it was gonna give me a virus! I was surprised at the immaturity that this app contained. Now all can say is vote trump out!","date":"2020-07-09T16:27:58Z"}},{"id":"6177366524","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just awful👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😔","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"gEn Z🧚\u200D♀️🥳👀👁👄👁😤","review":"I was open to this app when I first downloaded it but what I saw was awful.
