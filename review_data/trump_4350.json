I downloaded the app to see what’s up with it and my god did I meet a lot of problems. First off the app kept crashing before I had even tried to put my phone number in. I just don’t appreciate an app like this having so many bugs that it just crashes. Ridiculous. And second off what‘a the deal with the jump scares?? I was expecting this to be a fully functioning profession app and when me AND my democratic grandma were looking at it were met by the relaxing car ride video for one of the ads. We were obviously upset. She has heart problems. I thought she was going to pass on. Zero stars.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:43:54Z"}},{"id":"6176951707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"it’s spammed with the annoying orange?!","userName":"adsyeubege","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app so that i could learn more about the trump administration but when i opened it i kept seeing images of a different form of the annoying orange. it was wearing a suit this time and had old man wrinkles (not loving the update). anyway i as o continued scrolling through the app i realized how sexist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, etc. this new version of the annoying orange is. maybe not the best thing to put on the cover of.. anything.. because looking at the new annoying orange, or - to be more clear - Trump, i want to throw up because he is no better than the gum stuck under a new yorkers shoe :)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:31:40Z"}},{"id":"6176888746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My opinion about the app","userName":"karen movement","rating":1,"review":"I honestly wanted to download the app to support our president, the fact that the Gen Z’s ou whatever wanted to take it down is awful, but unfortunately the app does not work whatsoever!! My phone kept glitching after I downloaded it and at first I thought it was my phone but then I saw that the app wouldn’t open, which made me wonder if it was the app, and it ended up being Trump’s app, I do support our president but the app is just not built well!! Don’t download it and if you can, rate it with 1 star so people don’t fall for it like I did!! It also has a lot of ads that lead to pages with virus so be careful!!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:15:10Z"}},{"id":"6176738951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash🤢","userName":"Fairy Godmother👁👄👁","rating":1,"review":"Terrible app, software is bugged making your phone die immediately and you can’t reset it due to the glitch in the system that will only reset it to a update after the change in the software. As soon as I downloaded this app a random white dude appeared and started chanting some weird stuff like, “women don’t work as hard as men therefore equal pay is unequal”, I told the guy to leave because he was bothering a bunch of people but he just snatched my phone and ran down the street😠, wrote this review on a friends phone hoping to keep others from making the same mistake. \nTuck \nFrump \n(Switch the first letters🤭)","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:44Z"}},{"id":"6176738465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusted","userName":"bellabellachi","rating":1,"review":"This app is seriously out of control, immediately after I downloaded it my dog began having severe seizures. I was extremely worried about her well being and am positive that her deadly seizures was karma for me supporting Donald Trump. This should be an absolute embarrassment for Trump to have his name attached to such a problematic app. To think that our own president wouldn’t take the time to fix something that he puts out into the world is revolting. I am absolutely livid with this piece of junk app. Please have it deleted from the app store as no one should have to deal with what i’ve been through. As I was typing this my dog passed away from a seizure.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:35:38Z"}},{"id":"6176669318","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely terrible!!! 😨","userName":"FlutterdashLover6","rating":1,"review":"I got this app because I wanted to show love for our beloved orange pasted President and what better way to do that than download his app. BUT, it took 9 years to download and the actual layout of the app itself is mediocre at best. Also the font and colors just clash terribly, just like his skin and hair color. Also the sections of the app are divided wrongly, just like how he’s divided this country. I am also feeling strange after downloading this app, almost like I’m getting dumber and more complacent. Becoming a sheep if you will. Almost like I’ve joined a cult and that I can’t think for myself. This app ruined my life, don’t get it!!!✨💕🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:17:21Z"}},{"id":"6176546941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"afiufjkgetkk","rating":1,"review":"i got this app to maybe see the president in a new light, but this is not what i expected. i was browsing through the app and suddenly a knock on my front door is heard. i go to answer it and it’s dr spencer reid🥵🤩💓🙉🤴🏻 he tells me i’m in danger bc trump bb is looking for me. we run off together to the bau but we’re not fast enough. h cheeto catches up to me and looks even more horrific in person. 🤢🙈🤣derek morgan tries time stop him but it’s too late. he found me. i scream “ LET BARRON GO🤓👻🤡👿” and he just laughs in my face. then he brings me close and whispers in my ear “u downloaded this app, no u didn’t” and then i woke up!!!!!!

When I came across this app at first I was worried because of all the low reviews but I still gave it a shot & downloaded it. When I downloaded it it instantly took so much storage & data out of my phone I was so upset & curious as to why this happened 😡then once I finally opened the app and started working it it started to lag and freeze my phone !! GO BASED OFF THE REVIEWS AND DO. NOT. DOWNLOAD. IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO ⭐️ REVIEW I WOULD !!!🤬","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T11:05:13Z"}},{"id":"6175967794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is terrible I wasted my time","userName":"liane nia","rating":1,"review":"This app is a waste of space I don’t even know why it’s on the Apple Store I downloaded it to get some information but all it did was a glitch and it took forever to download and give me a necessary information old information was on there nothing new this app is a hoax they killed my dog while I was reading the app my dog passed away. I was hoping to look for some rallies next to me but there was no hole all I did was load even after downloading it was still loading the information wasn’t even relevant it was a waste of time a waste of space So disappointed I hate this app","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:51:55Z"}},{"id":"6175925187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"EW DISGUSTING DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"1smartmommy77","rating":1,"review":"I just looked at the name of the app and knew that it was going to be terrible. Who actually wants to see the human Cheeto with no brain? Why would anyone want to know when his disgusting rallies are and when? Not me! And they should change the sign up screen. It makes me want to barf! I’m actually sick now because I saw that screen! And I have a few suggestions for what will actually make America great again. You should stop being president! That would be amazing! And you should change the name to Dump Trump! It will attract a lot more people and the app would get a lot more attention. It would also get higher ratings.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T09:37:54Z"}}]}
