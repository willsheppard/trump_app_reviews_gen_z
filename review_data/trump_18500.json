I normal don‚Äôt write reviews for apps, but I made an exception for this abomination of all apps. Everything written on it are full of lies, that make me want to vomit. It does not update its user often, so many of the applications are not available. Don‚Äôt waste your storage on this one. This app made me hate Trump. #Biden2020"}},{"id":"6173620920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:27:51Z","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"wnduejebbddjn","review":"This app is horrible. It took so long to download. I went to walk my caterpillar and it still wasn‚Äôt downloaded. Additionally the colors on the app the word ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù induce intense nausea and body aches. Once the app downloads you are taken to a page where there is a hideous orange man with his fist up and it will immediately make you vomit. That man is so hideous. -20/10 would not recommend this app."}},{"id":"6173616083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:26:07Z","title":"Don‚Äôt download!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"death slip","review":"This app made me feel so sad when it turned my dog into an 18 year old child, I cannot control him and he now has the the ability to vote, he‚Äôs still marking better decisions than most Americans but he is a dog, and I would like him back. Also it made me trade out all my adult beverages for white claw, and all my nerf guns are now loaded with 115 gr jacketed hollow points, DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!"}},{"id":"6173616014","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:26:05Z","title":"Glitches A lot","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"SamanthaLy123","review":"i know that there are a lot of kids giving one star reviews because of tiktok, but the app actually did make my phone glitch and after a while the app wouldn‚Äôt even open at\nall.

It doesn‚Äôt even deserve one star. It gives you information that isn‚Äôt even true. You DO NOT need this app. It‚Äôs terrible. This app will help you with nothing. It‚Äôs a shame that apple still lets this app exists, because it‚Äôs useless. Just don‚Äôt get this app and it will help you more then getting it."}}]}
