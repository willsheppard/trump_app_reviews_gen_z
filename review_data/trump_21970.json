I tried opening the app several times only to have it crash before I even got started! I even tried deleting and redownloading the app but that didn’t work either. Where am I going to get my conservative propaganda from now?!😫","date":"2020-07-09T16:25:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177298880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ciara38","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely terrible app. Do not download","review":"Much like the president runs this country, this app runs poorly. Drains your battery, won’t load, multiple ads. I’m pretty sure the 5g that the app uses to run gives you cancer. Please let your all your friends and family know this app is absolutely awful","date":"2020-07-09T16:08:29Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177290143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"barron's clone","isEdited":false,"title":"só bad","review":"bruh this app is so bad i wanted to get it so i could keep up with the news and the great ideas of trump but this app is so slow and terrible quality. ever since i got it my life has been miserable like my bf broke up with me and when i was walking down the stairs after i tripped my leg ripped off. but when i started getting up my teeth fell out so i couldn’t say what happened to the doctors. then when i was driving home i saw barron trump yelling at his mom and then i ran over a squirrel. ugh being a trump supporter is too hard i can’t take it anymore. -_-","date":"2020-07-09T16:05:59Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177285931","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bigmouth_1997","isEdited":false,"title":"Dont get this app","review":"I got this app because yk i wanna know whats going on. But this gave my phone a virus. It shut down everything. Deleted all my contacts all my apps that I downloaded and deleted all my pictures. So I do not recommend getting this app. It wipes out everything. And it also has a virus.","date":"2020-07-09T16:04:46Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177279854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"corn_flake_luvr420","isEdited":false,"title":"this app isn’t it✨🌳","review":"corn_flake_luvr420:\ni downloaded the app to keep up with the tramp i mean trump news and every time i was on it, it took flicks of me when i would go to the br. fun right ! no. ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆. and then my mom came home from the store and said the app stole vbucks from her roblox acct","date":"2020-07-09T16:03:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177250003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Serena🔥","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE APP","review":"I really regret downloading this app. I hate the colors used and it doesn’t match my aesthetic. Doesn’t even offer night mode which is disgusting. Poor design. It also asks for your phone number?? That’s our fascist government invading our privacy and our ✨first amendment rights✨! Would give 0 stars if possible.","date":"2020-07-09T15:54:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177243103","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"veruca_salt_likes_squirrels","isEdited":false,"title":"So disappointed!","review":"I am super bored in quarantine right now, so I decided to download some games. As it turns out, this is just some app promoting a (fake) blonde Oompa Loompa trying to run for president of the chocolate factory? Personally, I would vote for Willy Wonka because he is inclusive and anti-racist. This guy has reportedly been really racist towards the non-orange Oompa Loompas. This app should get zero stars!","date":"2020-07-09T15:52:18Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177237030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kekjfidieie","isEdited":false,"title":"Just Horrible","review":"Glitchy, does not work well, takes up an insane amount of space on my phone and constantly crashes. not to mention extremely poorly made and a horrible app for “news” constantly spreading false information.","date":"2020-07-09T15:50:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177218135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Curry_danger202. yt","isEdited":false,"title":"Software (tictoc)","review":"I thought I might be able to support trump but when I went on the app I completely lost faith in what he can do. Like the app started asking for personal information and it started to make me feel as if it was a plan just to get my information and give me spam content.","date":"2020-07-09T15:45:02Z","rating":1}}]}
