I’m afraid this app is a trap created by the Trump administration to expand the cases of Corona virus in the United States. By downloading this app, Trump is able to infect more innocent people with the virus which is a technique to reduce the population. My life is now on the line. Unless you want to catch the corona virus and die, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!","userName":"Karen😠","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app😡😡"}},{"id":"6136857867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T18:07:56Z","review":"The second I opened the app my phone glitched up and hundreds of my photos were deleted.

This app told me I am a ... “monkey” I don’t know how it knew I was black but I will never support again.

I feel like this failed. It’s not a GREAT App. It’s Not The Greatest App On The AppleStore. I feel like it’s misrepresented of what this app really is. Has a lot problems to fix. Apple you should let this app go. I hoped for something \n\nBetter.. \nLost hope in this app pretty quick.\nMoral is that this app is bad.","userName":"BeliebersRauhl","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Highly Unsatisfied"}}]}
