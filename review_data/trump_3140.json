Thats when everything went haywire my mom came running downstairs and climbed the ceiling while barking like a dog. I knew what I had to do right before I got up I heard a thump at the door and I answered it when I opened the door all I saw was orange I looked up and I saw a HUGE face with little hair on his head. Before I did anything he kicked me back in the house with his carrot like feet.🥕🥔 I almost had a heart attack . I ran past him outside and there was TONS of carrot people dancing with 🐇 rabbits outside. I ran back in to get my phone and deleted the app. Everything went back to normal. DONT GET THIS APP.

Again with the glitches I can not connect Bluetooth devices to my device. I started seeing this when I first downloaded this app to my device. Another glitch when I opened the app I saw a orange 🍊 on my screen I was so scared I threw my device and it got a huge crack! Fix this app I was so scared I think you would if you saw a big orange 🍊 on your screen. Please fix the glitches, or better delete the app from App Store.","isEdited":false,"userName":"jala diop","title":"WORST APP,DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T14:55:59Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172298454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app solely to get the biased and bigoted news that come from it but I notice a feature it had and it interested me. I clicked a red button, not knowing what it was, and that’s when my life turned upside down. When I clicked the button a picture of each member of my family came up and next to each one was a date. As the first date drew nearer I started to get more and more anxious. Finally the day came and when I woke up my brother was DEAD. This happened with every single member of my family. WHO MAKES AN APP THAT KILLS PEOPLE???? Now I am living on the streets and scrubbing gum off peoples shoes for a living. All in all a HORRIBLE app and no one should EVER consider downloading it 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"nash18382","title":"This app killed my family","date":"2020-07-08T13:41:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172074068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"😡😡😡DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! As soon as I downloaded it, it took me to an orange loading screen and said “please wait.” This went on for about 15 minutes. Once it finally downloaded, it closed me out of the app and I was back at my home screen! I tried to go on it again, but this time my phone started glitching a lot. I then deleted the app and re downloaded it to see if it would fix itself. When I tried again, my phone SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY!! I couldn’t turn it back on so I charged it for the night. The next day, it still couldn’t turn back on so I had to go to Apple. ALL OF MY INFORMATION WAS WIPED OFF OF MY PHONE!! I had to get a whole new phone and had to pay it in full and everything!

Upon downloading it, the first photo to pop up was of a carrot... I was so confused. I was expecting a photo of our current president but I guess a carrot and Trump go hand-in-hand.  It asked to send me notifications, which is always a burden. After having the app for a few days. Everything started turning orange... like everything... I started having nightmares of Trump telling me coronavirus wasn’t real (even though I know people who had it in December). I started losing sleep and started to look worse and worse. My skin became pale and I look sickly. So I started using self tanner. Now instead of just seeing orange.. I am orange. DO NOT GET HIS APP! YOU WILL ALSO BECOME ORANGE!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jessica2467","title":"Trash","date":"2020-07-09T18:57:33Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177817313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app because my friend told me it would automatically ship a Hot Topic gift card to my house which it did NOT do😡 When I opened the app all I saw was this ✨😾 NAKED ORANGE🤢🍊 I was so horrified that I proceeded to throw my phone out the window 😤 It fell into the concrete and broke 😢 that’s why I am currently writing this review on my brother's phone 📱I have had reoccurring nightmares where I was being kidnapped by Mr. Cheeto😱 After a week of these dreams I woke up to him on top of me😭 But as soon as I screamed he vanished...The only way he could’ve found me was through this app😳 This app tracks your location so the Creepy orange dude can try to kidnap you🤯 I ☠️HATE💩👿 this app and want to 🥰die🧚🌷because of all the trauma this app caused me 👎","isEdited":false,"userName":"Gen-Z✨🧚","title":"No~❤️","date":"2020-07-09T18:45:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177783186","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This crashes every two seconds, and made my phone battery die so quickly. As soon as I opened the app I was greeted by a giant orange thumb and immediately vomited and threw my phone. This baby bunker boy doesn’t believe in freedom and justice for all, and is attempting to ruin the melting-pot-mentality that this country was built upon. I am ashamed to be an American, especially a white American in this political climate. Donald Trump is a sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamiphobic, and so much more. Can’t you see he’s afraid? He can’t see that he is the WORST person to be making decisions for everyone in America. Baby bunker boy needs to get out and go to jail. He raped children and he’s our president? That is sick and twisted.","isEdited":false,"userName":"SUPAHCOOOOO","title":"This app made me throw my phone","date":"2020-07-09T18:35:44Z","rating":1}}]}
