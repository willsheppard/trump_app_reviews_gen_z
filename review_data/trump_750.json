I got the app so I could keep up with our president but it just sent ICE to my house. They took me to Antarctica and forced me to dance around the fire. There were monkeys everywhere and I had to fend for myself after they abandoned me in the ocean. Cat Noir managed to find me and he took me to Mars. We were safe until the police walked up where we were and we had to escape our safe haven. We met Bakugo and he blew up the police but it wasn’t enough. They captured him and took him to the president. He wanted to murder him but I pleaded to take his place. I did persuade him to switch us but he decided to hang me by my hair and made me swing around the White House. It was terrible until the Avengers saved me. We lived somewhere remote until it all passed. The app is also incredibly glitchy and it kicked me out because I am not white. Very disgusting, I thought you said ‘All Lives Matter’. But overall, I highly recommend to not download this app.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:23:01Z"}},{"id":"6175431786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"leah🥰✊🏾💙","rating":1,"title":"The worst😰😩🤬","review":"For this review I give this app a one out of five because, first problem is that it Asked for my phone number and I feel like that is unnecessary nor professional to do especially when you install an app because I don’t like giving out my personal information like that especially on the Internet because stuff can happen. Another  problem that I don’t like about this app is the fact that it almost hacked my device. Once I install this app it almost hacked everything personal or anything else on my device and I don’t feel like that was OK, because once I deleted the app everything went back to normal but that also makes me insecure and uncomfortable with other apps that I have because what if that’s happening towards me like it just happens with this app? I would not recommend this towards anyone because I don’t want anybody that I recommended it to,to get their device hacked or haveThe same problems I was having with this app as well.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T06:41:53Z"}},{"id":"6175264132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rs334","rating":1,"title":"Hide","review":"Need a drink?\n(Hoo, ayy, ayy)\nFound my home (Ooh, ooh)\nShe made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine\nReally think I found my home\nShorty make me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home\nAnd I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control\nI'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls\nBut we're fine with it\nThere's love at my front door, short notice\nYou're not like the same girls I notice\nThink I met my soul mate\nYeah, I know it\nWhen it gets dark outside\nIn you I confide\nYou help me face my demons\nI won't hide, hide\nGirls like you are hard to find\nI hope you don't mind\nIf I give you the time of your life, life, life\nReally think I found my home\nShorty make me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home\nAnd I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control\nI'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls\nBut we're fine with it\nLife is not the same\nWith your pictures in my frame\nNow that you're here\nI want nothing to change\nYou pick me up when I'm down\nI need you around\nYou seen me through my darkest times\nGirl, is there something that you try to find?\nYou brought meaning to my life\nAll because of you, I do right\nBecause of you, I have a purpose\nFight for the world, because you're worth it\nReally think I found my home\nShorty make me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home\nAnd I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control\nI'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls\nBut we're fine with it","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:37:05Z"}},{"id":"6175002175","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"#mopa #black lives matter","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in the lack of respect that our president has towards the minority. He has called COVID-19 the “China virus” and has said that black people are “low lives.” He is supposed to be our president, and with being the president you are supposed to lead and respect the citizens of your country but he does the exact opposite.   He has continuously proven that he is racist, homophobic, a hypocrite and also a sexual predator that has sexualized his own daughter in an interview. In the interview the man asked “ what’s your favorite thing about your daughter” and he responded “ her legs.” Instead of saying something about her intelligence or her personality he compliments her physical appearance in her lower region. I’m astonished at how low America’s standards have gone. I hope that we can escape this president and thrive with a president that believes in equality and respects the citizens of the United States, and who finally leads us into freedom and JUSTICE for all. \n#blacklivesmatter #justiceforbreonnataylor \n#justiceforvanessaguillen #justiceforfloyd","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:08:21Z"}},{"id":"6174982429","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"monica🍼","rating":1,"title":"app ruined my life!","review":"this app ruined my life. one night, around 11am, i was in my room, walking home, on my way to work! it was the fourth of july, around wintertime, during a thunderstorm, and i was stinky so i took a shower, in my sink, and then this app made my phone get up and jump inside the sink. so my grandma placed my phone on a towel, in canada, and then started to shake it so aggressively, it flow outside and got on the satellite dish, and landed in florida! when i found it, i was looking for it, eating canned beans. and my sister lost my phone, and gave it to me while trying to find it! sooner or later, i can control boys with my phone! and then my dogs birthday was coming up yesterday, and i wanted to give him a digital picture, so when i asked this app to draw it for me, they drew the picture in SPANISH! thats why i dont like michelle musso, speaking of musso, this app attracted mooses to my oos, like my oreos, which i was drinking. so i had to remove the moose and i removed the app after all this happened. so disapaointed💔💔💔💔💔💔💔","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:02:02Z"}},{"id":"6174849889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"upgradedsusan","rating":1,"title":"worse than going over to your friends house and not being brave enough to ask for a blanket","review":"Apparently trump doesn’t care abt this nation at all, if he wanted to run for president he could at least make an app that doesn’t delete all the photos off your phone when u download it🤬. When I met him I thought he was a little mean, I mean I haven’t told anybody this yet bc I didn’t think anybody would believe me but he spit on my sons face and told him to say thank you. LIKE WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOES THAT TO AN 8 year old boy??? I wasn’t aware of this since my son hadn’t told me until we got home but if I’d known sooner than I wouldn’t have let him talk to my son in private. This app will hack your phone and let the government access all of your information, my phone suddenly is freaking out and is super slow. I no longer support trump, I keep hearing stories of him telling disabled children in wheelchairs that they should stand up and exercise, and only then would he think abt touching them. Vote trump OUT 2020.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T03:21:59Z"}},{"id":"6174183059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hrhejshdhdhddhdhhd","rating":1,"title":"Poopoo man 👨 I am a roomba","review":"I got app and it turned me into lettuce with eggs on it and a taco levitated over me and said “ I am your master, give this app 1 star “ so I did then a pineapple started a zoom call with me and this a crappy trump ad that had a garlic bread with door bits sprinkled on top and I ate it and I started to go blind and lost eyesight and went to sleep then respawned next to my bed filled with helmets and the helmets stacked on top of each other to create a monster the gave me the 👌 symbol and slapped me onto the moon and I did not die of fall damage and a pink alien with trumps face and I farted on me and said die  I think it was toxic because it smelled bad and I had 2 and a half Minecraft hearts left so I got my ender pearl and threw it anywhere but here and it landed in end portal and teleported me to Uranus so NASA the end is on Uranus I need your help defeating the trump Minecraft dragon on Uranus help me anyone anyways I am safe I dig myself a hole and apparently there is cellular service here anyways I see why it is 17+ because this is scary and I want my mommy bye","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:55:54Z"}},{"id":"6173927642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Karen Kutlery","rating":1,"title":"Do NOT download this app!","review":"I was very excited to download the app and get more information about the upcoming election/our President’s campaign, but I was very dismayed by the results. Not only did it take about 6 days to download, but once I opened it I think it created some sort of virus on my device! I was getting infinite notifications and pop-ups asking for my location even though I continued to hit decline. After a while, all of the app icons on my phone were changed into the Trump logo, even the default Apple ones. Once I deleted the app, my phone battery was beginning to drain incredibly fast and wouldn’t hold a charge. I even left it overnight to charge and my battery nearly burst into flames!! Besides that I have few other complaints, except that the app is incredibly ugly to look at, unintuitive, and cluttered. I hope no one else wastes their time trying to use this app and instead tries to use a rock for their information, as it will be much faster and accurate! Thank you","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:21:00Z"}},{"id":"6173393685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"scornrose","rating":1,"title":"Worst decision ever","review":"The very moment I tried to download this app my car caught on fire and exploded. Then when I went to go deal with that a swarm of locusts attacked me right when I stepped out the front door. After that I went back inside to see if my new app was done installing, my cat died right in front of my newborn toddler who was absolutely devastated. My husband then came home and immediately divorced me, claiming that I let some sort of voodoo magic take over our lives. I questioned what he meant by that when I received a phone call saying my credit card was compromised and I now owe the bank $40,000. Not used to seeing me in such a state of disarray, my toddler ran away from home, happy to be out of such a toxic environment. Alone and helpless, I fell to my knees asking God what I did to deserve this. Then I heard my phone ping that the app was done installing. I opened it up only to find one singular page that said, “MAGA: Make All Go Away” and then I died instantly 0/10 would rate 0 stars if possible","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:09:38Z"}},{"id":"6172819792","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"keylaq","rating":1,"title":"Ewwww no snake awful 🐍🤡🙎🏿\u200D♀️✨","review":"When I opened it the first thing I saw was a horrific orange 🍊 I couldn’t believe my eyes I almost fainted from the sight of that! #cancelthis app it was horrible it caused my grandma to die.
