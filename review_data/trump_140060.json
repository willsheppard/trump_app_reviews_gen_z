Thanks for\ncoming.\nThe Lorax CLEARS his throat and reads from a card he holds.\nLORAX (CONT’D)\nI am the Lorax. I speak for the\ntrees.\nAnd I’d like to say a few words, if you please,\nRegarding the story that you’re ‘bout to see--\nIt actually happened--just take it from me.\nBut there’s more to this story than what’s on the page,\nSo please pay attention while I set the stage.\nThe Lorax tosses the card at the audience and walks off as the curtain opens, revealing Thneedville.\nEXT. THNEEDVILLE - DAY\nTWO MAINTENANCE WORKERS work on a large “Welcome to Thneedville” sign. The slogan below it reads, “Fantastic! Made of plastic! 100% Inorganic.” The camera pushes past them and flies through the town, down to a suburban street.\nLORAX (V.O.)\nWe open in Thneedville, a city,\nthey say,\nThat was plastic and fake, and they liked it that way.\nA Town Without Nature. Not one living tree.\nSo what happened to them?\nCue the music!\nLet’s see...\nEXT. THNEEDVILLE - PRESENT - MORNING\nSONG: “THNEEDVILLE”\nThe MUSIC starts up on a LONG SHOT down the street of Thneedville suburbs.\n\nDr. Seuss' The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 2.\nAll of the houses look basically the same. Electric trees line the streets instead of street lamps.\nAn O’Hare Air delivery truck drives down the street.\nFLOOSH! An INFLATABLE PLASTIC BUSH inflates. FLOOSH! Another. FLOOSH! Another. Then--\nPOP! a bed of PLASTIC FLOWERS pops up in time with the music complete with PLASTIC BUZZING BEES attached to wires.\nPLASTIC BEES (mechanical voice)\nBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!\nThe DELIVERY MAN gets out of the truck and grabs an air bottle from it. He replaces an empty, used air bottle with a new one like a milkman.\nTITLE CARD: DR. SEUSS’ THE LORAX\nEXT: TED’S HOUSE - PRESENT - SAME\nNearby, TED, an 11-year-old boy and our hero, hops out of his second floor bedroom window, down a series of stairs, and flips over the railing into the air and lands on his SCOOTER.\nHe snaps on his goggles, revs his engine, and takes off down the street. PULL BACK TO A WIDE SHOT of the entire neighborhood.\nAll of the front doors of the houses open simultaneously and the PEOPLE OF THNEEDVILLE exit their houses singing happily.\nTbh: we never talk and i hate you. Rate: -5/10💯\nsincerely,\nSHECKWESMOM ❤️","title":"i contracted hemorrhoids from this app💔","userName":"queef queen👑","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:06:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179545066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"he’s a terrible, unbelievable, trash, waste of a man.","title":"VOTE AGAINST TRUMP","userName":"nooooooosir","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:06:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179545030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s 😔awful😣 it’s 😢bad🤨 it’s 😟not😕 cool😒 it’s 🙁disgusting 😠it’s 😞just☹️ eww😶 it’s 😐so 😑bad 😬why 😪did🙄 y’all😲 make😵 this 😾","title":"Worst app ever","userName":"itz just kayla","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T05:06:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179544997","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app and I suddenly started getting so many scam phone calls after I put my number in!!!

When I opened the app I saw a HORRIBLE picture of cheeto 🟠 and I was disgusted 🤮because it was soo gross 🤢. Then a video of Cheeto screaming and yelling to vote for him popped up. When I saw the video I was scared and fell off my bed. And then I went in a coma for 2 years. But when I woke after 2 years of coma, I went on my phone the app immediately opened on its own and then there was a video of Cheeto playing golf but while he was playing he purposely threw the golf ball at my phone and then my phone suddenly melts.
