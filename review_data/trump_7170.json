Took years to download to my phone and took up a lot of unnecessary data. This app is unhelpful and gives me no information on why we should vote for trump (though there are not any reason why we should Bc he’s a awful person and a rapist, and racist)I would not recommend this app to anyone, not a soul. There’s nothing on here that you will need for this election. But go vote and get this idiot out of office. Thanks from genZ.","date":"2020-07-08T18:03:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173175179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"My   Caterpillar","userName":"hahncjx","review":"I had just finished teaching my caterpillar how to do some Fortnite dances, when I thought it be a good time to check out some of Donald Trump‘s websites. Wow is checking them out, a lot of it seems really fascist. I didn’t want to believe that our greatest president could be a fascist, so I checked out the news for a second opinion the news did not help. I downloaded this app, as a final testament to my republicanism but then I realize there is nothing left for us if we voted to Trump. My pet caterpillar promptly followed up with a fortnight dance on this app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:56:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173148301","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"xxvvccfd","review":"This app made my phone crash and I can’t get back into any other apps. Also when I opened to find reasons why I should like trump, it took me out of it. And I kept trying and trying to get back in but it just wouldn’t work, I needed to get my phone fixed because there’s no point to a phone that doesn’t open any apps. And that cost $150 and after we got it fixed I logged in again and it still wouldnt let me in. So over all I would give this app 0 stars but that’s not possible so here I am.","date":"2020-07-08T17:48:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173135751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Not that good","userName":"keegan russell","review":"After entering the woods I discovered a large hole, I’m not sure to how this hole arrived with in the woods but it sure did. Why is a hole in the woods, clearly it was the leftover of something being removed, crazy and I right, so anyway last night at dinner I came up with this idea to get a noodle cake made out of ramen, your probably thinking to yourself oh my goodness this review is giving me a stroke at my answer to that is\nSo the other day I was asking my friend who was from a little town called witchhetaw which is actually where I is from, nope","date":"2020-07-08T17:44:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173125371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"What the actual what?!?!?","userName":"ocean.breezy","review":"This app is the worst app I have ever seen, It says sooo much fake news, and caused my family to divorce, and all friendships to be ruined. I have to burn my phone after this app has been on it, it’s that bad. My dogs won’t even come to me. I think this app is a relationship breaker, and I think Its a curse to own this app, because my cat whiskers died while I was using this app, And my soul died during this app was being used. Overall the experience is terrible, It  doesn’t even talk about China, or Russia. Terrible just terrible.","date":"2020-07-08T17:40:51Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173115569","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","userName":"Rowan Meier","review":"This app is honestly one of the worst things to go on my phone and that’s saying something. The app was scary, it made me cry constantly. Every time I opened my phone I was struck with horror just at the mere sight of the application. It gave me nightmares and I had to sleep in my parents bed for 69 days. How terrible! My sister also downloaded this app and she is now in a mental institution because of the terror produced by this scary application. My poor poor family many never recover from the shock and fright brought by this terrible creation perhaps from satan himself!","date":"2020-07-08T17:37:46Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173088706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This app sucked my toes... metaphorically and physically","userName":"Softball123456789736373","review":"To be honest I have never felt more violated by any single app on this App Store. The second the 17 hour download was complete I immediately noticed that 58% of my brain cells died and I grew an extra toe on the side of my left foot... it’s one of those things where it would have been an inconvenience but not unbearable if it had grown in a normal place of where a toe could be seen however the odd and incredibly inconvenient placement on the side of my foot has left me with no choice but to leave a one star review...","date":"2020-07-08T17:29:09Z","isEdited":false}}]}
