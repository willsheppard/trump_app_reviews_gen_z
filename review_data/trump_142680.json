If you truly consider yourself a patriot, you should know that this man isn’t fit to be president.

The app asked for all kinds of personal information which made me feel very violated. The app basically destroyed my phone and I'm just trying to look out for y'all by posting this.

This app took FOREVER to download when I have more than 100 GB’s free. I downloaded it to keep up with “actual” news than that “fake news” CNN. Then it started deleting and getting into my PRIVATE text and giving it to the Chinese government. What kind of president gives us hard working Americans privacy and rights to the commies. Very disappointed in our president","rating":1}},{"id":"6179274939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:35:09Z","userName":"hdjrjenebebd","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really expecting a lot more but when I first opened the app I notification popped up and that was annoying then it showed me a really ugly picture.","rating":1}},{"id":"6179274779","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:35:06Z","userName":"UnicornCatNoir","title":"please read, important info 😔💔","review":"okay, so i downloaded this because i most certainly support Rump— er, ‘scuse my slip-up— Trump. i TOTALLY do. definitely. and as soon as i opened it, i got rickrolled 😤😭😭 i am absolutely disgusted. and then, after the video of the legendary Rick Astley went away, it told me that i’m nothing but a stupid shorty???
