My phone significantly slowed down, and I couldn’t really even swipe between pages. At random times the app would just open, and sometimes music would play that made my dogs bark. I made an important call, and the app opened and ended my call."}},{"id":"6173274129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:29:10Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"larry huckbly","review":"THIS APP WAS HORRIBLE AND DIDN'T FUNCTION AT ALL. I am extremely dissatisfied as it just gave me fake news and spread lies! My cat came over while I was using it and she CRIED MY CAT CRIED. This app made my cat cry! Then this app started playing music summoning a bunch of rats! These rats tried to overthrow me and my family! They even tried to overthrow my cat! They kicked us all out and threw our stuff in the porch! I have never been so disgraced! Very very dissatisfied"}},{"id":"6173273070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:28:48Z","title":"DONT GET IT","userName":"harry styes","review":"I already wrote a review but really just want someone to notice!!!!

I tried opening the app and it locked my phone up each time I tried. Another thing, just why are we voting for Trump again? He’s already had his turn! It’s like toys. It’s no fun unless you share! There’s not really much more to write because the app won’t even work. So I’m saying delete and good riddance! (it took up to much storage anyway!)😡"}},{"id":"6173270881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:28:04Z","title":"Very bad.","userName":"rebcoiere","review":"As I was opening the app it took about 15-20 minutes. When the data finally loaded it was very unclear to where to find the daily information about what’s going on etc. I don’t always have the time to check and view the news so i rely on this app. This app is very Unuseful And disappointing. Trump 2020 app as no business being on here.  Kanye West 2020🇺🇸✊. Trump=🍊👹"}},{"id":"6173257333","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:38Z","title":"No❤️","userName":"🧚\u200D♂️✨❤️","review":"I downloaded this app because i wanted to support our racist homophobic orange president 🧚\u200D♂️✨ however, as soon as i opened the app this orange monster appeared. I think this app sold my information to telemarketers because i keep getting phone calls in the middle of the night by random numbers. This app took forever to download and it glitches. A new software update is needed. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6173245331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:19:39Z","title":"This app is horrible😡🍊","userName":"MOST BEST REVEIW EVER","review":"When I downloaded it my phone started to glitch out and then my phone turned off and on top of that my phone was over heating.

Doesn’t specify what you should do. hard to function in Ofer words don’t bother downloading it and if you don’t believe me just read the rest of the reviews my family has also downloaded it and they didn’t have a wonderful experience."}},{"id":"6173225337","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:13:01Z","title":"This app killed my dog","userName":"General Uhte","review":"I wanted to download this app to praise master orange but once I opened it spiders were coming out of my phone!!! 🕷👄🕷 they started chanting “trump 2020” and I couldn’t kill them. My dog was freaking out because an orange man then appeared in my house. He started chucking oranges and Cheetos in my face and one of the oranges unfortunately killed my dog 🙀😿😾. I do NOT recommend this app as it was terrifying and I’m so very sad now 😓😓."}},{"id":"6173201694","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:05:09Z","title":"To all Boomers","userName":"karen420blm","review":"This app caused my grandma to die. She was a republican and supported Trump with all her heart. And she wanted to download the app to support him. It took 69 hours to download. It was a waste of time. My grandma reviewed the app and realized how immature the President is and racist. She was so sad and disappointed that she died. I just wanted to say that to all the racist republicans, look at how disappointed my grandma was because of this app and your president."}}]}
