I can’t take it I can’t find ANYTHING. It also hacked my phone!! I should’ve read the reviews I heard that it did the same for some other people later on but god🙄","date":"2020-07-10T06:56:56Z"}},{"id":"6179849706","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ebettty","title":"Gen zzz","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I do not support this racists, rapist, clown of a human being. Not only is he a terrible president but he is trying to take away an app where many kids grow up, spend time, and learn. It's different when you grow up in different generations because there are so many new things coming out all at once and it's hard to compare. As a part of gen-z we are powerful and can cancel anyone","date":"2020-07-10T06:56:55Z"}},{"id":"6179849696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"eva.jaq","title":"Awful!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Something weird happened when I downloaded the app!!

I had a few of my friends get the app as well to see if it was maybe just my phone, but they had the same exact issue, all of our phones are less than a year old so it is not due it issues concerning the age of the phone. Overall I am extremely unimpressed and I do not recommend this app to anyone!","date":"2020-07-10T06:56:43Z"}},{"id":"6179849122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"loreandjackmucci","title":"No.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"No. Just no.","date":"2020-07-10T06:56:43Z"}},{"id":"6179848962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dashawng","title":"Why would some one get this","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was outside tommorow and it’s my sisters birthday is yesterday so my girlfriends boyfriend got her a present so tommorow when she opened it she was in shock cuz she got a dildo and then I saw this app and I downloaded it to be disappointed because I didn’t see a orange as expected","date":"2020-07-10T06:56:40Z"}}]}
