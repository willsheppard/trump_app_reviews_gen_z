And I have never been more appalled of a president in all of my life. He hides behind his stupid title like a coward and when the people call him out guess what, he claims “fake news” and hides again. Such a horrible and unqualified person shouldn’t even be running in office. We need a reset button for the entire election.","userName":"Mermaid Princess Flower Power"}},{"id":"6174034736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DELETE THIS APP NOW!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:01:17Z","review":"this app has offended me so much and it is sooo disrespectful 🤮! as soon as i open it i see a disgusting orange figure 😰😰 and my eyes start to literally BLEED 😤. i think that this app is a danger to society not to mention the quality is terribleeeee. please please please delete this app from the app store i don’t want anyone else to go through the ✨suffering✨ i’ve been through 😞 NO ONE DESERVES THAT. i wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy ❤️","userName":"Huururududhdhd"}},{"id":"6174029923","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrendous","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:59:30Z","review":"Absolutely horrendous app! I downloaded the app and the moment the picture of that Cheeto puff popped up on my screen, my whole phone turned orange! The spray tan off of that Cheeto puffs skin has infected my whole phone, making it turn orange, even the screen! This is very unacceptable!
