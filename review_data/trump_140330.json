App is super buggy and takes up too much storage space from your phone. It was also making my phone run hot while using it.

After it downloaded (it took forever) it asked for my social security number and credit card to create an account. I did it, but then I got a bunch of charges on it and had to cancel because I lost a lot of money. I’m sure I took it out of context though, because President Trump would NEVER do anything bad. \n\nAfter the weird login, it redirected me to a page with President Trumps leaked n00ds. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to see that.\n\nAfter that, it gave me 23 and 1/2 viruses and a list of all the “racist” things the Fake News Media and the left claims Trump said.\n\nThen my grandma died!! She was perfectly healthy and only 59. I miss her so much, and I think this app might have something to do with it because it happened a few hours after I downloaded the app.\n\nI broke my arm and my wife divorced me. \n\nThen Trump came out of my phone and ate my pet Komodo dragon!!!\n\nI think the app causes bad luck.\n\nAnyways, Trump 2002🇱🇷🇱🇷 the libs are just snowflakes ❄️","userName":"thisappisfakelol","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:56:32Z","title":"Trump 2020🇱🇷🇱🇷"}}]}
