The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","userName":"crstlgysrwtr","title":"😳😳","date":"2020-07-06T18:26:49Z"}},{"id":"6164490719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"i decided to download the app to see how my fellow orange oompa loompa president was doing 😼. when i downloaded it, it made me confirm i was older than 17 🙄 now it knows my age and i am so scared for my life😰!! my mom became ill and thru a chair at my phone now it’s cracked🤬😡😤!! at the very start you see a naked orange im so scared and the image keeps replaying in my head😢😢 im going to therapy now and my dog dislikes me very much now 😔.

This app rerouted all of my bank accounts to an Armenian prince. That’s not even the worst of it though!! Right after downloading this app weird things started happening around my house. I woke up at three in the morning to big bird dancing shirtless in my kitchen! The next day the entire muppets cast jumped my mom at the grocery store. It’s just not worth the consequences. Unless you want bug bird watching you in your sleep I suggest you don’t download this app!","userName":"sir hufflepuff","title":"Trump 🥰🌺🍃✨ how about no 😍✨🌸⚡️🌿","date":"2020-07-02T14:37:52Z"}},{"id":"6147372324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I hate to say this but when it asked for my ethnicity and race, it almost immediately sent over a platoon of tight pants, Republicans in MAGA hats to my house. I tried to understand what they were saying but they couldn’t really formulate sentences (typical right?) they said something regarding a wall? So I explained there was a door, and they could leave but then they called me fake news and told me to go back to my country. As a Mexican-American I felt kinda bummed but they smelled of mildew and supremacy of the white kind so I figured I shouldn’t really expect much \nWould give 0/5 if I could.  Some weird orange dude is a part of this app, he looks like he smells like mayonnaise 0/5 would also not like to look at him again. Very unsettling. \n\nAlso BLACK LIVES MATTER\nVOTE THIS HOT CHEETO MAN OUT OF OFFICE\nJUSTICE FOR VANESSA GUILLÉN\nJUSTICE FOR BREONNA TAYLOR \nJUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD\nJUSTICE FOR ANDRES GUARDADO\nJUSTICE FOR ROBERT FULLER\nJUSTICE FOR ALL VICTIMS OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND WHITE SUPREMACY IN THIS COUNTRY\nSAY THEIR NAMES\nDEFUND THE POLICE\nABOLISH ICE","userName":"Greyhazard","title":"This app gave me hemorrhoids","date":"2020-07-02T07:46:41Z"}},{"id":"6136591602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I’m a big fan of trump and I am all for everything he says but this app was so badly made. You would think with all the money he has he would put some into something like this. Goes to show how much effort he makes into things that he cares about. He’s always advertising this app but it’s just not good. It lagged on me about three times today. *if your still reading this and your gen z or a blm ali please go to the trump website and load your cart with trumps mercy but don’t buy it. It will effect his “business”. Thank you BLM justice for this county!!!","userName":"Jeniffer Z.","title":"SO BAD *read all of this","date":"2020-06-29T16:39:54Z"}},{"id":"6069330365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app to keep up with my fav president! daddy trump! Because I don't have social media and refuse to get on ,the home of the libs “tweeters”,  I thought this app would be perfect to keep track of dadas campaign. So disheartening to see all the information, secrets , and American rights I have to give up just to have the app and stay up to-date with sunny Ds campaign. It asked for LOCATION, FULL NAME ,as well as ACCESS TO NOTIFICATIONS which every educated trump supporter knows is just a fancy way apps get access into all your phone info. So disappointed that don trump is running this app and trying to strip me of my rights.","userName":"audiobooker33","title":"DISSAPOINTED","date":"2020-06-13T04:14:02Z"}},{"id":"6177887343","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app bc don’t we all and i was just like oh trump ✨✌️👎✨So i just want to say that we don’t stan trump, like why tiktok! sorry that Barron deserves better and we respect him but not u tehe! also um learn how to not be racist and homophobic, it’s just to much work and that’s why no one supports u!!!

He was not just a Cheeto, but an oompa lumpa which are two things that should never be crossed🤮. I was so surprised I fell off my giant fridge into the freezer. And there were muffins in it😱! I jumped out and crawled back too my house. Unfortunately I landed on the muffins and my diamond earring was ripped out of my ear probably leaving a permanent scar. 🥴So in conclusion don’t download this app unless you want to go through similar issues.","userName":"Parker Panza","title":"🧚\u200D♂️💫💞Scarred for LIFE 🧚\u200D♂️💫💞","date":"2020-07-09T17:09:00Z"}},{"id":"6177501025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app MAKES ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF. so i opened the app and when i did i saw this strange orange thing and then i realized that it was trump himself which bothered me a little bit but i was able to move on, i then went farther into the app and kept seeing his face over and over again and i started seizing on the floor, i started seizing so hard that my mom came in saw me seizing and she had a heart attack, my mother died, because of my mother’s passing my father jumped off a bridge and now i’m here alone, this app is the vein of my existence, thank you for your time ☺️ - sincerely, a gen z","userName":"GLUE BOTTLW","title":"this app made me suicidal 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T17:07:34Z"}}]}
