My monkey flew at it so they erased its memory. Trump 2020 the app will take ur microwave and prank call ur aunt Becky. They throw gorilas at you and will paint your house black with a laughing emoji on it. They stole all my doors and let my penguin go on a walk... BY ITSELF. it truly hurts me to see them do such cruel things to us. They ate all my chicken nuggets and I went to my McDonald’s to get more but they had bought them out. They will unplug you air conditioner, Alexa, and internet an it’s hard to set back up. (if you’ve read this far gen z rules lol).  10/10 WOULD BOT RECOMMEND. Have a great day to everyone besides trump and his app. I"}},{"id":"6174758092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:54:33Z","title":"don’t even get me started","isEdited":false,"userName":"tylersage","review":"a sunny little afternoon, there i was.. sitting on my roof, wondering what i could do to support my country. i decided to get this app.. & thought YAY, FINALLY I GET TO SUPPORT MY PRESIDENT!!! that’s when it all happened... i downloaded it & bam. i realized it. i had a pit in my stomach & couldn’t believe that i had this app now residing next to my tik tok app.. now you’re probably wondering what i realized... well, i realized \nit turns out that our president is a misogynistic, hom*ph*bic, r*cist, r*pist, among other things. to make a long story short, I wish he would get deleted but i’ll accept this app being deleted instead,. \nanyways.. 1312, register to vote this orange f*k out of office \nk, thx. xx"}},{"id":"6174744297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:50:22Z","title":"don’t recommend 😩😣","isEdited":false,"userName":"BearBeanz","review":"hi i’m emily 😜😝 trump 2020 😹🦋 even if he’s a shrimp 🍤🤏🏽🙄 shrimp lives matter 😍❤️ let me tell you why this app is such a disappointment 😞 so i tried getting into the app and it just glitched 😱 and i don’t know what to do 😰 so it finally started working 😣 and i got a commercial .. . . . and the commercial made me act up 😩 it was jut so hot 😳🥵 hotter than trumps deformed cheeto lookin shrimp 🥵😍 i wanna take whoever was in that commercial out to dinner.. anyways. as i was watching the commercial over and over again on repeat, it CRASHED.

Everything was ight until the next day around 7 am like literally two hours after I went to sleep, I hear banging on the door. I was like, “omg who’s banging on my door?” Anywhom I get up and as soon as I open the door I see a stretched Oompa Loompa. He literally dragged me from the hair and told me he would deport me to Mexico. What a racist 😞😔. Like I was born here man. Anyways I dragged from the hairs with my special fighting skills. I made sure he was off of my property because he had no warrant. Long story short this app gives out your private info like your address so don’t download."}},{"id":"6174695598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:35:39Z","title":"Horrible!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Dora The Explorer 🔫","review":"The other day I was walking my pet fish and he whispered something to me, not sure what he said because he tripped over a rock and I helped him up and he was fine. I saw Donald Trump walking his fish too and he was coming towards us. I was so happy I was seeing my Idol! I quickly asked for a picture and he completely ignored me!  That’s not the worst part! HE STOLE MY FISH!😭He went running away 🏃. I was so sad. Ever since that day my app has been running slow, glitching, I got hacked many times, and this app is not safe! They can stalk you and find you wherever you are , you could be pooping, showering, walking your fish 🐠 (r.i.p jerry) . Anyways Fly high Jerry 😔💔."}},{"id":"6174693386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:34:59Z","title":"TERRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"annaborshawn","review":"This app was so terrible.💫 The design of the app is just repulsive and unattractive.🤮 Like if you want people to use this app (which idk why you would even support this crusty orange Cheeto) then at least make the app appealing. It’s caused to many things to go wrong once I downloaded it. I’m telling y’all there’s an evil energy to this. When I downloaded it my pet pig started flying and just flew off into the sun. My fish started floating upside down unconsciously. My refrigerator ran away and my phone exploded. I’m typing this review from my microwave. Do you even know how hard that is? Ugh🤢All in all it was terrible 10/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND don’t download it✨"}},{"id":"6174660198","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:25:16Z","title":"this app is sooo bad don’t download it","isEdited":false,"userName":"urlocalmomkaren","review":"so basically it all started when i was riding my turtle. we were going to the nike store to get some pet food for my pet alligator. along the way i saw a taco bell so i went in and bought some sweet and sour pork. it wasn’t good. after that i went into the nike store and picked up some pet food. then went home. all of a sudden an app appeared on my phone and it was the donald trump app. i thought it was weird. so i went into the app all of the sudden a weird, ugly cheeto, fat looking man with ugly hair appeared. it was horrendous!!! then all of these glitches started to happen. OMG JUST GET RID OF THIS APP. don’t download it. the ugly man was the worst part of it all."}},{"id":"6174659054","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:56Z","title":"HORRIBLE. MADE MY PHONE SO GLITCHY!","isEdited":false,"userName":"SamanthaAyers","review":"I intentionally downloaded this app to keep up with Trumps presidential campaign and where his rally’s were going to be held. I didn’t know that along with downloading this app comes a glitchy phone free of charge. My phone was completely fine before downloading this app and worked as smooth as butter but ever since this app was downloaded my phone crashes every time I open it. It is very inconvenient when I want to know what is going on and I can’t because whoever made the app is so bad at developing. I overall would never advise anyone to download this app and I really wish I could rate it 0 stars. TAKE IT OFF THE APP STORE!"}},{"id":"6174601721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:08:40Z","title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE","isEdited":false,"userName":"yeehawchloe","review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the hype was about and boy, was I wrong for doing so.  I opened it and was immediately bombarded by insults from Bunker Boy Trump. He called me a radical antifa terrorist and a libtard. He also told me that women should not be having babies in the ninth month of pregnancy! What a gross thing to say! There were also many pictures of what I can only describe as a disappointment to the human race; a monstrosity. I think they called him Donald Trump or something. These disgusting images and words made me puke so hard, I went into a coma and I am now facing very expensive medical bills that I can’t pay off. THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE!!!! IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD!"}}]}
