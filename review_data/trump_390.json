This app almost caused me to DIE! I downloaded the app to show my love for the orange king but it broke my phone! I opened the app and my screen went black. I tried to turn off my phone but instead, big orange words popped up saying “RATE APP 5 STARS” and “ALL HAIL TRUMP”. I was scared so I threw my phone. I turned to my window and I saw Trump himself with an army of blonde hair, blue eyed, Trump supporters. They were chanting and holding Trump flags with knives on the ends. They came into my house and started to rip it to shreds. They formed a circle around me and started chanting, “TRUMP 2020! TRUMP 2020!”. I fought them off and the final boss was Trump. He looked just as sad as he was at Tulsa. “Why are you sad?” I said to him. He reeks of old cheetos. “You stupid GenZ kids are ruining my plan to become king!” he said. I rolled my eyes and pushed him out the window. I closed the window and turned to my room. Which was a reck because of the stupid Trumpies. They smashed my phone, took all my food from my mini fridge and took all my clothes... I COULDNT EVEN OPEN THE APP AND LOOK WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES! And that gets a one star from me.","title":"HORRIBLE APP!!!

It took me a month to download, also took 85% of my storage. While I was using and getting introduced to the new app, my phone was hacked and it caught on fire. Cost me thousands of dollars for a medical bill and a new phone, never in my life would I get this app again. All of my social media’s were hacked right after this app was downloaded, what a coincidence. They should have an option to bring the star even lower I would rate it negative infinity, I didn’t even mention the fact that the whole app was glitching, it would switch the languages everyday not giving instructions to turn it back to English. Keep in mind that’s the ONLY language I can speak. This app needs to be taken down. It’s hurt me. Leave the App Store. No one should need to go through what I went through. I downloaded the app to write a review. But do not actually open the app up if your using it for a review, that’s what caused the damage for me (opening the app up) Stay away from this Cruel disgusting awful horrific horrible scary dangerous mean selfish lame bad ignorant app. Please.","title":"AWFUL","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"hi658073"}},{"id":"6172902087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T16:30:53Z","review":"I LOVED Donald Trump and to me he has always been the epitome of god. Let me elaborate. He’s done so much for this country while he’s been president and is so respectful of women and people of colour!! He is truly inspiring and I hope the nation could follow in his footsteps (if we could imagine how amazing the world would be!).  But after downloading this app (which took over three hours and locked all of my other apps!) I have come to the conclusion that I must do some research on this man before making a conclusion like this. Unfortunately this app was not very helpful in my search and when I put in my phone number they constantly called and texted me! While I was making banana bread they called me, while I was cleaning my cleaning my dogs underside they called me, and they even called me while I was washing my toes. I then tried to delete the app but it didn’t let me! A giant orange thing popped up on my screen and waved its finger at me! How rude! Now I’m stuck with this app and the constant calls. I must now resort to voting for Kanye.","title":"Wow you seriously did that! ✨🧚⚡️ lets just make sure you never do it again ❤️🥰🥳","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Bxnhg123"}},{"id":"6177466762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:57:20Z","review":"I would looove to give this app a 0 star rating if that was possible. that’s certainly what it deserves. the multitude of problems started from the get go when I went to download the app. I couldn’t wait to support our ✨✨🧚fantastic🧚🧚✨ president through this app but then it took 37 WEEKS to download. I was furious. “how will I show my love and support now?” I thought. when the app finally was installed I got on my phone and it wouldn’t stop playing super bass by queen nicki minaj!! I thought this was weird enough but then my phone began to glitch out!!! this app clearly gave my phone a virus, and,  much like with COVID-19, the trump administration clearly did not plan for this ahead of time!! this app has caused me to fall down the stairs, slip in my kitchen, and get stung by 12 bees! this app should not be allowed on the app store, for all we know they may be tracking us through our phone cameras!!! I covered mine up just in case... overall, this app has ruined my life and should not be out in the open for anyone to download.

Firstly, the standard white background interface, opening the application strains my eyes, ultimately, leading me to headaches or just exiting the application immediately, and the fact there is no option for a dark/night mode interface ridiculous. Secondly, poor font style, head lines, and descriptions, there’s so many issues with the font choice/style, but my largest issue is the lowercase “i”; then the headline and article description, the app developers/designers waste so much of the interface with blank white space, the headlines, and time stamp there’s no room for the description, half of them say “Trump announced this... Trump said that...” I don’t even know what the opening line is, also the main headline, half the time I can’t even see the whole title- makes skipping over important new very easy. And thirdly,  poorly written articles, too many hyperlink integrated into the body and mainly bullet point news. \n\nOverall, wouldn’t recommend.","title":"Overall, would not recommend.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Sadness ab CP"}},{"id":"6176689037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:22:35Z","review":"This app is the worst I can’t even begin with it it took several hours and so much data space on my phone and deleted some of my pictures and several of my other apps some which where very important and it even deleted files and documents I needed do not recommend if you want to lose almost everything in your phone it even restarted my phone and after it did it had wiped out all of my Contacts I had some very important phone numbers just for them to be deleted by some stupid app I lost everything in my phone and now I can’t even get nothing back because I deleted my iCloud account and I could no longer get anything back so many hours and days of countless hard work to go to waste after downloading this app and just trashing it all and it being gone and no longer being able to bring back I can’t with this app and I highly recommended it be taken off the App Store before it happens to someone else and they have to go what with i did so i don’t recommended downloading this if you want all your data to be deleted","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"739273828"}},{"id":"6175738509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:34:56Z","review":"I downloaded this app to support the amazing definitely non-racist, homophobic and misogynistic president. I was immediately bombarded with notifications about how much he hated his supporters including the minorities. I also got a text asking if I wanted to get the “premium” upgrade. It was free so I went with it and nothing happened. UNTIL I heard a knock on my door. I opened it to see Donald and multiple masked me. They ran inside my house and took everything I had. 😡🤬. I was not very happy about this. 💫🌈 I told them to stop as they kicked my ankles repeatedly. After that they burnt my house down like zuko🧚\u200D♂️🥵. They threw me in a dumpster leaving me there and taking my dog for who knows what. Later Donald came back and unleashed an army of rats on me. They called me stupid and annoying and it really hurt my feelings 😢 😭. I went to the White House and asked trump if I could have my things back when he turned into Azula as he started to throw fire at me. I was able to escape but I definitely do not recommend this app to anyone. Unless you wanna be called a dummy head 😢 and thrown in the garbage. 🌸💅🌈💫👁💋👁","title":"Disgusted🥕🐡👎","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Grounded Teen"}},{"id":"6174859062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T03:24:41Z","review":"I hate Cheetos hate them soo much. Whoops I hate rapists i mean um sorry that was autocorrect. I hate racists . That was autocorrect too idk whats wrong with it today. What I’m trying to say I have no problem with rapists or racists at all and I especially don’t mind the Cheeto sitting at the White House. I just wanted to check in how is he doing?? Was There anyone who wanted to knock him out. I mean knock some sense into him. I mean was there anyone who was delivering a present to him bc I sent the Cheeto one idk if he got it yet. I think the bodyguards are doing a great job at trying to keep the Cheeto alive. They should rest tho. Don’t u think? The probably are working 24/7. Let them rest it’s not liek the whole country wants him dead or wants him to leave the White House or anything as a matter of fact they LOVE IT and want him to keep on being the amazing Cheeto that he is. 🥰😊😇🧞\u200D♂️🧜🏻\u200D♀️🤣☺️🧚🏻😙🧜🏼\u200D♂️😗🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻😘☺️🧜🏼\u200D♂️🧜🏻🧚🏻\u200D♀️😘 the Karen’s especially love him too.
