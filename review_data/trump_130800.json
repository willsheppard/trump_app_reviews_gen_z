He then chanted what seemed like nonsense until the rats from the sewers stormed the streets creating a mob around him and joined his side. i was paralyzed from shock so much so that i didn’t notice the sky slowly starting to change in color, the blue becoming a obnoxious bright green and orange ombré. thousands of murder hornets flew above me and began attacking civilians and their homes after the orange shrimp had looted them.i noticed a car pull in my drive way and assumed it was  my parents coming home from work. they were so mad (by the way they are vegans) that they grounded me even though i couldn’t move because i was literally paralyzed. so basically, don’t get this app ,or else you’ll get grounded . 🤷\u200D♀️","userName":"melanias left toe","title":"horrified🤢😱","rating":1}},{"id":"6174513339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:29Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I honestly wish I were Toph Beifong. This app is pure hot, steaming trash filled with with week old sweltering dog feces and bear ejaculation. Simply having it on my phone caused it to commit the unalive. I would rather eat an entire Jean jacket than ever use this app again. Tr*mps n*dëś are on the front page and I’m so glad I wasn’t wearing my binoculars when I opened the app. The app is so crusty and disgusting that it manages to emit a smell through the speakers that is so putrid my cat, who was next to me, involuntarily cringed so hard that she turned inside out. I’m writing this while next to Mittens, who is now just a grotesque pile of organs and bloody hair. This app is sadder than melania and as fake as Tr*mps “toupee”. Whoever took the time to code this must be the saddest little dweeb virgin ever. -2020/10","userName":"Yo diddy dawg","title":"I’m now considered legally blind","rating":1}},{"id":"6174513243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:27Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","userName":"carolinefromsouthbend","title":"stiñky pöø ćácä","rating":1}},{"id":"6174512312","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Smelled like blue cheese, my hair disappeared one strand at a time now I look like Stewie griffin  .

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry!

ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop.

BUTTTT..... when I open the app it started glitching and it took so long to load🙄I almost spent 2 hours waiting for the hot Cheetos advertisement and then when I logged out my wallpaper was changed to a Naked Peppa Oompa Loompa pig. Then when I went back to the app, it started to produce a bunch of smelly and disgusting fumes. Luckily I was wearing my poop 💩 protection mask 😷 bcuz those fumes made my fish pass out while I was taking him out for a walk. I think it would be better if we saw more of the Obama’s in this app bcuz I think they would help it produce better smelling fumes😌. And the worst part was that there was no hot Cheetos advertisement, instead I saw a bunch of Karens holding their phones taking pictures of a bleached orange 🍊. Lastly, the colors in this app were too bright and flashy. In my opinion I suggest you to use the colors black and yellow ⚫️🟡. Everything about this app was a lie except for these reviews🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨🧚🏼✨💕","userName":"Pickalo Pete","title":"If I could give this a -4 stars I would be happy to do so","rating":1}},{"id":"6174511148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:42:54Z","isEdited":false,"review":"no.
