So i decided to give it a try because i wanted to support my president. But after i pressed the download button it said that i had to stand still with my hands behind my back or it won’t download.. strange but i did it. I stood there waiting for about a week and a half. i got grounded for not doing my chores:/ and almost starved to death until my cat had to come and hand feed me🤧 but after that week and a half went by it finally downloaded so i decided to FINALLY sleep because i could put my arms down now. but mid nap my phone taps me on the shoulder telling me if i dont open the app trump will take my dad and have 12 arrest him and beat him for no reason. so i was like “i don’t want my dad to be one of the MANY victims of police brutality. So i decided to open it but everytime i did it would show a jump scare of some orange figure and glitch me out. so since i really wanted to support my president i decided to call the helpline. but when i did the staff who answered started to bully me and threaten to spill cockroaches all over me, my house, and my cat. (i am afraid of bugs) after they said that they started bashing me and calling me names. Mr trump please put your people in line. They really hurt me feelings😕 but after that i decided that maybe if i redownload the app it won’t glitch anymore so i tried to delete it but when i pressed the x Someone from the helpline i called smacked me through my screen. so now i have this app the glitches and everything and omg i just got a virus notification 😔. to save you of all this trouble and trauma don’t download this app. (true story)","date":"2020-07-08T21:59:27Z"}},{"id":"6173865351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dump7865","title":"Horrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Trump is a white supremacist.
