It had me put in my number and got a bunch of calls and texts. I should have realized that was a RED FLAG, but then there were a bunch of wavers and terms and conditions. So I just clicked on all of them, then agreed to the Trump Administration to murder my grandfather, who happens to be 84 years old. And I didn’t realize until the next morning when he was found dead. It was all my fault just because of this app.","userName":"Z_Greenie","date":"2020-06-29T02:07:30Z"}},{"id":"6133965419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed😔","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I was so excited to get more information about rallies and other great news from our president but all I got was lies, lies and more lies. I saw some information on this app that was credited from CNN. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT OF ALL THE NEWS SORCES. I didn’t see any information from Fox News whatsoever and that is the only credible new source. Also Biden was called “ a great candidate “ and apparently by President Trump himself, I doubt our amazing president would ever say such a thing. So that was more fake news. Do NOT and I repeat DO NOT get this app.","userName":"Peige🤩😀","date":"2020-06-29T01:22:26Z"}},{"id":"6177893791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I have a giant crush on trump!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Ok so i LOVE trump like i have an obsession with him i just cant get him off my mind and i downloaded this app just to see how AMAZING it is my love for him is as much as i love my moldy banana i just want to gobble it up thank you for your contribution to our country i just want to gobble that cake 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂 🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆\n\n𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙 𝚒𝚜 𝚊 𝚕𝚒𝚝𝚎𝚛 𝚙𝚒𝚎𝚌𝚎 𝚘𝚏 𝚑𝚞𝚖𝚊𝚗 𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚜𝚑 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚒 𝚑𝚘𝚙𝚎 𝚑𝚎 𝚍𝚒𝚎𝚜 𝚒𝚗 𝚊 𝚏𝚒𝚛𝚎 𝚋𝚞𝚝 𝚒 𝚓𝚞𝚜𝚝 𝚑𝚊𝚟𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚋𝚞𝚛𝚗𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚙𝚊𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚝𝚘 𝚍𝚘 𝚒𝚝 𝚖𝚢𝚜𝚎𝚕𝚏 𝚋𝚞𝚝 𝚒 𝚌𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚜𝚘 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚒𝚜 𝚖𝚢 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚋𝚞𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗 #𝚍𝚞𝚖𝚙𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙𝟸𝟶𝟸𝟶 𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙 𝚌𝚊𝚗 𝚜𝚞𝚌𝚔 𝚊 𝚏𝚊𝚝 𝚘𝚗𝚎","userName":"hi im here now","date":"2020-07-09T19:09:20Z"}},{"id":"6177883434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"disgusting","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"first off, not only do i not support this pig, i would like to address the fact that this app deserves to be where apps go to die. i hate this app with a burning passion. seeing the trump 2020 even being on my phone is APPALLING in and of itself. please apple store, do yourself a favor and delete this app off of your store, no one wants to see it. it instills a certain rage in me that i can not understand, but will certainly put into words against this racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic liar and predator’s app. thanks, xoxo, gen z ❤️","userName":"S.A Players","date":"2020-07-09T19:05:56Z"}},{"id":"6177882857","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"not good.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is completely unorganized and inappropriate. the “greeting” when you first open the app is a picture of a rotten Cheeto that has mold on top of it. this Cheeto is a homophobe, a racist, and more. he did the worst thing he could to handle a pandemic and didn’t make America ANY GREATER. to be honest, he made it worse. he also made many people suffer and he took away an app from everybody because he was butthurt. because of his RaLLiEs. please please please!! do NOT get this app or support this racist, homophobic, moldy orange. thank you.","userName":"Magic848","date":"2020-07-09T19:05:45Z"}},{"id":"6177719083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I tried to download the app my phone legit restarted! I came back to the App Store a few hours later in the hopes I could re download to see what our fabulous and not insane at all president has been planning, but  once I finally got it to download, every time I would go into the app it would close me out! And, when I finally was able to browse the app, it just kept glitching out! 10/10 would not recommend for download. I’m very disappointed.","userName":"MJCDC","date":"2020-07-09T18:16:25Z"}},{"id":"6177489730","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is just awful. it took 5 hours to download even though i have lots of storage on my phone.

The only people who tried the app before it’s release must have been Donald Trump and his two sons. Maybe instead of nepotism (I’m sorry for the big word it means “letting your sons get better things than everyone else because they’re your sons”) you could try not being a jerk??
