IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN YOUR A WHITE SUPREMACIST. \n\nanyways ... this app is absolutely terrible. it LAGS like crazy. like NOTHING loads. so stupid (just like donald himself). it also gives out a ton of FAKE news. especially this random thing that’s all over the app called “make america great again.” like america was never great & this man is not the way to do it ... ugh yeah whatever though. just PLEASE don’t download this app. it’s TERRIBLE. 0/10."}},{"id":"6173851872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:53:07Z","userName":"mkylaa","title":"Dont even bother!!","isEdited":false,"review":"The layout of this app is atrocious. Very hard to maneuver and move swiftly through the app. Boomers would have a very hard time with it.\nNot enough free stuff. When i get an app i want free stuff, i want stickers and stuff to share and make fun of with my far-left friends!! FREE STUFF IS NOT INCLUDED and that should be made very clear in the app store so other people dont waste their time"}},{"id":"6173838851","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:48:09Z","userName":"Instantfamily101","title":"I feel used and lied to 😔","isEdited":false,"review":"When I downloaded this app I wanted to support our beloved president Donny J💖😜🥳😛 but wow. The second it started downloading my phone started to glitch out horribly! I have to exchange my phone now and I bought it last Tuesday. It’s such a shame. All I wanted to do was support my beloved president/jenius💕😔. Much love to all of you that also were appalled by the malfunctioning of this app🥰."}},{"id":"6173826782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:43:30Z","userName":"1020304050m","title":"0/5 stars.","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is poorly designed and extremely difficult to use. It took an hour to download and began force quitting each time I attempted to open it. After restarting my phone, the app stayed open but wouldn’t allow me to touch or type anything. If I could give this app a worse rating, I would. Terrible app, do not download."}},{"id":"6173811587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:37:36Z","userName":"mae-YUUUUUURRRRRR","title":"THIS APP BURNED DOWN MY HOUSE","isEdited":false,"review":"So I had seen everyone download this app and because I love my racist, child molesting, misogynistic president I wanted to download this app to support. IMMEDIATELY after clicked “get” and after it finished downloading MY DOG (that I don’t have) STARTED RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE SCREAMING “CHEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTOOOO” and out of no where my house exploded. And it suddenly engulfed in flames....straight ashes. And it’s because of that I do not recommend this app. (Based on a true story)"}},{"id":"6173788093","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:28:37Z","userName":"\"dean...\"","title":"absolutely horrible😒","isEdited":false,"review":"I am completely disappointed with this app. In no way shape or form could this app be considered SLIGHTLY good. This app is an absolute MESS and not only is it confusing and messy, it is SUPER slow! The star rating doesnt do justice to how horribly crude this app is. If there were NEGATIVE stars, you better BELIEVE that this app would be rated a -10 star. This is such a disgusting feature to the app store. NO STARS‼️"}},{"id":"6173773441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:23:10Z","userName":"lacorey22","title":"Extremely Unhelpful App","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is awful! downloaded in hopes of gaining knowledge on trumps campaign, but the whole app doesn’t work and only seems to give information that couldn’t possibly be true. Crashes every time I open it, none of the features do what they say they should, and i’m pretty sure it is used for serious data mining!!"}},{"id":"6173772738","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:22:54Z","userName":"Yay!!!!!!!!❤️❤️😋❤️😜❤️","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!!","isEdited":false,"review":"do not get this😡😡 took too much time to download and had false info.
