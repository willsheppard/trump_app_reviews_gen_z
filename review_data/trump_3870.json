I had to go buy a whole new charger just to cut off the charger head to replace my old charger, but on the way back from the store my car lost all four of its wheels so I replaced them with some cube shaped rocks. I get home and see that I’ve not only forgotten my driver’s license but also my keys at the charger store so I do what any sane would do and speed to get my belongings. As I’m omw to the store I get a notification from this app and it ends up giving my phone a virus. I get home and lay down knowing my pet fish is walking around without me.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174705490","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:38:36Z","rating":1,"title":"so disappointed","userName":"TRUMP2020BUTTHISAPPSUCKS","review":"Thought this would be a good way to get a little more engaged with Trump's campaign. Ended up being INCREDIBLY SLOW, and would crash every time I opened it. At first I thought \"whatever, it's fine..\" and deleted it and redownloaded it to try again. This time around, I guess this app somehow accessed my apple pay and said I made a $5,000 donation and signed up for monthly $5,000 donations to Trump's campaign that I DID NOT CONSENT TO. On top of that, I started getting constant emails, texts, and all my advertisements about Trump's campaign. LITERALLY NONSTOP. I HAD TO FACTORY RESET MY PHONE BECAUSE JUST TRYING TO UNSUBSCRIBE DID NOT WORK. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, IT IS A SECURITY THREAT. I THINK IT HAS ACCESSED MY NUMBER, SOCIAL MEDIA, BANK INFO, EMAIL, CONTACTS, ETC. BEWARE!!!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174697215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T02:36:08Z","rating":1,"title":"Disgostang","userName":"Dikmcbig","review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited.

Glitchy and gross. Not to mention the first time opening the app it was so bright and had flashing lights that it gave my grandma a heart attack while we were on a cliff and she ended up falling to her death. After that terrible smells started leaking from my phone right after I was on the app. This stench made my eyes water and fall out and rn I’m having someone write this review for me since I can’t see my keyboard. But that’s not all. The stench not only took away my ability to see, but it engulfed my whole house with the disgusting scent. It gave my mom hives and bumps all over her body and my dad broke both of his legs. Please do not get this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174527789","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:47:33Z","rating":1,"title":"This app is a Nono","userName":"kwjajebhahaka","review":"This app will give you severe pain in your head and back and will also buy you a blender and steal it from you and will also take you fishing and steal your fishes and this app is also so vain and so evil and it just reminds me of everything I look in a big grapefruit I might see Donald Trump the guy who claimed to make a American great again and has done nothing but anyways child I’m just saying if you wanna be reminded who basically killed American dreams and hope it’s Donald J.trump thanks and when it’s time to vote ,DONT vote for someone who almost started a war this year and who ain’t doing nothing to protect us from COVID-19 child let’s just throw the whole president away","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174512287","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:43:11Z","rating":1,"title":"An absolute no no","userName":"Generarion Z","review":"No no don’t get this app this app is full op crap. As soon as I downloaded this app my phone began to self download horrific images of  “el trompas”. All I wanted was to support the Cheeto man but I didn’t sign up for disturbing images of him. After this I got news that my grandmother had to go to the hospital because she also saw images of the Cheeto man. I also saw some ppl commenting “all lives matter” and I thought that it was absolutely immature. Also after receiving those virus infected images my phone stopped working so now I’m obliged to write this review on a piece of cardboard in hopes that it’ll upload. Cheeto man. You owe me a new phone and a new grandma. Oh and long live TikTok","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174506342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:32Z","rating":1,"title":"This ain’t it 🧚🏻\u200D♂️❤️","userName":"ahaha🧚🏻\u200D♂️","review":"I was going to make a joke or something but Donald trump how DARE you try to get rid of TikTok so you ban TikTok we ban your orange app I’m surprised you didn’t put a Cheeto puff as the picture of it people be saying trump 2020 but I be saying trump 2020 🇺🇸 but in a grave🧚🏻\u200D♂️❤️oh and Donald trump also needs to start working out like girllllll you looking more Cheeto than human and stop trying to get a fake tan your already orange enough... this isn’t really a review on the app but it’s my own beautiful opinions on a rat named Donald trump... ahaha sorry for this stupid paragraph oh and I had to frickin DOWNLOAD this app and broooo I’m trying to ask forgiveness to my phone but I think I accidentally killed it, thanks Donald trump 😡","isEdited":false}}]}
