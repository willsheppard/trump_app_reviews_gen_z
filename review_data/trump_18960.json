This is a horrible app don’t waste your time. After some investigation i learned that the app is also sending my personal information out without my consent"}},{"id":"6177998513","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:43:32Z","userName":"ajbjjb23","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst Download","review":"I couldn’t have picked a worse app to download. I just wanted to keep up with what Trump was doing, but the app barely works and is not user friendly. The things posted on this app are absolutely disgusting and it’s not appropriate. There is also misinformation and this app should not be trusted. Mad I even took the time to download this app. Delete!"}},{"id":"6177992959","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:41:42Z","userName":"rremaspi","isEdited":false,"title":"TRIED TO KILL ME!","review":"Terrible app. It took one month to download and when it opened, it started harassing me for being transgender. Then Donald Trump himself climbed through the screen and assaulted me (I’m a minor). I called the police for help but they joined in and beat me up while saying “All lives matter”. Overall, if I could rate it 0 stars, I would. Would not recommend."}},{"id":"6177897804","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:10:40Z","userName":"zakai young","isEdited":false,"title":"PLEASE DON’T DOWNLOAD!!!!!","review":"This app was laggy no matter where I was so I know it was NOT my internet. And I’m surprised this app is not taken down by now. This is the absolutely the WORST APP I HAVE EVER DOWNLOADED. Please don’t make the mistake I and many others have made. Thank you to the other fellow haters and tiktokers that have also made this review so low😂 And find other ways to make his stuff GO AWAY😂😂"}},{"id":"6177875307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:03:22Z","userName":"Kentucky Kenzy","isEdited":false,"title":"✨💗🧚\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app to see what it was and i ended up wanting to bleach my eyes. the day after i downloaded it, i kept hearing voices that were saying sexist and racist things. coincidence, i think not. I opened up the app to see a nude orange and my virgin eyes can never unsee that. Please don’t download this app unless you want to be disturbed for the rest of your life like me."}},{"id":"6177862496","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:59:23Z","userName":"lava.pants","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible!!!","review":"I would give it 0 stars for what I had to go through when I had this app installed. Shortly after installing and signing up I keep getting spam calls about my extended car warranty and their still not stopping not to mention the micro peen I saw the second I signed up for the app absolutely do not recommend!!!"}},{"id":"6177854954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:57:03Z","userName":"MomErica","isEdited":false,"title":"saggy booty tooty orange racist man looking at my hooties","review":"opened the app and first thing was asking me my gender...weird. confirmed i was a female and immediately requested innappropriate photos and videos or i was going to get deported...??????what the hell??? so of course i exited out and then re opened it in hopes of not having to do that but this time when i opened it i was in a video chat with the rump himself?! the whole time he told me he’d date me if he knew where i lived and if i weren’t underrage...creep. so i hung up and checked out the merch which is umm weird to say the least. the women’s section consisted of plunging necklines and bright colored spandex? deleted."}},{"id":"6177836197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:51:29Z","userName":"nick & lance videos","isEdited":false,"title":"Literally just the worst","review":"Nothing about this app works. It was so gross, just like Trump himself. So many bugs and issues. Also it crashed like 6 times every minute. It also started randomly showing me videos of people throwing up???? If I could give this app negative stars- I would. Don’t even think about downloading this app."}},{"id":"6177711746","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:14:13Z","userName":"Kaee0010","isEdited":false,"title":"Crashing, not loading BAD APP","review":"The app continued to crash everytime i opened it. Not that i genuinely cared to support trump but was trying to see the app he felt he needed to put out into the world. Whenever the app didnt crash it was stuck on a white loading screen for a very long time before again, crashing and closing the app!! 👎🏻👎🏼👎🏽👎🏾👎🏿"}},{"id":"6177711159","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:14:03Z","userName":"Makayla11112","isEdited":false,"title":"ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE","review":"I was really excited for this app! But, My phone kept crashing I WAS DEVASTATED AND UTTERLY SHOCKED at how un well this app was made. I expect more from the orange Cheeto in the White House. Looking at this app just gives me PTSD, OK I’m suffering from PTSD cause all I can recall is my phone crashing and it possibly happening again. To anyone interested DONT DO IT, this app needs to be gone for the sake of humanity. ZERO STARS FROM ME! \nThank you"}}]}
