Music is blaring all around me as girls jump up and down trying to get the attention of the singer on stage. I’m not like them, i’ve never been like them. Instead of going to concerts i prefer to read books. I’ve always been quirky like that. I flip the page in my book, ignoring the chaos around me when suddenly i hear my name “Emily”. I look up from my special edition bible and see a man looking down at me from the stage. \n\n“Elow luv why don’t you come back stage wif me?”\n\nchapter 2 \n\nThe man leads me to the break room and sits me down on a sofa.\n\n“Sorry to bother you, luv. But i couldn’t help noticin’ your sleek blond hair pulled into a messy bun and your reflectif blue orbs.” he says.\n\n“oh” i giggle softly. “i didnt have time to do my hair this morning, i had to go to my horse riding lesson” \n\n“wow that’s incredible, i don’t have the time to do anyfing since i’m an internationally loved singer and wanted by all of the women in the world”.\n\nI look up at him in confusion, “why?” i ask.\n\n“you mean that you don’t find me incredibly charming and attractif?”\n\n“no” i lie, biting my top lip. “I don’t even know who you are”.\n\n“What do you mean? I’m Harry Styles!”\n\n“Sorry” i say looking shyly at the floor “The only Harry I know is Harry Potter”\n\n“You really don’t know who I am? Don’t you listen to my music?”he asks with his silky british voice.\n\n“I only listen to Alternative music, that’s i guess i’m...” i pause “not like the other girls”.\n\nsuddenly Harry kisses me. I pull back in confusion then look down at my bible. “Harry, I cant, i’m christian”\n\nHe takes my porcelain colored hand and kisses it.\n\n“I think i should go, i need to get home to take my goldfish on a walk”\n\n“Well, then i fink i should walk you to your car.” Harry says.\n\nI neigh in agreement.","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP MADE ME A HORSE GIRL???","date":"2020-07-09T03:22:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"charlie dalemio"}},{"id":"6174846531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app will take up 60 MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE.
