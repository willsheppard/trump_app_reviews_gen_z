Incredibly laggy with just orange Cheetos popping up on screen and I don‚Äôt even think the Cheetos brand advertise on this app. It‚Äôs slow and pixelated, I‚Äôve had this app for too long and I going to delete this app as soon as possible. I‚Äôve seen highly inappropriate things on here and I think this app is bad for you to download, full of Karens and nasty energy that‚Äôs bad for you. It‚Äôs bad for the environment and not good for you. \nThe fitness gram pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer testwill begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!‚Ä¶ Start."}},{"id":"6179422229","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not worth it","rating":1,"userName":"not_worth_it_app","date":"2020-07-10T04:25:15Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app helped with nothing. It simply had me sign up for something only for it to finish and gave me no news or anything just simply signed up and that was it it was a long process as well only to have it all be great thanks for your help and gone.

Since I downloaded this app it gives me motivation not to do anything in my life, it makes me want to paint myself orange and build a wall around my own house because I am so scared of Trump Supporters. I cannot sleep in peace because it keeps sending me notifications saying how I am not racist enough, and it tells me not to wear a mask out in public because I have right not to wear and be more selfish and I should become one of the Karens. Lately I have been dreaming how I should inject Lysol into my body so I can survive from miss Rona but I do not have supplies to do that so now I am thinking about drinking bleach instead I think that would work out pretty well. But again I was hoping to see something on this app that is actually helpful to world but no see nothing but DISAPPOINTMENT. I do not recommend this to anyone if I could give this app -50000 score I would."}},{"id":"6179422069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"userName":"lowkeyf202","date":"2020-07-10T04:25:11Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Crashed my phone as soon as it was done downloading"}}]}
