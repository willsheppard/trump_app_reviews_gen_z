The functionality of both? Useless. The aesthetic? None to be observed. The care for the constituent? Who is she? This app and the person it’s tied to is absolutely horrible and I’d give both negative (-) 5 stars if I could. Deplorable. Get this app off my phone and please get it off the App Store — how \n\n✨🥰🧚\u200D♀️ ~e m b a r a s s i n g~ 🧚\u200D♀️🥰✨","userName":"A literal human being","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179794653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:36:17Z","rating":1,"title":"Nope.","review":"I got this trying to decide between trump and Biden.... this is the first presidential election I can legally vote in and I was doing research to decide which to support and well... I downloaded this app and was slapped in the face with bugs and crashes after crashes like I except better from an app for a presidential elect...? Anyways I am not sharing who I’m voting for but this little effort put into this app and how little it’s updated with the latest news definitely shows and swayed my opinion (from the #alt side ;)","userName":"saveourmother","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179794591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:36:16Z","rating":1,"title":"buggy crashing how did apple even let this on the store","review":"disgusting app trump can't make good hotels and can't make a good app either. crashes. constant bugs. gave my phone coronavirus","userName":"nabbzzaa","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179794465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:36:13Z","rating":1,"title":"so bad","review":"did not enjoy 0/10","userName":"martharangg","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179793988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:36:02Z","rating":1,"title":"No money?","review":"I was promised 1k and this app failed to keep that promise","userName":"Kaypika","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179793903","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:36:00Z","rating":1,"title":"DELETE ASAP","review":"App is just irrelevant.","userName":"Paolav2001🤪","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179793391","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:35:48Z","rating":1,"title":"Why is this even an app??","review":"I got this app and it always asked for my phone number so I finally gave it to them so they would stop pestering me and a minute later I get a call from my money in my back account saying it’s being stolen....lesson learned...don’t give you phone number to people who don’t know what they r doing with their life and like to make all of the USA’s life horrible and embarrassing 🥱🤗","userName":"Hi Sop","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179792737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T06:35:34Z","rating":1,"title":"App Stole All My Information 💞","review":"This app isn’t good whatsoever.

I everything is lagging. Not seems to work, the updates and information on there is wrong and to be fixed.

He tends to abuse his authority way too often. He has a horrid past of being a sexual predator. Don’t sexual predators usually get arrested? I guess not. Anyways, what I’m trying to say is, I don’t support this man at all. Also, don’t threaten Gen Z with taking sway TikTok... thank you 😊","userName":"george washingtinia","isEdited":false}}]}
