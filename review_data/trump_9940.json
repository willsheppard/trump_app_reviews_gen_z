It then tried taking all my information and giving it to the government and spying through my camera without consent. I can’t tell you how disrespectful it is to open the app and see a pedo 🤢🤢🤢!!! This app made me want to puke and i’ll never be able to rinse my eyes enough to unsee this disaster of a cheeto! The audacity it had to be this bad is unacceptable, this app needs to be taken down right now!!!","userName":"big fat joke","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:55:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgosting"}},{"id":"6174349957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"omg let me tell you🖐🙄 so I open the app and this terrifying picture comes up of a cheetoman. I couldn't look at my screen but when I look over my sister is frozen in terror. we are still trying to get her to talk and she has to go to therapy 50 times a week after this traumatic experience. I also have to attend therapy for I sometimes see the cheetoman appear, neither of us have recovered from this experience😔😔😔","userName":"Izzybella1203","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:54:25Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I can't believe this app"}},{"id":"6174339941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I open up to see a giant orange that looks like it should be in a peach. Such a disgrace. It looks like it was very close to being inside of this peach. This orange looks like it had a spray tan to make it even more orange. It was waving and it freaked me out because an orange should not look like that. I really think you should change the screen to something better. It was captioned: Keep America great. Umm... so this app is terrible please remove it✌️","userName":"leak gallery onto one","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:51:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"If i could give it 0 stars I would🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6174295498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Sometimes I don't wanna be happy\nDon't hold it against me\nIf I'm down just leave me there\nLet me be sad\nSun's up, I already wanna lay down\nFriends calling, are you really tryna go out?

Like I want to revive texts from a nasty cheto dust person I think not. Second of all the app started attacking me. Coming into my house and eating all my food, deflating all of my balls and even kicked my dog! Third of all this app popped all of my tires so I couldn’t leave to get milk AND burned all of my CD’s. This app has terrible manners and should be taken away immediately!","userName":"Lilly awesome","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:25:56Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is horrible"}},{"id":"6174257638","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to see what the cheeto man was up to and i was appalled to see what the app did to my phone. it deleted my camera roll and replaced it with pictures of the fat orange cheeto man 😾. i heard a knock on my door and sure enough he was standing right at my door. he wouldnt leave because he has dementia and is just stupid in general and started streaking around my home😖. i saw his lil cheeto flying every where and it was in front of my grandma and my 2 year old girl. he was screaming and i tried to calm him down but he wouldn’t listen. he ate all of my candy and punted my baby across the room and as he did he said deletus the feetus. he also snorted my husbands ashes before he ran out the door. would not recommend this app 😣","userName":"Gallo76","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:23:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"its a no from me ❤️"}},{"id":"6174254325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"💅🏼👑✨casually got the app 🙂 and opened it then first thing 💛i see is a carrot🥕🥕😮‼️!! i thought 💓this app was about a cheeto puff😑!?!? i’m so disappointed 😔 once i got the dissatisfaction💐 i deleted it immediately because 💗it started smelling my phone😬✌🏼UGH!! it started smelling ☀️like...IGNORANCE!! 😩😩 idk🌟 i guess i was just too busy walking my fish 🐠 but also my caterpillar 💕was crying 🌺so i had to feed it chinese takeout 🥡🥢😗🥤 but IN CONCLUSION, never again 😌🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨ opening that app 🥰🎉💖","userName":"cutielovestea","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:21:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"✨🧚🏽\u200D♀️ never again 🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6174222882","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I opened the app and the first thing I seen was a man getting a spray tan naked!

It’s completely racist and just a huge joke. You’ll see people who have orange skin that make you wanna puke. All the people who’s support this app are all racist and want the country to be AWAFUL AGAIN. If you download this app, you’ll get into arguments with people and i wouldn’t recommend doing that. It has racist comments, orange skinned people, and people who think they are ALL that. PLEASE DELETE THIS APP. It is truly heartbreaking that this app is still on the app store:(.","userName":"Liberty1406","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T23:55:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WHY IS THIS A THING😭🤡"}}]}
