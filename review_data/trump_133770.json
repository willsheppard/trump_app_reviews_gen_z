canabisera","date":"2020-07-08T18:35:45Z","review":"i would give it zero stars but unfortunately that is that is not possible. i downloaded this app out of curiosity for the future campaign and the plans for the years to come... for personal reasons. as soon as it downloaded my device started to have severe glitching problems. and it’s only done this one time before due to...um... personal reasons...as i proceeded to open the app i was shown a picture of a man. i’m not sure who he is but he sure did seem angry! and it asked for my personal information! a phone number are you kidding me? that is very private. as i am trying to hide my identity from the government because of my obsession in buying kiwis on the black market, asking for my telephone number is a clear invasion of privacy. i proceeded to cry for what i am embarrassed to say many hours and may or may not have eaten 4.2 million dollars worth of contraband kiwis. this app is outrageous. the unidentifiable mam seems to be very angry and he also appears on my youtube ads. i don’t know who he is and why is on the cover of this app, but he is invading my privacy and now i have to purchase more kiwis because if his outrageous request. also please someone tell me who that man is i’m concerned","title":"unbelievably

When I opened the app my ears started ringing and I lost control of my bowels. After I cleaned up the mess - all whilst hearing the deafening tinnitus in my ears - I re-opened the app to just check to see if it was really causing my issues or if it was a coincidence and lo and behold my ass fell off. I picked it up and tried to reapply it to my lower back but it wouldn’t stick. I’m not sure assless people can live long enough to vote in the 2020 election so now I’m concerned that I’ll have to vote as one of those dead people voters that Trump warned us about. Thank god we have him to look out for us. I figure if I can survive being assless then I can survive Covid so I thank the makers of this app for at the very least helping me find my own strength. The app, however, is dangerous plus it has really poor user interfacing🤷🏼\u200D♀️ . Thank you and god bless.","title":"It made my ass fall off","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173289917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"thisischria","date":"2020-07-08T18:34:17Z","review":"bruh they really have an app for a guy with 20+ rape allegations.
