Once I finally got onto the app nothing worked, no links worked and I am one of the testers for the new iOS and it just kept telling me it was copying my links. THIS APP WAS STEALING MY INFORMATION. He wants to get rid of other apps for “stealing information” when his own app does. He is despicable. 😡","date":"2020-07-10T02:53:51Z"}},{"id":"6179156117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Guongason","review":"this app made my booty hole sew up permanently now i poop through my mouth","date":"2020-07-10T02:52:44Z"}},{"id":"6179155682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ew","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Real degrees ves","review":"This app glitches your PHONE OMWOW loolooloo toot ootooototo poopppyypoopoo leedeeleedeeleeldeee as Patric the stay says I really just cannot fathom the whole idea of \nAll adults thinking that these children this Genzie cannot do anything about this and that we don’t have any impact look at us we just spam that one it’s about what we do with how we do Loulou Loulou Loulou Loulou do do do do do do do do do do do do do do boo-boo Poopoo Poopoo Poopoo poop🦋✨🧚\u200D♂️🦋✨⭐️💩👾🤡🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♂️🧚🏿\u200D♂️🧚🏽🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏿\u200D♀️💁\u200D♂️🧤🧦🐡🐤🦆🙈🐒🐒🐒🙊🍆🍑🥚🤿🏋️\u200D♀️🎭🧩🛵🐒🙊🧚\u200D♂️🦋⭐️🙊🦋🦋🧩🤿🧩🤿🤿🥚🙈⭐️🐤🐤⭐️⭐️💁\u200D♂️🧤🧤🧦🧦🧤🧤🧤😂😂🐡🐡🐡","date":"2020-07-10T02:52:33Z"}},{"id":"6179148837","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"fucfhhobvvff","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"heisv dj","review":"hobo harry potter","date":"2020-07-10T02:49:58Z"}},{"id":"6179144765","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My fish drowned because of this","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bdjdhznehs","review":"I literally tried to download the app but then my fish drowned in the toilet bowl. I don’t know how he got there but I know it’s the apps fault. This app literally took 365 days to download (that’s a year if you don’t know). My mom and dad kicked me out of the house because I watered the dog to much expecting him to grow but he didn’t all because of this app. It’s so stupid. Also I almost clogged the toilet with my big poop, but luckily it flushed down before the app got to it. Phew! I really think you shouldn’t get this app thank you and consider it.","date":"2020-07-10T02:48:31Z"}},{"id":"6179143310","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"FAKE NEWS!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Catrina Cullen","review":"FAKE NEWS!!!

It turned out to be broken. He HAS to pay for my medical bills(34.2million) 👁👄👁. I hate this app I now have to get toe Surgery. Thanks a lot 🍊 man.
