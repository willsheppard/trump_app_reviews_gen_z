I was thinking about who to support in this next presidential race. Once I opened this app I was immediately scared as there was a fat puffy Cheeto. I was sitting next to my kids and they were both scared of the Cheeto they couldn’t sleep for days. This app then told me that I was fat and ugly and I should work out more which is very offensive. It also crashes very much even though the fat puffy Cheeto wasted a lot of money on this app instead of donating it to helpful causes, unlike this campaign. They were also asking me to poop in my neighbors yard which is very rude and terrible. Please do not download this app. \n\nthis app should appear in the app store ✨🥰❤️but add diss in front of appear😝😆😌✨","userName":"Melania and Barron","title":"DO NOT download this app (terrible)"}},{"id":"6139050930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T08:43:42Z","review":"I was excited to have this app since... I am clearly a trump supporter BUT this app is such a disappointment 🙄🙄🙄 Once i opened this app I was scared by an inappropriate picture of what it seemed to be a big wrinkly old orange man😱 and my kinda saw and may I said they cried of this horrifying image and it even gave one of my kids nightmares for days🤬🤬 That being said this app is also not family friends it promotes rape, the death of innocent people as well of hating people for no reason and more things. As the trump supporter I clearly am I am very disappointed in this app🤦\u200D♂️🤦\u200D♂️🤦\u200D♂️It should be taken down as this mapp is filled with hate and rude people 😤😤 It appears to be a good app

I downloaded it to support our orange president, when all of the sudden... a rat jumped out of the toilet! The rat said his name was Jerry and that I shouldn’t vote for Trump. I said “Why, Mr.Jerry? He is totally not rascist, a terrible president, and homophobic so why shouldn’t I?” Jerry continued with “Well, if you vote for him our country will end up in flames with a Cheeto dipped man as our ruler.” “You’re right Jerry, I don’t really want him as our president.” I said. Jerry said “Aight I’m out.” SO I ENDED UP WITH A DEAD RAT ON MY FLOOR.
