It promoted predatory behaviour, racism, sexism and homophobia I am not oaky with that being said. So obviously I deleted the app because that is disgusting. I would never recommend to ANYONE not even my homophobic grandpa. But before I deleted the app it started showing me pictures of an orange and telling me to vote for it obviously I cannot vote for a orange that would be absurd. All the app is is constant pictures of oranges and a Cheeto man saying weird things. Not a fun app👎👎👎👎","date":"2020-07-10T10:05:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"KACHIGGA"}},{"id":"6180368587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"budvsn ddn ddnnsncj","rating":1,"review":"I was eating my taco🌮 and then I downloaded this app and I saw this walking talking orange🍊and I got so scared I dropped my taco but it gets worse then the orange was trying to get me to vote for him as president and a orange as president I don’t think that is a good idea so I was like I to the no to the no no no then you will not believe what happens next all my food was looking at this orange and it all ran away now I starving this orange is out to get us all please get me foooooood","date":"2020-07-10T10:05:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Hate it"}},{"id":"6180368567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Dt1034986","rating":1,"review":"Honestly I didn’t even look at the app I just know that the app is just a bunch of bulllcrap. I mean it’s promoting Donald Trump soooo🤡🤡.  I’m here because or DEJUAN BOOKER OF TIK TOK. His username is @unusualbeing so go follow him if u have TiK Tok. WE ARE A MOVEMENT. And even tho I’m not Gen Z. I will do anything to keep Tik Tok from being deleted. Donald Trump will rue the day he ever messed with Tik Tok. We are literally millions of people that can come together and do anything if we want to. And the only reason Donald Trump is doing this is because we messed up his rally. Tbh he’s probably more hormonal than most of the teenagers on this app sooo. Joe Biden 2020. And Tik Tok is a force to be reckoned with. DO NOT BAN TIK TOK.","date":"2020-07-10T10:05:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m here because of DeJuan Booker of Tik Tok"}},{"id":"6180366394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Gamerater134","rating":1,"review":"Yeah so basically.

It is making my phone heat up AND it made my battery drop 20% AS SOON as I went into the app. Wouldn’t recommend this app to my worst enemies honestly.","date":"2020-07-10T10:04:32Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is honestly terrible"}},{"id":"6180364422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NanygPR","rating":1,"review":"The app is CONSTANTLY crashing, up to the point where I can barely be on the application for more than a few minutes before it crashing. On top of this, the layout is less-than-intuitive, and it’s extremely easy to accidentally click on something and then not find how to go back or exit. The app will ask you for your location AND cellphone number, but DON’T PROVIDE THIS INFO! You’ll be pestered constantly via text through different numbers, up to the point where it’s almost impossible to block them all or stop them from texting you once they have your phone number. Considering the candidate’s target audience is older, the lack of accessibility and it’s constant pestering to share the app with your contact list is malicious and upsetting. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APPLICATION. I AM PRETTY SURE IT’LL JUST STORE ANY INFO YOU GIVE TO IT, SO PLEASE PROTECT YOURSELVES.","date":"2020-07-10T10:04:09Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Glitchy, Malicious & Annoying"}},{"id":"6180363459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Crazy204","rating":1,"review":"trash sry not sry","date":"2020-07-10T10:03:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🗑"}},{"id":"6180362650","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Random Persom Passing By","rating":1,"review":"This is my first time ever typing a bad review. This is such a bad app... every time I click something, a random ad just pops up! Whenever I try to play the game, it just becomes a black screen. You can’t play with a black screen... it’s just not it. I also heavily disagree with the title of the app — unless you meant “Trump 2020 ✨ on a gravestone 😻”. I hope you will listen to what I have to say and fix it. I also hope you will listen to the BLM movement and do something instead of tear gassing and shooting rubber bullets at people. Thanks. \n🧚\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-10T10:03:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"My Complaints"}},{"id":"6180362348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"llwjie","rating":1,"review":"He is\n\nWow just terrible. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽","date":"2020-07-10T10:03:24Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Not good at all"}},{"id":"6180361210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"👁👄👁🤳","rating":1,"review":"As soon as i downloaded the app my phone started heating up so naturally i threw it in the pool but the phone was so hot it started to boil the pool while my sister was in it. My sister start to feel the boiling water so she tried to swim away but while she was swimming the phone got caught in her mouth and she swallowed it. The phone then exploded in her leaving a gaping hole in her chest. Then she went into cardiac arrest while doing kart wheels. 1/10 do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-10T10:02:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️"}}]}
