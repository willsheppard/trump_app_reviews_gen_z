He has no regard for the human race, deflecting his ludicrous irresponsibility in China! Wow! What a moron. Terrible app, terrible president.","date":"2020-07-08T15:49:07Z","title":"Terrible! Just like him!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Trump is a narciccist"}},{"id":"6172653459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app is so poorly designed, I sometimes question whether it is even made by actual human beings. Not only is the app bombarded by this strange old man, it seems to claim that he is my president. That little clown is not my president I don’t know who that dude is. The app also leaves most people I’ve discussed with uncomfortable. The app also serves no purpose, because there are other things that do the same thing as this app. Therefore the app is redundant and shouldn’t exist.  Yeah❤️","date":"2020-07-08T15:19:00Z","title":"This app has problems","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"THIS NICKNAME IS TAKEN*"}},{"id":"6172621626","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"do NOT download this app. this is ur warning.

Why do you need my information for me to learn how awful of a president he is. He is possibly the most sexist, racist, terrible human beings to walk the earth. This man, if you can even call him that, does not deserve to be in office and has to go. America is not great, and he is only making it worse. Terrible app for a terrible president. James Buchanan, you are finally being replaced for the worst president in history.","date":"2020-07-08T14:42:17Z","title":"Worst app ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Maddie1718"}},{"id":"6172306968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got this app since my mother was so supportive of our “dear” president but as soon as I opened it my tablet was just completely shut down by all of the bugs and viruses in it. (You’d think America’s PRESENT should be able to at least give you an app that actually WORKS but I guess that just shows how “great” of a president he actually is.) Unfortunately, soon Trump started becoming homophobic so I just gave up on him. Let’s face it; America stopped being great as soon as he became president.","date":"2020-07-08T13:43:42Z","title":"Do NOT download","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ZeiaZeia"}},{"id":"6172275791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when I opened the app I saw trump everywhere, it was like opening up a circus tent and seeing a bunch of clowns. on top of that, it was very laggy (just like his ability to take care of this country). I tried to cheat and skip past the phone number part, just like how trump cheated on all of his wives, and skipped through all of his marriages. Overall, save some space on your phone,( just like how we will be saving space for joe Biden in the white house in the fall) and dont download this app😊","date":"2020-07-08T13:34:50Z","title":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTANG","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"SIS 💅"}},{"id":"6172268690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The second I open the app it took 30 minutes to load and it wouldn’t even let me sign in this thing makes Trump look smart very smart and won’t let me delete it for some reason I am now stuck with this app on my phone I have been forced to hide it in like the back of my folders I hate this and I hate Trump and please don’t band TickTock even though we  RSVPed and didn’t show doesn’t mean that we deserve this","date":"2020-07-08T13:32:54Z","title":"This app is terrible it’s so buggy and slow","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"The agent be 13"}},{"id":"6172171274","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"guess WHAT.\ni downloaded the app. then, i opened it. it showed a orange man with a tiny pp named cheeto. “cheeto 2020!!!!” i was so confused  ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💅🏻 i quickly signed in and saw people panicking...

He’s my little orange smol bean. But as soon as I downloaded and put my number it, it texted me my exact address and said “we are coming for you”. I immediately deleted it and got really freaked out. I assume it has to do with the fact I am a woman. Maybe suspected trafficking having to do with Jeffery Epstein? I don’t know but this just supports the rumors I didn’t think were true about Trump being involved. Maybe I was wrong😖.","date":"2020-07-06T21:42:24Z","title":"This App Tracked Me","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Maria Forester"}}]}
