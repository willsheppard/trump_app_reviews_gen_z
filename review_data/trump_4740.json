(except for the hostages in the basement but they can’t escape) even my hostages started acting weird!! i threw holy water at them but they just hissed back. i’ve deleted this app multiple times but there is still a unsettling presence in my household. Mr trump IS in fact the devil.","isEdited":false,"userName":"dbjahx","date":"2020-07-09T11:49:12Z"}},{"id":"6176313587","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever😤😤","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start. ding\uFEFF\n\nThank you for your time","isEdited":false,"userName":"ForMiles","date":"2020-07-09T11:39:47Z"}},{"id":"6176182009","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Blew up my phone...my hand are burned now✨🔪","review":"You see I got this so I could vote for my 🗳 ✨amazing✨ and ✨lovely✨ Cheeto puff🥕 president💕but it took 10 hours👽 to download and after I finally✨got it it erased all of my data🙈😔Gosh all I wanted to do was vote for my daddy and savior😔💕But once I got it it gave me a ✨pedo vibe✨ and I was not here for it🔪After I got over every obstacle, when I tried  to vote for my beloved president it sent me a message saying that I was a racist and a homophobic and I don’t understand why🙈 and when I tried to vote again my phone blew up✨😳overall do not recommend this app at all it was a complete waste of time❌🔪✨🧚🏻","isEdited":false,"userName":"daisy✨🧚🏻💕","date":"2020-07-09T10:59:56Z"}},{"id":"6176023750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"You did this💖💅🏽🥰Now never do it again😺🧚🏻🌠","review":"I downloaded this app having high expectations bc it was app designed for our aMaZiNg president, yet it took 6 months to download😾 Next it hacked my phone and showed me videos of props pig and daddy pig going at it🙀next 4 Oompa Loompas showed up to my door, and carried me straight out of my house🤷🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏻💅🏽 they took me to Willy Wonkas chocolate factory, and then trump appears on the tv there🍤 they kidnapped my parents and best friend but they didn’t know we both had the powers of fairy’s, so we got our phones out and left fairy comments on trumps insta, and he and his little shrimp got stressed out that we escaped🥰","isEdited":false,"userName":"akaoshanma","date":"2020-07-09T10:09:59Z"}},{"id":"6175952385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Don’t even think about downloading","review":"I wish I could rate -99,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 stars! The app is absolutely trash and took about 6 months to finally download. It takes up ALL of your storage! I had to delete every single app on my device and delete all of my pictures. Not to mention how many racist remarks were made from the president himself. You also get calls from random numbers saying you need to pay to have your own freedom. Absolute waste of money and time. Don’t download it unless you want viruses on your device and you want to keep your phone number, emails, past photos, etc... a secret.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lemmesearchit","date":"2020-07-09T09:46:46Z"}},{"id":"6175894379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🔥Offensive character🔥","review":"Usually I try to be very nice when reviewing apps but this one I do not feel deserves it. It shows a very controversial and out right terrible person who encourages sexism,rape, pedophiles, racist, murder against anyone who is not a close minded white man, homophobia, and more offensive things that the news should cover more on this awful man. Instead of acting like he’s an angel who wants the best for our country when in reality he wants the best for himself and that includes being and doing probably all of the following, please get rid of this app and with it the bootleg Obama that we call our president! ✨✨🧚\u200D♀️Thank you🧚\u200D♀️✨✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"samengamer121","date":"2020-07-09T09:27:29Z"}}]}
