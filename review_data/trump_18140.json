Also since the app is very slow I was finding that other new sources were getting me my information first. In the end I felt like there was just no need for me to have this app on my phone any longer.","rating":1,"userName":"Ky horseman","isEdited":false,"title":"Slow and updated"}},{"id":"6173872235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:00:48Z","review":"I had a very simple and easy life before this app came this app has made me struggle to sleep and sometimes breath itâ€™s just so hard to see a Cheeto not get eaten I love Cheetos too but sometimes you have to hold it back this app is one of the most traumatic things that have happened to me.

It also did not work well for the iPhone at all, would constantly exit out and not allow me back into the app for approximately 15 minutes.... no joke. Terrible design, needs to be taken off of the App Store IMMEDIATELY. Waste of storage space .","rating":1,"userName":"Rileya44324","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6173832171","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:45:34Z","review":"I was chilln waiting for my pizza and then BOOM after pressing install for this app MY PHONE STARTED GOING CRAZY IT WAS BUZZING AND MAKING NOISES AND IT WOULD SHOCK ME IF I TOUCHED IT then my cat came over and swatted at it and it shocked MY CAT, MY CAT FREAKED OUT AND NOW I HAVE SCRATCHES AND SCARS ALL OVER ME I BLAME TRUMP THIS IS THE WORS APP EVER I HATE IT IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DOWN FOR THE SAFTEY OF THE PEOPLE.

It made my eyes go cross eyed and gave me such a painful headache. A serious risk downloading it for sure!!! Plus the name and title makes no sense! If youâ€™re going to make an app thatâ€™s based on something fictitious it should be in that genre. Like with the games or apps that tell completely fake stories. Truly saddened that an app aimed at children would be blatantly lying like this!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"young and unsatisfied citizens","isEdited":false,"title":"Lumpytrumpy"}}]}
