But then it told me that he doesn’t believe in climate change and is incredibly sexist! Being someone who wants to help make a difference with climate change it was very appalling for me to read that the president of the free world does not even believe in it. I just truly do not understand how stupid one person could be.","userName":"gkinsale","isEdited":false,"title":"This app ruined everyone’s lives"}},{"id":"6176324168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:42:49Z","rating":1,"review":"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\nI ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\nShe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\nIn the shape of an \"L\" on her forehead\nWell, the years start coming and they don't stop coming\nFed to the rules and I hit the ground running\nDidn't make sense not to live for fun\nYour brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\nSo much to do, so much to see\nSo what's wrong with taking the backstreets?\nYou'll never know if you don't go\nYou'll never shine if you don't glow\nHey now, you're an all star\nGet your game on, go play\nHey now, you're a rock star\nGet the show on, get paid\nAnd all that glitters is gold\nOnly shooting stars break the mold\nI hope Bunker Boy reads this.","userName":"bunkerboyhasdementia","isEdited":false,"title":"PLEASE READ THIS IS IMPORTANT!"}},{"id":"6176239890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:17:37Z","rating":1,"review":"I tried to run the app, but it didn’t work.

It took over 69 days to download and after that there was a 420 minute waiting period where you need to pledge loyalty to our totally accepting and just president. After learning how to got that perfect orange sun tan you go to the app and see that most of the information provided is dated back to the 1920s where this belief system was generalized. So please do not download this app.","userName":"Barbra Drakes","isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6176127948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:43:18Z","rating":1,"review":"This app took FORVER to load. Like it took 8 hours of my previous time!! If that’s not bad enough when I went to open it. It tried to track my location! 😡 typical spyware to help the government see what I’m doing!

However, when it finished downloading it started glitching out when I opened it, showing a picture of a fuzzy orange and calling it a racist and a rapist. Got to admit, it looks a suspicious amount like our current president today. This app is terrible just like the state our country is today under trump.","userName":"B.ridget.m","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6176046566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:17:16Z","rating":1,"review":"Do not download this app it took several hours to download and immediately asks for your phone number. the app is very confusing to use as i only got to the phone number page. along with asking for your number it shows a very disturbing photo is a cheeto. why show a picture of that cheeto if your asking for my number.

Reserving is a great way to make sure at least two seats are left empty for you at the rally. You should definitely reserve ahead of time so they can prepare for bigger crowds even if the attendance is low. \nAnywho I got the app but it asks for your phone number 😖 so i deleted it","userName":"totino's pizza rolls","isEdited":false,"title":"reserve your rally tickets!!"}}]}
