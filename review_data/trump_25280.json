From design to the contents of the application, this entire experience was a dumpster fire from start to finish. Every second that I spent paying any attention to this app was time wasted. So disgusting and disappointing.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6101529361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App Ever!","date":"2020-06-20T19:23:40Z","userName":"#JoeBiden2020","review":"I wish I have could I have given 0 stars because it doesn’t work, it only shows a 🍤 and I was hoping that I would get more insight but they are just lying about the Democrats too. Also they said you could sign up to get Coronavirus especially in Tulsa OK in his rallies. 1 out 5 stars","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6070276320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The fairies 🧚🏻🧚🏻\u200D♂️","date":"2020-06-13T09:54:16Z","userName":"bobby is a cow","review":"I downloaded this app and everything was going great until I noticed some small fairy like creatures outside my window 🧚🏻✨i thought nothing of it but it kept happening so I set up a trap and caught one and you’ll never guess what happened IT WAS A CAMERA 👁👄👁 I’ve never felt so violated as I am a teen girl","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6065787651","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Waste of time, don’t bother. Stick with Twitter.","date":"2020-06-12T06:39:15Z","userName":"femme_em","review":"I keep getting kicked out of this app every few minutes, it has some serious bugs. I find using good ole fashioned Twitter for updates on Donald J. Trump’s shenanigans is just more accurate, convenient, and easier to navigate. 0/10, do not recommend.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6064649845","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"SAD!","date":"2020-06-11T22:38:30Z","userName":"Stin KyHetero","review":"Downloaded this app to keep up with my daily bootlicking 🇺🇸🦅🍔, only to find it wants my social security, I love my trump but to go back on the grid just for rally updates when i could just get those at my weekly clan meeting (NOT BAD!)? NOT WORTH IT. I’m too intelligent (IQ of 50) to let the marxists and antifa get ahold of my SS number. Please fix the mr president. MAGA 😎","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6055644342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"To: Bunker Boy","date":"2020-06-09T17:30:09Z","userName":"uhhijbiihvu","review":"This app is absolutely horrendous. I was not expecting my eyes to be assaulted so quickly. The team went for a bold choice of bunker boy’s face as the opening screen, and I almost threw up. It was so concerning that I had to leave immediately. I would recommend fixing this problem by deleting it.🌸✨🌈🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6053886104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"do not recommend","date":"2020-06-09T08:19:16Z","userName":"Mr. Dickenson","review":"I downloaded this app and it immediately started glitching. i’ve been getting countless spam calls ever since I put my phone number in and same thing with emails.

But that is not what I received. They hacked my phone and now it won’t stop playing all star by smash mouth. It literally won’t stop. I will no longer be voting for Donald trump and instead I’ll just sit in my swamp. Do not get this app, it will ruin your life.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
