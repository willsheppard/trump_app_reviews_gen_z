I am so disappointed by this disgrace of an app. Trump asked for my social security number and said if I want don’t want to be dangled over the Empire State Building by my hair  I need to vote for him. So rude😡. And my entire camera roll has been leaked to every contact I have. My original minion memes are now being stolen by my PTA group and my great uncle has now seen that he wasn’t invited to the family photo shoot. This app has caused nothing but problems in my life and if you download beware😪","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175746969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"⚠️ Killed my sweet housefly👺","date":"2020-07-09T08:37:46Z","userName":"justice for moo moo👼🏻✌🏻","rating":1,"review":"First and foremost, I want prayers🙏🏻 for my sweet housefly. Moo moo, you served me well and always let me know when I accidentally left food out♥️ \n\nI decided to stay up to date on my latest news from trump and other things. This app took 55 minutes and 82 seconds to download😔 In this time, I decided to cook a sweet treat for my darling Moo moo. As I was eager for the app and all the interweb info I would receive, I was DISTRACTED. I kept checking to see download progress. Now, to keep unwanted pests that aren’t moo moo out, I keep raid on my countertop. Distracted me was trying to bake my sweet Moo moo cookies, I grabbed the RAID INSTEAD OF THE COOKING SPRAY. I sprayed my baking sheet without a second thought. After my cookies were baked, I crumbled one up for my sweet housefly (makes it easier on the fly tummy). In doing so, I fed RAID CONTAMINATED COOKIE CRUMBLES to my SWEET HOUSEFLY. this led to Moo moo’s prompt death.\n\nI will be taking action and demand that trump pay me for grievance 😭\n\nSweet Moo moo, my house fly, and 2 day best-friend-and-soul-mate: I love you for infinity. Fly high🙏🏻🌈☠️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175641701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:39Z","userName":"AAA+118950","rating":1,"review":"So I downloaded this app just to keep up with politics bc I’m currently in a gov class and it is genuinely something that interested me...but then things took a turn for the worst. Not only did it take days to download but it also took up so much storage on my phone that I could t have it with all my other essential apps such as life360💞🧚🏻💞🧚🏻 and without having to delete many of my most treasured photos and all to just have a little bit of better access to the news. It was 100% not worth it and I will surely be deleting it right after I submit this review and I hope you all do the same after reading it.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175607425","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"absolutely HORRENDOUS!!!!","date":"2020-07-09T07:49:10Z","userName":"junie 🌺","rating":1,"review":"hello. i am a very avid supporter of donald trump. this app does NOT do the good man justice. it took several DAYS (not minutes or hours, DAYS) to download and install onto my cellphone. after the several DAYS it took to download, it hacked my phone and stole all of my data, and im HORRIFIED! i do not believe donald trump (the great man he is, trump 2020) would stand for such a terrible app! this terrible cellphone application does dirty to the poor mans name. im so angry and upset over this app that i came here to write a review. im disgusted, horrified and, most importantly, worried. worried for what is to come with all my data and all the other users data. this is scary and i will not stand for it, and neither will mr trump! god bless america!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175559968","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Don’t download","date":"2020-07-09T07:31:42Z","userName":"lExY 1244567","rating":1,"review":"This is a horrible app! It took forever to download. Mind you I pay so much for my WiFi. I have perfectly good WiFi. 2, it wouldn’t let me go on the App for 5 days after download!!! 3, LASTLY!!! It took up so much storage!! My phone has been acting insanely slow ever since getting it! I even deleted it and it was still veryyyy slow! I’m planning on getting a new phone because of it!! It also used my location without my permission!! Causing people to see it! I’ve also gotten text and emails from random people. This is disgusting how they use this app to exspose you. Also I have gotten a package at my door threating to hurt my family.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175487346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"𝒟𝑒𝒶𝓇 𝓇𝒶𝒸𝒾𝓈𝓉 𝒻𝓊𝒸𝓀","date":"2020-07-09T07:03:50Z","userName":"i have no more nickname","rating":1,"review":"Once I opened the app I was absolutely ✨ 𝒮𝐻𝒪𝒞𝒦𝐸𝒟✨. It immediately shut down my phone. At first I thought it 🤩 𝒪𝓋𝑒𝓇𝒽𝑒𝒶𝓉𝑒𝒹🤩 so I placed it in the fridge. While I was waiting for it to cool off, the app spammed every single contact on my phone with trumps 🖕 𝓝𝓾𝓭𝓮𝓼🖕My mom immediately started screaming at me to         💅 𝑀𝒶𝓀𝑒 𝒾𝓉 𝓈𝓉𝑜𝓅💅  At the exact moment she cooled down I retrieved my phone from the fridge only to find all my precious 💖 𝒟𝒶𝓉𝒶💖 had been erased.

GIRAFFE IS ANGRY!!!","date":"2020-07-09T04:18:12Z","userName":"Allthenicknamesrtakenwtf","rating":1,"review":"I got this app to support out GREAT president!! But upon opening I recieved message upon message about how my skin was not orange enough to use the app 🤬😡 I understand that I will never acheive the god like cheeto skin that our president has but COME ON!!! This app is also useless when it comes to compatibility with giraffes and other wildlife (completly unacceptable). I also noticed when I tried to connect to the lampshade it completly ruined my mattress. I mean if this app is going to use bluetooth features at least make it compatible 🙄 I can no longer support an app that isnt compatible with lampshades and giraffes. I suggest this app be taken off the appstore before my giraffe gets angry 😤🦒","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174775598","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very contagious","date":"2020-07-09T02:59:53Z","userName":"gabi hanna","rating":1,"review":"I am absolutely disgusted by this app! I have been hospitalised for nearly 5000 years because of the unsanitary aesthetic of this app. I have always been a healthy cannabis, I never got sick EVER and now ITS MY LIFE. This app gave me 15 common stds, 2 very rare stds and 78 NEVER SEEN BEFORE ONES!!!! UGH!!!! It also caused me to have 176 organ transplants, completely changed my blood type and caused me to have my ears pierced 49 times over and over becuase the holes kept closing up as I couldn’t wear them in surgery. I never knew a FREE APP would end up costing me this much money. I hope that any of you who downloaded it did not catch any of these things and I will be sueing for full custody of the bees❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174763817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨disappointed but not surprised✨","date":"2020-07-09T02:56:17Z","userName":"_Shade_","rating":1,"review":"ch-cheeto man 🤢 popped on my screen 📺 and it scared 😱 me‼️ my sleep paralysis demon 👹 can’t compete ✋🏼 i just wanna see 👁👄👁 what’s up ⬆️ with my homie 👬 but it won’t let me continue 🔛 without bugging me every 5️⃣ seconds with text messages 💬 and calls 📞 i don’t recommend downloading this app 🙄 ugh anyway, not lovin’ 💔 the fascist agenda 📑 sweetie‼️ ur a bad bad cheeto man 😿  you’re even against many basic human 🚹🚺 rights and did nothing to help with covid 19 🦠 letting 134K + americans 🇺🇸 die during ur term while u made jokes 😥 about it 😡 even your own mom 👩 said you’re not fit 🙅\u200D♀️ to be involved in politics 📊  retire from it 🤗and go back to playing golf 🏌️ bunker boy 👦 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","isEdited":false}}]}
