I love apps. And I love presidents❤️ Upon opening the app I allowed it to send me messages, and IT BEGAN SENDING ME LINKS TO THE ADDRESSES OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT TRUMP. It started out subtle, a message here a message there. Little hints to get me to hop in my car(silver Toyota Corolla, with black accents((runs so smooth:D))), and go to their houses, and VERBALLY ABUSE THEM. One of the links that was sent out took me to a writing workshop web sight that led me through writing a very mean poem to a woman  named Pamela who lives in Rhode Island. The next text message from the app told me to drive to her house. I got to the first stoplight on the way there and it gave me time to consider my actions. I realized I was being manipulated and tricked by the app. It took me six months of therapy to come to terms with my actions. I do not want anybody to go through what I went through. I sometimes imagine what would have happened if I went to Pamela’s house in Rhode Island.

I decided to leave and go for a walk while my phone rested. Then j saw a Cheeto bag on the floor and decided to pick it up. That’s when my phone started buzzing uncontrollably. I disabled all notifications and then put my phone down. Remember, my life was perfectly fine before this app. The when I ordered take out pizza, my dog ⓁⒺⓋⒶⓉⒶⓉⒺⒹ off the floor to the door. Then the pizza guy turned out to be a giant Cheeto. By that time my head was about to explode. Then, my dog turned into a Cheeto. Then on the new the reporters were Cheetos. I knew it was the end of the world. I quarantined myself from other Cheetos, trying not to get the Cheeto virus. My parents came by a few hours later, and they were also Cheetos. My neighbor was also a Cheeto. So now, everyone except me and a few other people are not Cheetos. If you download this, just be ready.","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Freesia_123","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK"}},{"id":"6173633920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"they asked me to get into my photos to get my social security numbers this is unacceptable and cannot believe app would let this trash app on here. it’s not nice that they are the one who gets their money and it’s so much to say to the guy he wants it is so much fun he has no money and i don’t get it gurl he gets a good one and then he’s going back in a high end he was so lucky omg i didn’t want him a big girl to think of it he would never get the one to him but i don’t get to see it he gets it he will get the back to his name again but it’s his fault he’s so funny he looks pretty and funny i he gets the old guy in a black dress he looks pretty like it he’s so pretty but it’s so cute he said what you guys did say it and then she thought she was like oh crap and then he looks so cute she was so mad that he looks pretty and she was cute lol but she’s so annoying she is like she doesn’t want her back then i don’t get me. literally the worst app ever !!","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"G3n3ration Zz ♡︎♥︎♡︎","title":"What in the world type app is this"}},{"id":"6173500162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have always looked at trump like he was a buttiful Orange goddess from heaven so I downloaded this app. I knew from the beginning this app was a little weird because I could hear laughing from the app but one day I heard not a laugh but loud cackling so I opened the app and his face was there.  He looked me dead in the eyes and said pepa and I crapped myself. I had to run to the bathroom but before you could say I like them big and chunky my explosive diarrhea was everywhere. I ran out and said why would you this to me I hate you, all of a sudden these big scary oranges rolled out in to my living room. Mr. Donald appeared on my tv he told me if you say I hate you again the oranges would fight me, I looked right in the eyes and said I hate you. Then they punched, kicked, back hand slapped. I said I got this😉😏I did it I fought them all off, I thought back to when I was a wee child and would watch karate kid. Thank you karate kid, thank you.

The fact that there are still people who back this man up appalls me. I have never seen so many blissfully ignorant people gather in one place before, you all say you come to this app for the news about your president but don’t realize that it’s HIS app. You’re never gonna see any of the negative things your “president” has done if you only read news about him on an app that will give him nothing but praise. I’m sick and tired of seeing so much ignorance all around me. Just open your **** eyes and realize your stupid mistake of electing this man. Grow up and be an adult for once in your life and realize that ever since you all elected this Oompa Loompa of a president that our society has been going downhill. **** even Mother Nature is telling you it was a bad idea. So please for the love of your so called great United States of America just realize your very very poor decision and stop being so ignorant.","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Im tired a lot","title":"Honestly, didn’t even use the app"}},{"id":"6173011363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i was looking to find ways to support the big🍊 orange🍊god🍊 and i found this app! as i tried to download the app, it kept saying error🚨not big enough. i pondered on what this message could mean. THEN i looked down at my stomach and my question was answered. i have to turn my itty bitty stomach into the size of mr. Oompa loompa! so i began dieting for the next 4 years, drinking 12 bottles of coke each day and 2 mcdoubles, and 3 mcfreezes each meal. i was finally the size of my forbidden president. i tried to download the app again and it said error🚨to big. I WAS FURIOUS!!! how dare he!! it said miscalculation: woman detected. so you were telling me, they assumed my GENDER! as the steam was flooding from my ears i tried to hack my way in and as soon as i got in, the first thing it said was “grab her by the p*ssy”. i quickly closed the app and deleted it. after 4 years of trying to get into the app and sacrificing my victoria secret model body, my journey ended in disappointment.","date":"2020-07-08T17:04:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"R a t a t o u i","title":"i gained diabetes from this APP!!"}},{"id":"6172935918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Firstable can we about how terrible this app works and horrible things it has done to my phone, When I downloaded it it took about 2 weeks to download and  the app is SLOWER then the president. Anyways it also affected the way my phone works and also it hacked my phone and I have Donald trump pictures in my gallery and I just want  say how disgusting that is.

I DEMAND 10,000 FOR A NEW PHONE SCREEN , ALSO can we just y’all the lack quality in the actual app . I thought the president business was supposed to be professional, I opened this app I thought I downloaded a kids app. I really thought my children downloaded this that’s how unprofessional it is .

Next problem when I opened the app I was greeted by a big orange 🟠 cheeto looking man. He was holding up a fist like he cares about anything. I don’t think I should give my phone number to a weird cheeto looking guy (that’s required to start the app) my mommy always told me no talking to ✨strangers✨ I think that also applies to my phone number. Another thing is this 🦋cheeto🧚guy why is he standing where the president should be standing 🧐. Before you even say this is our 🤮president🤮 don’t you mean 🌸b u n k e r🌹 b o i⭐️. Well anyways why is this an app I don’t like this weird ompa lompa anyways. Since when do cheetos wear suits. In addition all of his follower/ cult are saying this is a good app 👁👄👁. These reviews are so fake my mother had to burn my iPad when she saw the ompa lompa she said we can’t have any bad spirits in our home, therefore i am writing from my phone 📱","date":"2020-07-08T16:23:03Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"quetzalmisty34","title":"bunker boi no thanks❤️"}},{"id":"6177391550","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I went into the app I had already not liked it because of all the personal information it was asking for from me then I went into the privacy policy and saw that they had planned to sell my information to a third party wich made me uncomfortable nevertheless I continued but my phone got really hot after not even 2 min(which it has never done before) so very concerning to say the least but I continued to explore the app but then my phone got so hot I was not able to hold it anymore so I had to set it in the freezer in hopes to revive it but suddenly I heard commotion in the freezer and when I opened it up there was black smoke/dust EVERYWHERE my phone had exploded only after 15 min of owning the app which I do not think Is a coincidence the trump campaign is lucky I’m not suing because if my phone was not in the freezer I could have gotten severely injured this app truly deserves a zero but unfortunately I’m not able too rate it as such","date":"2020-07-09T16:35:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"not happy parent 2.0","title":"My phone exploded"}}]}
