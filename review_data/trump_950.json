I love apps. And I love presidents‚ù§Ô∏è Upon opening the app I allowed it to send me messages, and IT BEGAN SENDING ME LINKS TO THE ADDRESSES OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT TRUMP. It started out subtle, a message here a message there. Little hints to get me to hop in my car(silver Toyota Corolla, with black accents((runs so smooth:D))), and go to their houses, and VERBALLY ABUSE THEM. One of the links that was sent out took me to a writing workshop web sight that led me through writing a very mean poem to a woman  named Pamela who lives in Rhode Island. The next text message from the app told me to drive to her house. I got to the first stoplight on the way there and it gave me time to consider my actions. I realized I was being manipulated and tricked by the app. It took me six months of therapy to come to terms with my actions. I do not want anybody to go through what I went through. I sometimes imagine what would have happened if I went to Pamela‚Äôs house in Rhode Island.

I decided to leave and go for a walk while my phone rested. Then j saw a Cheeto bag on the floor and decided to pick it up. That‚Äôs when my phone started buzzing uncontrollably. I disabled all notifications and then put my phone down. Remember, my life was perfectly fine before this app. The when I ordered take out pizza, my dog ‚ìÅ‚í∫‚ìã‚í∂‚ìâ‚í∂‚ìâ‚í∫‚íπ off the floor to the door. Then the pizza guy turned out to be a giant Cheeto. By that time my head was about to explode. Then, my dog turned into a Cheeto. Then on the new the reporters were Cheetos. I knew it was the end of the world. I quarantined myself from other Cheetos, trying not to get the Cheeto virus. My parents came by a few hours later, and they were also Cheetos. My neighbor was also a Cheeto. So now, everyone except me and a few other people are not Cheetos. If you download this, just be ready.","date":"2020-07-08T22:07:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Freesia_123","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK"}},{"id":"6173633920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"they asked me to get into my photos to get my social security numbers this is unacceptable and cannot believe app would let this trash app on here. it‚Äôs not nice that they are the one who gets their money and it‚Äôs so much to say to the guy he wants it is so much fun he has no money and i don‚Äôt get it gurl he gets a good one and then he‚Äôs going back in a high end he was so lucky omg i didn‚Äôt want him a big girl to think of it he would never get the one to him but i don‚Äôt get to see it he gets it he will get the back to his name again but it‚Äôs his fault he‚Äôs so funny he looks pretty and funny i he gets the old guy in a black dress he looks pretty like it he‚Äôs so pretty but it‚Äôs so cute he said what you guys did say it and then she thought she was like oh crap and then he looks so cute she was so mad that he looks pretty and she was cute lol but she‚Äôs so annoying she is like she doesn‚Äôt want her back then i don‚Äôt get me. literally the worst app ever !!","date":"2020-07-08T20:32:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"G3n3ration Zz Ô£ø‚ô°Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô°Ô∏é","title":"What in the world type app is this"}},{"id":"6173500162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have always looked at trump like he was a buttiful Orange goddess from heaven so I downloaded this app. I knew from the beginning this app was a little weird because I could hear laughing from the app but one day I heard not a laugh but loud cackling so I opened the app and his face was there.  He looked me dead in the eyes and said pepa and I crapped myself. I had to run to the bathroom but before you could say I like them big and chunky my explosive diarrhea was everywhere. I ran out and said why would you this to me I hate you, all of a sudden these big scary oranges rolled out in to my living room. Mr. Donald appeared on my tv he told me if you say I hate you again the oranges would fight me, I looked right in the eyes and said I hate you. Then they punched, kicked, back hand slapped. I said I got thisüòâüòèI did it I fought them all off, I thought back to when I was a wee child and would watch karate kid. Thank you karate kid, thank you.

The fact that there are still people who back this man up appalls me. I have never seen so many blissfully ignorant people gather in one place before, you all say you come to this app for the news about your president but don‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs HIS app. You‚Äôre never gonna see any of the negative things your ‚Äúpresident‚Äù has done if you only read news about him on an app that will give him nothing but praise. I‚Äôm sick and tired of seeing so much ignorance all around me. Just open your **** eyes and realize your stupid mistake of electing this man. Grow up and be an adult for once in your life and realize that ever since you all elected this Oompa Loompa of a president that our society has been going downhill. **** even Mother Nature is telling you it was a bad idea. So please for the love of your so called great United States of America just realize your very very poor decision and stop being so ignorant.","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Im tired a lot","title":"Honestly, didn‚Äôt even use the app"}},{"id":"6173011363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i was looking to find ways to support the bigüçä orangeüçägodüçä and i found this app! as i tried to download the app, it kept saying errorüö®not big enough. i pondered on what this message could mean. THEN i looked down at my stomach and my question was answered. i have to turn my itty bitty stomach into the size of mr.

I WAS FURIOUS!!! how dare he!! it said miscalculation: woman detected. so you were telling me, they assumed my GENDER! as the steam was flooding from my ears i tried to hack my way in and as soon as i got in, the first thing it said was ‚Äúgrab her by the p*ssy‚Äù. i quickly closed the app and deleted it. after 4 years of trying to get into the app and sacrificing my victoria secret model body, my journey ended in disappointment.","date":"2020-07-08T17:04:42Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"R a t a t o u i","title":"i gained diabetes from this APP!!"}},{"id":"6172935918","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Firstable can we about how terrible this app works and horrible things it has done to my phone, When I downloaded it it took about 2 weeks to download and  the app is SLOWER then the president.

Next problem when I opened the app I was greeted by a big orange üü† cheeto looking man. He was holding up a fist like he cares about anything. I don‚Äôt think I should give my phone number to a weird cheeto looking guy (that‚Äôs required to start the app) my mommy always told me no talking to ‚ú®strangers‚ú® I think that also applies to my phone number. Another thing is this ü¶ãcheetoüßöguy why is he standing where the president should be standing üßê. Before you even say this is our ü§Æpresidentü§Æ don‚Äôt you mean üå∏b u n k e rüåπ b o i‚≠êÔ∏è. Well anyways why is this an app I don‚Äôt like this weird ompa lompa anyways. Since when do cheetos wear suits. In addition all of his follower/ cult are saying this is a good app üëÅüëÑüëÅ.
