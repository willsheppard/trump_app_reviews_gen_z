I tried to turn off notifications but for some reason every time I open my phone I find hundreds of notifications from this app. I even tried deleting it but to no use. Imagine following 10,000 creators on TikTok and turning all notifications on. Yeah, it’s that bad. Not even silencing my phone works. There are so many sometimes that my phone just crashes. This app is disastrous, please, “if you value your life” don’t get this app.","title":"Too Many Notifications","isEdited":false,"userName":"E_partyka","date":"2020-07-09T10:58:15Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175973751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I got the app and it IMMEDIATELY asked me for my phone number like WOAH. I don’t want you leaking my number anywhere, luv 💕. This president do be asking for people’s numbers like tf? And guess what? I deleted the app and I saw someone else’s review BUT EXACTLY 12 OOMPA LOOMPAS SHOWED UP TO MY DOOR AND ASKED ME TO INSTALL IT AGAIN AND GIVE IT 5 STARS. That’s the exact same thing. Even with the minions like are y’all planning sum’? So anyway don’t download this bad app it’s so bad that it tastes worse than the lunch ladies’ food at school after being yelled at my Gordon Ramsay 💫✨💖💕 don’t download this data leaking app","title":"This is so bad 💖","isEdited":false,"userName":"lechucito24","date":"2020-07-09T09:53:55Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175913920","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For starters this app took a week to download. Upon opening it I’m met with a message saying if I don’t vote for trump me and my family will be executed. Seeing this message hurt me and I’m shocked that the president who is supposed to protect us said this to me and I’m also a woman of color. After I tried to close that app after that disrespectful message it was acting glitchy and not cooperating with me. Please watch the news and look up articles about this man, he is not innocent he should be in jail for all the things he’s done.","title":"Horrible App 😡.","isEdited":false,"userName":"get him outta here","date":"2020-07-09T09:34:05Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175829023","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It crashes every 0.5 seconds. It forced me to agree to rub Trumps feet every 10 days just to sign up to go to a rally! I want to just support my president, but I have a major feet phobia. I totally thought he would understand considering his fear of tiny hands. I don’t know how he manages to get so much cheeto dust all over him with how small those things are! Anyways, I hope with all the time he’s had hiding in the bunker, he’ll be able to just remove this app off the app store AND himself from office for bonus points.","title":"This app is deplorable!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"cheetoman1432","date":"2020-07-09T09:05:47Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175686697","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is quite possibly the worse app in existence. First off, the app took 45 TO OPEN and when it did? It crashed. I had to try I kid you not 30 MORE TIMES FOR IT TO WORK. You say make America great?? Maybe work on making your app great or even usable. This is the saddest excuse for an app I’ve ever seen and I believe it does not deserve to be available for download on the same platform as TikTok because for the more obvious reasons TikTok is FAR superior and the makers of this app and our president should be ashamed of themselves. Period and goodnight.","title":"🧚🏼\u200D♀️💞✨Trash✨💞🧚🏼\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"userName":"😌🧚🏼\u200D♀️💞","date":"2020-07-09T08:17:20Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175639919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app thinking everything would be fine, I just wanted to support our non-RACIST, non-HOMOPHOBIC, non-SEXIST, non-RAPIST president 😔😣 then all of a sudden my grandmas ashes on the mantle started shaking. The urn opened all by itself and the ashes started coming out of it in a swirling motion! Then they all came together to form my grandma who was dead! She begged me to delete the app and told me it would cause me harm if I didn’t!! Of course I deleted the app and my grandma is gone again but man that was crazy!!! It’s all because of this demonic app!!!!! Don’t download it :((((","title":"My dead grandma","isEdited":false,"userName":"settleforbiden2020:(","date":"2020-07-09T08:01:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175634728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded it to get the real news straight from the president but when I opened the app the only thing that kept popping up was a video of trump saying I’m the ugliest person alive and that I should go back to my country. And then after it played over and over again without stopping it froze my phone and somehow deleted all my photos and texts and filled it up with a picture of trump pointing through the screen and in capital bold letters it said “YOURE SO UGLY!! I DONT WANT UGLY PEOPLE SUPPORTING ME” I don’t know what happened but he’s lost my vote😌💅🏽💞💫😋🧚🏼😅","title":"DISGUSTING APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"shdudipcocirdjdd","date":"2020-07-09T07:59:06Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175628678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I was born I was diagnosed with eczema, asthma, and a few years ago, scoliosis. Downloading this app made me get more rashes, I couldn’t breathe, and my spine got even more crooked. I don’t know if anyone else with these diseases experienced the same thing, but I never had these problems before. I’ve always been able to control my eczema with my medicine but it hasn’t been working. Using my inhaler still makes me not be able to breathe, and my spine was never curved as much as it is now. And it’s all thanks to this app. TRUMP IS RUINING LIVES PLEASE DO NOT VOTE FOR HIM.","title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"awesomegirl1216","date":"2020-07-09T07:56:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6175582445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was so excited to get this app to support our loving, strong, charismatic, open-opinionated, non-racist president! I love President Trump so much I tend to call him Donnie to my family! When I first open this app, it works like a charm! When I complete sign up, President Trump’s NUDE PHOTO was COMPLETELY COVERING my phone screen!! I hate to go into detail, but it’s the one of him naked with his hands on his hips getting his spray tan.. a mortifying sight to see! I couldn’t close the app either! It was just there! It completely froze my phone! I had to restart it. Absolutely AWFUL.
