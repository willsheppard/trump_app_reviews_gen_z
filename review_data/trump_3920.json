In one of the photos I’m not sure if they just forgot to do some photoshopping to it because they left his hands so small. He comes off as being weak with his little hands. Like Biden’s campaign is able to maintain Joes strong looking manly hands. Also the campaign within this app is unsafe for the public, it promotes not wearing a mask to help battle the spread of coronavirus. And encouraging individuals to gather at these rallies is a huge safety risk, these rally goers are encouraged to ignore the CDC guidelines of social distancing and the wearing of a mask. This app seems very unsafe to the public due to this.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is unsafe","date":"2020-07-09T17:27:34Z","rating":1,"userName":"flamboyant🌺"}},{"id":"6177539104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app because i wanted to see what it was all about, but when i opened it up, Donald J. Trump himself was the opening screen, and told me that i was a stupid dumb idiot and that i should kms 😡 i expected way more from our President, i am so disappointed!!! once i passed the initial screen, it asked for some basic information about myself to make a profile, and when i input that i was a woman, the app crashed! it did this several times and would only ever crash if i said i was a woman!!!!!! so disrespectful!!!! i will be deleting this app off of my phone ASAP!!! i am so disappointed in you, Mr. President. don't ever come for tiktok again 😌✌🏼✨🌸🍃💫","isEdited":false,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T17:19:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"Blackflames98"}},{"id":"6177313578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to see how mr. trumpy but instead the first thing ever happened to my dad he had a horrible experience and he said he had no idea how he was gonna it was 👺👺👹👹💩then my mom was like omg wow that’s not good enough to make it happen lol 😝then my cat was born to be a trump supporter And was the first one to believe trumpy but my cat downloaded the app and she died on the spot as soon as she opened it RIP :( do not waste your money and you don’t have any more to do with this app and it’s so annoying that omg is a good way for you to ruin your life with a lot more people like you so i don’t wanna get it really sad and it looks so badtameez hahahahahah I hate this app.","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP RUINED MY LIFE!!😡😤😭👎","date":"2020-07-09T16:12:39Z","rating":1,"userName":"Gucciaka2pac"}},{"id":"6177146422","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took days to download. I finally was able to open it and there was this nasty, wrinkled orange potato on my screen and I had NIGHTMARES 😖about it. The font was far too big to read with any sort of ease and it kept asking for money. But I’m just a WOMAN so I can’t get any money to give without asking my superior husband 😢 because I’m dumb and probably would be too irrational with my own money. Then I woke up and I had a weird inkling to speak in circles, avoid answering a direct question, blame stupid dems 😤 for this coronavirus, pronounce it like “chy-na” and just be kind of racist and gross. Is the app influencing me??? How is it able to do this??? I wouldn’t recommend that to anyone.","isEdited":false,"title":"nasty😔","date":"2020-07-09T15:24:48Z","rating":1,"userName":"llyod gross"}},{"id":"6176989357","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I decided to download this app to see Bunker Boys plans for running the US, and I was not at all surprised that there was none.  Even though the app was useless and had NO information, it crashed my phone.  After I gave up on the app I decided to walk my porcupine.  While walking him he pulled the leash out of my hands and ran away.  He has never done this before and I don’t think it was a coincidence that it happened on the same day.  (Later that same day I also got a paper cut!)  DO NOT GET THIS APP! It is terrible in the first place and brings bad luck with it. (For all those worried about my porcupine, he has been located and is safe back at home)","isEdited":false,"title":"✨Trash✨","date":"2020-07-09T14:41:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"GZ✨"}},{"id":"6176961144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You see I was interested in getting this app to see what crazy thought Trump has next, but I have a lot of complaints about this app. First of all, this app took forever to download. And when I mean forever, it was literally FOREVER. It took me an entire day to download it, unlike other apps like snapchat, tiktok, and instagram. Also, when I finally could open the app it kept lagging the entire time and glitching too. And I don't think it's from millions and millions of other people going on this app, because it's not as popular as social media. Trump really needs to get his app together if he wants people to actually look into it.","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App","date":"2020-07-09T14:34:11Z","rating":1,"userName":"1Anonymous0"}},{"id":"6176687092","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is the worst app ever created. I downloaded this app and suddenly evil miniature oompa loompas started jumping out of my phone into my bathroom. They held me hostage their for 6 days with no food and only toilet water. They told me that tik tok was going to be banned from the US  and so i roundhouse their bootys and grabbed their legs and swung them around my room. Then i started singing “be happy” by dixie until their ears started bleeding. Then my pet praying mantis (jaquavis )  crawled into my bathroom and grabbed me and carried me away. If it weren’t for jaquavis i would be dead. If this app was never created none of this would have happened and i wouldn’t have to have 10 ommpa loompas in my bathroom.","isEdited":false,"title":"orange Oompa Loompa👨\u200D🦼💗🧚🧚","date":"2020-07-09T13:22:04Z","rating":1,"userName":"Save tik tik 2020"}},{"id":"6176671150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Even though the app speaks for itself, it’s the most annoying app I’ve ever had it’s so hard to download, and when I got it, it was a lot worse than I had expected.   Let me give you some friendly advice, delete it now.  If I ever see such a disgrace on the App Store again I’m telling all my homegirls and we’re not downloading anything ever again.  This app is the absolute worst.  It shouldn’t even exist.  A day after I got it my phone was turning off and on and the app was randomly exiting out.  If I were to tell you an example of a good app, this app should take notes from Tik Tok.  We need and love that app much more.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is absolutely terrible","date":"2020-07-09T13:17:50Z","rating":1,"userName":"_Kenzie14"}},{"id":"6176623998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This game is really glitchy.. like I thought it would be really sick bc we get to play as the president, but then i realized how glitchy, and how little choices we have. Im still waiting for the update where racism gets removed? we havent gotten that since the last update, where Obama was removed. Also I was wondering what happened with the ICE side campaign? Many players said that was wayyy too much for them to handle, and most called for abolishment or a reform. Can we just cut to the big update where we add a new character to play as for the president? That would be nice. All and all, 11/10 for the Obama era, and -11/10 for the update from Obama to Trump.","isEdited":false,"title":"This game is ok....","date":"2020-07-09T13:05:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"smsalty"}},{"id":"6176393178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Never in my life have I had to wait 10 hours for an app to download. When it finally did download, my phone began to glitch (randomly turning off, continually getting messages that my storage was full, etc.). And these things never happened until I downloaded this app! Also, my camera roll was suddenly full of pictures of this weird orange looking clown man thing????? It was extremely traumatizing as the pictures depicted this man holding an upside down Bible while saying racist and sexist things??? Not entirely sure why that came with the download of this app, but here we are! Anyway, I just had to give this app a one star rating🥴","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL🤢NO GOOD🤮VERY BAD😱","date":"2020-07-09T12:02:13Z","rating":1,"userName":"✨🌈🥰✌️"}}]}
