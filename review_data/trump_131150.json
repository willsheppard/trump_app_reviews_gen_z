EVER","review":"DO! NOT! DOWNLOAD!\nThis app stole my chicken,my wife,my wife’s boyfriend and my eighteen children. by any cost do not download this. this app is the SOLE reason me and my wife are getting a divorce. yeah you heard that right.Charles if your out there i want to to read this...: I ate the divorce papers, Charles. I ate them with ketchup. You want me to get serious about our divorce? You always called our marriage a joke!  Last week, I asked why you walked down the aisle with me and you said “for the exercise.” Ha, ha. That’s funny, Charles. I’m laughing, not crying. Ha, ha. I’m laughing because you’re about to give up on a woman who is infinitely lovable.\n\nJust ask Paul who's loved me since eighth grade.  Paul’s sent me over two hundred original love sonnets. Paul may be insane, but I would never ask him to sign his name to a piece of paper promising to just turn off his love. That’s what you’re asking of me. To sign away my right to your brown eyes, to your hands through my hair before bed...\n\nSo I’ve written you a sonnet. “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate, rough winds do shake the darling buds of May and...”  I’m not crying. I’m laughing. It’s all a big joke. I didn’t write that sonnet. Paul did. I think it’s good.\n\nWhy did I eat the divorce papers with ketchup?  So I could stomach them!  What I can’t stomach: losing you.\n\nagain the application isn’t worth loosing your family over. Stick to other apps."}},{"id":"6174394930","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:40Z","userName":"a.ayanna.a","rating":1,"title":"ewwww","review":"jehdjdhdmfj"}},{"id":"6174394239","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:28Z","userName":"barbz.4.bernie","rating":1,"title":"truly horrifying 😔","review":"this app truly does not pass the vibe check ✋🏼😤 filled with nothing but fake news ❌ and hatred 😖 would give -10000 stars if possible 🙊"}},{"id":"6174394238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:28Z","userName":"navkare","rating":1,"title":"This app should be deleted","review":"Okay so first of all when I opened the app and ugly orange popped up on my screen it almost made my heart stop and the app glitches a lot for no reason but I give this a one star rating because this app sucks😢😤"}},{"id":"6174393690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:08:17Z","userName":"hdhjDISGUSTING","rating":1,"title":"Disgusting🤢🤮 hORRIBLE!","review":"As soon as I clicked on the app it started glitching and then my phone was on 75% and it was on 5% already this app is so bad it ran out of charge it literally tried to run away from Trump.
