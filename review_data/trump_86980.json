As soon as I opened the app I got such a piercing headache I was scared for my LIFE. The moment I opened this god-forsaken app.. the images I saw damaged me forever, no one should ever have to see such HORRIFIC things. I have suffered severe brain damage from the vast amount of false information and ignorance I witnessed. Not to mention when the I gave them my contact information as instructed, they bombarded my phone with so many texts and emails DEMANDING for money (seems kinda desperate) ... yikes! Along with this brain damage I endured and will have to live with FOREVER, my phone also took sever damage :( it hasn’t worked the same since. I’m guessing this app downloaded some sort of virus onto my phone.. much like the virus this very administration failed to protect U.S. citizens from and CONTINUE to fail [hence Covid-19]. I have read through a lot of the other 1-star reviews on this app to see if my experience was shared and NOT to my surprise.. everything checks out. I also tried uninstalling this app and every time I went to delete it the words -and I quote- “White Power” flashed across my screen along with other racist, homophobic, and sexist phrases that haunt me to my core. The brain-washing tactics this app is so obviously using is harmful to communities and the freedoms of this country. I DEMAND this administration and especially the pr*esident (if you can even call him that) be held to the highest accountability for their crimes against humanity.\n\nThe ONLY place Trump should be in 2020 is a mental hospital, he’s got a lot of issues (just ask Mary L. Trump)... Prison is also an acceptable outcome, definitely more preferred by me."}},{"id":"6175559897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"adamstop","date":"2020-07-09T07:31:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worse app ever","review":"it gave my phone weird vibes pretty sure it has a virus do not get it, it’s still traumatized from downloading it smh"}},{"id":"6175539178","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gunshwow","date":"2020-07-09T07:24:02Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app sent me back to the time before the civil war","review":"Hi"}},{"id":"6175470637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"gen z 👂👁👅👁👂","date":"2020-07-09T06:57:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"RÖNĮÊ ÆŃD ÅRČHĪË ÁŃD BÊTTŸ ÂŃD JÜGHÈÂD","review":"Is this app is a waist of time it took me 5 days to download then gave me a virus then next thing u know my refrigerator has a virus"}},{"id":"6175440520","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"the boogie man 👻","date":"2020-07-09T06:45:16Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This gotta go ✌️😗","review":"This dude is the worst president and if he trynna steal my entertainment then this gotta go too 😤"}},{"id":"6175354033","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"girlwhohates class dojo","date":"2020-07-09T06:11:37Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"bad.","review":"after i downloaded it my phone started glitching up and now i got a new phone:/ i think it’s a spy app do. not. trust."}},{"id":"6175350212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Meeeeeuuuuh253","date":"2020-07-09T06:10:07Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"If I could give zero stars I would","review":"Cheeto puff app is gross"}},{"id":"6175341385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"juucjxhxjrFur","date":"2020-07-09T06:06:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🗑🗑 Trump🗑🗑","review":"This sucked so bad it bad that my phone screen broke"}},{"id":"6175302024","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anti Cheeto Man 😌","date":"2020-07-09T05:51:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP IN THE HISTORY OF APPS","review":"I had very high hopes for this app but it really let me down. You know I was just sitting here eating my Chile and lime Sabritones after I had just downloaded the app when out of the corner of my eye I saw a raccoon just sitting on my windowsill staring at me. We had a little staring contest for a few minutes before I decided I should befriend it so went over to the window and opened it. That was when I noticed that it had a note attached to its paw. The raccoon opened the letter and started reading, “ To the human standing before me, I am afraid that last night one of our youngsters got into your home and may have eaten all of your bread. Now, we do sincerely apologize for this and offer you this acorn as payment. Farewell. “ And then it scurried off. I just stood there stunned for this was a shock. What would I have for breakfast in the morning?! I would never survive without my avocado toast. So I did what any rational person would do, shutting the window I rushed into the backyard and sang beautifully so that Bambi came. I told him my missing bread situation and asked if he could skip over to the store and get me what I needed. He nodded so I handed him some money and he hurried off. I went back inside and realized that I was hungry so I went into the kitchen and grabbed a banana from my fruit bowl and peeled it. I was about to take a bite when I realized that the entire thing had MUSHY BROWN SPOTS!!!! It was not ok, I had to throw the whole thing in the compost bin which I suppose was good but I was really looking forward to that banana. I went back to my fruit bowl to grab a different banana but ALL OF MY FRUIT WAS ROTTEN!!! I was about to start crying but then I saw that Bambi had come back. And he had bread in his mouth! I opened the door for him and he dropped it at my feet. At least one good thing was happening, right? WRONG!!! Bambi had gotten me healthy bread with seeds! I only ever eat sourdough with avocado on top. This just would not do! I wondered what I had done wrong to deserve such a bad day and come to think of it, the only thing I did differently was download this app. So I rushed to my phone and deleted it. You know what happened? A fairy came and waved her wand! All my fruit became perfectly ripe and I had piles upon piles of sourdough even the seed bread turned into sourdough! I could not believe my eyes, it was all because of this app. I 100% advise NOT TO DOWNLOAD!!!!"}}]}
