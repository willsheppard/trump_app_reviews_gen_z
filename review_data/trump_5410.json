As soon as I deleted the app everything went to Normal and the tree went away. And that’s why I give this app a one star review🍊😞"}},{"id":"6173249896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"awful app VERY HARMFUL","userName":"Avery Henry","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:21:08Z","review":"this app took AGES to download and when i clicked on it it glitched for 5 minutes before a picture of this TERRIFYING ORANGE MAN 🍊 popped up. i’ve never seen anything so scary. my best friend was next to me and saw it and screamed. she’s so terrified of that orange looking creature she can barley sleep at night anymore. the app makes this horrible screeching sound while your using it and is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded. if possible i would give this a ZERO out of 5 stars ✨ DO NOT download it or you will regret and and then natural consequences will be devastating 😭 i’m still suffering from what this horrible app has done."}},{"id":"6173179366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Bad sickness 😭😪🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","userName":"alejandromatias matias","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:57:59Z","review":"When I downloaded this app I immediately GOT SICK TO MY STOMACH and threw up and, that’s not corona I got tested the next day they said I was fine and then my sister got sick my brother my mom my dad my grandma my grandpa my dog my hamster my fish my aunt my uncle my cousins and my dog was so sick of being sick he flew away I and i see him trees sometimes but he never came back 😭😪and then my friend got sick and she said I had to get rid of the app or else we would never feel better so I did and I felt greater than ever!! ......so if you don’t want this sickness I suggest you don’t get this app and leave a 1 star review 😱🤢🤮😪😪💩💩"}},{"id":"6173141305","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely ✨𝓉✨𝑒✨𝓇✨𝓇✨𝒾✨𝒻✨𝓎✨𝒾✨ 𝓃✨𝑔","userName":"Elijah9892","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:45:50Z","review":"Not only did this app take for ever to download, when it finally downloaded I felt so overjoyed I jumped up and down and knocked my grandmother down the stairs 😭. On top of that, at the bottom of my stairs was my pet roach named billy and he was squished beyond recognition, it’s really a shame how many deaths trump has caused 😭😭. For some reason opening this app blinded my mother too, the doctor diagnosed her with a rare diseases that causes the nervous system behind her eyes to shut down whenever she sees 𝑜𝓇𝒶𝓃𝑔𝑒 𝓂𝑒𝓃🟠. It’s a real shame, anyways, your better off downloading Dumb Ways To Die.

When I open the app it told me that I had to “show my allegiance to the peach man by doing tasks.” I thought what was the worst that could happen so I started my tasks and the first one was to find the nearest child and drop kick it. It just so happened I have a little brother so I grabbed him and drop kicked him into the trash! I thought that was it but I was so wrong🙀 It then told me to ingest LYSOL SPRAY! I thought this was a little strange but Trumpy said to do it🤷\u200D♀️ But  not even a slurpy second later I was PREGNANT🙀😰😻😿 Thanks a lot tiny hands now I have to sacrifice my baby🥰🎉🤭🍭🧚🧚\u200D♀️🥳"}},{"id":"6173126108","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Terrible","userName":"fkdckejvdj","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:41:06Z","review":"This app is horrible!! When I downloaded it, it ruined my phone and every time I click on an app other than this one President Trump’s face shows up with the threatening message “orange lives matter🍊” This must be a virus because my phone won’t let me do anything but go on this app. Also, if I forget to close the app at night Satan himself will spawn out of my phone and wander my house, looking for his next victim. The two times this happened my family and I had to hide until morning to avoid being taken to the underworld. 0/10, I would not recommend this."}},{"id":"6173016228","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"um no❤️","userName":"😭rip grandma😔😓","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:06:11Z","review":"Once I downloaded this app a very large puffy Cheeto broke into my house through my window, leaving shattered glass everywhere (he didn’t even offer to pick it up😡RUDE). He grabbed my phone📱 and proceeded to grind it into a fine powder (very good seasoning, it makes everything taste like metal and glass) I’m having to leave this review on a Samsung smart fridge because my phone is beyond broken. After destroying my phone he grabbed my grandma my the collar of her shirt 👚 and started punching👊 her and screaming that everyone needed to drink bleach and Clorox. Then as quickly as he came, he was gone.(R.I.P. grandma 👵😔) Also he left Cheeto dust everywhere😡"}},{"id":"6173010886","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","userName":"mypresidentoboma","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:04:33Z","review":"You know I was just in my vaccination on Straight TikTok.

Anyways the discussion in this app is AsTroNoMiCAl!!. I cried. Why? Idk. I just cry sometimes it’s no big deal. But when I was done crying I her scream I thought it was all the 30 kids my neighbor had.

Everytime I go on the app it jumps off so much fun to get it back on the time and time to do it again I love the app I love the game it makes you think about you doing something like it and it is a great app for me and you get your mind and you can do it now and then I gotta was it like you were gonna was a great game I love it so good app love. Make America Great again because trump destroyed it. He did the exact opposite of his slogan. No one should vote for this orange face bastard. And he raped kids. How would you feel as the parent or one of those children knowing your rapist is your president."}},{"id":"6172987271","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"worst app ever","userName":"💮🔆💮","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:57:23Z","review":"it took literally so long to download and i tried everyone to make it go faster but it just wouldn’t work. i tried to redownload and after 3 DAYS of waiting it finally finished. when i tried to open the app it wouldn’t start and kept telling me to try again later. i have never experienced such trouble while trying to use an app. i wish i could give it less than a star rating! i’m furious! it was full of bugs and hackers sending me pictures of this ugly orange man and i couldn’t get rid of it! this app is an abomination to have on the store! GET RID OF IT"}}]}
