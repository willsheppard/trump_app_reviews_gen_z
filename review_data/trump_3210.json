Ranging from Sailor Moon to Hannah Baker, to say i was disgusted would be an understatement. Once i closed the app out i forgot about it for a little bit until i clicked out and all of my apps were this one. I am outraged, it took me forever to find out which disguised app was the app store so i could tell people how awful this is. i am utterly ✨disappointed ✨","isEdited":false,"title":"✨It’s Bad✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:39:32Z"}},{"id":"6177331139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jo132456","review":"Was SO excited to see there was finally an app to keep up to date with the latest in fascism because it can be SO hard to find sources that paint our disgrace of a “president” in a good light anymore. But then every time I opened the app, I got a phone call from a random number (different every time) that bullied me for a different aspect of my appearance? And it was always super accurate!! Downloading this app must’ve allowed someone to start watching me through my phone! How else would they know the things they did. DO NOT download this app if you value your privacy!! So creepy! Almost as creepy as Bunker Boy can be, so I guess it was just supposed to remind people what a creep they support.","isEdited":false,"title":"DELETE THIS APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:17:27Z"}},{"id":"6177237819","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Babyglow7271828","review":"After it took three days to download I opened the app and IMMEDIATELY!!! IMMEDIATELY!!! I was face to face with a menace to society. It was saying The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.","isEdited":false,"title":"Wow AMAZING !!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:50:46Z"}},{"id":"6177015403","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"NikixTomxJameslovetriangle🥰","review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!! First I went on and it asked for my social security number so I put it in and next thing I know TWO CIA AGENTS knocked at my door! So understandably I yeeted out the window into a tree and watched as my mom opened that door. The agents grabbed her, snatched her wig, and made her do the cha cha slide 420 times. BUT THE WORST thing they did was when the escorted her to the car once she got in they played SWEET CAROLINE BY NEIL DIAMOND FOR 24 HOURS STRAIGHT. This sent my mom into into psychotic breakdown where she then rampaged for 48 hours straight and wouldn’t stop yelling “a white refrigerator ooh”. Now she is in a psych ward and we have to pay all of her bills but they’re too expensive for us to afford😔","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump is so confident😘😍💕💋i usually don't make an app when i feel ugly🧚\u200D♂️💞","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:48:49Z"}},{"id":"6176914859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chicken🍗wang🤩","review":"This app killed my parents. My parents downloaded it just to keep up with bunker boy and then after a week they started seeing things. Meaning the ghost of the orange. At first I thought they were lying so I had to see what was up. So I downloaded the app and after a few days I started seeing him too! Around my house, under my bed, and even in my shower(which scared me so bad that I jumped out of the shower and accidentally broke the shower curtains). I had to stop seeing oranges everywhere so I deleted the app, but my parents kept it and just died. Literally. The ghost of donald killed them. I witnessed it and let me tell you it wasn’t fun. He told me that if I wrote a review to the app then he would spare me. So here I am.","isEdited":false,"title":"no❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:22:02Z"}},{"id":"6176752079","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Wolvesmoo565","review":"I am severely disappointed with this app. I downloaded it so that I could support my very not homophobic, not racist, not misogynistic, not a child predator, and definitely not bad president.\n\nIt tools hours to download the app itself, which is very strange considering I have great WiFi and lots of storage, and not just that, but when I opened the app I was greeted with a page that asked for all of my information. And obviously, I have it.\nA few days later I learned my credit card was being used and ALL of my accounts had been hacked. This is unacceptable on so many levels, and I am severely disappointed.\nAfter that it proceeded to call me profanities and slurs, activating apps I didn’t open myself and sending rude, hateful, and distasteful messages to ALL of my contacts.\n\nAnd top it all off, the app KILLED my children. All of them. \nIt snuck into the house, the app, after controlling my phone and literally committed murder after already robbing a bank and robbing me of my life.\n\nThank, but no thank you. This app is horrid- just like our president.","isEdited":false,"title":"Fake News 🤬","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:39:09Z"}},{"id":"6176682545","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"godX2-trailrun","review":"When I went to open the app🕸I saw this flaming🔥hot ☄️Cheeto 💧in 🌫ranch☁️getting a spray tan and I saw something in never, ever, want to see ever again in my lifetime! It. Was. Donald. Trumps. NUDES. It was the most nastiest this I will ever see. Donald Trump was also in a workout video when I opened up the app for the second time. It was also horrifying it was like watching a bag of chips trying to work out 🏋️\u200D♀️. For some reason I open the app a third time, to find him dancing to a TikTok and he kept on flipping me off. He is very disrespectful, immature, and A catastrophe waiting to happen.

I understand that some people may be embarrassed or ashamed that they downloaded the app in the first place but I assure you we are not here to judge you I just want you to know that you do not have to re-download  the app again together we have the power to make the apple store GREAT again","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever I hate it here","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:01:38Z"}},{"id":"6176336452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"at frvxzs","review":"When ever I open the app, my phone freezes, my screen goes black, and there’s always a knock at my door and I receive a text message at the same time. When I go to my door, I always see two people who are covered in DJT merch, they force their way into my house and attempt to completely outfit me in merch while I scream and resist. It’s always of no use, I wake up and I’m covered in MAGA gear and my lawn and car is covered in the Trump logo and signs. When I go to my text message, the message is always a bill for all of the “products” that I supposedly just purchased. This is the third time it’s happened, so I deleted the app and locked my doors.
