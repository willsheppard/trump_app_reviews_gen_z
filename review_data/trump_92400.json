Obviously I love Mr. Cheeto Head 🟠and believe all of his lies, but this app it despicable! I downloaded this app to hopefully help our president “make America great again” (as he is supposedly doing ❤️✨) and check up in the boomers, ✨💖but now me and my whole family is scarred! The second I opened the app my whole screen just turned a deep orange 🍊, and I thought I saw Mr. Cheeto heads face, and my whole phone was just orange! The app wouldn’t stay open for more than 3 seconds at a time, so I just stoped trying to open it. Soon everybody got a sudden urge to assault my mom, and she ended up washing all the dishes in the house frantically screaming “I’m not a dishwasher!” “I don’t need a fake tan!” as she chocked in her sobs. All the boys in the house started using random racial slurs, and said they were going to kill all the peaceful protestors ✌️! They ran out the house, chucking oranges at anybody in their path. 🍊 Fearing for my families lives and the peaceful protestors, I immediately deleted the app and my everybody thankfully, was fine. We all came back to the house, but the 🍊never stopped rolling. Down the street they went. On dark, eerie nights, sometimes I still see the Cheeto Gods face in my nightmares, savagely tipping into oranges, not even bothering to peel them. Just starring back at me, pieces of orange fly into my face, by he never says anything. Just stares."}},{"id":"6173498822","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cheeto😌","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"i almost died","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:37Z","review":"i almost died when i saw the front paige of the cheeto because he burnt my eyes"}},{"id":"6173485232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"suckmyasstrump","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely terrible!!","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:58Z","review":"I hope the creator of this app stubs their toe! this app is cursed!!"}},{"id":"6173483758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"I know you love me xoxo","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T19:40:28Z","review":"I wanted to download the app but the it glitched my hole ipad it made it turn into an orange 😭😭😭 DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT PLEASE IT WILL GLITCH YOU APPLE PRODUCT 😭😭😭😖😖😖"}},{"id":"6173473998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Emi111222","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App","date":"2020-07-08T19:37:07Z","review":"I don’t like the app"}},{"id":"6173471222","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"g kJ dib du","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Bad app","date":"2020-07-08T19:36:09Z","review":"It is absolutely horrible"}},{"id":"6173469542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"whyisitsohardtofindanickname2","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Why","date":"2020-07-08T19:35:34Z","review":"Just why #settleforbiden"}}]}
