To my amazement it’s a Cheeto with a combover???  I mean at least get a toupee! Anyway I got so distracted by this one picture of it (the Cheeto) that I stepped on a crack in the sidewalk. And you know what that means. I got a call from my dad and he said “Come home, I think your mother broke her back!” And it just so happens that she was taking a pizza out of the oven so now she has third degree burns all over her body from dropping the pizza AND a broken back! To hell with the piggy Cheeto! Thinking about suing 😡 I do not recommend this app!","date":"2020-07-09T01:08:38Z","userName":"homiesexual😎"}},{"id":"6174322847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"please don’t download❤️","rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app to see what all the “hype” was about...but it immediately crashed!! after opening it several times it finally worked. even worse....when it finally started working. i became ✨𝓾𝓷𝓬𝓸𝓶𝓯𝓸𝓻𝓽𝓪𝓫𝓵𝓮✨ i was very disappointed and my whole phone started glitching! now i can see why there were so many bad ratings. i would recommend NOT getting this app. it caused so many problems for me (and it seems the rest of the community) that it should be TAKEN DOWN. thank you for your time❤️","date":"2020-07-09T00:45:25Z","userName":"heyheynat"}},{"id":"6174322767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"No❤️","rating":1,"review":"Miss Keisha\n8 July 2020 \n\nMy review on this app \n\nSo when I first opened the app I was greeted in the most ridiculous way ever. They had asked for my phone number like uhm Chile you haven’t even taken me out first and your asking for THAT. And secondly I  heard that the owner or the person who paid for the app is actually not real. Like they’re a hologram . “ To one who is not real shall be considered a snake” (me).  So I do not support someone who is not real aka a real life human being. So this is why I gave this app a one start review and if I could I would give it a negative one. \n\nI would also like to claim that when I was in New York the creator of this app actually called me a fat ugly roach and I did not appreciate it at ALL. \n\nIn conclusion this app was a waste of time even in the quantum realm. Therefore my review is valid and should not be questioned. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed this essay.","date":"2020-07-09T00:45:23Z","userName":"Judge toler"}},{"id":"6174315419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Hot Cheeto Porn","rating":1,"review":"I don’t even know where to begin, I opened the app and the first thing that popped up was a message saying “ur mad ugly, get off this app” then it said “never mind, it says ur underage and that’s his favorite type.” At this point I felt very uncomfortable but decided to give it a try, however, the opening page was a picture of a hot Cheeto working out then a video saying “I’ve been waiting for you.” I have now decided to flee the country and change my name because I feel very unsafe, I think I want to go somewhere calmer, like Hong Kong. Anyways, don’t get this app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:42:53Z","userName":"yessir9836"}},{"id":"6174229428","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"😡🤢🤮","rating":1,"review":"First of all it says to be 17+ or older so younger people can’t use this app like is it inappropriate or something like geez. I didn’t know you had to be that old to use this app there should not be a age restrictor because we have right to do whatever we want so yeah. So if we really want to use this app we will. And we have to give personal information like our phone numbers and other stuff who would want to do that like no way🤮. We don’t know if there’s a virus in the app or anything so why would we give out our information.","date":"2020-07-09T00:13:10Z","userName":"like no way Karen"}},{"id":"6174189156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Confusing","rating":1,"review":"Trump and his administration need to realize his voting pool is older people. With that being said, this app is far too confusing for older people to use. Older generations need a simple app in order to better understand what’s going on in this world. Along with this I noticed extreme bias and in accurate information portrayed on this app. In conclusion, this app is not only confusing, bias, but it is also unbelievably slow. I thought it might be my Internet but I’ve tried using the app in multiple locations and it still does not load!!!","date":"2020-07-08T23:58:07Z","userName":"a fellow granny"}},{"id":"6174114411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"✨👄✨","rating":1,"review":"i 🤝 was 😌 a 🧚🏽 girl 👧🏽 in 🤗 the 😁 village 🏡 doing 😀 all 🙆🏽\u200D♀️ right 💁🏽\u200D♀️ then ✨ i became 🦋 a princess 👸🏽 overnight 🌚 now i gotta 🧚🏽 figure 🤓 out 🙌🏽 how to do 🤝 right 👍🏽 so much 🙀 to learn 📚 and see 👁️👄👁️ up 👆🏽 in the castle 🏰 with my new family 👨\u200D👩\u200D👧\u200D👦 in a school 🏫 that’s just 😌 for royalty 👑 a whole 🕳️ enchanted 🧚🏽 world 🌍 is waiting 🕰️ for me 🙎🏽\u200D♀️ i’m so 💫 excited to 🤩 be SOFIA THE FIRST 🥺🗿😞👊🏽🤩💗😙💫 i’m finding 🔍 out what 😳 being royals 👸🏽 all about 🤕 (sofia the first 😙) makin my 😎 way it’s 🌈 an adventure 🧗🏽 everyday 🙆🏽\u200D♀️ SOFIA 💫 it’s gonna 😛 be 🤭 my time ⏰ SOFIA 🧚🏽 to show 🎟️ them all 😎 that i’m 😌 sofia the fiiiiiiiiirrrrrrstttt😍","date":"2020-07-08T23:30:40Z","userName":"Marifer Navarro"}},{"id":"6174106373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Keep America Great","rating":5,"review":"The app does a fantastic job in providing all the resources one needs in order to stay active in the mission to re-elect President Trump. I am eighteen and a first-time voter, so this app makes the registration much easier. I love that it provides different ways to help the campaign, as I will definitely do all that I can to participate in this process.","date":"2020-07-08T23:27:48Z","userName":"HelpMeIMessedUp"}}]}
