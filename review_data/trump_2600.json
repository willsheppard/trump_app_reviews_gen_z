I tried calling my therapist to rant about what had just transpired, and he said that that was some really deep mental abuse and that I should call the cops. So I called the cops and he told me word for word, “sorry we are unable to take your call right now we are kinda busy arresting and killing the people we are sworn to protect even if it recalls disregarding the officials orders.” THIS IS GONNA TAKE YEARS AND YEAR AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YEEAAARRSS OF THERAPY TO GET OVER SUCH A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. Equally so WHY TF WOULD YOU WANNA MAKE AN APP ABOUT ONE OF THE WORST YEARS TO EVER EXIST!!! RIGHT ALONG SIDE THE 15TH CENTURY OH YOU KNOW THATS JUST WHEN SLAVERY HAPPENED!!","isEdited":false,"title":"I HAVE SOME SERIOUS TRAUMA NOW"}},{"id":"6173369190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T19:00:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"gforcehamster","review":"after he downloaded the app he went insane , he loved trump, the app told him to go to the nearest crackhouse and the app told him to ask them where they got the crack ❤️ , he slowly started getting into drugs after the app told him to go into the crackhouse 😳, the app then told him to check into rehab and then he went insane. he got a message from trump to tell him to go on a killing spree under the named or jonathan galldino 😢and trump kept telling him that he had to force teenagers and children to play a game or something bad happened to him , after his killing spree he decided to kill himself after because the  app told him too. im sorry if this is too much for a review but this is what really happened and i hope nobody downloads this app because a cheeto controls you 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"title":"MY UNCLE DIED"}},{"id":"6173361500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:58:14Z","rating":1,"userName":"amanda_567","review":"I downloaded this app to support our Cheeto puff president😌🍊, but I do NOT recommend downloading it due to my personal experience. FIRST OF ALL THE APP TOOK A WHOLE  24 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD AND IT IN THE PROCESS SHUT OFF  ALL THE POWER IN MY DAM HOUSE😡. Then once it finished downloading I made an account using my PERSONAL email (which then later got hacked in the span of 3 hours🤦🏽\u200D♀️). I was finally able to use the app but due to it I soon became homophobic, racist, sexist, and ignorant. So that brings us to present time at this moment I taking therapy sessions to help me get through what this app did to me. I just going to say this I 100% do not recommend this app because of what it did to me and my therapy bills are so expensive that I am in debt. So don’t get this app if you don’t want to end up like me. 😪","isEdited":false,"title":"WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"}},{"id":"6173345084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:52:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"hitman for bunker boy","review":"this app is incredible for all of the karen’s who support an orange, sexist, racist, disrespectful bunker boy pig. it’s amazing how he doesn’t stand up for lgbtq+ rights or the BLM movement or doesn’t try to fix gun laws or racist groups. but he will take away an app where teenagers can socialize and let each other’s voices be heard. gen z is done with all the boomers ruining society. yes we’re young but that doesn’t mean we’re stupid. we do know what our world needs. if you don’t agree with it.. well, you’ll be gone soon. our generation will actually change the world for the better. instead of listening to the cheeto who is called our “president”. anyways. bunker boy, care to address this? or are you going to go hide again because you’re scared of teens?💕🧚\u200D♂️✨🧙\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"don’t play with gen z"}},{"id":"6173329373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:47:00Z","rating":1,"userName":"BULLET PROOF BOY SCOUTS","review":"This app almost killed me and my family!! I do NOT recommend this app to anyone. I was taking a walk around the park and I saw an app so i could support the big orange oompa loompa, and well i said          “ why not get it. It looks pretty nice”. I took   a shower because I was all sweaty and when I got out of the shower I got out to my whole family tied up to chairs and random white people chanting “VOTE TRUMP 2020” and I got scared of course my whole family could’ve died .I really fast dialed the police and started fighting each and every single Karen when the police got there they took all of them and I started apologizing to everyone who was tied up in a chair. This app was very traumatizing for me and my family I do mot recommend this app to ANYONE unless you wanna get killed.","isEdited":false,"title":"This app is HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6173256396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"youstes","review":"this dummy dum orange peel goldly lock inconsiderate queen has broken my app last week when i was trying to inform myself of the almighty donald rump🎂 himself, when i clicked on one of the pages my phone blew up due to the overwhelming amount of MEAT the screen was conveying.

It’s a very serious matter! The second I opened the app there was a very disturbing picture of a deranged old man. Not only was that terrifying, I got a virus from the app! I think that someone hacked into my phone from the app! Maybe it was the deranged old man? Now I have to go to Apple to get my phone fixed. In addition, the app was very slow and kept exiting the app. I’m not one to write reviews on apps but you know that if I am it is a huge problem. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing an app so terrible available for download in the App Store!!! Shame on you!!! This app needs to be taken down! It is slow, gross, problematic and a waste of storage and time. I’m sick of seeing crappy apps and this is on the top of the list.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6173126101","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:41:06Z","rating":1,"userName":"mm.lvv","review":"Man I just wanted to support our loving president 😔 but when I opened the app, it asked for my email and I gave it to them because 🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨𝓪𝓷𝔂𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝓯𝓸𝓻 𝓶𝔂 𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓼𝓲𝓭𝓮𝓷𝓽✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️ then it kept on sending me emails and it was annoying. One night, my phone went off with a bunch of emails from the app saying “vote and make America great again “ whatever that crap meant. 🙄 I opened the app again and it asked for my body measurements and my weight 💀 like bro I think tf not! Then it asked for my race. It had the audacity to ask for my address , and when I didn’t put in my address . Trump came to my house and told me to go back to my country. He then spit on me and stole all my food from the fridge. DONT DOWNLOAD THE APP. Trump will go to your house and steal all your food 🍊","isEdited":false,"title":"Asked for too much 🤡"}},{"id":"6173059635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T17:19:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"yessssssty","review":"Your very presence killed my dog. \n\nI was scrolling through the app, as all proper redneck Kentuckians do. I am not up to date with all this new technology the kids use. My cousin-sister came in to ask me what I was doing. And I was showing her this app. Meanwhile my dog comes in, sees my phone with your face on it, and just falls over. Well my uncle nephew came in to borrow my tractor and we all three went to go check on my dog. Checked for a pulse: nothing. No breathing. \nWe took him to the vet and the doctor told me that the cause of death was Trumpitis, a very common disease in which a living being looks at your face and gets brainwashed it loses brain cells. Ya see my dog also had many other health issues, and this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I hope you’re happy with yourself.","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE"}},{"id":"6172508470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:38:26Z","rating":1,"userName":"melania_trump","review":"so i was talking with my friend, greg, and his older brother, roderick, and they told me about a curse that people got from downloading this app. i didn’t believe them so i downloaded it to prove them wrong, but EVERYTHING went out of hand. the moment i got the app, i was getting spammed with texts telling me to sing the national anthem! i got scared, so i started singing black and yellow by wiz khalifa but then a bunch of teenage mutant ninja turtles came and attacked me!!! they took me to this abandoned spot and started acting and singing the musical, cats, while they force fed me brussel sprouts. i asked who sent them, and they told me it was none other than the orange with the cobwebs for hair. i eventually escaped, so here i am, telling you to not get this app. it’s very, VERY dangerous. please stay safe everyone!!","isEdited":false,"title":"😾DANGEROUS!!!!
