Well, we were laughing at the intelligent ❄️ liberals who are MUCH smarter and prettier than us. And then my floating ferret head had an idea! He said to me “let’s make the libs cry by getting this app” and omg I was so excited to watch the little snowflakes cry. Well I opened the app and suddenly flashing colors flooded the screen and gave my poor ferret a seizure! And then it showed images of My king Donald trumpets little wiener. I always loved him but seeing that it’s so small that he’s practically a woman? I HATE women, they should not be in the whitehouse 🍆😻✨❌ therefore since he looks like he could be a girl with that lil package. I will not be voting for him again this year. 😂❤️✨😻❄️🍆🤭🤏🏻","date":"2020-07-08T23:39:02Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I loved trump until this.... 👁👅👁🖕","rating":1}},{"id":"6174066964","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ellen.20","review":"I downloaded this app to see what all the buzz was about. I stumbled across it on my recommended apps and then I realized I should check it out. That was my first mistake. I could not believe I fell for the propaganda contained within the 5 star reviews. Most of the people could not even spell or use basic middle school grammar. It just shows that the individuals supporting Trump in the upcoming election are not intelligent. I was also just disappointed by the quality AND content of this app. I was expecting something above the average trash produced by the Trump campaign, but instead, I got content that made me gag. Please delete this app to keep others from making the mistake to download this crap that should not even be an app in the first place.","date":"2020-07-08T23:13:20Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible app, don’t download","rating":1}},{"id":"6173964560","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Vannah_.","review":"When I opened this app it brung me to a camera...I exited only to see a red dot recording me, at that time I didn’t realize I was being recorded without my permission. I was confused and thought nothing of it. Then it asked me to put in my phone number, I did. A random number texted me only a second after that, then they texted me MY ADRESS!!! I was scared and asked questions. That made it even worse, then the number sent me a video recording that I realized was from the app. THE APP RECORDED ME!!! I asked them to get rid of it and they told me “Only if you send nudes”, I was excruciated with rage and regret. I tried to get rid of the app then I looked and saw my video on the home page of the app!!! Without my permission!!! I cried and couldn’t delete the app...please don’t download, I’m scared and traumatized.","date":"2020-07-08T22:34:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"IM SCARED","rating":1}},{"id":"6173941629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpsgorillapussylips😏😌✨🙈","review":"I feel violated 😢when u first open the app u see a Cheeto puff ,honestly just really disturbed by it my pet ferret saw it and it started screaming and crying and it passed away 😫😔the doctors say it’s from trauma ✨.this app is horrible who would make such a thing I showed it to my grandma and she had a heart attack 😌.

Then it traumatized my friend rat remy, who is a awesome chief by the way😌and made him go into cardiac arrest because of this app itself. Then the app made me slip out of shock and my eye ended up getting hit by my now mentally traumatized grandmother and I had to go to the hospital and they managed to save my eye thankfully 😌 BUT THEN when I opened the app I got blinded by all of the things this app was showing me and I ended up going blind and now I can’t see at ALL. I do not recommend this app unless you want it to ruin your life and put your grandmother into a mental hospital 😔😡","date":"2020-07-08T20:14:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app made me blind😔✨","rating":1}},{"id":"6173567726","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zendaya4president2020","review":"These reviewers leaving good comments and reviews must not have experienced the nastiness and disgust from this app that I have. Literally rats and cockroaches infested my phone!!😧 When I tried downloading this app it took forever to install!!! When it finally finished downloading I got a heck ton of spam messages from Trump himself! You know what he said? He called me stinky and said I was poo poo! 😭😭😭 Don’t trust this app, it allows our cheeto face of a president 🥺😞🙏 to have direct contact to you! He may say some hurtful things. After I blocked him, it must have really upset him because he sent Trump minions to my house, and they proceeded beat me up!!!🤕 I am disgusted, I am revolted, I dedicated all my time to this lord and savior, the cheeto god and this is thanks I get!! Ugh... Unsubscribed. ✌️","date":"2020-07-08T20:09:08Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No good, terrible app 🔫🔫🔫","rating":1}},{"id":"6173554933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"allie winston","review":"This app is horrible! My phone is glitching so bad and I can barely use it. As soon as I opened the app my phone shut down and I had to wait 30 minutes for it to power on. Once I opened my phone my wallpapers were changed to trumps face as well as a message sent to EVERYONE that said “vote for trump 2020”. I am severely disappointed that our president would make an app that installs a virus on your phone. I also found that $20 was taken out of my account and donated to trumps campaign. I will be needing a new phone because of this. I can’t even download my pictures to the cloud, i had the last pictures of my grandma before she died. I will loose those pictures as well as many other memories. So so sad right now and disappointed.","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Need a new phone","rating":1}},{"id":"6173464584","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"supportthecheesepuff","review":"DONT GET THIS APP!!! i support the giant orange in dc with all of my tiny minuscule heart so i decided to get this app and further support the anti christ🥺🥰🤩🧚🏻\u200D♀️ suddenly after hours of waiting for it to download, someone suddenly knocked on the door! obviously i grabbed my AK 47 to prepare bc i never go anywhere without it🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌈💕i opened the door to reveal and GIANT CHEESEPUFF🤭😩😳 it barged into my house yelling KARENNNNN while i shot off rounds of bullets at it. no matter how many times i shot it, it still wouldn’t back down. it proceeded to destroy my entire house including my multiple shrines to stalin, trump, and fox news😭🤢🥵 immediately i knew that this app was made by liberals to target those who love america and the whites who control it😵😲😧the teens and liberals are taking over!!!
