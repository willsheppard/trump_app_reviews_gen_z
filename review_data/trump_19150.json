But it also stole my money too. I put in my credit card number and info and it kept charging me for stuff I never got.

But it doesn’t seem to work the way I wanted it to. My name is Karen and I am here giving this app a one star because there are so many ads, nudes, and etc. The app it’s self Is very problematic.

This app like the “man” it’s supporting is a complete waste of space and time. For one I don’t understand why it is running like the bunker boy is still alive we all know he overdosed on hydrochloroquine, so why the fake news. Anyway moral of this is that life the infamous toddle himself this app should hide in a deep bunker under the ground.","title":"Absolute trash","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173910971","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️no thank you🧚🏻🌸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:14:55Z","review":"So obviously I had very high hopes for this app. I expected quality content, as President Trump consistently does such great work (that was sarcasm). But would you look at that! Turns out this app is total crap. Useless, disgusting, infuriating, poorly designed, bland interface. Much like President Trump, this app is a complete waste of time and resources, and I believe it should be removed.","title":"Oh heck no","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173905713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mediumchild8","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:13:00Z","review":"When I first saw the logo of the app I was already appalled but I decided to open it...worst decision of my life. I almost became blind at the sight of the Cheeto people call a president. With his fist up I just remembered how many people put their fists up in protest of police brutality. Those fists were beaten by the hands of this man. I am disgusted by him, this app, and those who support his racist and homophobic ideals and actions.","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173881679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"whogontellher","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:04:13Z","review":"I just wanted to start by saying that this app has life tramautizing pictures of a man that somehow reminds or corn and Cheetos 🤢 the app is very difficult to use and it always glitches out 💓💞💗💙💙💞 the words are very hard to see and it also gave my phone a virus .
