Yes. SNAPPED ME IN HALF. Ripped me apart. Tossed my salad. Jumbled my jim’s. Anyways, since healthcare is so expensive here in America (thanks to our president), my bill is $895,346 for my surgeries. The worse thing about this is, is I thought Washington was still our President? This app is an absolute scam, who even is Trump?? My body is so swollen upon repair and I’ll never get laid again. Thanks a lot. Would rate this zero.","date":"2020-07-09T14:08:56Z","userName":"averyjester910"}},{"id":"6176808723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"my family is dead because of this app😭😭","review":"after downloading this app and using it constantly for about a week i started getting unusual messages on my landline, someone claiming to be a full trump supporter telling me i wasn’t a big enough fan of him and that no matter if my screen time said i spent fifty two hours on this app weekly i wasn’t in it enough to be considered a full supporter like him. very strange as i don’t know how he knew that was my average time. then things escalated as i began to receive weird items on my doorstep (glass shards, and dead birds and such). it all reached a pinnacle last night when the man broke into my home and killed my beautiful republican wife and children, then looked at me right in the eyes and removed his mask, revealing to me, that he was donald trump. 😔😔 i’m sorry i disappointed you so donald.","date":"2020-07-09T13:54:06Z","userName":"republican man ralph"}},{"id":"6176797763","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"MAJOR DIFFICULTIES!!!","review":"this app is absolutely terrible it has a ton of issues and bugs, after using it my phone froze. i had no idea that these problems were occurring bc of the app so a few days later i opened it again and my device froze again. i decided to bring it into the apple store and they said to delete this app. best advice is to not waste your time on it. oh also i should throw in there that i am definitely not a supporter of this man! got the app to laugh at his “updates” and sh**. \n\nONE LAST THING!!! \nSAVE TIKTOK 2020","date":"2020-07-09T13:51:12Z","userName":"Faith_Mariah_913"}},{"id":"6176793727","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Now I was a proud Trump supporter until I downloaded this app. First things first, it actually did take 3 days to download which is unacceptable. Next, they immediately asked for my phone number which is very inappropriate because I am in a married relationship to my husband Kevin. The last thing they did before I deleted the app was kidnap my firstborn child Mary-Anne Kate and they made me pay to have her back. I am disgusted by this behavior and I am going to have to say I do not support Trump anymore. #Jakefromsubwaysurfers2020 😻✨❤️👑😼","date":"2020-07-09T13:50:10Z","userName":"Penguin #1"}},{"id":"6176725688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Possessed my goldfish!","review":"When I first downloaded this app, I had high expectations. However, after a couple of days I started to notice that my goldfish would act crazy whenever I was on the app. It started out with the goldfish becoming more brightly orange (except for these weird pale circles around his eyes). He started puckering his lips and swimming into the side of the tank repeatedly. The other day, I got home from work to see him swimming around in his tank with a knife. I had to relocate my family to a hotel out of fear.  Don’t download this app!!😡","date":"2020-07-09T13:32:12Z","userName":"krink18"}},{"id":"6176720424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"This app broke my phone????","review":"Hello! I downloaded this app, and put in my number. But all of a sudden I’m getting HUNDREDs of text messages in Russian??? I plugged it into google translate and many of them keep saying “vote for our friend” but like idk what on earth that means?? Plus now my phone keeps glitching to the point where I can hardly use it at all. After deleting the app and switching to another political party suddenly my phone is great again! Kinda funny how that worked out. Anyway, I guess I have to vote for Biden this year!","date":"2020-07-09T13:30:51Z","userName":"✨💞😍"}},{"id":"6176696257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Took forever to download and Info was not useful","review":"I wanted to download this app thinking I would gain insight on America and what it has to offer but i couldn’t even get it to download right away. After 2 minutes of downloading it would stop, it took me forever but I was determined. Finally after 42 hours it finally downloaded! I was so excited to use the app but as soon as I opened it my cat jumped out of the bag and clawed my earlobe to shreds. If I could give this app a -1 star I would. I’m currently in the hospital.

First 69 weeks of download time now that’s just inappropriate. Then my camera never turned off and really weird stuff started to happen to me irl. My WiFi just turns off randomly, my kitchen cabinets will just swing open and closed all the time, and I always have dreams that I’m running but every time I look anywhere but straight Trump is right there starting at me.","date":"2020-07-09T13:14:10Z","userName":"test one won to the cool fin"}},{"id":"6176639525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🤮","review":"the app took 69 WEEKS to download like how is that even possible???? and once it was downloaded it kept crashing😪 once it finally DID open it had a message saying “go back to mexico” which i found very offensive considering i’m not even mexican and i was born here so that was just confusing. As a lacrosse playing american i thought this app was going to be more supportive of its people😪 but instead found that it only had pictures of a puffy cheeto with a golf club in its hand💔 he wasn’t even that good at golf😭","date":"2020-07-09T13:09:32Z","userName":"jazzzzzz010110"}}]}
