I actually don’t support this creep. If you do, then from the bottom of my heart to the tip of my middle finger, I sincerely hope you get struck by lightning the next time you leave your house because the world would be better off without you in it :)"}},{"id":"6175167762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:01:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Just what you should expect","userName":"Chickennoodlesoup77","review":"This app does not function well at all. It’s glitchy and it crashed my first time opening it. Luckily I never have to open it again. It also provides too much false information that has no credibility whatsoever, but what else did y’all expect at this point? Would rather go without a phone than have this app downloaded any longer."}},{"id":"6174924387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:43:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Very mad!

Truly disgusting. He’s like the Chito you find on the ground after 5 years of it being under your bed. I do truly feel bad for anyone who thinks a ~pedo~, ~racist~,~person who exploits lgbtq+ while being openly homophobic~~~~, ~ and horrible fatherrr~ (#savebarron2020),could be the president, ~but he might like the economy, so we all goodddddd~"}},{"id":"6174887717","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:33:01Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤮🤮🤮","userName":"hdheiw","review":"I opened the app just to see a huge picture of a talking orange if I wanted to see that I would have watched the talkng orange show on you tube and then I kept going on only to see a huge T. rex jump scare and then I saw little bugs crawling through the screen they even started to come out of the screen onto my hands that’s when I decided to give this one star I don’t recommend this app 🧚🏼\u200D♂️🌈🎊🧚🏼\u200D♂️🌺🌸🧚\u200D♀️🌈🌈🧚🏻🌺⚡️"}},{"id":"6174877008","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:29:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Wish I could put zero stars","userName":"Allie #🦎","review":"This is the absolute worst app ever! You see, I love to eat! And this app made my blanket die! Therefore, I have to get a new washing machine. All I wanted to do is read Charli D’melio’s and Lil Huddy’s tweets, but nooooooooo. Now I have to get a new Washing machine!!! 😡😡😡This app is awful because after I got a washing machine, I got ice cream. It was delicious, but the app did not do that for me! I had to do it my self! I thought this app would be great. Such a let down!! 👎👎"}},{"id":"6174790885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:04:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"REPULSIVE CONTENT","userName":"Cjjxvzvwjxbdofkgm","review":"Whenever i’m on this app, i always see an overly tan man with hair the looks like it’s made from hay! whenever i look and the man i get physically sick and i feel the immediate need to wash out my eyes. i am outraged that this app is still allowed on the app store, this app is too grotesque for even the dark web. i hope i can move on from the traumatizing experience that is this app, but i fear that the man’s cold and desolate eyes will haunt my soul forever."}},{"id":"6174789341","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:04:06Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolute worse","userName":"Yusra_ya7","review":"Let’s start with the icon. My kid use my phone sometimes, and the icon is very inappropriate for kids. She is allergic to oranges even if she looks at it. Her eyes started itching when she looked at it. Don’t even get me started on when I opened it. The things I saw made me lose my mind. Even Karens are shocked to see that. It would be nice if this app doesn’t exist anymore! Thank you or I’ll be contacting the manager of App Store 😤😤"}},{"id":"6174787986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:03:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible! Ginormous Failure","userName":"KaitlynBennet","review":"This app was awful! As soon as I downloaded it there were so many ads it was so hard to use! Not to mention none of the features made sense. I feel like I just got a bunch of malware. I’m going to change my email immediately after this since it collects it upon entering. I’m not even sure the email goes to his system since the next day I got blown up with spam."}},{"id":"6174787470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:03:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would...","userName":"🧚🏻\u200D♀️big ed✨","review":"In the wise words of TLC “No, I don’t want your number. No, I don’t want to give you mine.” I don’t know who this man thinks he is. The AUDACITY of that pervert to be asking for private information like that. The format resembled a dating website a little too much and it made me uncomfortable. But my hacker did get Willy Wonkas number through here so that’s a plus. Still, I bet this Cheeto keeps his Oompa Loompas hostage. #savebarrontrump"}},{"id":"6174777811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:00:35Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Stole my Dino chicken nuggets","userName":"aestheticanimegirl","review":"This app is terrible! I downloaded it while eating my Dino nuggies and the Dino nuggies disappeared! I was starving and I made them with so much love 😔, I’m not mad but really disappointed. If you were hungry I would’ve made you some, haha sike nah there just mine. Next time you try and take my Dino chicken nuggets I will get my sandal and beat you. Not only that I will tie you up and eat dino nuggies infront of you. So next time don’t take my dino chicken nuggies!!!! 😤🤬"}}]}
