I do not recommend anyone else putting this app in your phone. Once I’m done with the review I’m deleting this horrid app, as you should do ad well. Please take this app off of the App Store in the favor of Apple users, eliminated any risk of cellphone malfunctions. 👁👄👁 💅🏼","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER !!","date":"2020-07-08T19:51:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173497265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"annariddle","review":"Hey, hey\nIt's JoJo\nHere we go\nIf something about the day just got no taste\nLa la la la\nLa la la\nAnd you're feeling like life's no piece of cake\nLa la la la\nLa la la\nIf someone salty got you down\nLa la la la\nLa la la\nThere's sugar in the air\nJust look around\n(Look around, look, look around)\nBubble gum\nGumdrop\nDrop it like a lollipop\nNever let the craving stop\nA million flavors\nBreathe 'em in\nRainbow colored oxygen\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nThis life is sweet\nSweeter than you think\nGonna live the dream\nLike a candy queen\nLike a candy queen\nThis world's got more\nThan you can ever hope for\nJust gotta walk through the door\nLike a kid in a candy store\nLike a kid in a candy store\nLike a kid in a candy, candy\nRunning 'round the world\nEverybody sing\nLa la la la\nLa la la","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173493133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kiwiyuh","review":"this app is an absolute mess. first, it took 3 tries to download properly and was always constantly glitchy and laggy. it wasn’t even organized properly. it took up so much storage and made my whole phone become all laggy. what a waste of space. i hate this and would NEVER recommend this to anyone.","rating":1,"title":"horrible experience","date":"2020-07-08T19:43:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173481371","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jorrie18181818","review":"First of all this is just awful design. Like I opened the app and first thing I saw was trumps neck fat being pinched my his collar. \nSecond, when I reopened it (bc i had to close it cause of the neck fat) there was a terrible shriek noise and it made my sister go insane. She started jumping around yelling gibberish and nonsense. I tried to talk to her but all she said was “DONALD TRUMP NEED GO BYE BYE!” I i was like “yeah ik” and we just vibed","rating":1,"title":"the worst app ever created","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173480721","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"townezoe","review":"i downloaded this app because it had the name of our lord and king, donald trump on it. as soon as this app finished downloading a bad, orange rash began spreading across my skin. it was rough and itchy. i went to tell my friend about the rash but when i started speaking i realized that everything coming out of my mouth sounded crazy. i couldn’t finish any of my sentences and none of my points were valid. i deleted the app right away and my symptoms were gone immediately. trump is the real virus. he spreads hate and division within this country. we still have a chance to make 2020 a better year: vote out trump.","rating":1,"title":"worst app i’ve ever downloaded","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:23Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173476869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"arianrain","review":"This app keeps freezing when I open it then it exits me off the app it has even deleted its self from my phone at one point.

I tried to download the app and it took forever to download as soon as it did download it glitched out so many times.

I downloaded this app for the lovely orange president, and my phone went black for a whole hour, because my phone realized that it downloaded the app of a racist, rapist president. After my phone when black I had to power it back on and delete the app for it my phone to work properly.
