I gave them my address, 😹🥊 credit card info, 🦆🧚\u200D♂️ and other things that are required to have the app. Then all of a sudden, I hear a loud bang 😵 from behind me. I look and 𝑟 𝑢 𝑚 𝑝 is standing behind me!! He used my address I provided them with to find me and break into my house! 🏡😾And the worst part of it all,, 😖😖 HE WASNT WEARING CLOTHES 😟😫😭 I’m obviously in shock and just sit there for a minute contemplating what was happening. 💭Then I realize our president donald j  𝑟 𝑢 𝑚 𝑝  is standing in my house, NAKED! 🧍\u200D♀️This is unacceptable, this is disgusting, 📢 and I’m pretty sure this is illegal. ❌ DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! 😿🤖👾👻💀👹🤕🤢👁💥","date":"2020-07-08T18:50:46Z","userName":"not a person??? 🤡🤡"}},{"id":"6173215463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Tracking and hacking","review":"Now I originally downloaded this app to be helpful in helping me stay up to date with our country’s finest 🍊However I am sad to say this app has been nothing but a NIGHTMARE to use. The app requires users to have location permissions on which tracks users while not even being in the app. I’m not very fond of being spied on. This app also crashes about every 52 seconds to be exact. Also, whenever I close and reopen the app I am taken to the donation page. I could not imagine donating supporting this crummy app. This app needs a major redesign and facelift. Perhaps something orange 🍊? Needless to say, I will be deleting this app so I am no longer tracked or hacked.","date":"2020-07-08T18:09:47Z","userName":"mrweger"}},{"id":"6173154653","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"It’s a no for me❤️","review":"It saddens me to see such an important campaign be poorly executed through this app. President Cheeto deserves so much more than this. He works so hard to make America whit- I mean great. The creators of the app had the audacity to post pictures of a cracked carrot!! That is so disrespectfu! MY president is NOT a carrot...He’s a cheeto, get it right please. Anyway the app also made my phone glitch I couldn’t use any social media! Not even twitter to post my fancams of cheeto man under his tweets. Any platform where I could express my freedom of speech didn’t work! I was only allowed to type TRUMP2020. If this is what our president approves of I can no longer support. Please don't download this app it’s not worth it!","date":"2020-07-08T17:50:06Z","userName":"heysurai"}},{"id":"6173071307","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"URGENT INFORMATION!!! ☢️⚠️❗️❗️❗️","review":"Personally, I have never been a fan of this orange man who somehow controls America, but I never thought he would do something like this. Allow me to explain. This app was downloaded against my will when I bought two tickets to his rally (by the way Donald I'm sorry that I had to take my cat to the vet that day) but with curiosity of The Cheetoh I opened the app and golly was that a mistake. Firstly, the app showed a huuuuuge 🍊 and then it crashed. I was so frightened that I ran to the kitchen and to my surprise there was oranges on the cutting board. I did something only a person can do to defend themselves, I cut them and ate them...and they tasted rotten😡😔. I don’t like oranges anymore.","date":"2020-07-08T17:23:30Z","userName":"saucyrina😌"}},{"id":"6173034966","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","review":"This app took about a month to download. When I opened the app it was glitching. They kept asking for my phone number so I  entered it and a lot of my stuff got hacked. I don’t want anything to do with this app and I’m sure many other people don’t either. Once I opened the app for the second time it kept playing a weird video of cockroaches and cats which brought me many concerns on what it was. People should have an app that works perfectly fine, doesn’t play weird stuff, and doesn’t bring roaches to kill people’s cats. I would also recommend the app TikTok it has many great videos that can bring you joy. This is the end of my review. Thank you.","date":"2020-07-08T17:12:00Z","userName":"it every nickname taken?"}},{"id":"6173007667","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","review":"I downloaded this app to see what it was about and the second I opened it my phone started glitching out, badly. I would NOT recommend downloading this app. I think and know this app should be taken off the App Store. First off how is the App Store going to promote a rapist and a racist. Is that what you want Apple? Huh, really? He touches kids and women with NO consent given. He hates every race but the white race and to be honest he only cares about rich white men and why is that? It’s because he is one! This app should be banned immediately!! He also stole the identity of the Annoying Orange because Trump is annoying and has skin of an orange. Once again REMOVE THIS APP IMMEDIATELY! P.s. if you made it this far say hi to TikTok😉","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:34Z","userName":"I want sex"}},{"id":"6173001600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"nearly killed me","review":"this is a terrible app. as soon as i opened it i started to smell an orange scent. then i started TURNING ORANGE. at first it started with my nose but soon after that my whole body was completely orange. then i started getting terribly bullied by my family and my friends. but THATS not even the WORST part. i started craving oranges bc of this app and i started eating one orange after another. but guess what? i am sEVERELY allergic to oranges and had to be rushed to the hospital. we got there just on time and i nearly died, the doctors were surprised that i made it out alive. but when i got back home i started craving oranges again and i realized the only way that would stop is to delete the app.","date":"2020-07-08T17:01:46Z","userName":"anglerfishhhh2111111"}},{"id":"6172831715","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS APP","review":"This app is absolutely terrible and the quality of it is beyond low. Like the app, the president of the United States is kindred with this description. The economy is at an low, many jobs have been lost, and this situation could have been more preventable if the precautions and regulations for the corona virus were taken into consideration. The country is currently at a state of great division, as the president supports white supremacy in an acclaimed culturally diverse nation that supports all ethnicities and races, right? This app is a sensor of his actual articulation, especially in the clips were his part of speech is cut. I am not satisfied for what this president has done for our country and you shouldn’t be either💖🌟🥰🥳🧬","date":"2020-07-08T16:09:40Z","userName":"✨💖🥳no money🤍😘"}},{"id":"6172771247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"horrible app","review":"i downloaded this app to support our amazing president, but it kept glitching my phone. when i opened the app, my dog started barking at my phone and wouldn’t stop. my cat even tried to eat my phone!! then, i tried to register for the upcoming rally tickets. it said i could register for two tickets but only allowed me to get one! super disappointing because a friends was going to go with me. but i guess it’s ok because i just remembered that my aunt’s cow’s best friend’s pet bird just died and i have to go to its funeral that day. I also noticed that all of the news on the app was super biased and sometimes not even true!! this app is truly horrible and i don’t recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T15:52:24Z","userName":"Evielon"}},{"id":"6172693943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"take this app down luv 👁👄👁","review":"I GOT A VIRUS DOWNLOADING THIS APP ! 🤩 NOT ONLY THAT !
