I looked up the virus but any time I tried my phone would restart and I not turn on. It eventually downloaded after FOUR days of trying and it wasn’t worth my time. Whenever I opened the app it would shut down and once again restart my phone. This was the only app I could actually open which means I couldn’t go on any other app. Don’t waste you time on this app. Would not recommend.","userName":"johnson jope","title":"Absolutely horrible!!

But if I could rate it 0 stars, I would. I opened the app for the first time, and I think it released a racist white supremacist demon into my house. In the middle of the night, I was bombarded with voices whispering racial slurs and “make America great again.” My cat also went berserk!! She scratched my eye out because she became so agitated at the energy and voices in my room🤬I had to go the ER because of it!!!! My medical bills are now through the roof, and I have had to call my local priest to exorcise the spirit from my room. I would not recommend this app to ANYONE. 😡","userName":"tyririrowheoritutiew","title":"😬terrible."}},{"id":"6173655915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:40:19Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This app is truly just over rated!

It took about the entire day to download, and it uses so much data, that I couldn’t even open any other apps. When it downloaded, my father had passed away. I decided to say who was most likely to win at his funeral, but when I opened the app, my phone glitched out, and the phone snapped itself in half!! My mother disowned me because of what happened, so please have it take up less space and take care of the bugs.","userName":"Waving thru a windoOoOoOw","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE!! ^_^"}},{"id":"6173334744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:48:51Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"ok so first this app took 27 years to download. then when it finally downloaded, my house got infected with termites and caused my cinnamon toast crunch to develop spiders in it which caused me to lose my hearing. this app also caused my sister to turn into anne frank and go into hiding. and it also caused my pet turtles to sing songs that broke our noses and eyes. since i had already lost my hearing, when i lost my sight, i ultimately turned into hellen keller. the app also made my house collapse which made me and my family to have to move to alaska where we all froze to death and died.","userName":"alana✨🧚😽","title":"THIS APP TURNED ME INTO HELLEN KELLER"}},{"id":"6173280000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T18:31:04Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is completely infested with viruses and it constantly crashes. it is utterly useless and i had to get a completely new phone because the viruses in the app made it so i could only type “TRUMP 2020” and it sent the same message to all the contacts on my phone. it is absolutely horrible. it even managed to call people, play inappropriate videos, and delete all the pictures on my phone and replaced them with pictures of donald trump!!  i am horrified at how terrible this app is and even more disappointed that it came from our PRESIDENT!!","userName":"jdjksldj","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!"}}]}
