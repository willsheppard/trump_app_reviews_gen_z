Shortly after all my data on my phone was wiped and I started to get calls from pedophiles who already knew my information. I’m very uncomfortable and this shouldn’t be allowed to even exist. I’m scared to leave my house because I’m afraid the app sold my data to bad people and I’m being stalked. If I get kidnapped I’m blaming this app.","isEdited":false,"userName":"🤮😳😓","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:52:44Z","title":"LITERALLY WHY WASTE YOUR TIME"}},{"id":"6175600025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app but as soon as I opened it my phone exploded in my face and hands. Now I’m at the hospital writing this review from my sister’s phone. I’ve been here for 5 days and my skin is melting due to the explosion and the doctors cannot do anything about it!!! My hands are getting numb and my eyes are about to pop out. I haven’t slept for 5 nights straight because I see Trump’s ghost in my hospital room whispering: “vote for me 2020 so I can ruin America even more.” I’m so scared please don’t download this app!!! This is the worst app ever.","isEdited":false,"userName":"💥😢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T07:46:27Z","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6175433348","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Terrible app🧚🏻\u200D♂️😌❤️ I downloaded it and not even 10 mins later I fall asleep just to wake up in the shower🤦🏻\u200D♀️ and then I checked my phone for the time just to see that this app was open😱 and then after 5mins my sister fell off the stairs from our one story house😭 and then worst of all I see that our pet dog was walking on two legs😌 over all I wouldn’t get this app unless you wanna look like an animal🧚🏻\u200D♂️ sorry not sorry🥰🧚🏻\u200D♂️🙃 president trump don’t forget to leave and stay away🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰🤚🏻 thank you...😌","isEdited":false,"userName":"Esmeralda😌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:42:27Z","title":"🧚🏻\u200D♂️🥰☺️"}},{"id":"6175376032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was really slow. I was trying to figure how much of a clown Trump was to really see the true nature o golden stupidity. I could not load any of the images and it kept kicking me out of the app. Along with this, it was taking too much storage in my phone and it was getting quite annoying. I think it was kind of stupid of how it kept sending me notifications that I could NOT open. I was really banking on this app to educate me on Trumps lack of awareness, but I guess I’ll just use google.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Carla.salas37","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:20:14Z","title":"This app is slow"}},{"id":"6175239962","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"From the very start this app has glitched. I get multiples of the same notification every thirty minutes. VERY ANNOYING. Every time I open it my phone screen flashes on and off. Completely pitch black then back to the app. ALSO VERY ANNOYING. Ever since downloading this app I’ve gotten “virus” messages on my phone. I haven’t downloaded any new apps besides this one, visited any new websites, or anything out of the ordinary. Poorly constructed. Something seriously wrong with the app. Needs to be removed immediately!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"misstambam","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:27:44Z","title":"CUASES VIRUSES AND BUGS ON YOUR PHONE"}},{"id":"6175167585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"when i down⬇️loaded this app, i thought💭 that’s it was completely🤧 normal, until.... i was sleeping😴 and suddenly🤯 i started dreaming💭 about peaches🍑. scary👻 right✅ yeah it was but it gets worse😖 I WOKE UP AND PEACHES🍑 WAS THERE WATCHING ME SLEEP🛌 i rubbed my eyes👀 then she was gone! the day just kept getting weirder🔱 my brother woke up with a buzz cut and my father was gone! don’t worry he left a note saying he was getting milk🥛 lol weird right😂 for some reason all my food🍩 was gone too! so yeah i wouldn’t recommend getting this app it’s lowkey a bit haunted👻 so yeah bye!","isEdited":false,"userName":"VaehBea","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T05:01:45Z","title":"CURSED👻🙀"}},{"id":"6175145076","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i got the app wondering what all the fuss was about and the first thing I see when I open the app, a cheeto man staring me down as i sat there in my oompa loompa onsie, i got scared 😱 and immediately closed my phone and threw it onto my bed. a few minutes later I take a peek 👀 at my phone just to find that a nake picture of the big orange 🍊 cheeto man has now become my lock screen 👿 i was horrified💀💩🤡i immediately deleted the app in disgust🤮 but the nake cheeto man wallpaper wouldn’t go away 0/10 for this app would not recommend","isEdited":false,"userName":"avagraygubler","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:54:03Z","title":"lol no❤️"}},{"id":"6175128440","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I... I am at a lost for words. First off, it took 8 years for this app to download. It was so bad that my lizard turned into a coffee mug and asked if I wanted tea, TEA! Of course I said yes. Once I drank the tea, my toaster jumped up and slapped me in the face, now I have a bread sized burn and can no longer see through my left eye. I tried to give the app another go and all of a sudden it started raining so hard my roof sunk in. I am now in the sunken place. If no one here’s from me soon and comes looking from me, GET OUT! The app will get you!","isEdited":false,"userName":"The Couch loser😔","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:48:29Z","title":"Worst app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6175017723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is nasty and i cannot believe people made him president❤️ my shark even flushed the toilet and from there a bear ate my big mac! i cannot believe the audacity and boldness of that horse! i de acuerdo con el informe del ministerio del exterior y en el consejo nacional del mercado el presidente.
