I downloaded this because I wanted to see what was up with the app, and now a squeaky voice keeps yelling trump 2020 and I can’t get it to stop. Everywhere I go it shouts and everyone stares at me. I tried to fix it but nothing worked. I have no idea what to do now cause the voice keeps me awake and is super annoying. I do not recommend this app, for it hacks your phone and starts playing a really annoying voice. I will now maybe have to get a NEW phone all because of this. I’m very un happy and now trump photos keep appearing on my phone camera.","date":"2020-07-09T17:02:31Z","title":"HORRIBLE APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"yueyshjsjsbs"}},{"id":"6177455671","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to support Donald Trump but as soon as I went on the app my house started blowing up like crazy I ran out of my house buying a maga hat but my house is now destroyed I called the police immediately but now I have to buy a new house 😡 Now even worse I went to the bank to get some of my money but none of my money was there when I downloaded the app it took my money and then I fell and broke my neck 😭 The Trump app was blowing up my house and stealing all my money and made me fall and break my neck I hate this app remove it from the App Store now","date":"2020-07-09T16:54:02Z","title":"My house blew up 😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"137473872"}},{"id":"6177434736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"first of all this app took 6 hours to download then it gave my phone a virus!!! considering this is the presidents app it should be better, and easier for the people to work and understand.

The app then started trying to convince me on why it’s okay to support someone who is a racist and rapist with a pea sized brain and I am definitely not about that life. False advertisement bc it says he is keeping america great but I think America is at its worst. When I left the app, everything on my phone was orange & now I have to get a new phone.","date":"2020-07-09T16:26:55Z","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"Someone in here"}},{"id":"6177240129","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"If you are seeing this, Donald trump is the worst president because he’s racist , rapist, and did not do anything about coronavirus, he only said that people should INJECT BLEACH into themselves!🤢. Not only that but the whole reason I said this was because if this app becomes a 1 star then trump might not ban tik tok( for those who don’t know, tik tok has rumors saying that it might get banned from the U.S , I believe because it has negative videos about Donald trump even tho he is the worst president, so that makes sense) Make sure you rate this review helpful so that more people can see this","date":"2020-07-09T15:51:27Z","title":"Worst President ever","isEdited":false,"userName":"trash trump president 🤢"}},{"id":"6176993216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to appease my favorite candidate Donald Trump when out of no where I see that I was mistaken. I was greeted with pictures of an obese orange man and was very confused until I discovered that Donald Trump and Donald DUCK are indeed different people, despite the similar stature. So like anyway I called up Kanye to see what was going on and he told me to click on the information button so I did that and the whole app crashed? I click on the app to open it again and when I did it stole all of my data and Called me a tig biddie immigrant 😔 do not download Kanye manipulated me into this slander","date":"2020-07-09T14:42:52Z","title":"Kayne lies","isEdited":false,"userName":"Tig Biddie immigrant"}},{"id":"6176982217","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app for 1 reason. i was promised a life sized adam driver cutout within 2-3 weeks of downloading this app. So of course being a sane human with a love for the wonderful man that is adam I downloaded. Gave this app all my information and sat in suspense as 4 WEEKS!!! passed by. I am now writing this from the safety of my room in the psych ward.

I am delusional, I keep seeing orange everywhere and it is starting to get scary. Then the worst thing happened I kept hearing sexist and racist things in my head and I began to cry 😢. All I wanted to do is to see the lovely 🍊 in action and get educated on the world. I am truly hurt for what this app has done to my life. Some nights I sit on my bed trying to think about life and then a orange will roll in my room or I try and color but then the nasty face of 🍊will be sitting there with me. I had so many high hopes for this app but now those have all fallen.","date":"2020-07-09T14:38:25Z","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE 🤢🤮🤢🤮","isEdited":false,"userName":"gen_z-lover"}}]}
