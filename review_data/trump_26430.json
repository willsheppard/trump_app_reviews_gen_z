I do NOT approve of this app. It keeps taking my money! After I downloaded this app I got an eviction notice! Like I said before, it keeps taking my money and should I mention that it leaked my nudes! It‚Äôs filled with viruses that keep messing up MY phone, that I worked very hard to pay for. No more Trump for me!"}},{"id":"6175118713","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Lilykingston10","date":"2020-07-09T04:45:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrified","review":"Everything is horrible. Everything about this man is horrible. Specifically his vomit inducing citric acid joke of a spray tan. He‚Äôs ugly. He‚Äôs stupid. He‚Äôs everything those hillbillies want in a leader. Dear America, How stupid are you? How can you elect THIS man. How did this sick monster even get on the ballot?? This app is extremely laggy and offensive."}},{"id":"6175102207","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kenzieadams","date":"2020-07-09T04:39:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do better :-(","review":"This app is incredibly awful!! The app has WAY too many bugs. It released ROACHES out of my camera hole and started eating my hair!!! Then my little yorkie started freaking out and daddie trump started manically laughing as he watched my bedroom fill with insects. This needs to be fixed. Very uncomfortable."}},{"id":"6175093724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vermuchbadnotgoodatall","date":"2020-07-09T04:37:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"so awful!!!","review":"I got this app to see a Cheeto man sweating and yelling. Not only am I offended due to the content but a man with a red hat burst threw the screen and proceeded to drag around my green pet grandma!!!! üò°on top of that he salted and mowed my roof which I exclusively save for November. I am very extremely hurt and unsatisfied with this app and I hope it gets deleted!!"}},{"id":"6175083133","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"@alliehill16","date":"2020-07-09T04:33:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Awful app","review":"Seems to make my phone really slow. I also get an unnecessary amount of notifications even though I swear I turned them off. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure he stole my cat when I was 6. My washing machine broke the day I downloaded it...

It is slow, glitchy, and supports a gross senile racist as president. YIKES. we, as Americans, deserve so much better. You'd think if he thinks he's the best candidate, they'd make a better app. Don't make the mistake I did by trying it out."}},{"id":"6175043867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"vanytocutw <--add me on sc ;)","date":"2020-07-09T04:21:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"What about a girl and she said you didn‚Äôt have any good morning you just don‚Äôt know how to make a decision to do the work you have done so much for you you can not do anything you know I do you have to pay me to do the job I‚Äôm just saying you have a friend that‚Äôs not a good idea."}}]}
