Apple needs to remove this application immediately in order to save the American people their money and time!! Make America great again by DELETING THIS APP!!"}},{"id":"6178529046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:55:46Z","title":"absolutely terrible. DO NOT BUY!!!","userName":"1-2-15","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Considering how powerful this app could be, I was immensely disappointed when I had come to realize that it is absolute trash. This app is in no way beneficial to any trump supporter or otherwise. It has countless glitches, ads, and it was simply very difficult to do anything that it was made for. Would not recommend."}},{"id":"6178497481","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:43:06Z","title":"BLM","userName":"_.kiki__janee._","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Wow this app really should be taken DOWN!!!
