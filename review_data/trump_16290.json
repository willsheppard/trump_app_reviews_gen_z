After I downloaded this app my information was sold to the Chinese government for facial recognition.  The app emitted a high frequency noise that made my dogs ear bleed and cost me a $500 vet bill. My dog got mad at the phone for the noise and ate my phone. So it also cost me my brand new iPhone 11.

When I first opened it, a very graphic photo popped up of a orange with the tinniest hands ever, it couldn‚Äôt even pick up a glass of water!  After I manger to get past that photo, another one showed up of our beloved chief of police doing unspeakable things with the our amazing Vice President! It was unholy and very disrespectful.

Now he owns his own app. If you download it because you‚Äôre a supporter, i‚Äôd like you to know that the man you‚Äôre sticking up for is a orange fool who treats people different. This app is also annoying can someone shut it down?","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174056266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:09:30Z","rating":1,"title":"horrible app","userName":"karlmarxismydaddy","review":"literally the worst app ever made. as soon as i opened the app my phone glitches and a bear with chainsaws for arms walked down the street and waved at a car being driven by a great white shark going 110 mph because he was being chased by rabid vampire bunnies who wanted to eat seafood because all the carrots in the world were destroyed by the evil alien monkey battalion of the Borgon Galaxy who were on a Galactic conquest to destroy this app because it‚Äôs so horrible.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174046209","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:05:36Z","rating":1,"title":"wish i could give 0 stars","userName":"Dont care about nickname","review":"this app is so bad, when i first opened it i was redirected to a website advertising sex toys without any warning. i‚Äôm all for sexual freedom but my children were in the room. when i went back to the app it just kept redirecting me until i bought something from the site. they made sure to mention that 70% of the proceeds would be going to the campaign but so i really need to buy a dildo in order to donate??!!!!?!?! it‚Äôs been 4 weeks and not only have i not received my toy but once a week it will redirect me to that cite even when i‚Äôm not using the app. this is ridiculous!!!! fix it and then get back to me!!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174045320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:05:17Z","rating":1,"title":"1 star","userName":"anna ooooooooop","review":"Wonder Pets Wonder Pets, Wonder Pets Wonder Pets\nWe're on our way\nTo help a friend and save the day\nWe're not too big and we're not too tough\nBut when we work together we've got the right stuff\nGo wonder pets yay!\nThe phone\nThe phone is ringing\nThe phone\nWe'll be right there\nThe phone\nThe phone is ringing\nThere's an animal in trouble\nThere's an animal in trouble\nThere's an animal in trouble somewhere\nIt's a baby penguin\nHe's caught on an iceberg\nOoh\nA baby penguin\nCaught on an iceberg\nWhat's a penguin\nWhat's an iceberg\nLook!\nA baby penguin caught on an iceberg\nThis is serious\nWe have to help him\nLet's save the penguin\nLet's save the penguin\nLet's save the penguin\nWeeeee!\nWrong clothes\nLinny, Tuck\nAnd Ming Ming too\nWe're wonder pets and we'll help‚Ä¶","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174033786","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:00:56Z","rating":1,"title":"DON‚ÄôT DOWNLOAD","userName":"thebestbearüêª","review":"I open the app and when its loading instead of a cirlce its his cheeto face üëÅüëÑüëÅ it takes and hour and a half to load, finally it opens and theres a 30 MINUTE AD.
