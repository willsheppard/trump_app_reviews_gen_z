But right after i downloaded this app, things would pop up on my app unknowingly after i downloaded this app. I started getting linked to shady websites, that would have photos of disgusting, gross, images. I don’t want to go into detail. But.

I don’t know if it’s the new update but this update made the app just awful.

The seizure lasted more than 1 hour and we eventually had to smash the phone in order to get it to stop. I hope her medical bills will be paid for. Other than that, I definitely do not recommend to anyone.","userName":"thatgirlRum","date":"2020-07-08T19:00:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173363722","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","review":"this app has the worst glitching problem and is know for leaving a tracking device attached to you phone making it easy for the government to track you down and know your every move. it leaves viruses on your phone and it also makes your homescreen move on its own, it drains you battery power too!

Nothing apparently. But oh wait we already knew that. Anyways, the app drained my battery. Trumps nudes popped up with an orange covering his penis when I opened the app and **** the police by N.W.A. started playing. TERRIBLE APP. AWFUL! \n\nJust a reminder that black lives matter despite what President Dump says ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕✨","userName":"flaminhotkermit","date":"2020-07-08T18:55:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173337801","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Traumatized","review":"This app is HORRIBLE. As soon as i opened the app I saw this hideous orange creature fly out at me and it gave me nightmares. He said he was gonna ass@ult me and I was never able to sleep since. When I went further into the app it gave me the corona virus and my phone broke (I’m writing on my iPod touch. Now, I have no phone, no sleep, and ICE took my uncle away because I downloaded this app! DO ⚠️ NOT ☣️ DOWNLOAD 🤡","userName":"katiebatt6","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173330342","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"App about as complete as the border wall","review":"This app is in no way a representation of the presidents body of work. No mention at all of the new wall that’s been built. Or of his incredible cognitive ability. Not once did I see the phrase “stable Jenious” anywhere. Personally I believe this failure of an as app is a liberal attempt discredit our president. Look. He can do that all himself. Nice try Antifa.","userName":"callsigbchaos","date":"2020-07-08T18:47:19Z","isEdited":false}}]}
