And the very first thing I saw on the app was a CHEETO!!! Oh my goodness and do not get me started on the racist energy of this app. I just felt inferior looking at that picture of such a horrible man. I cannot believe APPLE allows such an app to even exist at a time such as this. So please do yourself a favor and do not download this piece of trash❤️ and if you really love yourself vote blue this November❤️❤️✨🧚🏾. And For Donald Trump, Your life is a gift from God🥺🌈💫 return it❤️🧚🏾💕💞.","rating":1,"userName":"blue lives dont matter hun","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:48:27Z"}},{"id":"6172021319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Literally felt sick when I was downloading it","review":"There are many ways to describe this app. But let me break it down for you. Donald Trump is horrible and should have never been president. He’s homophobic, transphobic, a bigot, a racist, a rapist, and so much more 🤩. Let’s also include the fact that I actually had a physical reaction because of this app. Like I literally feel sick that it’s on my phone right now. You can try to take gen z and millennials down by getting rid of our app but we’ll regroup on another app. So trump 2020 🧚\u200D♂️💖✨ but never again 🧚\u200D♂️💖✨","rating":1,"userName":"Jaliesa08","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:23:02Z"}},{"id":"6171908975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever🥺😔😢","review":"I cried twice while using this app because the quality was so bad.😭I thought it wouldn’t be glitchy but it was such low quality that it broke my phone.😔I tried calling the help service number but they were extremely rude and wouldn’t explain how to fix it.😢I was only able to get one ticket to his rally because of that.🥺 But then I remember that I had to bathe my cat that day!!!😤And after that I would have to go walk my fish!!!😞 Hope Mr. Cheeto Puff isn’t sad about it , anyways worst app ever. 😗 Gen Z do your thingz✨✨🥰🧚🏽\u200D♀️","rating":1,"userName":"Abbor Shawn","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:49:33Z"}},{"id":"6171829326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🍞🧑\u200D🦲🏃\u200D♀️✌️✨ GEN Z","review":"I read a lot of false thing and I just didn’t want to get more stupid so I deleted the app it was a waste of my time do not get unless you don’t want brain cells. ✨🧚\u200D♀️💖 He already made 2020 worse he hates people who are no his color 🟠🔶🟧🧡 which not ok cause  🇺🇸 does not like those vibes, and I mean it when I say you will lose you’re brain cells cause his supporters are not that smart and can’t spell or use proper grammar.

Trump, but 9 minutes after downloading trump had cops show up to my house in full riot gear. They beat my 12 year old brother with batons, Then they grabbed the vase my mothers ashes were in and smashed it over my head. They took the broken piece of the vase and stuck in into my throat. Then they went into my kitchen boiled water and poured it down the gaping hole in my neck. I can no longer walk and im paralyzed waste up so i cant move my arms to use a wheel chair so i have to stay in bed all day.

As SOON as I downloaded this app my phone shut down 👎🏻. THEN when I finally got it to turn back on Siri started spouting homophobic slurs at me🥺 I was very hurt. I tried to give the app a second chance but when I clicked on the icons my screen said “we don’t want you liberal snowflake” 😭. I started crying and I don’t think I’ll ever be okay again.

But here I am writing this review from my grave, and warning everyone that this app is in fact dangerous. As we all know, Mr. Trump is not the type of person to take...negative opinions about his “presidency”. He will send the ARMY TO KILL YOU!! YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR MORE VICTIMS THROUGH THIS APP!! The only way to protect more poor souls from passing away is to remove this app from the App Store! Please let everyone know that this app is not safe, and you will die from downloading it!","rating":1,"userName":"Generation Z💅🏼✨💋💕","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T20:50:18Z"}},{"id":"6141196808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I wish I could give this 0 stars","review":"As a respected pta mom of this community I find it DISGUSTING that my president has come out as a Cheeto. When we heard this at first I was like oh I thought it was just really bad from the obvious tanning beds he goes too. I find this Hyenas I only support gluten free diary free keto soy vegan foods and I was like omg I thought he was an orange,but overall I understand he is so flaky to the black community and he is so processed with racism it’s disgusting. He needs to pick a struggle either a bad marriage being morbidly obese ugly or the worst president we have ever had.","rating":1,"userName":"qqqqqqqq)38,$.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-30T19:37:02Z"}}]}
