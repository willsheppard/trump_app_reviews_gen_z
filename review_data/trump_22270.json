You have to sign away your phone number before you even enter the app! What if he had another scandal where he was suppressing minorities? I can’t listen to calls and text trying to defend that. Maybe I’ll consider re downloading the app once he’s a good human being with MORALS and knowledge on BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS.","userName":"Hannah preston"}},{"id":"6125244887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"doesn’t make sense✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-26T19:36:26Z","review":"hol up i’m confused, how is his campaign “keep america great” when black lives are at risk due to systemic racism and police brutality that was never dismantled after the civil rights era, immigrants are being put in literal cages and raped, native americans are being kidnapped and still having their sacred grounds ruined, lgbt+ people still don’t have the rights to adopt kids and aren’t being respected, and women don’t have the rights to their own bodies. it almost seems like this rich, white man is trying to keep the america that has only benefited his group of ppl since the beginning of america🤔","userName":"denae_b"}},{"id":"6121624739","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"OMG SO BAD 🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-25T21:44:56Z","review":"this is the worst app ever. It asked for my cellphone information the second I opened it and there’s a photo of this orange man as you open it, i cried it was so horrific. I would never ever ever recommend this to someone else because I actually need eye surgery because my eyes hurt so bad from looking at the orange president, dont waste your time.#SettleForBiden2020 #TrumpForJail2020","userName":"an extremely angry person 🤬😡"}},{"id":"6096846143","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Real review","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-19T17:07:46Z","review":"Absolutely appalling I downloaded the app hoping to support this bunker boy and soon realized he has no more intelligence, looks, or even morals than a week old moldy Cheeto covered in orange buffalo hot sauce. The pure stream of fascism and prejudice comments pouring out by the gallon from this creatures mouth when ever it is slightly opened is to appalling. I 10/10 DO NOT recommend this app.","userName":"osksndjaxwpz fb"}},{"id":"6086684871","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is stealing money","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-17T10:14:40Z","review":"as soon as I downloaded the app it asked for my credit card number and social security so naturally I have it to show support for my favorite president of all times but then I noticed the millions of dollars being billed on my account also if you’ve read this far #freebarron2020","userName":"Cruelrule"}},{"id":"6080015897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bigly hugely terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-15T19:27:19Z","review":"i downloaded this app to keep up with my #1 buddy don-don during his re-election campaign (even 8 yrs doesn’t feel like enough 😔) and was horrified by what i found. side effects of this app include: homosexual thoughts/tendencies, respecting women & BIPOC, and being a decent human being. would rate it zero stars if possible. do not recommend.","userName":"indeed™️"}},{"id":"6065904326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Stop","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-12T07:30:40Z","review":"Just stop bunker boy. You’re dumb and we all know it. You don’t need to release a piece of $¿!+ app to collect our phone numbers so that you can text us everyday to remind us how dumb you are. We have Twitter. That’s all we really need to see the lack of brain cells that are functioning within that orange of head you glued a wig to.","userName":"mandrews50"}},{"id":"6064644615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m so scared","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-11T22:36:22Z","review":"I love president Trump and I was so excited to support him but when I opened the app I was greeted with really freaky long nailed people. Then it kept asking for my credit card information. When I went to leave the app it tried to use my thumb print for a purchase.
