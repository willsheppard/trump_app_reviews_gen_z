I asked my husband to help me, but he couldn’t figure it out either. There’s no instructions on how to use the app, and it’s also very unorganized and ugly. I have no idea why they’re using blue in their designs when I’m a die hard red wearing conservative. I will be deleting this app and never coming back. The glitching and twitching app was lagging and my screen would often go black.","rating":1,"userName":"KonservativeKelseigh","title":"Outdated Graphics and Glitchy","date":"2020-07-09T06:32:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175195453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"mr cheeto i’m disappointed. u have done many awful things that i have let slide but taking away my only source of free entertainment and joy crosses the line. you do not mess with gen z’s happiness. many people have been saved and had some of the most memorable things happen on tiktok, you have been called racists, and rapist, abusive, and rude. i have let this slide but u underestimate our power, if you thing you can extinguish our flame you are wrong, by doing this you have only fueled the fire.\n\n-xoxo gen z","rating":1,"userName":"tifrubwnsfbyutmotmfsudwrabfb","title":"No❤️","date":"2020-07-09T05:11:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175085999","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrid I was riding my pet tiger and the app made my phone malfunction so I couldn’t use the gps to get to cains and I really wanted some chicken tenders. My phone kept on glitching so I had to call over my mutant hawk to give me a ride home but my phone was still glitching and the hawk didn’t know how to get home bc my gps didn’t work bc of this dumb app. And it’s saying if I don’t vote for him I’ll be deported back to Africa but the fact that I still didn’t get my cains bc of this thing 100% don’t recommend!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"willywop816","title":"Ewwwww","date":"2020-07-09T04:34:39Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175011741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i (I’m White btw) LOVED LOVED LOVED the idea of getting the BEST unbiased news, and upcoming events so one day I could achieve my dream of finally going to a rally!!!!!\nBut when I opened the app, it asks you to Literally use your phone number, and in that Moment I deleted the app!

Before we were so happy, me, my wife and our 9 cats lived out our days peacefully, but the constant notifications and time consuming informational texts became too much and I was made to choose between the love of my life and my great nation. I chose wrong.
