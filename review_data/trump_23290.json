I then had to put it in rice to dry it off. Another thing was as soon as I deleted the app it completely deleted all my other apps with it. Extremely disappointed.

MUST BE REMOVED","review":"I’m am so disgusted by this app. I downloaded it because my white republican father told be it would be useful but the second I opened the app a big fat Cheeto popped up and told me I had to vote for him or my phone would explode!
