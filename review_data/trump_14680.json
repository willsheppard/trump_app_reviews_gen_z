It just made my ears go deaf and now I have a bald spot. I would recommend this app to people who would like a bald spot, extreme headaches, explosive diarrhea, being deaf in the right ear, every animal to hate you, and seven extra chromosomes. Personally, the side effects aren’t my thing. I regret ever downloading this app.","date":"2020-07-08T18:25:31Z","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would","userName":"hajghsj","rating":1}},{"id":"6173232377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"when i downloaded the app, i thought i was going to be greeted by our beautiful😻 orange 🍊god but i was sadly mistaken😿. i was greeted by a man in a mask👺 saying if i didn’t give him my address, i would be deported👿. so i gave him my address and the next day, he was banging on my door🚪. i opened it and asked him what he wanted. he told me to let him in and held up a gun🔫🔪. i asked him to please spare me but he shot me🎯.i immediately ran to my phone 📱 and tried to delete the app, but there was a virus 🦠 and my phone exploded 💥. and then i laid there and imagined our orange 🍊 god👼🏻. then as i drew my last breath 💨, i saw him 👦🏻. donald j trump, holding a gun 🔫. and he said”i’m here to finish you” and he shot 🩸 me one ☝️ more time.","date":"2020-07-08T18:15:21Z","title":"i got mudered 😱 🦋👄🦋","userName":"ratpuss2000","rating":1}},{"id":"6173208670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Tiktok teaches me more about chemistry than all of my school lives combined. It keeps me informed and is helping me get through the pandemic. It is my number one source for entrainment. It teaches me how to function in the society. The number one thing is that it shows me many ppl have the same problems as I do, I don’t feel as different. I thought I was the only one to scared to ask for a ketchup packet.

You’ll never guess what I found.\n\nHe has multiple— yes MULTIPLE sexual assault cases against him; and he’s racist, homophobic, and transphobic. He’s taking away our FREEDOM OF SPEECH, which you Trump supporters care much about. On top of that, this app is sucky. 1/10. Would give 0 stars if I could. Do not recommend.","date":"2020-07-08T18:06:02Z","title":"Dang, really?","userName":"Unknown and Anonymus","rating":1}},{"id":"6173165811","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I’M HERE TO SAVE ALL PEOPLE.

And I noticed that our big amazing orange pig president just says “it’s a hoax” so this is why me and my pet shark don’t support our big fat orange 🍊 president.
