The only thing he has done right is lead us in the amazing race of Covid-19 deaths.💀 I’m so glad we surpassed the other countries 😍😍. But anyway as I opened this app i turned to the mirror on my left and noticed that I had turned into a giant cheeto.🍊 I was horrified 🙀 as I didn’t want to look like our disgusting excuse for a president. 👹👹 So I panicked and quickly deleted this app. As I did so, my bank account got drained suspiciously. 😧So I called the bank and asked them why my bank account got drained. 🥵🥵 (I’m not saying it was very full at the start because our president decides to tax the poor more than the privileged rich.) 😻😫 the bank told me the queen from Alice and wonderland had drained my account.💕 Honestly I was okay with that, because I would much rather live in her country than in this one. 😂😂 So I went on a trip to find a job to restore my bank account. Obviously I couldn’t find a job because I am a minority 😍🙈. So now I am homeless cheeto with a drained bank account. 😼❤️ I hope this influences your opinion on this app. Please do not download this app unless you would like to end up like me. 🤩 \nyeah ❤️","title":"I’m begging you pls read this.

I thought this app would help me understand where my racist, homophobic, and peodifillic family members were coming from, that is not the case. The app must be only catered to older people, because the print is large and you have to scroll to read. It is not particularly useful. The app also looks like a run-on-sentence. There are no boarders or breaks so it is really to accidentally click something other than the intended article. The app reads like stereo instructions and is more set on building “trumps army”?????? There is very little truth in the articles presented. More like fear mongering bigotry wrapped in an American flag. I honestly came into it trying to understand what makes his cult so appealing, but was left with frustration and uncertainty. The app also tries to force you to share it with contacts in your phone, going as far as bringing up my contact list, which was weird. If I had not known how to click out of it, I would have shared it, which seems predatory as the app is seeming designed for older people who probably don’t know how to do it. I had it on my phone for 2 weeks and still receive random texts and calls that come from constantly changing numbers trying to get me to donate it. Don’t waste your time. This app is misleading and malicious. They know what they are doing.","title":"Malicious use","userName":"Moveyourself","date":"2020-07-09T17:57:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177471729","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🧚\u200D♀️😗👄I was initially very excited to download this app because I had heard people raving about it on tiktok, but now after having it on my phone I wish I had never downloaded it. First off, this app took well over a day to install into my phone which I found odd because my phone had plenty of storage and apps never take that long to install. In addition to it taking long to install I could not use my phone during that time. It was extremely annoying because every time I tried to use my phone to send a text or answer a call the app would restart. Very aggravating! After this app finally installed I opened it to get started and my phone was working very slowly which happens in no other apps. I entered some personal information and then my phone started to glitch very badly. THIS APP PUT A VIRUS IN MY PHONE. I am beyond outraged at the Trump 2020 app. I immediately deleted the app but since I downloaded it I have been getting numerous calls a day from scam callers and hackers because I put my phone number into this app. I do not recommend this app to anyone; the information is bad and it is not secure. Such a waste of time and energy since I never even planned on voting for Trump in November, I just wanted to see what the hype about this app was. Let me tell you, there is not a single good thing about this app (or about Trump.) DO NOT GET THIS!!!! 💅✨🧚\u200D♀️","title":"This app ruined my phone.","userName":"jilllic","date":"2020-07-09T16:58:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177860922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was extremely exited to get the app to support our great and wonderful ✨orange✨but when it finished downloading after A WEEK of waiting I was just starting to get annoyed. After awhile of using the app I noticed something weird was happening in my room. Like stuff on the walls started to appear and EVERYTHING soon had something to do with trump 2020. I thought It was very weird so I kept scrolling in the app so I could get more 🍊Educated🍊and my vision started going blurry so I got up and took a sip of my water. But then out of nowhere weird voices started popping up in my head, almost like brainwashing yk yk 🥰and it kept telling me to do these racist and sexist things. So at first I was confused and my brain was just mush. So with the little bit of consciousness I had, I pulled myself to the phone and before I could do anything the screen was going orange and our ✨presidents✨nudes were displayed on the screen. I was appalled. I quickly deleted the app and things went back to normal but I think I’m going to need EXTENSIVE therapy, but it’s good I found a therapist that charges $100 a session and I expect that trump will  reimburse me for the pain I went threw to pay for my therapy and the renovation of my home that I just couldn’t focus anymore due to my traumatizing experience that almost made me blind ✨😖 don’t recommend this app unless you want similar experiences😭😖😌","title":"✨This is bad✨","userName":"mr.tortise man","date":"2020-07-09T18:58:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177459311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded the app just because I wanted to know what was going on and I wanted to see if any of these reviews were true and as I opened it up the first time ever it just stemmed normal and I went to sleep that night to find it out I was having nightmares and nightmares on end they were all about him raping all the accusers who had said he raped them so must have been true I was terrified I was next and he was being so selfish. But I feel like those weren’t that weird so the next morning someone was telling me in my head to do all these trump 2020 related things like deleted this person because they hate trump blah blah blah and I couldn’t have any more of it and I took the courage just to deleted the app. I took a nap about 3 p.m. and I woke up around 4:30 and the app had appeared back on my phone by now I just wanted to get a new phone with how much that scared me I had told my sister and she said you probably dreamed that you deleted it but Ik for sure that I deleted off my phone and the next day after the dreams and the person taking to me in my head my sister had came to my room to complain the weird stuff had been getting written on the walls like vote trump women are trash and that clearly made me very upset and I couldn't handle it anymore I had restarted my phone completely and it finely went away I really hope it never comes back","title":"This is app is controlling","userName":"max-butler99","date":"2020-07-09T16:55:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176597733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app literally spit on me upon opening 😩✨. After I waited 3 full days for it to begin downloading and eventually finish downloading (on the 6th day) this app showed such a racial prejudice towards me that I actually began to fear for my life🧍🏾\u200D♀️. Every update posted was a threat to my life, as a poc I’d say the only benefit this app offered me was getting a heads up about the plots made against my life and my fellow brothers and sisters by people like Don Trumpet and his white supremacist followers 🙉. As I’m typing this I’m hiding under my bed in fear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! 🐻🌹. This app is despicable and it threatened to shoot me 🤬. The only reason I am alive right now and safe in hiding is because I pretend 🧚🏾\u200D♀️ I do not ✨ see 👩🏾\u200D🦯 them outside my house 😎. \n\nI genuinely thought this would be a positive app that would give me updates on my fellow Americans, queer and all, yet it was only slander and racism. I cannot even tell you how disappointed and afraid I am to still life in this type of society. I give the app 0/10, a 0 being generous, because I believe it was developed in the pits of hell. I know Jesus did not intend for a strong black, melaninated Queen like myself to follow in the footsteps of an orange, overbaked and stale potato chip so I am writing this to warn you guys as well. Please do not fall victim to this app 😩😩. I beg of you. SEE WITHOUT YOUR EYES ✨✨💖😩🤚🏾😔.

And that’s saying something considering my brother just died and my house just burned down. I actually downloaded this app and the logo is actually so gross to look at. You have the audacity to T pose at me and intimidate me as soon as I open the app I downloaded as a FREE AMERICAN???? Disgusting. But then I let it slide and opened the app anyway. Then I saw the ugliest creature in the whole world that I actually had to get up and run to the nearest toilet to vomit my intestines out. I can’t even describe how this creature made me feel, it had orange decaying skin and it’s head was a yellow birds nest. It was pretending to be a human with an oversized suit but we all know that it is nothing of the sort. At this point I was terrified by this app and then it proceeded to ask me for MY PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING MY MOTHERS MAIDEN NAME. What??? So I went to delete the app after hyperventilating for a few minutes and it actually wouldn’t let me delete the app! So I’m writing this from a new phone I had to order online because I am NOT ABOUT TO EXPOSE MYSELF AND MY LOVED ONES TO CORONAVIRUS but I still get texts asking me if I will sign over my rights to join whatever cult that creatures a part of. I see it in my nightmares.

How could have this happened was my question. What is going on. Now of course i was young back than, which led me to not understand what was going on until i realized. Taco bell had gotten rid of my favorite item, What was I going to do? Imagine how you would feel if your FAVORITE fast food place got RID of your top no-brainer choice when driving through the delicious, immaculate, show-stopping, impeccable drive-thru. WELL THATS EXACTLY WHAT THIS MENACE WANTS TO DO TO THE APP TIK TOK. If some of you are not familiar with this wonderful app then let me tell you. This is one of the most powerful apps to basically exist, Why? you may ask, well this is because Generation Z is THE generation that will overthrow social standards and old bats who believe that women, people of color, different races, different cultures and so many more things that justify who we are as people think that they are on a higher social/economic stance than the rest of us. Donald Trump know that Generation Z will be the most powerful nation to EVER exist in all of humanity. I don’t know who you stand with but if you are part of Generation Z or any other generation that wants to make a difference we HAVE to make a change   now. ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿.  🧚✨🧚\u200D♀️✨🧚\u200D♂️✨🧚\u200D♀️","title":"I had a normal life until this man showed up","userName":"Mathlete12","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6176845990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It was an unsuspecting Thursday when I decided to download this app. I was having a breakfast of banana bread and saw on my favourite social media app that President Trump had an app, so I knew I had to download it to see how I could support the amazing, strong, and brave wet cat we call our president. Big MISTAKE! I opened the app to immediately begin hearing a strange noise: raspy voices hissing. Then I got a notification (even though I had NOT given the app notification privileges to my phone) saying that I had been hexed and the only way to break it was to vote for Trump in the upcoming election. I turned off my phone to get away from what was going on in the app when all of the windows in my house SHATTERED. Obviously, I screamed. I left the house to see what was going on when ALL OF THE BIRDS IN MY YARD ATTACKED ME(Or should I say spies)!! I went to the hospital to get help, but on the way, I got into a car crash. I did in fact get the necessary treatment, but unfortunately, my insurance will not be covering my medical bills. Every day is agony. I continued to get push notifications of various insults multiple times an hour every day. This morning, I opened the app for the second time to see if there was any way to break the hex, only to find a video of President Trump laughing maniacally. 0/10: medical bills, bourgeois birds, broken windows, excessive push notifications","title":"please, please, please DO NOT download!","userName":"Renie H","date":"2020-07-09T14:03:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
