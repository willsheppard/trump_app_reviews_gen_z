But when I opened the app, all I saw was hate speech and a racist pig with a spray tan trying to convince the far-wrong that their preschool school level of thinking was correct, which is a lie and a joke, just like this entire app. Please remove it from the app store, it has keyed my car, stolen my dog and had “intimate intercourse” with my wife.","title":"Absolutely APPALLING 🤢🤢🤢","userName":"mike awksmaul","date":"2020-07-09T08:39:44Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175750613","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The poop song\nI feel it...

First, this took up SO MUCH space on my phone! Once I downloaded this, even though my phone is brand new, my phone starting turning off prematurely and whenever I open the app my phone crashes and I have to reset it. It’s happened 17 times!!! Not to mention when I can finally get the app to work, its extremely difficult to navigate. They’ve made it very difficult to understand how I am supposed to reserve tickets for me and my family at Mr. Trumps events and for his live appearances. Who ever made this app is doing President Trump an injustice. We should not stand for this quality of craftsmanship. Take this app off the app store immediately!!! Trump should have the best quality app on any apple device EVER. -1000/10.","title":"Wish I could put 0","userName":"MonicaAndFriends","date":"2020-07-09T08:38:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175747061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have $91378 saved for my college application and then all of it got wiped away by this app all of my money gone 😪😪😪😪😪 it also sold my house and I’m living in the street using my neighbors WiFi.

The features are full of bugs and links are broken. I don’t know what fiverr contractor they paid to code this, but it’s awful. Some of the info even seems to be wrong. Plus, it asks for an awfull lot of private information. Something about it seems suspicious. I hope it’s not some sort of trick by the other side to get information on us, but I don’t trust it. I’m deleting it.","title":"Absolutely horrible.","userName":"eye flying","date":"2020-07-09T08:36:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175744410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"🧝\u200D♂️🧝\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♂️🧜🏾\u200D♂️🧟\u200D♀️🧝\u200D♂️💁🏿\u200D♀️🧝\u200D♂️🧝\u200D♂️🧟\u200D♀️🧞\u200D♀️👩🏼\u200D🔬💂🏾\u200D♀️👨🏽\u200D🔬👨🏽\u200D🔬💂🏿\u200D♂️👨🏽\u200D🔬💂🏾\u200D♀️💂🏾\u200D♀️👨🏽\u200D🔬💂🏿\u200D♂️🤙🏻🤙🏻👣🤙🏻👄🤙🏻🤚🏼👋🙏👈🏻👄✌🏿✌🏿👋✊👋🙏✊🙏🤞🏿👋👈🏻✌🏿🙏🙏✌🏿✌🏿🤙🏻👉🏿🙏✋🏼✍️👈🏻✍️🤞🏿💋👋👌✌🏿💋👌🙌🏻✊","title":"For you, Trumpkin.","userName":"Aidan Tobeck","date":"2020-07-09T08:36:55Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175743379","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is not worth downloading because it has fake news and it is just taking storage DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!
