All the showed me was a weird orange guy in a suit. Who cares about him? Who even is he??? Why he gotta look like that? He smells racist. This app offended me, my family, my friends, and my very being. I wish I could rate it in negative numbers. This app’s favorite beverage is probably room temperature milk. This app’s favorite book is animal farm. This app’s favorite movie is inception. This app’s favorite food is warm celery. This app probably thinks jake Paul is funny. This app sickens me to my core. Very bad. No good. Awful.","userName":"downwiththeorangeman"}},{"id":"6173256240","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Super mad about this! 😾😾","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:17Z","review":"I just wanted this app to support our GREAT not racist, not sexist, not homophobic, not transphobic, and most definitely NOT a child rapist 🙄 and I can’t do that because this app won’t even open! And im so upset about that, fix your app, you walking tan spray. I was going to go rally but my sister kept telling me I had to wear a mask! A mask! Right? Unbelievable. So i said to her that god would protect me 😼❤️ anyways aside from that, this app is crap. It glitches a picture of Donald when he’s nude and I keep seeing his tiny croissant 🥐😫😫FIX THIS APP","userName":"biggestrrump"}},{"id":"6173253731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app gave me PTSD (serious)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:22:26Z","review":"I was so excited to get this app so I could support our carrot faced president. But after downloading the app my phone was hacked. My phone started to show me pictures of this scary orange monster. Everywhere I went I saw that fat orange monster. After many nightmares and sleepless nights, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for intense PTSD and depression. It’s hard to share my story but I wanted to help others. Hopefully one day I’ll get better and can go out in public again. Don’t make the same mistake I did.","userName":"North40"}},{"id":"6173178423","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible app and president","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:57:40Z","review":"So in 2016 I voted for trump. Worst mistake of my life. He has not done anything to benefit this country. And did not do what he promised. And this app is so hard to navigate. This app does nothing it is useless. And also my friend killed him self because of the president. He was not happy with how things turned out in the election. All Trump has done is cause racism and problems for this country. That’s why my friend killed himself. He was sos sick and tired of being racially profiled by cops and afraid of cops because he was black.","userName":"id103"}},{"id":"6173159805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Death of sharks and family","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:51:42Z","review":"This app was TERRIBLE!!!!! This app took months to download and as it downloaded I wondered what the purpose the app had. Later that day it downloaded so I proceeded to open the app, but as I did I mediately regretted it. This app spond sharks in the middle of my living-room (there must have been 40 great whites). When this occurred I said out loud that I was very scared, but as I did my phone started to poor water out of it to save the sharks but instead of saving them the water killed them immediately and flooded my house","userName":"ava-me"}},{"id":"6173116005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Sold my personal information and ruined my battery!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:37:54Z","review":"This app asked for my phone number when I originally downloaded it, which was fine, but then I kept getting calls and texts from all sorts of Trump solicitors who wanted me to donate to their campaign! It won’t stop! Also, the app always stays running in the background, even if you close it! It has ruined my iPhone XR battery life. Do not install this app!!! Instead use the website, much faster and does not ruin battery life!!!!","userName":"Pajamida"}},{"id":"6173055267","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I can’t believe this!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:18:20Z","review":"I can’t believe people are supporting trump in this 2020 election and actually think it’s a good idea. He has done absolutely nothing of what he’s promised as president, shows disrespect to not only the veterans he said he would support but to the American people as well. Not only is he an awful president but his app is awful as well! I downloaded this to see if he would take any actions as president and to be informed, but I can’t even open the app without it crashing my whole phone! Waste of time.","userName":"nsndbdjsiaiw"}},{"id":"6173042833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:14:26Z","review":"I gave this app a one star review. It is awful the fact that he’s taking down tik tok my only source of entertainment and fame. So I come here to take down his app “Trump 2020” yeah we will see about that mister. Besides him taking down tik tok this app gave me so many nightmares at night to the point where I just deleted it. and when I woke up my dog became and ORANGE when I saw my dog it scared me so I threw it into a cage with the rest of its family suffering because that’s all your president knows what to do to our Hispanics 🇲🇽BLACK LIVES MATTER/HISPANIC LIVES MATTER!!","userName":"w.jennyy"}},{"id":"6172925028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":":)","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:38:04Z","review":"Honestly with this app i wasn’t able to do anything at all. It always froze up and I had to uninstall and reinstall over and over and over again. It makes your phone slow and it doesn’t help with anything. Most of what I see when using the app when it does work is fake news, no facts and only opinions. There isn’t any hard evidence when trying to prove a point. Just like his tweets on twitter it’s just an app for a baby to throw a tantrum when things don’t go his way.","userName":"D O N T C A R E"}}]}
