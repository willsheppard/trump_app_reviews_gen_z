As soon as I opened the app my phone started to glitch and my cat floated...FLOATED up to my ceiling. She then proceeded to meow in a way I could tell was demonic😔. I closed the app and deleted it as soon as possible. But, little did I know that when deleting it, it would kill my cat. She dropped to her death, and what was on her eyes was even scarier. “Vote for trump or you’re next” was written on her eyes.
