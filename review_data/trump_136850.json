Awful. Terrible. Disappointing. Disgusting. Irresponsible. Disrespectful. Pointless. Offensive. Misleading. \nThose are a few words I would use to summarize this app. A bad, awful, terrible, disappointing, disgusting, irresponsible, disrespectful, pointless, offensive, and misleading app. \nThis app is also slow. It’s full of spam and fake news. I came here for a president and walked away with a headache. \nDelete this app for the love of all other apps that came before it. Sacrifice this app to the gods and bring back flappy bird. It’s a far better upgrade.","userName":"Fran Howard","title":"I Hate This App."}},{"id":"6180081963","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T08:22:48Z","review":"As a political enthusiast myself, I had to see what the rave was about for trump’s app. In my political beliefs, the president represents America (periodt💅🏼) and I wanted to see what trump’s personal philosophy was.
