I downloaded to see how it would operate and what it offered, and all I can say is that it offered was the promotion of a man who is a racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, sexist bigot. Deleted! Wiped from my home feed forever!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6175689924","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T08:18:24Z","userName":"AbbigailAngel5272","title":"Worst App Ever","review":"This shouldnâ€™t be on the app store at all.

What do they need my number for?

I was hesitant given the facts but caved in due to peer pressure. \n\nWish I would have known what it was and what it would do because as soon as I downloaded it, I grew a beard, a mullet, and a confederate flag appeared in my right hand that I now canâ€™t get rid of. I quit my job and spend my free time looking for people to get arrested or deport. I also somehow hate wearing masks. The sheer thought makes my blood boil. \n\nI was born a girl. \n\nMinus four stars because my breasts were really nice. \n\n#MÃ¢gÃ¤2020 #Murica","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
