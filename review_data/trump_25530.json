Unbelievable. Then it said that I was going to have to be one of those Karen’s and not wear a mask because it’s unbearable. Unbelievable.

If I could give it zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed in this app and it is “a danger to our democracy”. Apps like this one should not exist- Ithe design is trash, it’s is bug-infested, and caused my phone to crash and fall into anaphylactic shock. This app should be taken off the App Store!!!","userName":"Caraign","date":"2020-07-09T01:44:26Z","title":"WORST APP EVER!!!"}},{"id":"6174497401","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"What the hell🤮 I opened the app to see trump naked smelling his dirty armpits I’m scarred, but next I saw him twerking \nand I nearly passed out, I showed my dad and he’s been in a coma for over a month.

Donald Trump is a vile human being who has repetitively shown incredibly disgusting behavior towards women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community to name a few.
