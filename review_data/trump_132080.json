I cried for days and now I am having to go to therapy.As if I hadn’t been tormented enough my dogs are now orange.and their diet which had consisted of kibble they no longer have a taste for and will only eat Cheetos I have reason to believe that this is a form of cannibalism.now this brings me to my point of this review;If this review were to even save one person from such a terrible fate as I have endured then my mission will have succeeded.My advice:is to delete this app immediately as I have done as long as you wish to live a long happy life and to have a perfectly normal pet.In case you are wondering after I deleted this app my phone when back to Normal and my dogs are fine.However I can never get back those sleepless nights.The smell of Cheetos still lingers in the air."}},{"id":"6174064678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:12:32Z","title":"Horrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"PLZ KANYE 2020🇺🇸","review":"I 💆🏻\u200D♀️hated 👛this👓 app🌓 i opened it glitched so much.I also thing I saw some leaked info🤿 but I wont say what.so many very🌉 odd things popped up.and honestly⛸ if i were 🤾🏽\u200D♀️you would❎ not get 🍃this app.It was the worst app ive ever gotten.I also saw📈 a lot of cheetos"}},{"id":"6174063210","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:12:01Z","title":"this app SUCKS😖💸‼️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":".Redhead.","review":"as SOON as i downloaded the app i got a flood of notifications from the stinky yee-yee boys👉🧅 in my town🤢🤢 they were all welcoming me to their cult and said they were glad i joined🤥 then i got a call from ✨barron✨telling me to turn around before it’s too late😳 he told me that donald trump was holding him hostage and that he needs help😓😓 trust me, the LAST thing you wanna do is download this app😷 the racist, homophobic, trump-supporter, yee yee boys will stalk you😳👀 plus the cult leader (donald trump🤮) will feel supported. we don’t want that!!👺 for the sake of your well being, do NOT download this app!! it needs to be REMOVED!!😣😣#FreeBarron2020"}},{"id":"6174062678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:49Z","title":"SHUT UP","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"imdiying","review":"FIRST OF ALL, I HAD TO GET THE APP IN ORDER TO RATE IT SO ITS A BIG OOF AND SECOND OF ALL WHY TF DOES TRUMP WHAT AN APP WHEN OBAMA DIDNT?

I do not need to share my personal information with a 70+ year old with dementia and his pedophilia buddies! This app has done nothing but spread false information all across our country for the purpose of a fake political agenda. I’ve never seen a more clear form of fascism than this app right here, I will not allow a obese brain damaged man to falsely spread misinformation!"}},{"id":"6174061933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:34Z","title":"absolutely not❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🤡👾👅","review":"this app is horrible, if you wanna watch an orange blab about nonsense open youtube and search “annoying orange”. could never, i feel bad for his wife, with his miniature size..well yk what, anyways thats why she’s always depressed. anyways im watching the minion movie while writing this.
