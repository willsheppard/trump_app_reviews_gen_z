The app constantly glitches, the layout is confusing and laggy. I wouldn’t recommend this app to anyone. The point or “rewards” part of this app also seems like a huge scam and making it incentive to get a overload of texts just to earn points. Worst experience! 0/10 would recommend this garbage app!"}},{"id":"6157037300","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely absurd","userName":"dumptrucksucks","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-04T15:58:15Z","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to see how America would be making changes to be “great again” and honestly it was awful there was nothing of the sort just a bunch of nonsense from an orange (which I didn’t know oranges could do these things, apparently vitamin c is bad for you) and a loading screen that literally took a hr to get past. So disappointed in this app waste of a download"}},{"id":"6148001286","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible 🤬","userName":"Trumpie Sheep Stan","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-02T11:30:25Z","rating":1,"review":"I thought this app would bring me closer to my lord and savior, President Cheeto Trump, but instead it has given my phone a virus and is now full of bugs. Every time I use my phone, bugs come out of it! 😿😿😿 but I will always love trump, NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS, because I am a sheep 🐑🐑🐑I would now like a small line of 1 million dollars, since I have dedicated my life to worshipping President Trump, and I have now gone bankrupt.

I was instead met with very rude, aggressive emails begging for donations for the Trump campaign. Also, I was very reluctant to use the app in the first place for fear of tracking and information selling. I read other complaints about this on many other reviews. Be careful when using !                           ✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿❤️🤍💙🇺🇸"}},{"id":"6144377813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app will ruin your life!!","userName":"Trump Reeks","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-01T14:08:22Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is literally the worst app to ever exist!! As soon as I opened it a bird flew through my window! I thought it was weird but throughout the day every time I opened the app, something bad happened! The next time I opened it, my closet door fell off and almost crushed me! The time I opened it after that my roof gutter nearly fell on me as I left my house! This is going to cost me so much in repairs! This app is cursed!

This app made me physically sick. If anything, this app should be banned from the app store. \nThey should put this in school textbooks so our future children know not to create or support such a horrid app. I would not recommend at all!! If I could, I would create a time machine and go back in time and tell the creators for this app to not create such an idiotic app."}},{"id":"6133995468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app does not function properly! I am very disappointed.","userName":"f*ck trump and pence","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T01:34:09Z","rating":1,"review":"You would expect that since he’s the president of our country, the app would be somewhat decent, but this is a very wrong prejudice that you may hold. I’ve deleted and re-downloaded it multiple times, but to no avail. It has made me extremely frustrated and I will not be downloading, or even looking at this app again."}}]}
