It took HOURS just to get it to download, and I mean HOURS. Once I finally did get it to open, it crashed immediately, and keep in mind, I have lots of storage on this phone, and yet this app is slower than trumps ability to process information. Please Apple, this app is a waste of time, terrible, slows down my phone, and is overall a disgrace to the App Store. I genuinely don’t think this is a good app for anybody to try and use. Once I even got to the section to log in, it denied any entry I made into making a username, and then told me that I am a snowflake??? I am horribly offended. It’s like the team that constructed the app did such a bad job that the glitches are unmanageable. -726262882/10 do NOT recommend","date":"2020-07-09T12:57:52Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I HATE THIS APP!!!
