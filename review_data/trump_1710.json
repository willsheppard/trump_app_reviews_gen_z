I threw my phone across the room out of complete fear, where then I realized this screeching noise was the sound of children screaming. I picked up my phone to try and see why that was, but I was then met with a knock at my door. As I rushed to see who it was all I saw was a big black van drive away from my house, however they left me a package. I was hesitant to open it but I needed to know what it was! Inside the box was a letter that stated- “vote for me or else.” And underneath the note crawled out hundreds of salamanders. Because of this app, my phone is now cracked, I fear there might be children held captive inside the app, and now I have a city of salamanders in my home.","date":"2020-07-08T20:19:38Z"}},{"id":"6173485773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"very disappointed","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Kelli122120051974123:(;);(:)","review":"stupid communist libs probably hacked or created this app.  \nim a huge trump supporter. i have all his merchandise and have been trying to convince everyone i know to join me because he’s the only good president we’ve ever had. however, this app doesn’t do him justice. if i could vote with 0 stars, i would. i became suspicious when it began asking for my address. phone number is okay, i’d be happy to get texts often about my favorite man, but address was a little creepy. then it started asking about my family members. slowly, i noticed the people around me begin to disappear. as someone who believes All Lives Matter i was shocked to see the lives around me be taken away. \ni didn’t connect their disappearances to this app until it asked me about them through text and email. \nyesterday, i read two notes from friends who have gone missing. \n“it’s trump’s app,” they had written. “it was so bad we couldn’t handle it.”\nanyways, don’t get this app. in fact, it should be completely deleted so that more people aren’t killed or missing. \ni’m scared. please, please fix your app or delete it completely. \nthank you. \nanyways, TRUMP2020🇱🇷🇱🇷 all lives matter stupid communist libs probably hacked or created this app.","date":"2020-07-08T19:41:09Z"}},{"id":"6173120170","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁 made me have diarrhea 🤢🤮🤯🤬","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ayo luvs ✨✨","review":"So I got up from my bed to get a snack then I saw that this HORRID app was on the App Store.

However I can’t stand by those words anymore. Not only did it take 3 days to download it took up ALL of my storage. I mean ALL. After that experience I got over it, only to find out I started getting letters sent to me from this “app” that wanted me to join a cult with the founders...Now after all of that I STILL decided to keep this app, until, a guy with a purge mask came to my home and played “I am the tiger” on full blast at 1 a.m. I immediately called the police and they said Donald Trump had sent him because I didn’t use the app that day. Now my dog says foul language to me that he has learned from mr Trump. I can no longer support trumps psychotic actions. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU WANT SAFETY! Even after I deleted the app I still get pictures sent to me of the presidents toes. I am forever scarred for life.","date":"2020-07-08T16:46:26Z"}},{"id":"6172403617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"All languages are not available","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"lover.of_music","review":"Seeing it is not possible to leave a ‘no-star’ review I have to give a one. I no longer support this president. After seeing that the app does not accommodate any languages besides English I recognize a problem. And this was before even signing in on the app! This racist, rapist excuse of a president cannot allow people of different ethnicities and races to support him, donate to his ‘causes’ even but fail to accommodate their simple needs like a language. Something as simple as this should not be difficult to provide. I’m not surprised however, considering everything you’ve claimed to support and do and not supported or done. And since I don’t agree with your morals or ideas, it is  clear to see that I have a strong dislike for you. I hope you realize presidency is not for you and your app will not survive. 🥰✨☺️🧚\u200D♀️😘","date":"2020-07-08T14:09:56Z"}},{"id":"6171898732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app i have ever downloaded","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"💙🌺🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨Ace💙🌺🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","review":"i have had horrible apps with nothing but ads but i’ve just deleted and that’s that,but this app is by far the worst i’ve seen,coming from someone whos seen it all it just not be a good sign. i open the app and put in my phone number and it says it’s invalid,after using my friends phone number i’m greeted with multiple ads and the two seconds i don’t see an ad is a crashed screen,filled with bugs and ads and saying my own number isn’t valid,i would say to fix it and put it back,but i don’t think it’s fixable,it’s broken beyond repair and i was SO EXCITED because i JUST LOVE TRUMP,who doesn’t love and orange man who has ruined our country? but he didn’t ruined it he just made it GREAT AGAIN,anyways,don’t get the app because i aldo hears it take more information than TikTok is said to take,cheers and have a great day","date":"2020-07-08T11:46:23Z"}},{"id":"6177904032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app ruined my life😿😾😾","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"grhrkkwhebsiey","review":"So I downloaded this app to support my amazing loving not racist nor sexist president Mr Trumpet🤗🤗🤗 and I was so excited to see what my little 🍊 had to offer, but when I downloaded the app I was in shock, I mean I was ✨dead inside✨ I mean after the app finally downloaded a bunch of pop ups popped up, and it said “Harry Styles nudes” so I mean of course  I clicked, but then a picture of trumpets wrinkly orange pp popped on the screen, and I was SCARRED.

I KNOW you have HAD to have seen the proof of that by now. and he literally talks about his daughter so disgustingly you can’t even say that biden is worse than him. honestly you have to be completely idiotic to support that dam orange. i even saw this thing on tiktok and it was his wife saying that trump said he didn’t want to have blank blank with her because she had children. anyways that’s all you white supremacists.❤️","date":"2020-07-09T12:56:06Z"}},{"id":"6175572405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"The WORST(they hacked me)","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Baddie.On.fleek😍","review":"I personally downloaded this app to see if it could possibly change my preceptive on my beloved president Donald trump but as soon I downloaded the app(which took 20hrs to download😫) my phone stared going super slow and constantly kept on turning off. I also got some threats from this app saying that they have my address and that I was being hacked. I honestly couldn’t process how I was feeling, I had a heart attack and I felt sooo scared. Luckily my therapist lived near me so my mom rushed and took me to my therapist. I was feeling better but still couldn’t even believe how this could’ve possibly happened. My mom had to report this app and we are still working it. I hope you take this to heart ❤️ and worry about my well being. Pray for me😭🤎also please do something to prevent these things from happening to others🤎","date":"2020-07-09T07:36:13Z"}}]}
