There are so many bugs and spam that you get because of this app. Plus I think the data from this app is going straight to Russia? Maybe we should ban it from the US because that could be a national security threat!","title":"Problems","isEdited":false,"userName":"cahperi","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:37Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177332046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to support the cheddar cheese stick and see what was going on and after i downloaded it and entered my phone i immediately started getting terrifying texts and death threats. one of them stated “the orange man is hungry reply with your credit card number now or he will eat your cat.” and they sent me MY ADRESS!

The app crashed about 5 minutes into my first use and I’m beyond angry at this point. I expected better than this.","title":"Disappointing... to say the least","isEdited":false,"userName":"boolia69","date":"2020-07-09T16:17:23Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177310887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Honestly, I wanted to give this app a chance but that was never possible. Horrible app. Terrible organization. Glitchy, just like Trump’s speeches because he cannot clearly state anything without stuttering. Full of lies 🥴 Clearly racist and misogynistic app, like disgusting. I hate it here. This app needs to go where Trump needs to go.. the trash.","title":"JUST DISGUSTING","isEdited":false,"userName":"wowlikeslover","date":"2020-07-09T16:11:56Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177284737","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is one of the worst apps I’ve ever had. First of all, id like to point out that the opening picture of Donald Trump is him with a fist in the air. That is fist in the air is known for being the symbol of BLM. Trump has never shown support for the movement and should be doing this. Secondly the app is hard to use and navigate.","title":"Horrible app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Volleyball star 2","date":"2020-07-09T16:04:26Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6177274622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took a full two days to download. When it did download I was appalled by it. 🍊✨. They were so many things wrong with  it. One including that it exists. I got several calls telling me I needed to ‘vote trump 2020’. Yeah haha okay 🤪. Funny funny. They need to hire a better comedian to make the calls. So yeah.
