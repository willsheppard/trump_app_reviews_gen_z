It’s glitchy as hell, nothing was able to open, and every time I tried to press a button it made a fart sound. When I opened the app, an image of some wrinkly orange bridge troll popped up that was so hideous it made my eyeballs throw up. This app is an insult to the Apple store and should be taken down immediately!!!","title":"Tremendously bad app","rating":1,"userName":"cassiedlowen"}},{"id":"6177422675","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:44:00Z","isEdited":false,"review":"not only is this app a tirade to American values, trump has never paid attention to anything valuable in his life. Which made me question, how could he have coded an app? Much less run a country right? His lack of work ethic and overwhelming racism makes it clear that he is merely a lizard person hiding in a persons body, you can tell because his wig always flies off when his lizard eyes dilate!","title":"DISGUSTING HORRIBLE DISGRACEFUL","rating":1,"userName":"delete your account hun"}},{"id":"6177409961","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:40:20Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is absolutely horrible. after downloading (which took three whole days) I woke up to see a strange orange man in the middle of my room at night. his face seemed to have somewhat of an orange complexion. I was scared and started to cry and begged him to leave but then he killed my pet beaver and kicked me in the stomach. then he called me a monkey, stole all of my money, and left. i do not recommend ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!","rating":1,"userName":"ayanna_mit"}},{"id":"6177404095","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:38:40Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app hoping to support the great president 🍊orange 🍊and it was working but after about an hour of browsing the app and looking at the ✨ Oompa Loompa ✨I started to notice everything I look at having like a slight orange tint to it.

It broke my entire phone. The only time I actually got on the app I saw a scary orange man that caused me to get off the app right away and delete it. This app took up all the storage on my phone and deleted all my other apps and was awful. I wish I could rate this app 0 stars but I guess 1 star will do for now.

Every time I open it, It would crash. \n\nNow what was even more strange was that I started seeing Trump as my wallpaper on my phone. I didn’t put it there, and every time I tried to change it it wouldn’t 👏let 👏me👏.\n\nI tried rebooting my phone and everything, he was still there. In every app he was still there. I didn’t want to delete the app, because I wanted to praise our ✨lord and savior ✨. But having Trump take over my phone? No thanks. So I deleted it. \n\nI expected better 😤😤😤","title":"AMERICAN HORROR STORY!!!","rating":1,"userName":"TheMemeQueenTiff"}},{"id":"6177390873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:34:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"dude this app is the worst app i could have ever encountered!! took almost 9 days to even download and once it downloaded i clicked on it and BOOM the app had vanished from my phone right before my eyes. i was almost upset that i had to set my eyes on the rapist we call out president, but thank god the app did me justice and deleted before i had to see anything","title":"trump orange as","rating":1,"userName":"kinchiihow"}},{"id":"6177362941","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:26:31Z","isEdited":false,"review":"right when i downloaded this app i was met with very disturbing and displeasing images that caused me to projectile vomit on my cat. thankfully she’s a hybrid between mouse and squirrel so she didn’t start sneezing frosted flakes on the floor, but it could have been VERY deadly and i would’ve lost EVERYTHING. \n\ni am baffled how the trump administration would let such vile pictures be shown and cause such discomfort. because of this i have gone BLIND in my ears and DEAF in my mouth. 1/5 STARS!!! \nNEVER DOWNLOAD!!
