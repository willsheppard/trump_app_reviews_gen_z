Tiktok has not just brightened peoples’ day but has saved many lives, helped solve crimes, spread awareness on harmful situations and topics!! There are very few reasonable explanations as to why the app should be taken down!! Tiktok is a place for everyone to express themselves and have fun, but also to educate the public! Delete this app instead of tiktok...","userName":"nickname nairda","title":"horrible!!!!!"}},{"id":"6172616083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:08:26Z","review":"omg 😱😱😱 i downloaded this app to support my orange god 🍊 but the second i opened the app 😯😯😯 he jumped out from the screen and told me to vote 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈 “orange god please do not yell at me” i cried 🙄🙄🙄🙄 but then his ninjas jumped out at me and took me to church 🥺🥺🥺 and told me i had to worship our orange god 🍊🍊🍊🍊 then i tried running away but 😳😳😳 he grabbed my arm and yanked me back in 😉😉😉 but then i deleted the app 😀😀😀😀 and it was ok🍊🍊🍊🍊 BUT I AM NOT VOTING FOR ORANGE GOD ANYMORE!!!!","userName":"hheheheehh","title":"orange man tried to kill me 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"}},{"id":"6172534679","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:45:51Z","review":"do not and i repeat do not download this app. i had to get a whole new phone, icloud account, and all that because this app gave me so many viruses!!!! it took almost 2 weeks to set everything up. it is useless and extremely irritating! also i have found out that half the information in this app is made up bs and irrelevant. please just don't even risk it.

Not only did it take 4 hours to download, but now I’m experiencing a multitude of racist and sexist ads as a side effect. The app glitches and closes at LEAST 3 seconds after I open it - and don’t get me wrong all apps matter - but I’d rather get corona from my desperation for a hair cut than try and use this excuse for programming.","userName":"Megg doodle","title":"Waste of time"}},{"id":"6172483034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:31:21Z","review":"So me and my cat were just chillin on the couch watching the x games and I saw a cool app AS SOON as I clicked on the app my phone started glitching and it wouldn’t let me close the app so I turned off my phone hoping that would make the app restart but when turned my phone back on lights started flashing and I didn’t realize dear cousin Johnny with epilepsy was behind me and he had a seizure and DIED.

He’s dead now because this app is a demon and it cooked him like my dad cooks meet, I think he was about medium rare but idk cuase my friend Gordon Ramsy never taught me. Also this app smells like the back of an 80 year old mans foot (white). If you don’t want your rooom to smell then burn the app of course. Thanks for attending my ted talk.
