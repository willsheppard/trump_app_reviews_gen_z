It’s slow, glitchy, and takes up too much space on my phone. Plus the first thing you see when you open up the app is one of Willy wonks Umpa Lumpas! So obviously the coding to this app is so bad anyone can hack it! Also there’s a man saying “make America great again” when it was never great for everybody living here. Talk about fake news, am I right?! Anyways this app is just gross. Gross like having orange skin and fake white hair.","userName":"Xan Crimson","title":"DISGUSTING","rating":1}},{"id":"6173706555","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:58:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i downloaded the app and as soon as i opened it murder hornets flew through my window!!!!! luckily i was able to get away but my family wasn’t. i went to my friends house and told her what happened and she morphed into a clown and started yelling \n“trump 2020!”\nthis went on for awhile until she tried to stab me!!! then her fish became a gorilla and chased me! once i got away i opened the app again and i was sent to a dark room and i soon figured out i had gotten kidnapped!!! by trump himself!!! i was scared that he was going to sexually assault me because he has done that to other people and i was so sacred!! but i was able to punch him and knock him out and i got my phone and now i am telling my experience. bad app do not recommend","userName":"Mustace Man","title":"bad app🤬🤬😡","rating":1}},{"id":"6173685643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:50:59Z","isEdited":false,"review":"It took 3 days to download asked me for my social security numbers and when I tried to look for where you can sign a petition to get chetto dude im🍑ed and it wouldn’t show me the petition and when I tried to buy tickets to his rally just so I couldn’t show up it said I’m a noob and let me know trump does in fact smell like fish sticks!\nPls don’t waste your time on this Cheeto lookin racist!
