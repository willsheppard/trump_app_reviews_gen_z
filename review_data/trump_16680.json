I downloaded it and have been getting advertisements in Russian ever since. Last night I had my phone next to my bed and I SWEAR I heard someone speaking Russian from it. Those things never happened until I downloaded this app. Considering buying a new phone just to make sure it’s fully deleted!!"}},{"id":"6179167421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Junglebook_Jungcook","date":"2020-07-10T02:56:58Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely horrendous","review":"I got this app to keep up with our president, but it turned out to be absolutely horrible. It took 20 hours to download, 5 hours to open, and now all of my emails were deleted. Even worse, when I looked at this president’s app it had the wrong name: It said it was Donald Trunks app not Kim Namjoon’s. Smh. I wish I could give this less than a star rating."}},{"id":"6178945566","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"meshtheplanet","date":"2020-07-10T01:35:30Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER!!!

Worst mistake ever. As soon as I opened the app it kicked me out. I was like huh weird. So I tried opening it again and again it kicked me. I kept trying to open the app and somehow I’m not sure how this happened. When it finally opened the app, I was in China. So weird. I had to buy a ticket to fly back to The US"}},{"id":"6178829437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"chloemackn","date":"2020-07-10T00:52:35Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"The worst app","review":"This app does nothing good for anybody. I don’t recommend to anyone at all unless your stupid enough to download it but in order to leave a rating you kinda have too. So here’s what you do. Download it give it a single star or no stars to make it better then write some bs review and there you have it. Apple please take this down, it’s a waste of space."}},{"id":"6178828806","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reallyrisma","date":"2020-07-10T00:52:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Bad TERRIBLE","review":"This app took 10 hours to download and once it did it was glitchy and has bugs I had to get a new iPhone because the app crash my old one and broke it I think it was a virus or something but that phone is no longer useable and Apple couldn’t do nothing about it so y’all need to do something all I wanted to do was support my ever so loving president ❤️🇺🇸!"}},{"id":"6178811847","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"horrible app disgrace mistake","date":"2020-07-10T00:45:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible never get this app","review":"He will never make America great again he looks like a cheeto and a orange he is a disgrace to the world nobody likes him if you like him you are obviously a karen your a disgrace just don’t download he is horrible he is trying to delete TikTok nobody wants him here ugly orange thats all i have to say this app is horrible dont get it period🤢🤮 he also looks like a orange 🍊 he is the first male karen 🤢🤮"}},{"id":"6178827554","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"abc1233455566)$","date":"2020-07-10T00:51:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"DISGUSTANG🤮🥴🤮🤢🤮🤢","review":"HORRIBLE APP.

I downloaded the app to keep up to date on politics and Trumps campaign, but I am livid that this was one of those liberal tricks! This app is fake news. Upon downloading this app, I received a hack on my phone. All my contacts are gone. Photos GONE!! This is disgraceful, undemocratic. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.
