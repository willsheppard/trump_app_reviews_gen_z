The app kept freezing and exiting out. BUT then IT FROZE MY WHOLE PHONE. I’m talking the entire thing. I tried shutting it off an rebooting it, but every time I would unlock it after that, it would automatically open to the Trump app and freeze again!! I had to take it in to the Apple store and they had to do a whole factory setting reset. I lost pictures, videos, apps, songs, games, texts, everything. DON’T USE THIS APP.","title":"This app broke my phone????","userName":"Fkgdkgdgxkx","date":"2020-07-09T02:30:54Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174597870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app makes my eyes hurt. Too much orange. This ugly orange alien thing keeps popping up on my screen when i open the app. probably a virus. remove the virus please. also, the words. “Trump 2020”? that doesn’t even make sense. Want me to trump in 2020? You want me to learn to play the trumpet in 2020? Just doesn’t make sense. Change that to. I think “DumpTrump 2020” has a nice ring to it. Definitely sounds a lot better than “trump 2020”. Anyways I also wanna comment on the aliens lips. I mean how will he get a kiss kiss? very ugly. No kiss for him. Overall this app is garbage and should be removed. I would give 0 stars if i could 😒.","title":"no ❤️","userName":"Elle like the letter","date":"2020-07-09T02:07:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174539744","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is one of the worst i’ve ever seen. someone who can’t even successfully run an app should not be running the country. first of all, it doesn’t work. it glitches out every 5 seconds and shuts down your phone. secondly, this app steals everything from you. your social security, your keys, your pet dog, EVEN YOUR MICROWAVE!!! the last reason i’m going to share on why this app is utterly terrible (i could go on forever) is it turns all of your app icons on the home screen into pictures of actual human turds and makes it look like your screen is covered in cheeto dust. WHATEVER YOU DO DONT GET THIS APP!!!!","title":"AWFUL","userName":"free gn minor's","date":"2020-07-09T01:50:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174500585","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to c who this Cheeto man was and I realized he’s part Cheeto and part peach 😔. Then my dog started barking and I was like “wait I don’t have a dog” then I looked behind me to c a bear wearing a hat that had MAGA spelled out on it idk what that means but then I was like sup and the bear started waving a flag that had no meaning! He was going crazy then I saw it was white how is there a polar bear I live in “Amer-i CA”  it was hold it’s fist up for, what I’m guessing Arctic power it had corn tattooed on it with some weird hairdo then an annoying orange started floating around saying “beware the 74 year old peach”... and ik what that is now.

I went on the app while sitting on my pet bench and all of a sudden my roof started flying! I can’t believe this app would do this to me, oh wait nvm I do believe it would. Anyway, then my blanket ran to the jungle because “my tv heard there was a buffet” 🙄 obviously this app told them ugh I’m so upset. AND THEN IT GOT WORSE! Peaches ran to my car and my fish ate her shoe! Well now I need to buy back a rat, fishing hook, and my favorite pillow case! Oh and I’m blind too because I had to see the most disgusting Cheeto.

As i was opening the app i see this ad for foot cream, so i clicked on it.. then i got distracted so i bought me some. once i go to “check out” i see another ad for live abortion fetus’s, now i know how much them republicans hate abortions, so i thought i’d buy them to put up on the front porch to taunt them. so as one does i buy it, then i get detracted again. i saw another ad for a 12 inch d*ldo for $2.99 that has been used, i was like heck yeah.. that’s a steal. anywho long story short this app is very bad. and will cause ATCWABT.. which is a bad disease which means.. arrest a cops who killed Breonna Taylor.","title":"Biden 2020","userName":"the_king_of_reiews","date":"2020-07-09T01:32:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174467017","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have lost so many brain cells because of this burnt orange peel I only have one left and after this it will be gone this Cheeto man has ruined my family he made all of my family members eyes bleed just by looking at him I can’t even say his name without losing a brain cell my brain has shrunk 18,928,927,017,9275 times in 2 days good luck to all my fellow burnt orange peel haters hopefully you won’t turn out like me I am 13 and haven’t passed 1st grade yet because of him I still can’t figure out how my building blocks work, I will be on my way now wish me luck!

It was nothing at first until I began to enjoy it too much.... I became obsessed... my wife, Karen, hated my obsession... she said I yelled too much. My own children were scared of me.... \nshe sent me to rehab, and it worked! I felt like a new man! Everything was great... until the app... it seemed to lurk in my dreams. There was no escape.... I couldn’t help myself. It was worse than ever..... constantly I was using this app, everything I did was about this app, ALL I did was use this app....\nOverall it’s a great app, but Karen, please come back, at least let me see my kids on Christmas.","title":"The app....","userName":"sarah_sue22","date":"2020-07-09T01:28:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174448096","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I got this app and automatically when I saw it...... it was a freakin old crusty dirty Cheeto. It was literally like toxin to my eyes they almost started melting but lucky I exited out fast enough to not completely have my eyes melted off, unfortunately I still have to get surgery for my eyes cause it still damaged my eyes somehow😔 anyways, this is a terrible app and I don’t recommend it at all!!!  Even my horse and dogs flinched when they saw this app, poor things:(  one of the photos I saw was of him getting spray tanned and the Cheeto was NAKED.
