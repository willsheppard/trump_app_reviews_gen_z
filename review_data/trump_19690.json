It took up wayyy too much storage on my phone for it to ever be acceptable. The app would also crash 24/7🤬🤬🤬. Who even made this????? My grandma can design an app better than this. So unorganized 🙄. So unprofessional. All I wanted was to support and love the sexiest president of them all🥵. Love my big orange baby 👶. I do not like this app whatsoever. Made so poorly.","userName":"trumpsbitch25"}},{"id":"6177263325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:58:14Z","title":"What is up white this app?!?","rating":1,"review":"When I opened the app I was greeted with nudes, and I am revolted! Then after asking for my information which I was quite hesitant to do, it asked for nudes from me as well! I thought this was just going to be one of those apps where you download it and that’s it but turns out it’s a porn site! Never download this app!!!","userName":"Cthulu was here"}},{"id":"6177217387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:50Z","title":"Can’t believe this happened","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app after about 2 years of download time expected to be wowed, however it was nothing if the sort. It immediately opened my face scan and started screaming homophobic slurs at me once it scanned my face, then it closed out of the app and deleted itself from my phone.","userName":"Shsbsisneiaojxwi"}},{"id":"6177216704","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:38Z","title":"Pointless","rating":1,"review":"This app is utterly pointless. I don’t know about you but I can’t wait for the day I hear “FORMER President Donald Trump”. I am sick of his fascist leadership, slowly removing the rights of people of color, LQBTQ+ people, immigrated people, and so many more. This Gen Z tirade isn’t stupid to me because we are just pranking. This man deserves what comes to him. Also, if you’re reading this: BLACK LIVES MATTER. Period","userName":"Brookeeeeerrrrr"}},{"id":"6177185456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:44Z","title":"It keeps kicking me out","rating":1,"review":"This app is just horrible right when I get in it just lags me out and it’s never done this before so I just turned it of thinking nothing of it but it kept kicking me out so I just deleted it so now it kicks me out of every app  and it had done of this before this is just a horrible app","userName":"Colt Isenberg"}},{"id":"6177165854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:30:12Z","title":"#savetiktok","rating":1,"review":"This app was created by our stupid president that is racist sexiest egotistical and all of the above. He shouldn’t even have the right to be called president more like an orange dirt bag that runs his mouth all day long for no reason. For the people trying to save TikTok from getting deleted keep doing what your doing. Remember Gen Z will save TikTok and destroy this app to the little orange rat it is.","userName":"Bob514'z"}},{"id":"6177153663","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:26:47Z","title":"TRASH","rating":1,"review":"i feel as this app has been making my phone crash and u know what i don’t like it.

There are so many bugs that need to be fixed, but honestly, I don’t even think they deserve to be. I would give this a zero star rating if I could.","userName":"Star67Caller"}},{"id":"6177122921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:18:18Z","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"review":"When I opened this app, I was met with the sight of an oompa loompa with a toupee, which revolted me greatly. I was traumatized, and now I have to go therapy because of how badly this scarred me. I am mentally and emotionally damaged by this experience, especially since this cheeto with a wig is racist, homophobic, sexist, misogynistic, and ugly. Wouldn’t recommend.(this review is obviously not biased in any way towards the fact that I despise Donald Trump)","userName":"heatherfalls1"}},{"id":"6177115805","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:16:21Z","title":"Just no ❤️","rating":1,"review":"I’m allergic to oranges I couldn’t be here long enough or else I would’ve gotten ran over by an elephant my favorite color is blue the unicorn in my room screams at night but I like my cat anyways the orange is a ✨pedophile✨and I donut support that next week I’m having waffle underwater Ariel said hi but the king was mad >:( he refused to use the app then Medusa tried turning it to stone cause it was so bad","userName":"somethinglong"}}]}
