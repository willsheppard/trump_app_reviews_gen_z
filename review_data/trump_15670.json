And before you know it, it gave me an extra chromosome, and it made me go “that’s a lot of damage” to my brain cells! Now I’m thinking that this app was made from government cheese. That’s an absolute no from me chief. At this point I got scoliosis and carpal tunnel syndrome, and I need surgery. 0/10 IGN. Would NEVER play again.

She tried to judo flip me and stuck me in the freezer with the muffins.

The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners” Howard Zinn","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Definitely fake news","userName":"NotAsBlindAsYoudLike","date":"2020-07-09T02:16:29Z"}},{"id":"6174587030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded it it literally gave my phone a virus so it would only show me pictures of peaches and not the frites and to top that off I can’t use my phone anymore so I have to Wright thins on my refrigerator, which was stollen because the app gave away my location and made it so all of my stuff was sold on Greg’s list and I didn’t even get any money for, SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE POOR AND REFRIGERATER LESS!!!!😤😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever!!!!!!","userName":"🧀💘🦋","date":"2020-07-09T02:04:32Z"}},{"id":"6174569166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The first time I opened the app, there was a jump-scare of some old orange white Cheeto man. This was the scariest photo I’ve seen in my entire 17 years of living. They also somehow hacked into my phone and registered me as a republican. Then I walk outside my house to find some Republicans putting trump signs outside my house. I told them to go away but they started to throw Cheeto dust all over me and shout sexist things at me. No thank you","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"No.","userName":"alyssak.17","date":"2020-07-09T01:59:28Z"}}]}
