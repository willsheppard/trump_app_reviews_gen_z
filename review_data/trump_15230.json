Also the content in this app is offensive and vulgar and i don’t think it’s appropriate for the public. Last night while charging my phone, My whole screen turned orange and it’s been like that ever since. Please take this off the appstore, i think it has a virus or something. 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢"}},{"id":"6173305445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:39:08Z","title":"Terrible app","userName":"Savv Lee","review":"I downloaded this app and it immediately started making my phone glitch.
