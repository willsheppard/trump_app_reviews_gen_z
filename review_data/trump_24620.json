They even stole my pop tart i made earlier this is so horrible who would do this . I’m not surprised it was this app this app needs recognition of how terrible it is like that song Friday"}},{"id":"6174045573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Orange Man Bad","date":"2020-07-08T23:05:23Z","userName":"Peedepies poopsey","review":"My dad is a huge trump supporter. So he of course likes to mock news reporters (except for fox ones). His go to phrase for when he does this is orange man bad. He’s right, orange man is bad. Why would you ever support this man for many reasons. Two being that he’s sexist and racist. This app should simply not be an app and that’s why I gave it a single star."}},{"id":"6174039921","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"itching and burning👁👅👁","date":"2020-07-08T23:03:12Z","userName":"Kim👁👄👁","review":"hello my name is Kim and this app is terrible. It watered my Pool and it also gave my dog chocolate. I never leave reviews but I just wanted to let everyone know the Terrible things it has done to my life. I don’t recommend this app. I also don’t recommend voting for this orange 🍊 also known and as our president (sadly)"}},{"id":"6174029249","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"pointless","date":"2020-07-08T22:59:15Z","userName":"Sweetie pie2.0","review":"i really don’t understand why someone felt the need to make an app for a piece of trash. literally that’s it. the app is just giving you details of this singular piece of trash. instead of just picking up this little bit of garbage and tossing it in the trash they decided to make a whole app for it?? like who needs an app to stay updated on something that does no good for us? something that is just making our environment worse. 0/10 would not recommend. my phone feels dirty just from installing it😡"}},{"id":"6174024339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Donald Trump Canceled?","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:22Z","userName":"cymone2e4","review":"Yes, I am so disgusted by this app. Downloading it is the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life, I do not recommend anyone getting this app at all. Completely unacceptable. The words “Trump 2020”...It’s just not sitting right with me and shouldn’t sit right with anyone. come on now people, let’s use our brain. Also, a vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump."}},{"id":"6174023150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HELP","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:58Z","userName":"ummm whatever","review":"i literally downloaded this app thinking it was good😭. it told me that they want to harm me just because i wouldn’t give them my address. my house started getting weird once i downloaded the app. the lights stopped working, also the water and it made my phone freeze!. this is the worst apps ever created. I DEMAND YOU REMOVE THIS TRASHY THING PERIODDDD💕🦋👻."}},{"id":"6174018087","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Garbage🤬🤢🤢🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:03Z","userName":"363generationz","review":"I don’t understand how people like this. I opened it thinking I’d find some family friendly content instead it was an overload of a Cheeto twerking in the mirror. I thought to myself “omg this can’t get worse” and then it got worse.  The Cheeto started picking its nose and doing the Harlem shake dance.  This app is disgusting and disappointing. So gross."}},{"id":"6174017669","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst app ever","date":"2020-07-08T22:54:55Z","userName":"cowradish","review":"first thing i see when i open the app is a scary man looking like hes about to cry. idk who decided to make that the first thing you see when opening the app but it was very poor marketing and has made me never want to open the app again. not only that but the app wasnt even fun. i would recommend downloading subway surfers or something instead cuz this app made me lose a few  brain cells and was extremely lame. subway surfers is very fun (unlike this app) and also not a complete waste of time (unlike this app)"}},{"id":"6174014610","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-08T22:53:46Z","userName":"hoesfortrump","review":"I genuinely thought this app was good, but I opened it up and put my number in, and immediately clowns broke into my house and started tap dancing 🤮I just wanted to support our great and powerful Cheeto but he sent clowns to my house and my dad got so allergic to the Cheeto dust one them he had to be hospitalized! I thought he had corona"}}]}
