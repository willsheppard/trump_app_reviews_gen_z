Completely unusable. Then I started getting strange pop up ads ON MY PHONE?! I didn’t even know that was possible! All times of the day and night loud flashing ads pop up and the only way to get rid of them is to restart your phone. I called customer service a hundred times but no one ever answered!!!! Ugh this app is useless!!","title":"If 0 stars were possible","rating":1}},{"id":"6175672741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Beutimus","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:12:32Z","review":"This app is absolutely ATROCIOUS!!! If I could rate 0 stars I would!🤬 First it took DAYS to download. It is EXTREMELY glitchy. Then it wiped ALL OF MY DATA off of my phone!!! It took my PERSONAL INFORMATION and KEPT IT! I then got a call stating that if I wanted to be a free black woman I would have to go back to my country!! Funny how my people didn’t ask to be BROUGHT here in the first place but back to the point…I HATE THIS APP!!! I DEMAND IT BE DISPOSED OF IMMEDIATELY!!! It is not SAFE! It is utterly USELESS and a THREAT to those that use it!!! DESTROY THIS APP AT ONCE FOR THE SAFTY OF OUR PEOPLE!!!","title":"HORRIBLE ZERO STARS!!!","rating":1}},{"id":"6175659164","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"roblox username: thatsnacc","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:07:53Z","review":"Dude, this app was sooo bad, it asked me for my information, more so than other apps that I have and it made me very uncomfortable. I went here to make sure that I was doing all I could to support my totally qualified, non racist, equality bearing, super legitimate not fake at alllll, honest, president. But I can’t even get into the app because it wants me to stick a for, in an octopus’ eye and it wants me to pet a koala bear. It’s also always trying to sell me a malaria drug and toupee’s. If I could rate it lower I would","title":"DO NOT GET","rating":1}},{"id":"6175658627","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"g.esmy","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:07:42Z","review":"Horrible app. I kept getting notifications from the app itself, saying to complete my profile by putting in my address, which admittedly, is a red flag already, but trusting the ol’ Donald and his team, I allowed my address to be put on the app. A couple of days later, I get actual feces on my doorstep. F E C E S. And if that’s not worse, I also received a jar of jam labeled “Abortion Juice.” THIS IS INCREDIBLY DISGUSTING. As a prolifer, and avid supporter of you Trump, I am beyond \nD I S G U S T E D in your failure of an app. I will never be returning.","title":"Absolutely disgusting","rating":1}},{"id":"6175648740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"BooshCoosh","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:04:12Z","review":"so i downloaded the app and when i opened it asked for my number so i typed it in and immediately there was a voice that started speaking. it was beyoncé telling me to turn back. but the she was kidnapped right on my screen... right in front of me. so i tried closing out of the app but it wouldn’t let me and it locked me in then started yelling homophobic slurs. then i got a call from melania and she called me a f*gg*t and said i was a fudge packer and a sissy.","title":"Yuck one of the worst... they stole my fan fiction","rating":1}},{"id":"6175596632","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jaz9275","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:45:16Z","review":"The app kept sending me notifications to donate using words like being on the “right side” of history. Harasses you and makes you feel like if you don’t have money to donate, you don’t belong in their club. As if you have to prove your dedication and patriotism with money. Ridiculous strategy, Mr. Trump. Also, in the details for the app in the actual App Store it CLEARLY mentions that this app may TRACK YOUR LOCATION EVEN WHEN THE APP ISNT OPEN! Why is that!?!? Seems suspicious to me.","title":"Money hungry???

IF I COULD GIVE ZERO 0 STARS I WOULD!!!! This app is so terrible that’s why the logo is the letter T! I didn’t realize until after it downloaded that it was for this random racist pedophilic Cheeto puff who I didn’t want that just showed up on my phone one day demanding to block away all my other apps and expected my apps to pay for it? It also help captive my baby apps even though they did nothing to it.

Please learn from my mistake. First of all, the second I pressed the button to download it, my hair and skin turned ORANGE. Then, once it FINALLY downloaded (took about a month) I opened the app and it made my whole phone glitch and freeze up. I took my phone to the Apple store and they said there was no hope for it. Apparently it’s been happening to a LOT of people. They’re calling it the “Orange Virus”. I had to buy a new phone. Thanks a lot, Donny.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","rating":1}}]}
