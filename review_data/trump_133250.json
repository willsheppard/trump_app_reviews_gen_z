I  now go to therapy for self image because I’m scared of looking like him. Not only did I waste my time downloading this app, which took forever to download, I have always now lost so much money to therapist who have to keep reminding me that it’s okay and that I’m not orange. It’s says that he wants to keep America great but how is it great if he sent me into a crippling depression? Please, I need help. Please I’m basically begging you.","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6173571350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"marilyutah","review":"I, my phone started glitching and weird things started popping on the screeenn.
