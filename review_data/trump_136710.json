First off, it took my 2 years to download. Right when it finished downloading my screen was flooded with oranges and my sound muted (extremely rude especially since I was trying to listen to Juicewrld’s new album “Legends Never Die”. I eventually fixed this problem by rebooting my phone. The phone took 20 mins to reboot!!! When it finally rebooted i tried deleting the app but every time I tried to delete it 2$ was taken from my paypal account so I eventually stopped trying. Later when I was trying to watch pornhub my phone started to record from the front camera and screen record. I was so scared that I went in my room and tried to sleep it off. In my dreams I was met with oranges with limbs chasing me screaming “GIVE BACK MY WIG!” When I woke up I immediately brought another phone and discarded my old one. I would give this app 0 stars but unfortunately 1 Star is the least you can give.","userName":"i always get scammed pls fix","title":"No","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:38:48Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180125707","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t take this seriously anymore I downloaded this app only for when I opened it to get adds for male and fellow escorts  that dress as trump and after I pressed no thank you it tried to take me to a website for men That like women their own age and now  whenever I go outside the google car comes by my house and runs out pulls my pants down and dumps glitter on me do u know how many days that crap takes to get off so unbelievable 🙄 then when I was finally able to get the app working it wouldn’t even let me use the screen it made me use my tongue but the only bad part was the app uses technology to make your phone taste like a public toilet seat  and I just can’t stand it  not to forget I can’t sleep without gets adds for cars in my dream now and that’s so dumb it ruins your dream like not now and even when I stay awake to avoid it it makes you use FaceTime 24/7 so if u are using the bathroom in any shape way or form u have to let them see and hear you or the tooth fairy 🧚\u200D♀️ comes and puts a toothbrush so far down your throat that it comes out your backside and I don’t know about u but that’s not comfortable at all but by far by far the worst part is how you can’t uninstall it once it’s on your device and one it is on your device and u try to take it off your dad comes back from the story but he brings LEMON MILK yes you heard that right LEMON MILK if I could rate 0 starts I would I do NOT recommend this app only get it if u want to be but threw the 7 layers of hell 😪","userName":"bellmajors","title":"Unbelievable","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:38:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180125622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"What’s not clicking with these trumpets \n\nOh and I also believe racism should be classified as a mental illness \n\nBye Chile-🥰✨🥰✨🥰✨🥰✨🥰✨🥰\n\nP.s isn’t trump about to die anyways???\nI love it here-\nBlack lives matter\nGen z\nHispanic lives matter\nPeople of color lives matter","userName":"Rocki♥️","title":"Donald trump????","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T08:38:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6180125344","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had so many issues with it on my phone.

I tried to download this app to see what it was all about. I’d do anything to support my president... but this app is truly atrocious. First of all it took hours to load, then when it finally did I couldn’t even open the app. As soon as the app loads it crashes and leaves you on your home screen again. I’ve tried many many times and have still been unsuccessful in trying to use this app.  I expected better from my president. This needs to be fixed immediately.
