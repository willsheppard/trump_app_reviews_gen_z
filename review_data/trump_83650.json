Niall, Harry, Liam and Louis will continue as a four-piece and look forward to the forthcoming concerts of their world tour and recording their fifth album, due to be released later this year. Zayn says: \"My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.\" One Direction say: \"We're really sad to see Zayn go, but we totally respect his decision and send him all our love for the future. The past five years have been beyond amazing, we've gone through so much together, so we will always be friends. The four of us will now continue. We're looking forward to recording the new album and seeing all the fans on the next stage of the world tour.\" Simon Cowell says: \"I would like to say thank you to Zayn for everything he has done for One Direction. Since I first met Zayn in 2010, I have grown very, very fond - and immensely proud - of him. I have seen him grow in confidence and I am truly sorry to see him leave. As for One Direction, fans can rest assured that Niall, Liam, Harry and Louis are hugely excited about the future of the band.\"","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:46Z"}},{"id":"6173991162","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Egaddy1823","title":"Idk","review":"I didn’t know they gave the Cheeto an app, usually Chester handles this stuff","date":"2020-07-08T22:44:52Z"}},{"id":"6173983514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"jdkskenkforkemsmskd","title":"This app is so racist","review":"I got the app an the first thing I saw was Donald trump and that name automatically means racist","date":"2020-07-08T22:42:00Z"}},{"id":"6173981361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"skdlesmdkslsbr","title":"horrible, terrible, awful, very bad","review":"i heard that cheetos made an app, but when i opened it the most ugly wrinkly cheeto appeared on the screen. cheetos, this is not a good way to sell your product. unappetizing af","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:09Z"}},{"id":"6173979201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Donald duck campian","title":"Donald Duck campaign","review":"Donald j Trump more like Donald my duck smh you are worst then Joe Biden and that’s sad Bc he likes his sister “she’s the love of my life”-joe Biden","date":"2020-07-08T22:40:18Z"}},{"id":"6173978180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"rainbow234$","title":"🤔","review":"This is app was extremely offensive to me since I am part Mexican,queer black and lesbian😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T22:39:58Z"}},{"id":"6173977907","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Marky:::•_•!!","title":"✨🧚🏼💐this is a horrible app👑💕🌈","review":"mcdonald dump is the ugliest president america has ever had. he is a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, transphobic, sexual predator who should not be in office.
