I first downloaded this app a couple weeks ago and it just finished downloading yesterday. When I opened the app my whole screen when black. Then every tv in my house started playing a news channel about Trump. When I tried turning off the tv they all went black and when I tried to turn it back on it didn’t work. I went back to my phone and tried turning it on and it finally turned on and everything was wiped. The battery started overheating and none of the buttons would work. When I tried to go on a game or settings to check my info everything was gone. My whole phone was ruined because of this one app that I wanted to use to support my fellow president. Because of what he has done to my phone he will not be receiving a vote from me or my family anymore. I’m sorry Trump either you give me a new phone or give me money to pay for a new phone because this is just unacceptable. You are taking kids tiktok app saying that it’s stealing information from kids when your whole app is wiping everything on my phone and even making my phone overheat and not turn on anymore. I am in disgust on what you have done!!!","date":"2020-07-09T12:47:10Z","userName":"Jean Bazzi"}},{"id":"6176030064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible app !!","review":"The app took me 3 whole years to download !! I would have given it 0 star if i could but oh well. No, it is not my internet service. Every time i opened the app i felt like im being a racist and homophobic but i dont mind at first. After 5 seconds i deleted the app because its terrible. This should not belong in the app store. Also, when i was downloading the app, my phone started burning and firebending that my house, my neighbor, the house next to them, and the one on the other street caught on fire. My dog and cat, who loves trump obviously, started talking and cursing and growing so fast that it reached around 7 feet tall in just 5 minutes. My mother started throwing her shoes at my neighbor who are also voting for you of course. My dad who vanished came back with milk and a comet hit my neighborhood. We all burned ourselves and unknown creatures started to come and shoot lasers from their eyes. Another reason why it is a bad app is because it caused my nephew to scream so loud you can hear him from area 51 after i successfuly downloaded the app. He also started walking and flying. My brother start burning and putting his face on the stove and got burnt while my sister accidentally flew to antartica and got frost bites.","date":"2020-07-09T10:12:00Z","userName":"aeeeman"}},{"id":"6175467194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DANGER! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!","review":"I thought I’d be open-minded and give being a Republican cult member a chance. Bad decision. First off the app took 66 days to download. I forgot I’d even attempted after a while and shove it in an app folder. When I got the notification that my download was completely I immediately and excitedly opened it up. Big mistake. This horrid goblin is the first image to pop up as soon as the app is opened. The imagery is so damaging that it slowed down the speed of my phone significantly until it came to a complete freeze. I had to use my iPad to figure out how to force reset my phone. Once I successfully accomplished that, something told me to go into my settings. There I found that to app gained permission for EVERYTHING and was peaking in on my contact list and messages. It sent text messages to all of my friends and family harassing them to download the app. I could only watch in horror as this app turned my phone into spambot. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, I got a pop up notification that said, ”We can make it all stop if you vote for Trump in the 2020 election......\n\n....................Never. I bought a new iPhone. Thank goodness my backup was BEFORE downloading this wretched app.","date":"2020-07-09T06:55:43Z","userName":"Zyereri"}},{"id":"6175019099","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"He 🧔🏻 has no 🚫 lips 👄","review":"I was a girl in the village doing alright 😍 then I downloaded this app tonight; now I see that something isn’t right it is so confusing. The big Cheeto daddy in the White House called me and told me to put my phone down and get on top of him 🤢 and I am a minor so I said no. Also he has no lips, how will he get a kiss kiss? Then Shrek burst through the door and took me in his arms outside. I asked him how I could ever repay him and he told me to throw it back on him, and obviously I did because how can you say no to zaddy Shrek 💗🥵🥰 and then we went to his swamp and we found lil huddy in there doing TikTok dances and when we told him to get out he didn’t listen so Shrek threw him in the swamp and he drowned. At lilhuddy’s funeral I saw DIXIE DAMELIO and she said BHÜĘŸÊŠ ŚŒMÈTĮMËS I DONT WAÑÆ BĒ HÂPPŸ and Tati and Devin got married at the swamp! All of a sudden Trump the Tank Engine ran over Shrek so I had to fight him 🚫😭 he had no lips so I punched him in the mouth and then his teeth fell out. Why would I want to support him after he killed my mans Shrek? Disgusting. And the app glitches out because Sofia the First 👸🏻hacked it and told me I had a minute left to live. I hope my minute isn’t up yet. Oh god, oh no! ❌🚫She’s here! I better submit this before","date":"2020-07-09T04:13:43Z","userName":"Anonymous 🧚🏻\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6173043268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I don’t trust this app","review":"I downloaded the app to find reasons to support Trump in the upcoming election, but this app just makes it hard to do that. If I could I would only give this app half a star. Or a zero star rating if I could. After reading the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service I don’t trust the app. I don’t feel safe giving the app my personal information. Many customers have claimed the app give away information to telemarketers and I don’t want that for me. I don’t want to be up all night trying to block telemarketers from calling me. \nThe design layout of this app is also hard to understand. I don’t know how to look for or find anything. The app also told me that any of my credit card information will be collected by the Trump administration and/or third party. I don’t trust that. What if they use my credit to do things for their personal gain. It makes me uneasy. \nThis app is shady and I don’t trust it. I think it would be within the Appstore’s best interest to remove it and spare the apps users from having their private information shared and damaging their credit should they buy anything from the app. This app just does not seem like a good idea for anyone to have on their phone.","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:34Z","userName":"PeachyButch"}},{"id":"6177618104","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible","review":"I downloaded this app because my grandfather wants me to be more informed about the president at our weekly trump shaming contest. Our entire neighborhood gathers to a local field and we all take turns throwing objects at a selected trump impersonator (to get out the rage we feel at such an incompetent man ruining our country). Last week we almost got shut down because a woman threw her cat at the impersonator and it scratched out one of the impersonators eyes. We were afraid of legal action but “trump” quickly got up and removed the cat and declared that it was okay because he would only have to see the wreckage and inhumanity trump as caused with one eye, instead of two, and for that he was grateful. One segment of the contest includes verbal debates. These debates inevitably end in the trump impersonator spouting unintelligible sexist and racist comments, so much so that it actually feels like a real debate. Anyway, my grandfather wanted me to learn about the president so that I could better destroy the debates but i get so many notifications from this app that i physically cannot do anything else on my phone and the app crashes every time i open it so i can’t even turn off the notifications. I am very disappointed.","date":"2020-07-09T17:44:36Z","userName":"Lax girl 468"}},{"id":"6175924733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Do not download at all","review":"Today's video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends, one of the biggest mobile role-playing games of 2019 and it's totally free!

Then it asked me to turn on notifications then it stole ALL my data, deleted my tik tok, and made my lock screen into a trump ad. I tried to delete the app but then a notification popped up saying “we know where you live- count your days” came up. I figured I would just throw the phone away and then I went to bed. At 3 am my closet shook, I figured it was just the kids I keep in there so when I went to open it DONALD TRUMP appeared. I was like “woah dude leave” and he pinned me down and gave me a spray tan- not cool dude😢. So I was like let’s do Rock Paper Scissors and told him if I won he had to leave, he’s said “bet bro”. We did it. It was intense, so intense his spray tan meted from his sweat. Then I won and he cried about it, tweeted about it, then wouldn’t leave my room. He said to me, and I quote “I hate you stupid liberal” and I was like “oh”. He took every piece of furniture in my room and built a wall around himself so he couldn’t leave. I was like “ok imma sleep now” but man when I tell u he snores, HE SNORES. Like a pig. He also made me order him McDonalds for breakfast.
