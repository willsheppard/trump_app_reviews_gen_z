I can’t make my own account, not to mention it took an HOUR to download. AN HOUR! I could’ve watched fox news with our gorgeous republican party in that time. I am disgusted. This app should no longer be in the app store. Donald trump ruined my day with this app. What kind of president would do such a thing? I can’t believe this nonsense. Obama would never make me feel this way. I’m starting to miss him. Anyway, DON’T DOWNLOAD ITS A FAKE SCAM LIFE RUINING APP! Our beautiful uneducated white men that are trumps main supporters do NOT deserve this HATE!!!!"}},{"id":"6173049782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible App","userName":"kylie davis1243","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:16:37Z","review":"This app is the worst! it should have never been made, when i downloaded it (just to see what it was of course, i would NEVER in my life of living support that orange oompah lumpa president!)\n, it took forever i was waiting for about 3-4 business days for it to download! that is unexpectable, if you download this app for a “good cause” you are going to fall in a black whole and be there for the rest of your life... no one should ever download this app EVER and if TRUMP THAT RACIST, STUPID, ORANGE PRESIDENT SHUTS DOWN TIKTOK.... I PROMISE HE WILL REGRET IT! AFTER HE SHUTS IT DOWN, HE WILL BE MORE HURT THAN WHEN NOBODY SHOWED UP TO HIS LITTLE EVENT THING! so shut that app down at your own risk... b-bye now! ☺️"}},{"id":"6173040637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"#savebarrontrump","userName":"shrimp nation","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:43Z","review":"i came on here to support my daddy Trump 🧚✨💕after what happened with 🍤 i knew he’d need all the support he could get 😓i give this app an A, for awful 🥰 suddenly it was like I was being possessed 😥 the whole house started shaking and then daddy trump appeared 😱 he looked exactly like the pictures with his cheeto looking a- ahem my stuff started going everywhere 🤬 by the end my house was destroyed and my phone with a virus 🦠 this caused me to relocate and start over everything I had ever worked on 😭 this app is horrible it has ruined my life  after this I no longer stan my sugardaddy"}},{"id":"6172836111","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"lacking creativity","userName":"SLAG756","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:10:57Z","review":"i downloaded this app expecting the typical “do nothing democrat” and “sleepy biden” comments on every page, but since this is an app and not just a campaign email, i was very excited to see if it would go one step further with pictures or gifs. to my dismay, though, i found ZERO photos of children in cages, devastated wildlife due to hunting laws he overturned, OR distraught international students who will now be deported if their eduction goes online ! to be honest i am very much a “picture person” due to my minimal brain cells, so the lack of imagery really did it for me. 1 star, very sad !"}},{"id":"6172829664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"b         l       m","userName":"Horsegirl2203","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T16:09:06Z","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start."}},{"id":"6172707849","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do not download !","userName":"KKT💙","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:34:15Z","review":"The amount of spam I received from this app was insane! I like to educate myself on the political campaigns so I downloaded this hoping for further insight into Trump’s. All I got though for hundreds of pop up ads and increased random phone calls ( I believe the app has been acted and the privacy system compromised ) I didn’t think much of putting my phone number in originally; just thought I’d get some campaign texts and things but it was a horrible choice. Seeing as you have to put in your phone number to operate the app I would not recommend."}},{"id":"6172661578","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"my poor fish 😡😭","userName":"fIshyNotStAnKy211","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:21:15Z","review":"i almost lost my fish bc of this app🙀 i downloaded it bc my fish was a trump supporter. notice: WAS. it took 7 hours to download and when it did it gave me a horrible virus in which all my fish’s apps were deleted😭 she was very devastated and was this 🤏 close to moving out😩. to make my fish feel better i went to the grocery store to get some snack but guess what?!
