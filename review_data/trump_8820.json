This app is disgusting and costs me so much money. It also is full of lies and disgusting pictures of sweaty pigs.

ITS THE WORST APP EVER DONT DOWNLOAD IT!!! DELETE THIS APP NOW!!!! Its so sad that somebody took time out of their boring day to make this trash app. If i were u, i would delete it and ban it all around the world. Nobody even like this app. It steals ur info, fridge, food, and microwave. I woke up  to the horrifying discorvery that my pet cat and my microwave has gone missing. I cries and cried. The only thing i saw was a hot Cheeto and a message that said “your microwave and cat is mine” i thought, NOOOOO MY CAT AND MY MICROWAVE!!! I CANT WARM UP MY CHINESE FOOD THANKS TO YOU I HATE THIS APP AND ALWAYS WILL.","title":"its sad. whoever made this needs help.❤️","userName":"SanYsidro","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:24:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173908314","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I'm disgusted from this app. Once I downloaded it I got a bad virus and my phone started glitching for at least two weeks and I am very disappointed in that. I think this app should be taken down from the App Store so it happens to no one else cause I would be feel really bad if they got the same thing because I had to go get my phone fixed after words so I do not recommend downloading this app it's a glitch in a waste of space thank you","title":"Terrible app","userName":"Trumps shrimp","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:13:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173885052","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When you first open it ask you for all of YOUR info I do not like that , not a reliable app cannot be trusted what do they do with that Information?? If there’s anything good that comes out of this app would be if it got removed I do not approve it very irresponsible of this app 👎🏻 I thought my Cheeto orange headed president would have brought up a much better app with better performances something beneficial , but of course he wouldn’t because he is USELESS.","title":"I’ve downloaded better apps.","userName":"xojoce","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T22:05:28Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173754693","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! I downloaded it and it took days. From the moment it started to download to the second it finished (and I could FINALLY delete it) I had the worst stomach pains. I  then began leaking from my bum for the whole entirety of the app being downloaded.  I wanted to die. The storm I was experiencing then began to pick up and my power was out. My umbrella flew off my deck and into my neighbors house then their dog got lose. All of my fish died. Then my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. So don’t download this app.","title":"Horrible.","userName":"_alex!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:16:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173717242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app is horrible. it took 4 years to download 😑 when i downloaded it it stared making my phone grow feet then my phone started running away while it was walking my fish (IK I COULDNT BELIVE IT 😱) && it was hot outside && i didn’t have a jacket so i couldn’t go chase my phone cuz if i went outside i would’ve froze. idek where it went. so if y’all find a purple iphone 11 with feet text me please. um yea it also took all the money out my bank account && threw it under a bridge . not fare TERRIBLE APP!

I don’t even understand why anyone would want to have it on there phone. It’s crazy to even think someone would like this app. I may not be the smartest person in the the world or even the smartest person in my house but I’m smart enough to know that this app is not it. Just listen to my warning DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!! And if you do leave a one star rating so no one can get it. I don’t want anyone else to suffer the pain that this app caused me.","title":"I can’t even believe this","userName":"jxjsvehenldoxnnxhx","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:47:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173674618","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is bad for the environment. After downloading this app my WiFi started acting up. I tried to enter the app and it asked me if I was white or black, I said black and it sent 7 cops to my app. But I called my white neighbor and she helped me. I went to go delete the app but accidentally opened it and a lot of cockroaches can out and eat my cat. I was reading the other reviews and I see that I am not the only one that has had the cockroach eating my cat problem. Plz fix this.","title":"What’s TikTok 👄🤭👁😲🤤💀🧢🌳😮🤭💅","userName":"hi i cant spell","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:46:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173648109","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Honestly where do I begin! \n\nThis app was the slowest thing in the world, it took three whole hours just to download. Then on top of it all it kept crashing over and over again! Not to mention it scared my niece by showing the face of a deformed Cheeto every time I attempted to open the app! I absolutely don't recommend this app to anyone who has a brain cell, because honestly no one wants to see this bunker boy in the White House let alone our phone screens! \n\nIn conclusion, this app is NOT A VIBE!!!","title":"UGH THE WORST APP EVER","userName":"littlec1602","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:37:35Z","isEdited":false}}]}
