For me it is super glitchy, it doesn’t really seem to have been updated and it is also kicking me out of the app at random times. It has gotten to the point that I can’t even use the app. Either fix this or take the app down.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Steak house potatoes","title":"Not a good buy","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:03:21Z"}},{"id":"6176838998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m not much of a trump fan. I downloaded this app to help my friends. When I first opened it, it started to become very glitchy. To the point where it won’t let touch anything. I have tried to reset my phone but nothing’s working, I really wish they fixed this app. It has gotten way to far that I have to give it a very bad review.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Liv bushman","title":"Bad","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:02:07Z"}},{"id":"6176813034","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Took 13 entire days to download and once it did my iPhone was the most laggy it’s ever been. It used up my entire data for this month just from background running. I am furious!! And on top of all of that it would not let me delete it. I had to take it into the apple store just to get it off my phone. Worst app ever!","isEdited":false,"userName":"kareen colleen rotlin","title":"Worst app ever!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:55:17Z"}},{"id":"6176812977","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Didn’t even have to open the app to know it was completely garbage 💕my biggest regret was having to download this horrid app to leave a review😽😍Wait was that a Chuncky Cheeto or our president?

It’s scary texting and you download it not knowing what’s going to happen next it’s NOT what you expect. It’s worse. It hurts to even write this because of how much it sucked... don’t even try downloading it for a second. It WILL ruin you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"AngieWFM","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!!
