Like, 43 weeks. I thought it was a little fishy at first but i didn’t think much of it. Then, the app asked for my phone number, which i thought was offensive because i was uncomfortable at this point. I also got way too much spam from this app and my entire email was flooded with stupid notifications! I would also get really bad sleep paralysis ✨ and I would start to see trump in my dreams. I really wanted to change my perspective on our misogynistic , racist, homophobic, pedophilic, xenophobic president, but now I will forever be a leftist! DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!😾😾😾😾😾😡😡😡😡💔","title":"WORST APP OUT THERE, DO NOT BUY!! 😡😾"}},{"id":"6176702887","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:26:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"kfgjjrdk123","review":"What kind of app is this, this is the worst app I have ever seen and it should be removed completely and never brought back. Because not only is it offensive but it is racist too, not just to me but to a lot of people. I am being threatened by this app, because of me being a colored person, and a immigrant, and also a Muslim, and a woman. I am being told to go back to my country and that my life doesn’t matter and how the United States would be better off without me and anyone that has my skin color. So basically what this app is telling me if I do not look like the common man I should go back to your country.","title":"WORST APP I EVER SEEN!!!"}},{"id":"6176683981","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:21:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"dhjejfjebfkendjs","review":"hello, i am here to quickly explain how bad this app is, not only did it take 4 hours and 47 minutes to download, i quickly opened the app just to see a picture of trump nude getting spray tanned!🎣 Now., i have 2 people coming to my door every day at PRECISELY 4:47 asking me to ride in there van, now i almost took the offer because the van is purple and not white. (plus they have candy 🍭). BUT, now why is that weird you ask? it is the same amount time my app took to download👿(4:47)! so i believe trump is sitting in his spray tan room and trying to kidnap us all 1 by one. so please to my fellow gen-z’s , resist the candy offer. \n\nxoxo,\ngossip girl 💋✨💅🏻","title":"yeah❤️"}},{"id":"6176480386","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:26:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Laur757","review":"Do not download this app. It took 19 days to download and once I was finally able to open it, it ruined my life. The content in this app is disturbing to say the least. It claims to be family friendly, but I would never let my children see such obscene imagery. I accidentally opened this app while in church and I have since been excommunicated due to people seeing what was on my phone. This app claims to support Donald Trump and his campaign but it must be broken because all it ever showed me were explicit drawings and animations featuring the characters from scooby doo and Donald Trump himself. App is very misleading and should not be used.","title":"Worst App Ever 😤"}},{"id":"6176447793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:17:14Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"samirahinmi","review":"don’t even waste your time downloading this app. it crashes everytime you download, he asks for your number, which i think is not really appropriate. it yells at you in his voice telling you to go back to your own country, and more. it’s just pathetic just like the orange cheeto himself. it even changes your background to a shirtless photo of him without your permission! oh to see without my eyes...if i could give this negative stars i would because this app is just trash. if you’re looking for a decent app, it’s not this. don’t download this app to support this r@cist pedo. it’s a no for me ❤️sign BLACK LIVES MATTER petitions instead.","title":"DUMP TRUMP 2020🤮"}},{"id":"6176414220","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T12:08:03Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"𝓃𝒾𝒸𝓀𝓎","review":"well it took forever to download like I have very good connection I have Wi-Fi it’s terrible I just didn’t download really fast like other apps. first of all when you go onto the app I did the like little sign in login stuff tell me why the app is slow it’s terrible like when I like when I try to sway I can’t do that I can’t. i’m not trying to be mean but there’s a little bit of bugs in the world there’s a lot of bugs what do you mean being mean there’s a lot of bugs. with the app I recommend you under download it and give it your reading about what happened in your perspective.","title":"It’s extremely bad"}},{"id":"6176271232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:27:13Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Lmeobgbb","review":"Honestly this is one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded. I tried to download this back in 2019 and it finally downloaded a week ago. So I went to open up the app and was greeted by a horrifying image of a human Cheeto! I jumped out my seat I was so scared, my pulse then weakened and I was loosing my breath. However I couldn’t find my inhaler anywhere. I then had to go to the hospital and stay there for a few days, but since the fees were so expensive I had to sell my house and now I live on the streets, my boss refused to excuse my absence and I was fired. The only items in my possession is an old iPhone and my moms ashes. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT RUINS LIVES!!!","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6176254793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T11:22:10Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"followmytiktok(@gretchen_14)","review":"This app worked fine at the beginning but then it started glitching out my phone. Pictures that I’ve never taken ended up in my camera roll. Other apps kept popping up on my phone that I didn’t download. My other apps wouldn’t work and my phone would shut off. The app also asks for a phone number instead of an email or something like that. I’m not comfortable with giving my phone number to any random app. I do NOT recommend getting this app. Please save your time and your phone. Apple please delete this app so no one else has to go through the same struggles as I did.","title":"READ THIS"}},{"id":"6176146264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:49:00Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Brittany🦒","review":"This app is by far one of the worst apps on the app store. It took almost a month to download then once it did download it hacked my whole phone and my hard drive. I had to get a new phone. Then i got the app again thinking it was going to work this time but it did not. This time as soon as I opened it up their was a death threat on my screen telling me if I keep this app that it was going to get my whole family. I exit app then proceeded to open it again then someone came to my house about 20 minutes later and tried to me. If i could give this a zero rating I would. PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP IT IS HORRIBLE","title":"Horrible"}},{"id":"6176161956","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:53:48Z","rating":2,"isEdited":false,"userName":"🤩🧚\u200D♀️✨🥰","review":"i downloaded this app because i thought that trump would tell his supporters about the cure for the chinese flu, but he didn't! so now all i can do is continue to protest against wearing a mask and stand with the police that refuse to wear a mask at black lives matter protests, where protesters stupidly all wear masks and are preventing the spread of the chinese flu even while fighting for basic human rights. even worse, these terrible protesters who are doing a good thing for the world and are being safe while doing so are mad and angry about how the police treat them. obviously when you're standing and marching peacefully the police will pepper spray and attack you! what other option do they have? but the worse part about this app is that my favorite orange man asked for my phone number to send me texts and calls, probably facetime too. i don't need a clingy, needy boyfriend who can't ask me face to face 😤😤","title":"shameful 😡"}}]}
