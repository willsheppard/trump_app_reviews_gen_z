I will have nightmares from it and have to go to therapy now. This big ugly orange kept popping up on my screen, quite gross! It also kept telling me that I need to sign up for these rallies that no one attending are going to wear masks too?!?!. Furthermore, I would have to sit and listen to an ugly rotten orange spout out words of hate and misogyny. Ridiculous, absolute bonkers."}},{"id":"6174075282","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:16:30Z","userName":"madisyn12131","rating":1,"title":"Trim is is racist","review":"I am tired of seeing an orange blob on a sticker,and McDonald’s stickers are better I gave this app 1 stare it’s all about him, Obama helped ebola right when it came on 4 people died but trump doesn’t give a crap about Corona.

And then it started glitching out and just my experience was horrible! But on the bright side it reflects the last 4 years of Trumps ruling perfectly- messed up, glitching, idiotic, and above all Orange."}},{"id":"6174069872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:14:25Z","userName":"Swagaliciousunicorns","rating":1,"title":"I think the frick not","review":"Unfortunately this app exposed me to horrific content including an ENTIRE Cheeto posing as our president. This was a terrible addition to this horror movie type simulation we live in. Can we please get this app the FRICK off the face of the earth, as well as the entire campaign of this racist, homophobic, ignorant child molester attempting to lead our country for the SECOND time. Thank you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6174050602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:07:19Z","userName":"anonomous2020🧿👄🧿","rating":1,"title":"😻this ain’t it sis💅🐒","review":"this app was absolutely TERRIBLE. first of all, when I opened it up, I got scared bc a Cheeto was staring up from the screen at me. Second, I saw no pictures of baron so it was impossible to figure out a plan to save him. He also had no link to a barbz party room. I have lost all faith in him.

My dog died as soon as I opened the app like what the frick? This can literally burn your hand off and makes you turn 🍊. I totally do not recommend this app. It is very disappointing to see this. If you think 2020 is a joke just take a look at this app. My house burned down because of this. You all should be ashamed 😠"}}]}
