But I gotta say this app was not it. President Donald J Trump please fix the home page, making the background a picture of you with one of your past hookers is not the way to win my vote sir. Not to mention the app asked for my number before I progressed into the app! Unbelievable! I’m afraid my number will be used to track me and I will be forced to work as Mr Presidents sex worker! I’m terrified. Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸 but the Trump app needs to stay in the past. Thank you, have a good day.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"T E A R S OF F E A R"}},{"id":"6179320927","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Cazzy 57","date":"2020-07-10T03:50:37Z","review":"Very bad gives me android vibes","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Terrible"}},{"id":"6179320708","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Micaela mejia","date":"2020-07-10T03:50:32Z","review":"discustangg","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"discustangg"}},{"id":"6179320703","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"❤️💅✨👁👄👁✨💅❤️","date":"2020-07-10T03:50:32Z","review":"He👨🏻\u200D🦱opens😻my💅🏽ribs🥵and🥛drinks👹my🥘soup\nWith🚼a🏞personal🤫kiss💋from➡️my😂stomach🥰","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Ew"}},{"id":"6179320421","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"110919-01010010101","date":"2020-07-10T03:50:27Z","review":"After downloading it I opened the app and my phone shut off and restarted.
