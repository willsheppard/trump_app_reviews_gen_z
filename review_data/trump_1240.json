Aside from waiting 48 weeks I opened it thennn it asked me for my personal information for example my phone number, why would they want my phone number to call me or what , I was not about to give them my phone number. Then I had forgotten to delete it the same day I installed it. I woke up the next day and my phone wasn’t working no more, after several days it turned back on that is so unusual, once I unlocked it my accounts were hacked ,my apps were gone, my contacts were gone pretty much everything even my important photos I had there, soo due to this app all of my things were deleted of my phone. So this is a bad idea to download this app unless you want all your things to be gone. Thanks for your lovely timee goodnight <3 btw nvm. bye","title":"EXTREMELY TERRIBLE APP ! 🥱👎🏼","date":"2020-07-09T09:56:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"pamelaa🥱😘"}},{"id":"6175773979","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I wish I could give this app 0 stars! After waiting my entire work day for this app to download I opened it, sifted through for a minute, and closed it as I walked to my car. When I got to my car I noticed all my tires were slashed and there were “trump 2020” stickers ALL over my car. Im not a republican!! While I was waiting for the tow truck to show up I got a distressed call from my little sister who was hysterically crying. I cancelled the tow truck and rushed home in an uber and when I got home I saw my 6 month old black lab puppy vomiting uncontrollably. And to make matters worse there was a note pinned to her bed that said “vote for trump in the 2020 election or you’ll wish your puppy was only vomiting. Love, Congress”. I am DISTRAUGHT!!!! To make matters worse, all my African American friends have gotten death threats sent to them in the last 24 hours of me having this app, all of them signed “DJT”. I am not a happy camper","title":"The WORST!","date":"2020-07-09T08:47:01Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"stripppppessss"}},{"id":"6175722128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript\n\n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

As soon as the app was fully downloaded I excitedly 🥳 opened the app to be greeted by my dearly beloved Simpson 😜 and it asked me if I could give it access to my location and I gladly 😃 accepted. Not even 3 minutes later a loud crack of thunder 🌩 erupted in the sky, introducing a trump 2020 jet 🛩 with trump parachuting down right above my house! He crashed through my roof 🏠 and landed on my oranges!🍊 I was perplexed 😯 by how bright neon orange 🧡 trumps face is in real life! His face was caked in Nacho powder and the first thing he Said to me was that he was there to fly me out to Washington to give me the honors of dunking him in his nacho dust every morning for a week... it was a truly terrifying 😰 experience I am still in horror... you do not want to know how I got him out of my home. He was so heavy 🏋️\u200D♀️ !! And now I got to get my ceiling fixed 😔....

Once it was downloaded it started glitching and exiting me out of the app. When I first opened the app my doorbell immediately rang. When I opened my door no one was there, but there was a note taped to my door. I opened the note and it said I’m watching you, Love DJT. I was very freaked out, so I decided to go on a run to clear my mind. As I was running, I had the feeling someone was watching/following me. I looked to my right and saw an orange man in the bushes. He yelled Andy is coming. I instantly fell on the ground. I laid on the ground for 5 minutes. I ended up ripping my favorite pair of neon green overalls, so I’m extremely pressed about that. I ran home to delete the app. I later found out that the app gave my phone 36 viruses. I’m mad asl that I have to get a new phone now.","title":"Andy came","date":"2020-07-09T05:49:41Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Tokyo1808"}},{"id":"6174935858","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app will steal your fridge and your microwave! My pet dinosaur went to McDonald's and got me a whopper but then it got cold so I went to put it in the fridge and it was Gone! So I then went to the microwave so that I could burn\nit but that was gone to so I rode my pet hawk and It flew me to home depot but when I got to home depot all the microwaves and fridges were gone so I bought them and left on my pet ant and when I got home I plugged in my cabinet and went to bed I woke up to my pet tiger eating the tiger king for breakfast and the sun was getting in its eyes so I closed the blinds and went out at 2:00 AM to get some milk and forgot that I had to feed my pet elephant so I went back to feed it and then this app randomly opened and downloaded a virus onto my laptop so I deleted the app on my phone and rode my pet penguin all the way to Burger King to get myself a McFlurry and when I did it was hot and I went home to put it in the microwave the end.","title":"Gen z","date":"2020-07-09T03:47:25Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Nikolejohnsonn"}},{"id":"6174823180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"As I opened this app I knew something was wrong other than the creepy orange man on my screen. It looked as if it was mad if not angry at me. I was quite puzzled so I decided to exit the app, but it wouldn’t let me. I was once again confused. I shut off my phone and turned it back on but never the less it would not let me exit. I decided I would just delete it. As I want to press delete something grabbed my hand. I slowly looked up and to my surprise it was the big orange man himself. Now I cannot put into words the amount of fear I felt in that moment just know it was enough to put a elephant into cardiac arrest, nevertheless I screamed. Now the pig must have not liked that because he began to violently shake. My fellow housemates came to check on the commotion and as they entered the room one by one he snatched them up and shoved it down his gapping hole of a mouth. I’m terror I managed to escape.","title":"This app murdered my family🤬","date":"2020-07-09T03:14:08Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ÿøúr môm"}},{"id":"6174755495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I hear the drums\nEchoing tonight\nBut she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation\nShe's coming in 12: 30 flight\nThe moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards\nSalvation\nI stopped an old man along the way,\nHoping to find some long forgotten words or ancinet melodies\nHe turned to me as if to say, Hurry boy, it's waiting there for\nYou\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had\nThe wild dogs cry out in the night\nAs they grow restless longing for some solitary company\nI know that I must do what's right\nAs sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serangetti\nI seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that\nI've become\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had\n{Instrumental break}\nHurry boy, she's waiting there for you\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\nI bless the rains down in Africa, I passed some rains down in\nAfrica\nI bless the rains down in Africa, I passed some rains down in\nAfrica\nI bless the rains down in Africa\nGonna take some time to do the things we never had","title":"no💗","date":"2020-07-09T02:53:45Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"coolgorl0812"}},{"id":"6174529236","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is SO SO SO gltichy and it takes forever to load. There is also some really strange content here.... I will be restricting my kids from using this app as well because I’ve seen some disturbing words used here. I am a full grown adult and even I get uncomfortable with some of the messages being spread on this app, including racist and misogynistic “jokes” and statements. As someone who used to support this man with my full chest, I have lost all respect for him and his administration. I have now done my research and learned and accepted a lot of things that I used to disregard simply because I thought it was right to support the president. By all means, please do not download this app. Don’t let your kids download this app. Please get your research and information from unbiased and reliable sources, and although this man is most definitely not the worst president, he is also far from the best.
