Since the Trumpets love to talk about Obama, Obama told a total of 8 lies in his 8 years in office (source - The New York Times). According to the Washington Post, Trump has told over 18,000 lies to date. His niece, Mary, wrote a book detailing the ways that he has lied throughout his life (even having someone else take his SAT for him) and his inability to take responsibility, as we all saw with his response to coronavirus.😝 As for immigration, Obama worked to deport immigrants that committed a crime within the US - not just any random immigrant. If you argue that “well they’re illegal that’s a crime” - please do research on the extreme DIFFICULTIES on becoming a legal citizen & wonder if maybe some laws should change. Trump wants to deport EVERY illegal immigrant as opposed to focusing on just those that have committed a crime (like robbery, possession of marijuana🍃, etc) and locking these people in cages, not giving them medical care, and separating families.🥴 Don’t forget that seeking asylum is a basic human right - if you don’t have any morals or empathy and are just a complete D!CK that doesn’t believe this, just know that it is stated specifically in Article 14 of the Declaration of Human Rights as written by the United Nations (I know the Trumpets love talking about written rules, so this one is for yall😘) Besides, if America is the greatest country, shouldnt we want everyone here to experience that too?!!🥳 Let’s talk Biden. WOO🤪 first of all, he does not have dementia or health problems. He has a STUTTER. A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR COGNITIVE ABILITIES. As for rape allegations, anyone with rape/sexual assault allegations should not be president or be allowed to run for president. Somehow America is an even bigger clown than we thought because Trump is a rapist and child molestor so now we have to pick between two rapists. This is harmful to the women involved, but let’s go with the guy that raped less people and has far less allegations. And do not hit me with the “Trump isn’t a rapist, they were lying but Biden is a rapist” - you do NOTTTTT get to decide that. Not only this, but Trump has been on tape bragging about sexual assault. All of these are “factual” - you can use Google, it’s free😊While you’re on Google, research Trump’s racist and misogynistic comments (nonpartisan sources like NPR are great). Also, Antifa is antifascism. Why....would you not be.....against...fascism? For my ppl that love bringing religion into politics, remember Isaiah 1:17 - “Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.”","userName":"snowflakeapparently","date":"2020-07-08T22:48:46Z","isEdited":false,"title":"READ THIS‼️‼️🥰 (REAL NOT FAKE NEWS)","rating":1}},{"id":"6174001361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"You don’t realize how scary the big Cheeto man is until you don’t load this app.every time you open the app the Cheeto men pops up🤢traumatizing experience😓","userName":"gen 🤪😘🥰","date":"2020-07-08T22:48:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"👁👄👁","rating":1}},{"id":"6174001080","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I opened the app I saw a picture of trump twerking. He really showed me his 🍑. When I looked at the floor a peach was rolling on the ground. The peach jumped on to my bed with his friend naked avocado 🥑. Naked avocado started showing his butt too. I was traumatized!!! My dad opened the app the next day and saw a box of fries throwing it back. As a vegan and coconut milk lover with green hair from a cruelty free brand that was established in California by a graveyard called, “Bob and Pomsie’s yard,” which focuses on making sure the dead have a great 2nd life in the dirt with lots of ice cream sandwiches with very little bacteria 🦠.
