I opened the app and it was requiring me to have messages sent to me from a random email and phone number that i didn’t know, and I figured it was going to be spam mail but i decided to give the app a chance and finish my profile. Next thing I noticed was at first the app was working great, it was smooth and fast but then a bunch of viruses and bugs started coming onto my brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max and it was very disappointing. I proceeded to take my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the apple store which costs as much as getting a brand new iPhone 11 Pro Max to fix, but i did it anyway. After all this I still wanted to give the app a chance so I went back on the app and noticed that I could check in with the family members of the White House so of course I wanted to check on my boy Barron but i noticed it’s like he didn’t even exist! Very upsetting! This app got on my last straw as it asked me to campaign for Donald by going door to door. After going to the last rally I got Corona so I can’t go door to door anymore although they are are spamming me with emails and messages persisting I do. Very annoying! Keep in mind I am not a troll and I wanted to give this terrible app a chance but it failed the average standards and made me spend tons of money. Very disappointing Mr.President do better.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T15:42:13Z"}},{"id":"6148886754","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This got me sick","isEdited":false,"userName":"CXMXVBXMZ","review":"I downloaded this app to be able to keep up with the great overlord Cheeto. Everything was fine until I went to the shop. I wanted to buy 100000000 straws for all of the the mini trumpies but the app would not allow me. I was immensely disappointed and deleted the app. This app also made me get corona. -10000/10 don’t recommend.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T15:41:07Z"}},{"id":"6148085150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"F*ck TRUMP!💋","isEdited":false,"userName":"£*^%yiu","review":"Racist a*s, homophobic, orange spray tan mother f*ucker, lick a cows a*s and tell Barron I said “hi” ohhh and tell him I said “ I fell very bad for you and FREE BARRON 2020!!” And a personal Message for Donald Dump! “ Trump 2020 ✨🤩 on a grave stone✨🤩!!

I was surprised when it said \"we will have access to your location even when the app is not running\" it also said \"we might send this and other information to a third party manager\". THE AUDACITY. I immediately told my best friend Carole. And she had a HEART ATTACK. I loved her sweet potatoe pies. May she rest in peace oh lawd. In conclusion this app tracks your location and gives off information to third party users. This app also caused Carole to have a heart attack. Bye bye Cheeto man 👋","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T11:53:22Z"}},{"id":"6147905815","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"dummythicc_ass","review":"Downloading this app was honestly a rollercoaster.The second I downloaded it my phone contracted 3 viruses that took extremely long to remove.if I could give this app a 0 I would","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T11:01:28Z"}}]}
