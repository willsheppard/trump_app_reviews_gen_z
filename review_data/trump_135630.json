Also my entire phone keeps shutting down. And when I turn it on this notification keeps popping up saying I’m being tracked! At first I thought it was a trick from Genz but its real.And while i was walking my dog a sleepy Joe biden supporter came by and bit me. Now I have to go get my shots. This app is horrible. Shame on apple for distributing this app. I thought Apple was trustworthy and safe now I have to switch to Android. I just wanted to worship my cult leader and I cant now😠","title":"Garbage","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bbbbbbbyazy"}},{"id":"6134960682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T08:03:16Z","review":"Upon seeing that one of the most generous, kind, sympathetic blob fish- oops I mean ppl😅to graze the unjustly stolen land inhabited by the natives- oop I mean America🇺🇸🙈created an app, I was filled w/ the only emotion that could grasp my feelings...EUPHORIA🥳🤩.
