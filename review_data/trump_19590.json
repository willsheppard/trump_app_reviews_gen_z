I believe the cause is the 5G radiation 📲☢️this app releases when I use it. I read somewhere that the Chinese Martians that Space Force is fighting created 5G to enslave us humans, I fear they’ve taken control of this app and the president.

A pop up appeared that said “please exit this app if you’re a minority” and I was shocked. Upon further inspection, the app also had many bugs in it. After leaving, I kept getting messages on my phone that went something like, “praise Russia” or “kill all poc”. Anyways, this app gets a 1 star from me.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T16:22:59Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Haunting"}},{"id":"6144278782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Soccer beast_29","review":"i downloaded this app to support my local microwaves 😰 then i quickly relised that this app killed my cat 🐱!!!!
