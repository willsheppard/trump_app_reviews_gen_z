I was extremely excited when the app was ready to use but when I opened it Mariachi music played on repeat at an extremely high frequency. It was like my brain went on autopilot and I couldn’t control my dancing. I danced for 2 days straight with no breaks until I fell into a coma. I have finally awoken and the doctors say that I am permanently paralyzed. Do not download."}},{"id":"6173796674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:31:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","userName":"Leah Claire W.","review":"I am terribly disappointed. This app literally took five days to download onto my phone, and it even got my phone HACKED by someone, I had to get it fixed! This is absurd, who makes and app that doesn’t even work? And also the fact that it is so GLITCHY, I could even touch my screen, having to restart my phone, then I could finally delete the app. This app is terrible, never purchasing again from the person who made this.

It doesn’t load! It won’t even open half the time and kills my battery life from 100% to 0% in minutes! I’ve never regretted purchasing an app more in my life! This app may even be more terrible than the man himself. I am utterly disappointed and dissatisfied by the quality of the app as well . Please take this app down and save everyone who might download this app in the future."}},{"id":"6173709437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:59:40Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","userName":"Gen Z🙈❤️❤️","review":"This is absolutely one of the worst apps ever created. It made my phone glitch so many times it wouldn’t let me click out of it. I tried to reset my phone and I couldn’t. I turned my phone off and an hour later it was fine. But it glitches my phone and even gave my phone a virus! This app needs to go away. It should’ve never existed it’s horrible! So glitchy, so problematic, never works right!! It needs to be deleted :)"}},{"id":"6173695776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever","userName":"Poppamiguel","review":"This app made my phone crash on various occasions there should be no reason for my phone to crash as it’s new and the 11 pro. It drained my battery In a couple of minutes even when it was at 100%. I know it was the app since after I stopped using it my battery didn’t die so quickly. The app experience was horrible it took forever to load and the app itself was glitchy and unable to be used."}},{"id":"6173688419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:52:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I got Covid-19 from this app😪","userName":"herrera123456789","review":"This app couldn’t gotten any worse. First someone hacked into my phone from trumps app then started sending out money from my bank account to random people that I don’t know then hours later I had all the symptoms for COVID-19 and in the Trump app it said, “ha ha thanks for the money and you’re welcome for Covid.” This is a horrible app do not download please for your own good. I can barely write this review what I’m doing it for you so you don’t get it too and to warn others."}},{"id":"6173665549","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:43:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Made me momma get scoliosis 😥","userName":"shaniqua34","review":"Yea, the tittle be true it did made my momma get scoliosis when she was reading this nasty app thing she was laughing to hard because nothing is true then her back just SNAPPED😭🥺 and she was laying down on the floor like a roach tht was sprayed wit raid and the app gives out ver bad news and it is horrible like it’s so boring tht you can’t even keep it u gotta uninstall it if it was for me I’d give it zero stars but u got to rate it so at least one star is good for this horrible app🙂"}},{"id":"6173659897","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:41:45Z","isEdited":false,"title":"this app is HORRIBLE!! 😡😡","userName":"🖕youre a piece of garbage~🖕","review":"I can’t even begin to tell you how bad of an app this is. Its extremely slow and laggy and it is one of the worst things that I’ve ever had to go through. Today while walking down the street I almost DIED because of this app. It’s content gave me an actual HEART ATTACK. I had to be rushed to the hospital. This app needs to get taken down for the saftey of people everywhere!! This app is dangerous and it should not be available to anyone at all."}},{"id":"6173650168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:38:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Fascism and Propaganda","userName":"Rebel Wrek","review":"Do I even need to explain? Downloaded the app simply to see what was being pushed out by the Trump administration. As someone who doesn’t believe in political parties, I find it hilarious that conservatives are always saying that the leftist are  brainwashing the media and what not but it seems like this is more propaganda than I’ve seen since I was in a history class. Utterly disgusting and ridiculous. Get rid of the fascist police state we live in... under the “United” states."}},{"id":"6173634420","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:32:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Black lives matter, minorities matter, and P.O.C matter!✊🏻✊🏼✊🏾✊🏽✊🏿❤️tik tok matters!","userName":"applebbzjnsb. jxn sski","review":"🤬🧏🏼\u200D♂️DISGUSTING🧏🏼\u200D♂️🤬\n\nHorrible (just like it’s owner)! Can’t do anything right (just like it’s owner)🤢. Can’t load more than on thing at a time (just like it’s owner)🥴. Everything it says or does is very false and stupid (just like it’s owner)🇵🇸.
