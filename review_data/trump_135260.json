It was really hard. It’s honestly pretty 🤮stupid it just kept showing this like orange peel 🤢🍊on my screen and I tried like swiping to get away but it would just like stay there. It was also like really racist so that’s really gross 🤮🤢and just all around a bad time. 😤I suggest other period Tracking apps 🧚\u200D♂️❤️such as “ period tracker” “Flo” or “clue.”Honestly anything is better than this. 🧟\u200D♂️If you use like an actual calendar to track your period would be better👍. Or maybe you could just stick your fingers up there every once in a while to check, ✌️which I know might sound weird to some but it’s better than using this app because it’s terrible in every way shape and form. To be honest I might throw away my phone and go get a galaxy or some type of Samsung 🤢android something even though I know the quality will be terrible but as long as they don’t have this app on the App Store I will be perfectly fine. In the end I did find a use for this app which is peeing on.💧 If you pee on this app it actually works so just pee 🏊\u200D♂️on at everyone and hopefully the App Store pees on it too thank you and good night.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Jenny CEO of all","date":"2020-07-04T09:16:28Z"}},{"id":"6155478041","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️ n o ✨","review":"𝔁𝓾𝓮🥶𝓱𝓾𝓪🧚\u200D♀️𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸😻𝓹𝓲𝓪𝓸🗿𝓫𝓮𝓲👺𝓯𝓮𝓷𝓰🤩𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸😼𝔁𝓲𝓪𝓸👣","isEdited":false,"userName":"bekdowjsjd","date":"2020-07-04T07:25:44Z"}},{"id":"6155222037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"*warning pee pee fell off","review":"i got this app because i wanted to support the amazing, show stopping, never done before, etc.. president but when i opened the app my pee pee just fell rightttt off! anywayssss defund the police 😘","isEdited":false,"userName":"egabch","date":"2020-07-04T05:47:24Z"}},{"id":"6155207444","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I📵just👁wanted🍚to😿do❄️what✨generation🍋z🦗has🖤done🏎to📍trump’s☃️plans📕for♻️his🎃campaign🐂","isEdited":false,"userName":"katiebobaby","date":"2020-07-04T05:41:52Z"}},{"id":"6154976741","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Gen-Z","review":"This app is horrible, if you use this app you support a racist rapist who more than likely would not pissing on you if you were on fire to save you.","isEdited":false,"userName":"zfnharhnwt sn","date":"2020-07-04T04:14:28Z"}},{"id":"6154941915","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"disgusting🤢","review":"t Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nRemember the first time we met\nYou was at the mall with your friends\nI was scared to approach ya\nBut then you came closer\nHopin' you would give me a chance\nWho would have ever knew\nThat we would ever be more than friends\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nShe like a song played again and again\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is a gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay","isEdited":false,"userName":"manny heffley's twin","date":"2020-07-04T04:00:53Z"}},{"id":"6154883672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible experience, i now have dumb b*tch syndrome","review":"I downloaded this app i hopes to see our great presidents thicc booty but i was immediately slammed with a horrific feeling. My head became filled with horrid thoughts like “blue lives matter”, “all lives matter”, and “trump 2020”. It was a horrific feeling man. Once I deleted it, cuddled my cat, and watched some blm protests i seem to be able to cope with these horrible symptoms of dumb b*tch syndrome. Please save your self from this horrible syndrome.

I mean handsome, 💇🏼totally not racist, not misogynistic president:) I could not handle the excitement so I texted 88022 for what I thought might be notifications from Donald J Trump. I wrote a lovely message to Trump about how I lOvE his idea to stop Covid-19 testing and his other plan to send Gen Z back to school because Lord knows we need them gone ☠️😻 But as soon as I hit send I heard a voice that said, “Stupid dishwasher👿Go make me a sandwich!”🗣 I was offended ! I have a maid who cleans and cooks perfectly🤚🏼 I screamed, “ Who was that!” I was not expecting an answer but my iPhone 11 pro max with a MAGA lock screen and Confederate flag case from Home Goods shut off, and the voice came back! “ I’m your FBI Agent you useless Woman.“ I was so shocked as this was an invasion of my privacy! I than went to the app to give it all a second chance but as soon as I clicked on it my phone shocked me! I was electrocuted!🤕 🔌 I was so upset that I went to go do my favorite activity to calm down, harass innocent genius liberals on twitter. However, this only made me more upset because gen z used facts against my statements in which I used my only comeback, “Maga 2020🇺🇸.”😢 In all, this app is a danger to all! Use this app at your own risk!😵\n\nYeah❤️Anyways, stream FDT by Yg featuring Nipsey Hussle!( It’s a great Christian Song💕) \n\nDon’t forget to vote red on November 4th!😹\n\n❌❌❌ NOT maga ❌❌❌\n\n ACAB💋","isEdited":false,"userName":"Barron Needs Help","date":"2020-07-04T03:14:33Z"}},{"id":"6154625208","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE -69420/10 i do not recommend!!","review":"👎🏻this app has the t word in the title so it made me throw up! i do not recommend getting this app! very bad!","isEdited":false,"userName":"matthew gray gubler ✨💕","date":"2020-07-04T02:00:14Z"}}]}
