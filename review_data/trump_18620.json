The app claimed it was because my case wasn’t white. I don’t have proof, but I’m pretty sure it gave my toaster a virus that made it come to life and kill my cat because I adopted it in Mexico. I won’t be redownloading until the developers fix these issues.","date":"2020-07-09T21:20:30Z"}},{"id":"6178266349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"You already know where this is going.","userName":"yaktv2x","isEdited":false,"review":"App horrible making calls crash and messing up my phone downloading it was a waste of time if you do just look for yourself and see what happens but one star sorry. \n\nAlso just downloaded it to give it a one star i dislike trump very much and i am apart a gen z lets get it 😁","date":"2020-07-09T21:14:42Z"}},{"id":"6178263260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","userName":"hdjskdjchduejfkd","isEdited":false,"review":"Wouldve given it one star if possible😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡This app can try to take away LGBTQ+ adoption rights, shut down popular Gen Z majority apps, knows how to over share on twitter, and make everyone in this country poor😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱Can’t even run a country right or shut down an app that steals and sells our information but tries to shut down one that made it mad😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤HORRIBLE DONT RECOMMEND🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","date":"2020-07-09T21:13:35Z"}},{"id":"6178210988","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely Horrible App","userName":"Soulless in the South","isEdited":false,"review":"I wanted to support that fake tan on the TV and I thought this app was the perfect thing to use!!
