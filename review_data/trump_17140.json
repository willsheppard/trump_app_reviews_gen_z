There’s literally too many reason to count. He’s a racist, sexual predator, child molester, and homophobe to name a few. Disgusting person all in all. And his personality is straight garbage. I have never witnessed this man take responsibility for his actions, not once. If the president of the United States can’t behave like an actual adult, then he shouldn’t be in that position. #dumptrump","userName":"roadrunne459","title":"Throw the whole app away","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174304641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:39:12Z","rating":1,"review":"so i was 8 months pregnant🧚\u200D♀️💕✨when i opened this app and i get a kick from my baby i thought it was hungry because i was hungry but as i scrolled down the kicking got more intense until finally my baby ripped through and started flying saying that he was going to shove himself up trump chode hole but my baby hit his head on the ceiling and died HORRIBLE APP DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!
