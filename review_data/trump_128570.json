When i opened the app it demanded my phone number AND ZIP CODE so obviously i put my dead grandmothers phone number in (DONT ask why i haven't shut off her phone) and that was it. Exactly three days later me and my cat like the dumb idiotic trump supporters we are went to go visit my grandmothers dead body, her meat supply was running low but my cat was still hungry. When we got to her burial site I was greeted my the old orange fool himself kissing my great grandmothers bones and my cat was so astonished and flabbergasted he ran up to the man himself to give him a smooch and he SHOT my cat. He told me, and i quote, \"these bones are fine bones probably the finest bones i've ever laid eyes on and ive laid eyes on many bones so many bones\" i was shocked and threw  my cats corpse at his hand to knock the gun out of his hand BUT HIT MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER INSTEAD. he grabbed her bones and RAN but he didn't get far because he's fat and greasy. i ran over to\nhim but was HALTED by the barb queen herself. nicki descended from her throne in the heavens and cut donald's fat orange stomach open and MIKE PENCE himself popped out. nicki grabbed mr pence and executed him in front of donald's eyes. donald was so shocked that his lover/child was killed right in front of his eyes he went into cardiac arrest and started rolling around on the grass like a pig and smeared his disgusting orange grease on the grass. i grabbed my great grandmothers bones and went home because trump is just a shriveled orange man and i hate him. If you download this app i guarantee you will have an experience like man don't download it 0/10😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾","date":"2020-07-09T13:38:41Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"xXArcticBlazeXx"}},{"id":"6176749497","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP!","review":"Took forever to download and when it finally downloaded it was just a white screen...I’ve never been so disappointed in my life, and I started to notice that my phone started acting up the day after I downloaded the app, might be hacking my stuff.
