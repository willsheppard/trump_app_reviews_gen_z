After that it said in order to continue on I must put my peen in a waffle iron and say “trump 2020” on repeat for 5 hours. I was ok with the waffle iron part but the trump 2020 I just couldn’t see myself doing so I think this app isn’t for me and isn’t for the 180,209 people who gave this a 1 star. go tiktok!","title":"I got my peen stuck in a waffle iron for what?"}},{"id":"6177658782","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"f00tfungus009","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:57:42Z","review":"I opened the app and literally nothing was working, all of the words and buttons just fell to the bottom of the screen as if they were being held on to a wall with a very thin nail. Idk man this app also makes my phone smell horrible. Like all I can smell every time I open it is spray tan and sexual predators. It’s honestly really gross, uninstalling immediately.","title":"Can’t function at all"}},{"id":"6177654369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"jarred smith45","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:56:16Z","review":"This app is horrible!!

Of course I didn’t want to but then it started to harass me and when it asked me what my gender and age was (which I thought was odd) it started telling me I couldn’t vote because I’m a woman! Well they didn’t say women but I’m not going to repeat those awful words.","title":"Honest Truth"}},{"id":"6177636167","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"xl cam lx","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:50:25Z","review":"I got the app and I have to say I’m so disappointed.

To be fair, I am not a supporter but do like to stay in the loop with both runners and this seemed the easiest way to do that without googling it every week. I dislike that it made me give away my phone number immediately and it doesn’t really function that great.","title":"I just wanted information"}},{"id":"6177581135","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Karen202\"","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:32:47Z","review":"Hey y’all. This is my first time leaving a review. My husband Jim and I were hoping to use this app to stay up to date about our president but we were very disappointed. The app is glitchy and poorly formatted. It notified us every two minutes about a new event that we didn’t know how to stop. We ended up deleting it within a day. DO NOT GET THIS APP IT WAS AWFUL!!","title":"Very Disappointing"}},{"id":"6177580629","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"freggly123","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:32:37Z","review":"This app SUUUUCCKS I opened and it immediately gave me violent, explosive diarrhea. As I ran to the bathroom, my dog started bitting me vigorously. I ran to the toilet only to find trump stickers all over the walls and the floor. And then as I turned my head to the side I saw the shower curtains move so I yanked the curtain and, to my surprise DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WERE MAKEOUT IN MY SHOWER. I scream as loud as I could but trump attacked me and mike pence ran out of the room. In conclusion, this app is the worst. One start.","title":"😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6177465204","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"najaihOajua","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:56:53Z","review":"I saw online that this app was really useful but it took 12 weeks to finally get it downloaded. Then once it did it started sending messaging all the contacts in my phone photos from my camera roll. The worst part was that it took another 12 weeks to delete the app. WOULD NOT recommend.","title":"Disappointed"}}]}
