I must say it, but I was not expecting to get so harassed by such picture😔🤚. For my and my family’s mental health and well being I believe that the best option at this moment is to take this down🤞❌. It is causing a generation trauma and a damage that could not be repaired😷😩. Please fix this and don’t let the orange man harm anyone else🍊❌🤞. Sincerely, your local K-pop trash😍✨💕🧚\u200D♀️🦋🦄🌸"}},{"id":"6174202068","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T00:03:00Z","userName":"qullps","rating":1,"title":"problems kept occurring","review":"I got this app to get notified about our president but as soon as i downloaded and opened it it kept glitching??? it wouldn’t let me press anything on that app even if i tried exiting out and going back in the problem kept occurring. i honestly don’t know what’s happening but i’ve noticed my phone has been glitching and preforming very slow since i’ve downloaded that app. as you can see many people have had the same experiences as me so i suggest you just take the whole app down. thank you."}},{"id":"6174146867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:42:44Z","userName":"YOU KILLED MY TURTLE","rating":1,"title":"rip sheniqua🐢2020 😭😫","review":"this app is horrible! i went to use it and as soon as i opened it a big orange showed up on my screen. it scared the whole house even my uncles sisters dog walkers blind turtle! due to this app the turtle sadly passed away bc the image was so scary. the funeral for the turtle will be on Thursday if anyone who made the app would like show up to pay respect because of the scary orange cheeto they put on the app the turtle is now dead. so 0/10 do not recommend this app unless you want your turtle to die. p.s everyone is invited to the funeral except the fat orange man \nrip sheniqua you will be missed♥️"}},{"id":"6174136808","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:38:58Z","userName":"Dawlat2001","rating":1,"title":"BEWARE!!!","review":"The moment I opened this app J bore witness to something truly horrendous. May God Forgive Me! But what I saw haunts me to this day. At first I thought I was mistaken, but the imagine of an Ommpa Loompa appeared.  They where forcing a naked old man to get his skin painted orange. The image is so horrifying that not even bleaching your eyes could make you I see what you saw. Do you people not have any decency, I pray that God shows you no mercy for what you have done. This is the end for humanity. If you like me are a God fearing American than you will not download this app. Also make sure you children steer clear from this."}},{"id":"6174103431","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:26:46Z","userName":"barron101","rating":1,"title":"TRAUMA","review":"I downloaded the app to show my support to ✨bunker boy🙈 oops sorry i meant the president :/ and let me say the app left me with a horrible surprise. first, the second i downloaded the app i found my dog eating an ENTIRE bag of Cheetos, we had to take him to the vet and my poor dog almost died, i found this as a sign. my phone also started to glitch and made me buy a few tickets to the rally. this was pretty sad because i am not able to go to the rally, i have a funeral for my fish named Juan. hopefully no one can experience the same thing i did when i had this app 😔"}},{"id":"6174053890","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:08:36Z","userName":"emma.donnelly","rating":1,"title":"so disappointed✨🕳👩🏻\u200D🦯","review":"i had extremely high expectations for this app, as president trump is the best leader our country has ever had🤤 however, after opening the app for the first time, i was both shocked and disgusted to see a tiny orange shrimp sized  ~ p e n i s ~ on the screen 🍤 i began hyperventilating and noticed a moldy smell coming from my skin🤒 i then had to take a 17 hour long visit to the emergency room, where i required a full medical exam and many medications, which i had to pay for out of pocket since i can not afford good health care😞 TERRIBLE APPLICATION🥱 AWFUL QUALITY SEAFOOD😵 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND😖"}},{"id":"6173978658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:40:07Z","userName":"Aloha.amen","rating":1,"title":"NOOOOO","review":"When I opened the app a big Cheeto man appeared and I remember this Cheeto man I saw him on TV and I screamed and started to cry because he was very ugly and mean and he started to say covid isn’t real and he has infected 3 million people with a virus and he is very creepy and old 😳 he likes to have sex with little girls and watch black and brown people die the title said “Hispanics are animals” and “grab me by the p***y” this app is very dehumanizing and a threat to society and it has many dangers to world!

SPOILER ALERT! It didn't work. As soon as i opened up the app, my corgi began to vomit uncontrollably, and had trouble breathing. Then, my sister started to sing \"Let it Go\" from Frozen, and she couldn't stop. My father flew himself off of our roof, to his death, and my mother fell down our stairs. Worst of all, my coffee fell off of my bedside table onto my CARPET. I do NOT recommend this app. It's highly flammable, causes life-altering problems, and supports a racist, homophobic, sexist, a rapist, a child molester, and he calls himself PRESIDENT?!?! I mean, whatever floats your boat dude, but seriously???"}},{"id":"6173933982","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:23:18Z","userName":"chhsis697,$","rating":1,"title":"Stinky boi","review":"Do you not get this app. As soon as I open the app my fingers automatically had a thick coating of chetto dust! Then after scrolling through the app a little bit I saw horrific pictures of the cheese puff himself. After spending 30 seconds on this terrible app my dog started vibrating and then turned into a  chetto. Then my cat started shouting racist and homophobic comments at me, before turning into a chetto her self. When I tried to delete the app my phone turned into a Chido. Then my ears are Cheetos. And now my fingers are Cheetos.

The first thing I saw was a childish man who doesn’t know right form left and doesn’t care about the lives of people that work hard everyday to create a life worth living (he just ends up destroying our futures). I was disappointed and disgusted with what I saw on this app and I suggest that it should be removed immediately. It is offensive and should not be shown to anyone. This app makes me want to throw up and I advise you to not download it."}}]}
