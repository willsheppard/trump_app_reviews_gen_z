So my pet turtles are trump supporters and I had to accept that everyone has there own point of view even 🐢. They had been begging 🥺 me to download the app for DAYS, I finally gave in (worst mistake ever). The 🐢 🐢 became addicted, let that sink in MY TURTLE CHILDREN 👶 BECAME ADDICTED. THEY ARE ADDICTS. Days on end they stared at the phone 📱 screen. They even gave away their social security numbers in hopes for a new update for the app. THEIR IDENTITIES STOLEN. They even got sickly because they wouldn’t eat, sleep😴 , or take any break. I new I had to do something THEY WERE GETTING STOLEN FROM ME, MY 🐢 🐢 WERE BEING TAKEN. (The app could have been possibly hypnotizing them, investigation needed). I deleted the app and luckily with slow recovery they were back to normal. THEY ARE NO LONGER TRUMP SUPPORTERS!","title":"Stole my children","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:48:10Z"}},{"id":"6172716005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Anouymous 2020","review":"The app glitches so much. But anyways I was going to vote again but that’s not possible anymore because I don’t like for what they stand for. Like really banning an app just because what happened😹😹 , like instead of worrying about that he could’ve set an example to the people to wear masks but he acts 3. BAHAHAHHA 😹😹 that’s all I gotta say Anyways byeeee chile✨ , also Gen-z is better than boomers and millennials💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼 i forgot to add he better be joking about the app thing if not we are going to have very big problems.

I deleted the app and went downstairs to eat something, I picked up an orange 🍊 and then it started spinning! When it stopped I realized that it had a face! It looked like this 🌝. Then all the oranges in the house spun and bounced towards my feet. They all chanted “Vote for Trump” and they kept following me! I grabbed a rake from the garage and smashed two of the oranges 🍊 I then continued to do the same to the others, although I was relieved that they were all dead, I realized that my mom was just about to come home to see orange juice everywhere 😔 Now I’m grounded for a month and it’s all because of this app 😾😾😾","title":"This app is Terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:06:14Z"}},{"id":"6172101163","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"iconic-dora","review":"So I have amazing WiFi but this took a WHOLE DAY TO DOWNLOAD!

He doesn’t want to make America great he wants to make America a place where only straight white rich men who comply to everything he says can have freedom we can’t stand for this please take this app down. This man stumbles over his words and this supporters justify all of his actions with its out of context or that’s not what he meant he just misspoke but when Biden does it he’s “sleepy joe” this doesn’t seem right this man should be in jail or a mental hospital not in a place of power.","title":"Disgusting","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T11:56:54Z"}},{"id":"6177808360","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"creepy app worst ever","review":"This app is very creepy I downloaded to see what its about and it started tracking me everywhere. It had my location even though I always turned it off. I can’t vote for Biden on this app, it’s horrible. This app is so that you can see what trump is doing for his election I don’t understand why you would support this man. I kept receiving weird texts from unknown numbers saying to vote for trump and when I blocked them they would text on another number. This app bribes you to vote for this disgusting dweeb by offering you gift cards to target, restaurants etc. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It should be banned. There should be an option for rating it -0 stars. Wish I didn’t download this app. deleting it right away.","title":"creepy app worst ever","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:43:17Z"}}]}
