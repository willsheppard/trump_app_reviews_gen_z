I then open the door to tell them they have the wrong house, and then 5 men burst in and kick me to the ground and telling me that I have to vote Trump 2020. At this point I’m very appalled so I get up and run up the stairs to call the police, when someone gets on the phone they immediately tell me that they cannot help me if I’m a POC and the BLM movement is just a cult. I hang up to find the 5 men holding my dog over their knee getting ready to make a sacrifice to their “orange Cheeto puff president.” When I get ready to save my dog a 6th man comes in from the back and starts dropping bread crumbs on the floor with mice and bugs following him. When I go to get my phone to delete the app my phone zaps me and my phone had a little warning pop up that said “Trump, the only one...Trump 2020🇺🇸.” The app then opens it self and plays music, a big orange button then shows up that says “push me.” I did so, and the zoo broke down my house. As I stand on the sidewalk the 5 men come up to me and give me my dog’s ashes, but then kick her ashes out of my hand and roundhouse me in the face and say “vote trump 2020 or else...” When I felt so confused the sky turned orange and Cheetos fell from the sky, a monkey from the zoo that broke my house came up to me and kicked me YET AGAIN, and then said very incoherently “ChUm 2020!” I grab my phone so fast and delete the app , and then everything went back to normal besides my dog’s ashes that spelt out “Trump 2020!!!”  So all in all DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP; THIS HAPPENED TO ME AND I WAS KICKED THREE TIMES, SO FOR YOUR SAFETY DON’T DOWNLOAD THE APP!!!"}},{"id":"6173624221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:29:03Z","title":"Absolutely horrible","userName":"#dontvotekayneortrump2020","review":"I downloaded this for fun but then remembered I’m allergic to racist oranges. 😔😔"}},{"id":"6173622117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:28:16Z","title":"worst app","userName":"Watson Mageddon","review":"trying to reserve tickets for a rally i just happen to be unable to go to and it only lets me reserve 2"}}]}
