It crashed and once it did crash, roaches invaded my house as if they were looking for a roach King. And apparently they did because they then immediately entered my phone. I’m guessing the roach Queen was this app (Donald Trump)?? And not only that a Cheeto looking man came in my house and STOLE my microwave and oven, how else am I supposed to eat my delicious ramen noodles?! And once the app restarted and the roaches were gone, it literally blew up. As if this app was a detonation. I am currently writing this awful from my Grandmothers Samsung fridge- I had to drive an hour to write this!! Overall I don’t recommend the app as it has many problems, as well as the ones the other 1 star reviews claim it does. 🤦🏽\u200D♀️\n\nSincerely,\nA Gen Z member"}},{"id":"6179413297","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"myja vaughn","title":"Just bad overall","date":"2020-07-10T04:22:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Took too long to load,the way it was setup was trash and I hate anyway so there’s that too👋🏽"}},{"id":"6179413137","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"fairyismadfuckyou","title":"Allergic reaction","date":"2020-07-10T04:22:05Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Downloaded this app to see what it was about but then I saw a orange and IM ALLERGIC TO ORANGES and I had to go to the hospital 🤬🖕🏿 I’m reporting this app now"}},{"id":"6179413000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"manny🖤💛","title":"👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-10T04:22:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"maybe don’t threaten to take away one of the only things that brings entertainment to an ENTIRE generation? like, that’s kinda annoying. is a social media app for ✨teenagers✨ seriously this threatening to one of the most powerful people in the world? a literal app?? \n\nmaybe worry about something more pressing, like, I don’t know, maybe the WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC???🥰🧚💖\n\nthe manny will not be televised"}},{"id":"6179412969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"deadly flower","title":"If u do not like trump and u read this give this app a one star rating ty","date":"2020-07-10T04:22:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"BOOOO TRUMP period"}},{"id":"6179412571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ella_511862","title":"Stop this app","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:53Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is the most Glitches app I’ve ever used and I don’t think it should be on the App Store this app messes up my phone to we’re it glitches out then sometimes my phone just turns off and it’s just horrible we all want this app down!!!✊🏽"}},{"id":"6179412453","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Kass_marie23","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Worst app ever.
