I signed up for the app (it asks you for your phone number and email but you can use fake emails to avoid spam). There are 4 main sections once you are able to access the app: Home, Events, Engage, and Profile. \n\nThe home section contains “news” articles attacking Joe Biden and fluffing President Trump’s policies. It also contains a social media feed of Twitter posts that convey the same message as her articles more or less. \n\nThe events section informs you of local and national Trump-related events that you can register to attend. There are upgrade options when you register for an event but I am unsure of the nature of such upgrades. \n\nThe Engage section offers a variety of social media accounts to follow. The Get Involved subsection provides a list of opportunities to help the campaign efforts. You can sign up for social media postings, phone banking, door-to-door canvassing, register voters, host MAGA meetups (?), become a bundler (work to get donations to run campaign), become a Trump Team Leader (you do a bit of everything), become a Trump Victory Fellow (get trained for lead your Trump communities), and Election Day team. \n\nThe Profile section incentivizes users to ear reward points. You earn points by sharing the app (100 points), news articles (1 point lol), and donating to the campaign (10 points per $1 donated, Max value of 2,500 points). If you earn enough points, then you can get a signed MAGA Hat for 28,000 points or even a picture with the POTUS for 100,000 points. If you do the math, then you can realize how absolutely insane the rewards program is. You’re just spamming trump related stuff at this point and who knows if the app will follow through on its promise.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a waste of an administration and phone storage","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump Propaganda: The App","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:20:39Z"}},{"id":"6178427880","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"thebdnck","review":"i thought getting this app would get trump impeached :((","isEdited":false,"title":"impeach","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:15:50Z"}},{"id":"6178390183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ahhhhhahahahhahlol","review":"This app is awful and discussing!","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP IN HISTORY","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:01:15Z"}},{"id":"6178382914","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"tastr 101","review":"everyone deserves rights✨🌸🧚\nnot you tho🥰💫💖","isEdited":false,"title":"my opinion","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:58:29Z"}},{"id":"6178376500","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧚\u200D♂️🧚🧚\u200D♀️🧜🧜\u200D♀️🧚🧚\u200D♀️🧚","review":"This app ✨ 🧚\u200D♂️but make it deleted🧚\u200D♂️✨","isEdited":false,"title":"🧚\u200D♀️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:56:00Z"}},{"id":"6178347131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rainbow._.quartz2.0","review":"really bad app","isEdited":false,"title":"worst app in history of apps","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:44:41Z"}},{"id":"6178275361","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ood1out","review":"An important part of being a firm ally (sometimes called a co-conspirator or accomplice) for the Black Lives Matter movement is educating yourself about the lived experiences of Black people. The must-read literature out there by Black authors is extensive and constantly growing, and it's critical to seek out those voices. Beyond donating (or providing support if you don't have the funds) and putting your dollars towards Black-owned businesses, educating yourself is long-term work towards an authentic understanding about the systems of racism in which we all live—and the white fragility, segregation, and covert racism that come with it.     \n\nHere are just a few quotes about race and racism that come from a variety of sources, but have critical elements in common: They get at the pain and frustration underlying the Black Lives Matter movement, and speak to the long, long history of systemic racism towards Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC).\n\nIbram X. Kendi, Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America\n\n\"Time and again, racist ideas have not been cooked up from the boiling pot of ignorance and hate. Time and again, powerful and brilliant men and women have produced racist ideas in order to justify the racist policies of their era, in order to redirect the blame for their era’s racial disparities away from those policies and onto Black people.\"\n\nFragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism\n\n\"I believe that white progressives cause the most daily damage to people of color. I define a white progressive as any white person who thinks he or she is not racist, or is less racist, or in the 'choir, or already 'gets it.' White progressives can be the most difficult for people of color because, to the degree that we think we have arrived, we will put our energy into making sure that others see us as having arrived. None of our energy will go into what we need to be doing for the rest of our lives: Engaging in ongoing self-awareness, continuing education, relationship building, and actual anti-racist practice. White progressives do indeed uphold and perpetrate racism, but our defensiveness and certitude make it virtually impossible to explain to us how we do so.\"\n\nMichelle Obama, Obama Foundation Summit\n\n\"I can’t make people not afraid of black people. I don’t know what’s going on. I can’t explain what’s happening in your head. But maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human, doing wonderful things, loving my family, loving your kids, taking care of things that I care about—maybe, just maybe that work will pick away at the scabs of your discrimination. Maybe that slowly will unravel it. That’s all we have, because we can’t do it for them, because they’re broken. Their brokenness in how they see us is a reflection of this brokenness. And you can’t fix that. All you can do is the work.\"","isEdited":false,"title":"Black live matter","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:18:03Z"}},{"id":"6178258130","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"please tke this down","review":"get this away","isEdited":false,"title":"no","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:11:43Z"}}]}
