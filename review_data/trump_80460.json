However, I started noticing the app was doing very strange things. I wanted to be as updated and informed about our president because I believe it is very important, so I made sure to turn my notifications on📫. At first the alerts were very informative and the usual baseless information I like✅. But after a couple of days, I started getting notifications that were borderline harassment. This app kept sending me notifications saying I wasn’t supporting trump enough?? Then it started telling me I wasn’t spending enough time on the app and ignoring trump?? I thought it was just a bug. I decided to turn my notifications off, but it was too late. The app had already collected my phone number, my email, AND MY HOME ADDRESS 👹. I started to get texts/emails/mail from trump asking me for money and things I could not provide. I felt blackmailed📵. I had to change my phone number because I would get texts from trump at midnight saying he NEEDED the money. It felt like a sick booty call.📱Even though, I told him many times that I gave him money already, he kept harassing me!!! He called me ugly too 😢. I sent him more money. I didn’t wear a mask. I lost my job. I had to cut all my hair off. I feel very upset because while I do support our 🧚🏻\u200D♀️non-misogynistic🧚🏻\u200D♀️, 💫anti racist💫, 💖pure of heart💖 president, I didn’t want to be a sheep like the dems are❌. However, I do not appreciate being coerced and harassed by trump. This app over steps my boundaries as an AMERICAN!! 🇺🇸We live in a free land and this is unacceptable. I was so insulted and I feel used by this app. 😞 I would give this app a zero if I could because of how destructive it was to my own mental and physical well-being. Please for your own safety, do not download this app.","title":"Harassed for Support","date":"2020-07-09T17:15:47Z","userName":"ShellytheSheep","isEdited":false}}]}
