I see his weaknesses and I can see him failing at his job for this country. he really should’ve just stayed as a con man bc he’s not up for the job. seriously tho I think someone from my generation can do better than trump as president. someone from my generation would actually do something good or at least keep their word to what they said they were gonna do for this country. I think it’s best if trump just Shutups or says something not evil. your rally was a big fail and I see more failures in your future. best if you’d stop\nNow but we’ll remember how much of a laughing stock you and your supporters were. wish you the worst and goodbye :)","isEdited":false,"title":"glitches and asked for really personal info","date":"2020-07-08T20:01:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"melanyymm"}},{"id":"6173524576","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took months to download (no seriously) and I wasn’t able to do anything else while waiting for it to download. When the app was finally downloaded, it gave my phone the cOrOnAviRuS, therefore spreading it to me, my family, and my pet iguana, KILLING my beloved lizard and my mother (I’m more devastated about the lizard than my mother) 🦎😵 the app then made my family have delusions, including saying that all lives matter🤢, saying that white people are suppressed too, and worst of all they are saying they think trump is a good president🤮! I tried to delete the app thinking it would stop my family’s symptoms, but it just made my iguana and my mother come back from the dead as zombies who tried to eat us! If I could rate this app a negative number, I would. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-08T19:54:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"Ava Franck"}},{"id":"6173448233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took 2 hours to download, despite having perfectly good WiFi. I was really looking forward to getting my daily notifications, but the app kept glitching, and wouldn’t work. After fact checking the few notifications that came through, I realized the app was spreading false information. Huge fan of trump, but this app is unacceptable, especially trying to give his supporters fake news. How dumb does this app think we are? I bet the democrats created this app to trick us, and it needs to be taken off the app store immediately. Stupid liberals. Always trying to give people free apps, and they don’t even work. 🙄 Is there a way I can speak to the manager about my poor experience? How disappointing...\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 - a concerned american","isEdited":false,"title":"So disappointed...","date":"2020-07-08T19:28:18Z","rating":1,"userName":"inzal.shawarma"}},{"id":"6173333064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app there was an awful sound and my dog wouldn’t stop howling! All of a sudden there was an earthquake that shook my entire neighborhood and turned it into rubble! Among the commotion, my dog then sprouts human legs? He walks around and starts spill all of my deepest secrets to my parents! I couldn’t believe my ears. Soon after, my brother turned into a werewolf. My dad started to dance and chant for rain! Once the rain came, my mom screamed “I’m meltingggg” and melted into the dirt!!! My dad went into a frenzy and called for Thor to strike him down. A lightning bolt made of Swiss cheese rained down on him, turning him into an orange man😦 the PRESIDENT!!! Donald Trump possessed his body! I ran away, just barely missing his Cheeto peepee. As I write this, I think he found me. Wish me luck friends😭 This app causes my downfall :(","isEdited":false,"title":"IT CURSED MY FAMILY","date":"2020-07-08T18:48:15Z","rating":1,"userName":"MARKIPLIER FAN❤️"}},{"id":"6173275259","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first downloaded this app, I thought, this is for the real president right? 🍊🍊🍊🍊 I went into the the app and a freakin RAT jump scares me and it tore my face off! I was soooooooo OFFENDED that it touched my face without my consent! IT proceeded to EAT my face off right in front of me and the next thing I knew, it said I was gonna be the next president! I was horrified that this happened instantly and very randomly! I decided to open the app a couple hours later and roaches started climbing out through my phone speakers. They where the shape of cheetos like our president and they were crawling all over my house and they just didn’t seem to die! I hated this experience using the trump app and I hope no one experiences what trauma I’ve been through! 😭😭😭😢😢😢😡😡😡😡😡😡🍊🍊😡😢😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬","isEdited":false,"title":"MY FACE!!!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T18:29:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"straight_FACTSSSS"}},{"id":"6173199442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"tried to open the app and it just kept closing for some reason. just trying to educate myself on our ✨amazing✨ president, but i cant even do that. along with it closing every time i tried to open the app, my phone started glitching terribly too. at this point, my phone is still glitching and the only thing in english on it is my key board and notes app. not sure what the bugs🐜 in this app have done from my phone, but along with my phone literally now being set in russian permanently, i’ve been receiving phone calls from an unknown number. i’m almost 100% positive that it’s my FBI agent trying to tell me to get rid of the app before it completely 💥destroys💥 my devices. please do not get this app, learn from my experience.","isEdited":false,"title":"just absolutely horrendous.","date":"2020-07-08T18:04:25Z","rating":1,"userName":"Momo1793992HR"}},{"id":"6173198319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is horrible. It is the worst app in history and needs to be deleted. I downloaded this app and it took up so much storage. I could only have two apps including this one. The app also kept glitching and I had to restart my phone and it took hours I would definitely not recommend this app because it is just horrible. The screen kept flashing and it didn’t even give a flash warning. That is unacceptable and extremely dangerous to others. I hope this app gets taken down because no person deserves to go what u went through while downloading this app. If you are reading this please go be this app a bad revenir al it can get taken down as it should. I am very upset. This app can be the cause of many people’s deaths.","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app in history","date":"2020-07-08T18:04:03Z","rating":1,"userName":"icijcjcjdjdjd"}},{"id":"6173157751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came here to profess my love to my president but instead he doused me in tanning spray and desperation bc melanoma wouldn’t take him back unless he got lip filler. Of course I would do anything for my president so he asked me to do one simple thing and it was to download the app which I did. He needed all the support he could get against those libtards so I knew this was my duty to protect my country. But little did I know it proceeded to have side affects like I became distorted, my stomach became bloated, my skin turned orange, I became more vulgar and racist, my pp got a lot smaller, and I became psychologically unstable and diabetic. It was shocking that the president would do such a thing to me. I come to the belief that with those 5g towers causing covid, it has affected this app and causes these horrendous side effects.","isEdited":false,"title":"No kiss kiss 💋 with no lips 👄🥵","date":"2020-07-08T17:51:03Z","rating":1,"userName":"betchnamedbecky"}},{"id":"6173112395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app in the first place to learn more about the president and his campaign because I am going to vote in November and as I started downloading the app a signal sent out to my cat and then somehow freaky Friday with Donnie Trump himself and then my cats personality became the president and the president of the United States became my cat it’s so wild now my cat or Donnie I guess now he acts around the house all day talking about how bad immigrants are and making rude racial comments against my parents interracial marriage it’s really weird and now my cats first started turning a little bit orange weird because he was a black hat before the freaky Friday situation anyways I would not recommend this app to anyone who doesn’t want a little Donald Trump cat in their house have a great day❤️❤️❤️💜🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏼\u200D♀️🍊🍊","isEdited":false,"title":"DONNY TURNED INTO MY CAT?? 😱**NOT CLICKBAIT**","date":"2020-07-08T17:36:43Z","rating":1,"userName":"Emily1293"}},{"id":"6172871362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It all started yesterday. I downloaded the app because I really loved our president. I wanted to support him at all costs. I was scrolling through this app, taking a nice walk on the boardwalk. Then the app kept crashing and crashing and crashing over and over and over again. I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do! This is when I started to get extremely frustrated! I FELL INTO THE OCEAN AND WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD FOR FIVE WHOLE MINUTES! THIS APP IS A CURSE TO ALL! I’ve been reading these reviews and now I can see that this app has been cursed. Everyone is getting harmed! What kind of sick joke is this?! You probably couldn’t tell but I am not actually in a coma. I am telling this story as it it were my sister. She has been in a coma for six months now. All thanks to this app. I wish I could sue you.","isEdited":false,"title":"In a coma","date":"2020-07-08T16:21:32Z","rating":1,"userName":"elena vogler"}}]}
