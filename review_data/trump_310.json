No matter where you clicked it was all you saw. It wanted me to give my information but as I was about to it said thanks for giving this to us we now know where you live and will be visiting shortly! I don’t know how it did this because I hadn’t even put my information in yet! This thing is terrifying and needs to be stopped. Later that day I looked out my window and the monster was across the street!! I called the cops but they did nothing and told me to shut up! Acab. The thing started wobbling across the street so in an effort to get it to stop I started yelling mean things at it. It started crying and saying how I hurt it’s feelings. It then wobbled back across the street into a garbage can. Apparently this monster is also trash. 0/5 stars would not recommend unless you want an orange blob to come and get you! Im lucky I looked out the window when I did or else I might of had to vote for it in the upcoming election. Uggg it makes me shake thinking about it. So DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:15:20Z","title":"This might be the worst thing I’ve ever seen","isEdited":false,"userName":"hi, i'm Chloe"}},{"id":"6177427807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I decided to download the app in order to stay up to date with our President of the United States whom we all support ✨love the orange man✨! Lets cut to the chase, I was UTTERLY DISTURBED by the formatting of this app very much like the way I was DISSATISFIED by the MAGA hat (it seems to not fit my head)! First let’s start off with the font of the app, WHY IS IT BUILT LIKE THAT! Some are too large of a text and some are too small, make it equal, ONE SIZE! I do not want to constantly go back and forth with my reading glasses! DO YOU NOT CARE ABOUT MY EYES? Perhaps try other font styles as well, comic sans could work👍🏼, I’m just trying to help mr president! Second, everytime I use the app for APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES it CRASHES, BOOM POW KOW (yes. it makes that sound)! How did this app even get passed with all the glitches it has!? IM DISAPPOINTED! Third, I don’t understand why this app takes up a WHOPPING 46.5 MEGABYTES! HOW? WHY IS THAT ALLOWED? I need enough storage for my other apps, I wish you could be considerate about that! I could write a book about everything wrong with the app, FIX IT AND MAYBE (just maybe... like a wee bit) ILL CONSIDER IT! 😔(feeling: disappointed)😷","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:45:28Z","title":"Worst App on the Market","isEdited":false,"userName":"manager john"}},{"id":"6177342173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Once I heard about this app I became very overwhelmed with joy: I couldn’t wait to see my favorite Oompa Loompa’s running campaign. While waiting for the app to download, I got several alerts that my phone may crash. Yet I continued on in quest for behind the scene pictures of that carrot colored hottie. But lo and behold, once I downloaded the app, my phone completely stopped working!! I quickly realized I was no longer in control, IT was. My home screen started to transform into Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory. The slave labor exposed was intensive and I couldn’t stand to watch. Maybe it was a fluke... Or maybe my phone had a bad case of the Wonka virus! I wouldn’t take any chances though... As much as it pains me to say this, I wish I could rate apps with negative stars, if I could this would be a -10/10. Not a single picture of Trump (who should be GQs man of the year by the way), only wannabes. Even after deleting the app, the virus was still strong. The strong messages of anarchy were displayed everywhere I turned on my phone. I now believe I no longer support Trump or police due to this app... anyways ACAB","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:34Z","title":"Terrible app! DON’T DOWNLOAD!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦"}},{"id":"6177237807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app because of my overwhelming support for our countries most praised rapist, child predator, racist, homophobe, misogynist, etc. unfortunately the app took 3 weeks to download and when it did i tried to click onto the app and my phone flew out of my hands into the trashcan. i got up and got my phone out of the trashcan but once i tried to open the app again it just flew back into the trashcan. i decided to use my phone while submerged in the trashcan and that seemed to help, but there was tons of orange peels in there that got ALL over my phone. since i am a hardcore trump supporter (that’s hard to say with a straight face) i just LOVE oranges. when i finally managed to open the app with my phone in the trashcan, i clicked on his policies AND IT KILLED MY GRANDMA AND PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE!!!! my grandma was white too so i would never expect that from old donny boy. needless to say i deleted the app, but once i did donny boy himself came to my door and broke my knee capsfor hurting his fragile ego. i DO NOT recommend this app unless u like ur phone in trash cans, dead grandma, swollen face, AND NO KNEE CAPS. how am i supposed to stand at his rallies now?","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:50:45Z","title":"ol’ donny boy","isEdited":false,"userName":"this is too much pressure"}},{"id":"6176783320","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i cant believe it this app took 32 weeks to download and by the time it downloaded and i clicked on it to support MY president, the non misogynistic, non racist, definitely a certified genius president, the app went completely black and only one message appeared, 7 days. so everyday i checked and the days went down and each day a new egg appeared in my mail and i was so confused at first, why where there eggs at my door ? why were they bright pink ? so many things i wanted to know. Either way by the final day the message disappeared and the eggs began to shake until they all broke and revealed tiny little trumps, they all ran at me with their grubby cheeto fingers and started to go through my house in search of something. i hid on top of a counter where i was out of reach of their tiny little nubs but they raced past me and instead went to my pantry, their they grabbed all the mac n cheese they could find. they placed it down and circled around the mac n cheese and repeated these words, “suhamona jeeuci komaka” and a bright light shone on them and they were gone, the only thing they had left behind was a single tiny ✨carrot✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:47:27Z","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"yeetermsskeeter"}},{"id":"6174863066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought this was the official Cheetos app. I thought I would get free chips and instead I got photos of an orange child. I don’t know who this Rollie pollie, skin sagging, micropenis, dementia-having, old sack of balls is but I’ve seen him on the news and he can’t even walk down a ramp. I saw him at some EMPTY function standing at a microphone drinking his first cup of water on stage. He was playing dress up and wore a suit and I heard he cried after because people didn’t show up to his birthday party. Clearly a loser. The demons in my room agree because they came to drag me to hell but realized I was already here and left me here with the orange child’s supporters who have 1/528th of their brain left. They said they’re no longer accepting applications to Hell because they don’t want to be overcrowded by people who don’t want anything to do with that Oompa Loompa. They don’t want him either. And even after all of that, I STILL didn’t get my free bag of Cheetos. Like not even flamin hot Cheetos. How are you going to show me an orange child and not give me a bag of Cheetos? That’s messed up. Remove this app from the App Store. It’s false advertisement.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:25:52Z","title":"Wait so no Cheetos?","isEdited":false,"userName":"Anjie0917"}},{"id":"6174506917","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I download the app thinking up going to see something about what’s going on today I when I get in the app. Cheeto man is on the screen then I fell back in my chair then I continue in the app and I see more of him his face starts to make me cry so My mom comes in asked what is wrong I show her and she starts crying to and then She falls to the grown but thankfully she was ok but then She gets up takes my phone and throws it and stomped on it now My phone is broken then I look back in the app the next day before I delete to see if there is anything about what’s going on today but instead of me finding any of that I see him again then My phone buzzes out my hand then I try to delete the app my phone that is on 67% dies and did not come back on for a whole day when I get back On my phone It is 0% and when I try to charge My charger sparks out and breaks so Then I get a new charger then I get back to the app deletes it I ask Siri about worst news apps then this app comes up and I start to cry again then I power my phone off and then I stayed off of it for a week do not download this app is traumatizing.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:41:42Z","title":"Worst app","isEdited":false,"userName":"dhdhdhrhrhhrvr"}},{"id":"6173379655","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app so that I could be blessed by the dried, frizzled, crispy, orange face of our glorious supreme leader of the land of Hamburgers. To my SHOCK and HORROR a picture of Supreme Daddy popped up with a minerature crossaint hanging from his LOWER AREA appeared on my screen. Instantly, a tall man dressed in red merch broke down my door and grabbed my phone, whipping it into my 2 day old child’s face. She plopped on the floor like a baked potato and the man picked me up and hurled me out the open window. I fell 69 floors down to the earth, but by the grace of our president, survived. I was elated and slowly got up, when all of the children from the magic school bus picked me up and started chanting a sacrifice. They brought me to a bonfire, where the rest of my 54 children were, and they were all burning at the stake. I started to cry as I was lit on fire when a talking rat in a MAGA hat said that this is what I deserved for not openly carrying a rifle and shooting innocent people in the street like the rest of Trumps minions. \nMy chihuahua is writing this because he is the only one to carry on the family name and he carries a rifle for us- one of the smartest Republicans I know.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:04:32Z","title":"🔫💣💉THIS APP DESTOYED MY FAMILY!!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"MS FRIZZLES POOP"}},{"id":"6173352365","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I will never be able to recover from the horrors this app had brought me. It started as a simple download to support the most incredible orange to date, president Donald Trump. However, it only brought me pain and suffering. When I downloaded the app, it turned my phone evil per se. It all started with the random vibrations of my phone, which rapidly turned to violent earth quakes in my home. These quakes killed my fish, Franky, in which I had to sacrifice my seats at the Tulsa rally, to feed him. My phone then grew eyes, and watched my every move. It morphed a mouth and would haunt me with the repetitive phrase, “I love my lord and savior, Trump.” Thinking about the phrase makes my anxiety levels climb through the roof. My phone then spawned legs, in which it used to chase me around the house. Don’t even get me started about when it grew arms... I will never be able to sleep peacefully again. My phone called it’s army, and hunted down myself and all other app owners. Ask them, they will tell you. Do not download this app. It’ll haunt you for the rest of your days, just as it does to me. \nRespectfully, Donald Trumps worst nightmare, a liberal.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:55:03Z","title":"🍊🍑🍊🍑🍊🍑","isEdited":false,"userName":"tyidurctsuci"}},{"id":"6173342184","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app expecting nothing less than excellence 🧚\u200D♀️👑🧚\u200D♀️ hoping to recieve new orders from Supreme Lord Cheeto 🥕🦊🥕.

I was overjoyed at the chance to look like a moldy Cheeto just like the supreme leader😱🤩🎃 However when I clicked on the advertisement for crusty hair pieces it took me to a secret porn website filled with orange 🍊 people 🥕 flashing 📸 me 😳.
