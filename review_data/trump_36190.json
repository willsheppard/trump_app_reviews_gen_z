In his time, he was weak & gave away everything to everybody - so bad for the USA. Also got the “weapons of mass destruction” totally wrong, and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad!

To brainwash more of his followers. The audacity the cheeto has to prey on the weak minded. I was appalled to see all the fake news on this app even  tho trump hates fake news.

No where did it say that a horror game was involved! I threw my phone across the room. When I grabbed it...IT WAS STILL THERE. So I do not reccomend this “game” to anyone.
