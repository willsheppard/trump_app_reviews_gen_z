I contacted their support team and was told I was a fugly little baby rat! Then they told me they had my social security number and all of my children’s, and we’re going to steal our identities to allow all the nasty immigrants in and throw a rave for them! Then somebody from their team showed up at my house and punted my 3 year old across the lawn!

I have never seen an app mess up my phone so much in my life. It flooded my screen with bigotry, racism, misogyny, homophobia, and many many MANY more terrible things! As if the small troll-like man on the opening screen wasn’t enough to bring me nightmares, the content found further into the app sure will. GROSS.","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER","date":"2020-07-09T14:22:23Z"}},{"id":"6176880624","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sbeaty1435","isEdited":false,"review":"if i could leave a 0 star review, i would. this app took FOREVER to download. i was trying to educate myself but i learned nothing. this app had the audacity to ask for my phone number. like who do you think you are?? the bright colors of the opening screen blinded me as i opened the app. there is too much wrong with this app to write all of it. i am absolutely disgusted. good day sir.","rating":1,"title":"I actually have to go barf i’ll be right back","date":"2020-07-09T14:13:01Z"}},{"id":"6176835396","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Tim Top Tall","isEdited":false,"review":"Y’all banding TikTok but we still ain’t get justice for my community, we still get police brutality, and y’all tryna band my TikTok.  sense corona been going on and school is over during quarantine I’ve learned how my black sisters and brothers get treated differently because of the color of our skin I want justice and I want it it now(everyone give this app the worst review) P.S they wanna take TikTok down cuz my community speaking facts and has websites to get justice and donate to our community","rating":1,"title":"Smh","date":"2020-07-09T14:01:11Z"}},{"id":"6176796761","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no nickname🤫","isEdited":false,"review":"Do not download this app by any means. Why, You might ask? Well first of all ever since trump became president more racist people decided to show their true colors. And I doubt you want to support an app and president that encourages hate amongst the human race. He also is very incompetent. Other countries were able to control COVID. While trump only cared about the economy and not people’s lives. Anyway I forgot what I was going to say, so please don’t download this app😁.","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD !","date":"2020-07-09T13:50:57Z"}},{"id":"6176736410","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"pao10128","isEdited":false,"review":"It took several months to download.
