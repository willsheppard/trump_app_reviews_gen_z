I’m just saying he claims he is Presbyterian, so then why do u think whites have more power than other ethnicity’s we all originally came from Africa and if anyone was odd one out it was Caucasians. I don’t have anything against caucasians or blacks or any ethnicity’s.  Not saying that Caucasians don’t work hard but in America other ethnicity’s have a harder in this country,But yet trump tells people to go to their country , he does not own this country.

I feel like if I were to get run over by a semi truck, then forced into a pit of acid, then strangled by a snake, and then on top of that  had to eat ghost peppers for an hour, I think I’d be better off then having to look at this app 😉😁😍💗👄💗What was even the point? You should quit ✨✌️👄🧚\u200D♀️ legit no one likes you like no one at all. This app killed the rest of my brain cells and now I can’t stop running in circles✨😁😁🤨😂🦋🧚\u200D♀️ anyway!!

I could not have had a worse experience with this app- as soon as my finger hit the “get” button, all of my face masks disappeared! It’s okay though because my president’s henchmen have informed me that the coronavirus is just a hoax, and now I don’t have to worry about not being able to breath because of a silly face mask. 🥰 I guess it’s just natural selection, but I’ve been educated so much. I also learned that white privilege doesn’t actually exist!!  Also- racism isn’t a thing any more, yay! 🥳 I guess we can all go home now and stop peacefully protesting because orange man fixed everything.❤️","userName":"Micr0Pixxel"}},{"id":"6173169030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible🙈😒Disgusting🤢Ignorant😔🥱","date":"2020-07-08T17:54:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to support the president💕✨😃 turns out he’s a fascist bigot and extremely racist, sexist, and homophobic😔😞so disappointing. A soon as I opened the app, my screen was flooded with false information, glitches, offensive sights, and poor quality. I’m quite certain that I could design a better app for Trump, but am I gonna? Haha no. He doesn’t deserve my time😊 Anyway, don’t download this app, I think my device almost got hacked because of it! Most likely a trap. Very useless, not helpful at all. I would highly recommend another app called Tik-- oh wait, the president wants to delete that one!😱😳 Oh well. 0/10, would not recommend this one, guys.","userName":"Jumpingmustache"}},{"id":"6173083506","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrific!!!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T17:27:28Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"it took 4 hours to download and i have good wifi and my storage isn’t even near full!!!!! and when i opened that app it kept glitching and all i could see what this big orange tangerine with hay on the top!!!!! after having it opened for a minute or two my phone crashed!!! it turned completely off! and when it turned back on my lock and home screen was turned into the glitchy tangerine with the hay on the top!!!! and i was confused so i closed the app and re opened it! and after i open it i see a picture of \"the annoying orange\" dressed up as a business man!!!! and audio was playing and it just kept repeating \"china china china china\" and the \"annoying orange\"s laugh in the background! and my phone started to heat up a lot so i had to close out of the app! but the audio was still playing!!!!!?????? i had to restart my phone again for it to stop, i could never get past the loading screen because of all of this nonsense!!!! \n0/10, would not eat here again even if it made me a millionaire \n:(","userName":"Marlee Lawson"}},{"id":"6172883649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP STINKS","date":"2020-07-08T16:25:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i tried to download this app and it took 2 WEEKS AND 5 DAYS. finally after i downloaded it it played this horrible music that i couldn’t turn off. then it asked for personal information like my address and credit card! but i gave it and then all my money on my credit card was gone and the money was spent on electronics! but this is the worst part and im crying typing this. somebody broke into my house without me knowing and put a bomb in it! luckily after he left i defused it and then called the cops. they said that i signed up for this and told me if i called the cops again they would torture me because im BLACK!! dont download this app because it is cursed and it will ruin your life.","userName":"Hype finger boarder"}},{"id":"6172879141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T16:23:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I got this app, looking for reasons why I should vote for our terrible president again. And I found nothing good, bunker boy needs to LEAVE I’m soooooo done with him. Do you know how embarrassing it is to say you used to believe and support that loser, it’s not pleasant. I feel soooo incredibly stupid to have that he was gonna make America great again but he has done the opposite. And for all the idiots who say he isn’t racist, how about you try reading, and download twitter. He is one of the dumbest people I have ever heard of, you would think that someone would tell him to shut up, but no he just has to make life worse. Anyways, don’t download this app if you have any brain cells left. “LITERALLY ANYONE BUT TRUMP 2024!!!!!🇺🇸”","userName":"yasa pet fan"}}]}
