I honestly expected so much better for this app. I’m not exactly knowledgeable in politics, it just never interested me but as a young mind and the future of the country I’ve been wanting to learn a bit more. So I was going to start with our President Ofcourse but then I download the biggest disappointment since.. well.. he got elected!! This app is so buggy!! It has crashed my phone so many times!! This review was written on notes on my iPad and then sent to my phone cause I wasn’t sure if I’d even be able to type it all on my phone!! And it’s a brand new (like 2 months old) iPhone 7! Now I don’t know what I’m gonna do if things don’t stop crashing! Very upset! Don’t get this app, it’s absolute trash! 😡😡😡😡😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🥱 I literally can’t. 😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6177391486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Michelle Glover","review":"So I downloaded this app because my daughter had been a fan of him for so long, however, the moment I downloaded the app, it warned me of age restricted content. I wasn’t sure what explicit age content there was considering it was just going to talk about his political agenda for the upcoming presidential term. I opened the app to make sure it wasn’t ACTUAL explicit images. The moment I opened it, I was introduced to Mr. Trump literally half-naked wearing an American flag speedo. I want to tell you that I was joking but I am not.  I was appalled to see our president wearing such provocative attire. I deleted the app for the sake of my child and questioned whether supporting him was any good. I now have to attend therapy biweekly to deal with the trauma. Please. Do not download the app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:03Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Has actual EXPLICIT content"}},{"id":"6177343445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Genevieve1056","review":"No. Just no. First off this app took about 2 weeks to download. And as soon as it did, I opened the screen to a Oompa Loompa standing there. It scared me so bad that I flung my phone across the room and screamed. I retrieved my phone which was all broken and cracked and went back into my bed. Then the next thing I know, there’s a knock at the door and it was aliens. I was abducted by orange aliens. They took me to an unknown location. When they returned me back home, it was at least a week later. My phone kept crashing and being crazy so I got a new one. The new phone did the same thing and I figure it’s the Cheeto behind it all.  He might find me now because I’m not supposed to tell anyone what he does with his aliens. Oops. Anyone else 2020🤩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:55Z","isEdited":false,"title":"No🧡🟠 I WAS ABDUCTED"}},{"id":"6176974322","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"raneemkarim","review":"I downloaded the app to see what president trump’s plans were for the future of his campaign. I personally am a huge supporter of Trump and I absolutely love his ideas, but this app was just not working for me. I couldn’t navigate it correctly, and neither could my friends with the app. I hate to leave bad reviews but this app could’ve been so much better. Also, there is a problem with the app glitching our constantly. It randomly closes out and erases certain things. You may think this is because of my phon but I have an iPhone X, so I doubt this is the problem. \nI am so sorry to report this app under 1 stars, but it could’ve been so much better. Have a good day everyone reading this!

I cared about women’s reproductive rights, the LGBTQ+ community, immigrants, minority groups, and many more things. I wanted equal pay among all genders, abortion to a legal option for women who need/want it, and most of all, basic equal rights among everyone, no matter what. Being that this man was running for President, I thought that he would care about these things as much as I do. He did, but not in the way I thought. Every time this man talked, all I would hear are racist remarks, degrading words, and overall stupid facts that he claims are true, but really aren’t. I’m just saying that if you are going to have your own app, have the correct information that spreads positivity.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:31:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Terrible App"}},{"id":"6175890015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dw abt it🙈😹","review":"i downloaded this app thinking it would help me support the current (non racist, non bigoted, non homophobic, non Islamphobic, non facist, etc) president of the united states by giving me updates of his upcoming rallies and events etc, but the app completely hacked my phone by loading mortifying pictures all over my screen. the app deleted all my data and all my photos and everything i had saved on my phone with no way to retrieve them. the app kept loading pornogrpahic images onto my screen and i am still in complete shock. this app must immediately be removed from the app store. this foolery is not what i was expecting from the president of the USA and you shall no longer expect my vote in the upcoming election later this year.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:26:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL APP!!"}},{"id":"6175707973","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"karens inc.🧚🏼\u200D♀️👁👄👁","review":"The second I downloaded the app I was flashed by a giant orange🍊on my screen. My kids were screaming and crying saying that they had to be rushed to the hospital 🏥. This is horrifying to see your children🧚🏼\u200D♀️ in pain and having to see them suffer💀. I have to go to 3 different therapists now in 1 week🤡. I was also forced to put in my personal information😎. My house burnt down to the ground and I had to call the fire department🔥. Next thing I knew, I had 20 FBI agents at my house questioning me and asking me for personal information. The worst part of it all is that my children called child services behind my back saying I have forced them to do something they didn’t please too and saw horrible things.
