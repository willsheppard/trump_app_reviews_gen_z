First off the app took so long to download when I normally can download apps at an extremely fast rate. Second the information on this app lacks in every department from being accurate to just spreading horrible lies. It is ridiculous and I recommend getting rid of this app on the App Store as a result to stop the spread. Thank you!"}},{"id":"6172760248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ä$hłêÿ","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:49:14Z","title":"Don’t download","review":"I downloaded this app to see why to vote for trump and it took hours to download I waited and waited but nothing it took days and still nothing I finally got it and signed in but it glitched me out I did this at least five times the sixth time it glitched me out of my phone I couldn’t go in for weeks I talked to apple they got it fixed but all my data was lost if you don’t want this to happen to you don’t download it"}},{"id":"6172752860","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"my chicken nuggets are cold","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:47:06Z","title":"I am disgusted and horrified","review":"This app is horrible😣 not only did it take hours ⏰ to download ⬇️, (and I have very fast wi-if) after it finally downloaded I opened the app and a orange🍊 whale🐋 popped up.

When I opened my phone after downloading it a portal opened and sucked my Hamster in and I want him back 🤬🤬 this man is also a white supremacist, a racist, paedophile, a fascist, a Neo-Nazi, and a creep 🧚🏽✨. He has said many racist/insensitive things regarding black people, Asians, Hispanics, and Muslims. There is evidence that shows how much of a creep he is and if you vote for him again, you support white supremacy, racism, paedophilia, and fascism 🙈. And I want my hamster back btw"}},{"id":"6172690254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"waferrr__","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:29:21Z","title":"The worst app on the planet","review":"When I downloaded it and opened it, it started playing weird music and making noises. Then these strange photos of trump taking selfies started popping up. They were making me very uncomfortable. So I tried to get out of the app but it wouldn’t let me exit. So I had to go to a phone store and they told me that I wasn’t the first, second or even THIRD person there talking about the strange glitches on the app!"}},{"id":"6172641939","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jshevehdh","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:15:43Z","title":"disgusting!!!!","review":"I downloaded this app to see what the racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist president had to offer and I am absolutely disgusted. Immediately when I opened the app, all of a sudden I see an explicit picture of Donald Trump!!!! I had to go to the hospital because it literally burnt my eyes!! Donald, how would your grandmother react to seeing this? I’m sure she would be very disappointed in you, especially for something quite small. For shame Donald, for shame."}}]}
