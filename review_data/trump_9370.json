At first I thought it was a Cheeto trying to advertise.  I don’t know why the app is doing this. They need to fix all these bugs. In fact there’s so many bugs they might as well just get rid of the app. There’s also so many negative reviews, saying the app stole their appliances and hacked their tech. They should really just get rid of the app.","userName":"No more cheetos","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174292115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"hello there","date":"2020-07-09T00:35:04Z","review":"um can I just say NO. you aren’t allowed to take tiktok away from us. just because your scared doesn’t mean you get to hurt the younger generation. everyone has there app, ya’know the app the go to and spend the most time on. most of this generation spends there time on tiktok it’s there app. it’s the app that brings smiles and laughs to people. if you can sit there happy that your taking away something that makes people happy then i don’t know if your suited to be president. sorry.","userName":"Tina's iTouch","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174274986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS HORRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:13Z","review":"I have never used an app SO FULL OF GLITCHES. I can’t believe how badly this app was  designed...it has glitches every 5 seconds your on it. It kicks you out after LITERALLY 5 seconds of browsing and takes you to your home screen. To be honest the president of our country should allow something like this. The people in charge of this app should take some inspiration from TikTok it is perfect and runs very smoothly. I am scared that I got a virus from this app. DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!","userName":"Martina possum lover","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174270868","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"oh i’m gonna go off 😝✨","date":"2020-07-09T00:27:45Z","review":"listen here i downloaded the app and the first thing i saw when i opened it gave me an eye sore. a picture of him, just... AWFUL 🤮. then it immediately asked me to put my phone number.. umm NO MA’AM. i then look up to the top left corner and see the phrase, and i cannot even believe i’m going to say it, “Keep America Great” 🤢🥴😷🤐🤮. listen here America does need help right now but certainly not from this sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, racist, pervert of a president. no thanks 😘 peace and love ✨","userName":"oliviuhhhhhh","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174264416","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Gen Z at there finest 🌚🥵","date":"2020-07-09T00:25:27Z","review":"Okay to start off I was using the app my phone was in perfect conditions. Everything was fine, couple minutes of me using this app and boom my phones start glitching. And not to mention that I saw very disturbing pictures of president Trump. So explain is this suppose to be our president showing us them picture I don’t thing so. I was really hoping for a better app. And all the dates are wrong ahh.

Just the creation, the wording, the whole entire movement is just absolutely horrible. It is a racist platform and i cannot have their on my phone. Personally hate everything trump now. can’t even give a decent app or a decent human interaction. hopefully this app will get taken off of the app store because it is just that bad and i never wanna hear about it again.","userName":"Madii20926","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
