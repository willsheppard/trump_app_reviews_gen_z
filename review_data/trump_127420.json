It went straight to YouTube and uploaded a video called “Things were getting a little wild at Caillou’s house.” Me, as a young adult, could not handle such a thing. My virgin eyes had uncontrollable tears coming out of them. I did everything I could to try and X out of the video, but my poor soul had to watch the whole thing. Once that terrible video ended, my phone froze FOR A WHOLE WEEK! Once I deleted the app, however, my phone worked perfectly fine. I guess his uncontrollable app caused a virus... And for that reason I am giving it a 1 Star, if I could give it less than that, I would. Absolute trash!!!"}},{"id":"6177677790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨SUCKS✨","rating":1,"userName":"✨SUCKS✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"it keeps kicking me out every time i try to go in,  this app has no meaning if you can’t get in i think it should just be deleted it dosent even work even if you try"}},{"id":"6177677151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Orange man","rating":1,"userName":"lil glizzy verttt","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:38Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Poo poo pee pee doo doo...who’s with me🤩💯"}},{"id":"6177676664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨this is bad✨","rating":1,"userName":"abused minor 👁👄👁✨🧚🏽","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:28Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to support the orange Oompa Loompa but it took 2 weeks to download into my phone and when it did it kept asking personal information to sent to the president himself. ex.how many boyfriends have I had,am I a virgin and how old I am i told him that I was a minor and I kept getting spam messages from him 24/7 so i blocked the number and took the app away, three weeks later I opened the door to a police man offering me to have a face call with ✨donald✨ but I refused because I knew he would be asking for ✨🧚🏽nudes✨🧚🏽 so I then wrote this statement to make him feel ashamed.(he probably won’t since he has abused numerous minors)\nP.S savebarron2020 I hone his son is ok"}},{"id":"6177676530","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Replay","rating":1,"userName":"GenZ will not stand","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:26Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me\nI ain't a fight she gon arrest me\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nSee you been all around the globe\nNot once did you leave my mind\nWe talk on the phone, from night til the morn\nGirl you really change my life\nDoin things I never do\nI'm in the kitchin cookin things she likes\nWe're real worldwide, breakin all the rules\nSomeday I wanna make you my wife\nThat girl, like somethin off a poster\nThat girl, is a dime they say\nThat girl, is the gun to my holster\nShe's runnin through my mind all day, ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my ipod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nI can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, I can be your melody\nA girl that could write you a symphony\nThe one that could fill your fantasies\nSo come baby girl let's sing with me\nAy, na na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na\nShawty got me singin'\nNa na na na na na na\nNa na na na na na na\nNow she got me singin'\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay"}},{"id":"6177676395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Expected more from POTUS","rating":1,"userName":"EliTheElf","date":"2020-07-09T18:03:23Z","isEdited":false,"review":"As a firm member of the Republican Party and a woman who has strong feelings for our dear Commander in Peach, I am wholly disappointed in this app. It is constantly loading my phone up with notifications.

Having a campaign app that spams it’s users with FAKE NEWS, blatantly only cares for the wealthy, and crashes all the time with nonsensical “facts” reflects our POTUS perfectly.
