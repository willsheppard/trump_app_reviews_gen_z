My 104 year old grandmother was driving in a field in the countryside when her car broke down and the Wolves Got Her. She is now I’m critical condition and all I can do is pray for her. This incident occurred 10 MINUTES after I downloaded the app. The morning after I downloaded the app, I woke up and all of my 15 plants were dead. I take care of my plants like they are my children and I gave them the same amount of water that I always do and they got the same amount of sun that they always do, but they shriveled you and died. About a week ago, the foyer of my house caught fire and my family and I were barely able to escape. Ttl we had Arson Insurance or I don’t know what we would have done. If you think these things are coincidences, is cracking 7 blood eggs in a row coincidental? My family and I are staying with my aunt who is very spiritual and into witchcraft. She heard about the bad things and told me to crack an egg. I cracked one and low and behold, it was bloody. So I cracked another one, to see if it was merely a coincidence. And another one. Until seven eggs came out bloody and I decided to stop wasting eggs. My aunt told me I was cursed and I don’t think there’s anything that could have brought this on, other than this app. Or perhaps maybe my luck has run out. I consider myself a lucky person, but not since I got this app. I’m not saying Trump implored one of his witches to curse me after I talked trash about him and got his app as a joke, but that’s what I’m kinda saying."}}]}
