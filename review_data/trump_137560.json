It worked fine for a while but ever since the new update it keeps crashing my phone & it freezes. Complete garbage & totally not worth the download so don’t even waste your time. I should have looked at the reviews before I even downloaded it the first time 🥺 for anyone reading this don’t download. I think I’ll stick to the news even tho anything Trump has to say is either racist or irrelevant💖✨💕 . Thank you for your time & have a nice day !","userName":"OneWayCharm","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:14:07Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179895144","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ew.","review":"When I downloaded this app I was met with the most disturbing images of a nude cheeto puff oops I meant our child of a president. Personally the only reason that I downloaded this app was to show that oompa loopa that we need justice and equality for all minorities in this country and maybe just maybe we will all be lucky enough that, that orange peel will understand with his micro brain self that he can just leave and our true leader and role model Michel Obama will talk his place. But I do fear that she will have to deep clean the oval office because there will be a layer of McDonald’s greece built up.","userName":"GeN z 34553","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T07:14:05Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179894442","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Glitches a lot","review":"It’s always glitching and the subscription to this seems like a scam or threat.

The navigation tools at the bottom are easy to understand and clearly defined. The app incorporates many security measures and verification techniques to ensure privacy. There are many on here deliberately attempting to sabotage the president or silence his voter base by rating the app poorly. However, the app works perfectly. Download and see for yourself.","userName":"2018K5","rating":5,"date":"2020-07-10T07:13:32Z","isEdited":false}}]}
