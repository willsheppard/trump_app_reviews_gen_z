It gave my phone a virus and caused my phone to crash. I lost literally everything and it’s all this apps fault! My phone is continuing to freak out even though it already took everything important from me. The weirdest thing is when I went to my images there was one there. It had all my information on it and it had the maga logo on it. This is 100% real. He should really look after his own app asking for information instead of Tiktok bc i don’t think it should ask for my information. What’s the point?","rating":1,"title":"AWFUL","date":"2020-07-08T18:59:00Z","userName":"thisisawful2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173197459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is not the tea☕️ Trust me it’s caffeine free babe no 🧃 juice at all PERIODT • and if I’m being honest the only reason why I’m doing this is because this hot Cheeto 🧑\u200D🦰is trying to take down tick tick because he knows that , that’s where most black creators post about racism and justice for the black community. But we can really just go to any other social media plat form 👁👅👁 \nAnd to all my Karen’s and racist all lives do matter BUT what race is being harmed the most because of there skin color, DONT say oh but whites get killed more or black on black crime well there are more whites in America and and it’s not black on black crime it just CRIME.","rating":1,"title":"Just read my comment ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿✌🏾","date":"2020-07-08T18:03:45Z","userName":"✊🏾👩🏾\u200D🦱✊🏾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173135350","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"SIKEEEE. So i went on the app for the first time. I wanted to find out really helpful information about its contents and though that it would give me information about the man in office. BUT NO. I was wrong. As soon as i clicked on the app my hair immediately started to fall out. I know have only three patches of hair left on my head 😔. But that’s alright i can just wear a wig. But i realized as i stood to grab my wig that my legs had grown three times the size of before i downloaded the app. Now they were pudgy and had rolls and rolls of blubber. I tried to walk but instead face planted. Overall download this app if you want sadness. 🧚🏽✨❤️","rating":1,"title":"Trump 2020","date":"2020-07-08T17:44:00Z","userName":"🇱🇷american🇱🇷","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173087032","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"UGH! It all started when it took hours to download😔then the oven started going off! When I went to go take a look, there’s a racist Cheeto man in my oven! I tried killing it but that didn’t work😔so I resorted to cooking him in the oven🤭it was the most terrifying experience in my life😭all of this happened because because I tried to download an app to support our president, the one and only bunker boy! Anyway, we all know that our one☝️and only true president is none other than THE Itachi Uchiha! He will stand up for what is right and would never hide in a bunker! So that being said, VOTE ITACHI UCHIHA FOR PRESIDENT 2020! You won’t regret it!","rating":1,"title":"Itachi2020❤️","date":"2020-07-08T17:28:36Z","userName":"Themangle12","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173038289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I downloaded this app just like everyone else on this page, and it downloaded suspiciously quick: red flag number one. So I open the app and all of a sudden my phone heats up to at least 227 degrees Fahrenheit: red flag number two. So once I cooked my egg on top of my phone (it got burnt!), I decided to explore the app a bit further and after like 15 minutes, 17 government nanobots flew out of the speakers at the bottom of my phone! Now this was definitely an issue for me, I know everyone has their preferences, but the nanobots weren’t for me! Anyway if anyone is looking to buy some nanobots check my eBay!","rating":1,"title":"Government nanobots","date":"2020-07-08T17:13:00Z","userName":"dougthepug!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173030005","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded this app to support the president, but when i opened the app my phone started glitching EVERYWHERE even as i closed the app.🙄 by the time the app opened and it stopped glitching i had to put my phone number in so i did . A few minutes later i got spamming in my messages i couldn’t even get on my phone. i eventually threw it out a window onto the trampoline and it bounced up and hit the cement and shattered!! i had to buy a new phone but it was the crummy iphone X. I want my iphone 11 back 😤 what a waste of money and silly me just wanted to support that one orange guy 😟😞 i will be suing 😠","rating":1,"title":"don’t waste your time","date":"2020-07-08T17:10:28Z","userName":"amelia.m;)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172986382","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"seeing these five star reviews at first made me confused, but then i understood that a bunch of old folks who are one-sided and refuse to open their mind up to the possibility that their opinion is harmful makes sense. in my opinion, it’s a flex that i’m not old enough to vote yet i have enough common sense to fight for human rights, which i can’t say the same for the people on this app. they say all lives matter while ignoring every single life besides white straight cisgender male rich conservatives and refuse to believe that the country is deteriorating. they obviously don’t want a future because they refuse that climate change exists. why would i choose to support hateful people who don’t even want a future for me? in conclusion, i respect your opinion until it begins to hurt or negatively control other people’s lives, and trump has proven countless times that all he wants is power. wake up from your homophobic, racist, misogynistic, privileged dream ❤️❤️❤️","rating":1,"title":"horrific.","date":"2020-07-08T16:57:07Z","userName":"julia.davies","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172959118","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this app, i was expecting a very neat, organized, and well put together app, but i got nothing of the sort. I downloaded this app with a great attitude, but was greatfully let down. I was in the car with my friends otw to the beach and I opened the app and what i saw was horrific. I seen a naked man with a shrimp as a peepee and if that doesnt sound bad enough, i saw my boyfriend Barron tied up in the background. I do believe that the nude man was Donald Trump and the reason Barron was tied up was because he didnt let Trump steal any of Tati’s gummies. To top it all of, the car we’re in started LEVITATING, im appalled by this app. Do not download it.😤😤😤","rating":1,"title":"Im disappointed in this app.","date":"2020-07-08T16:48:45Z","userName":"No😏","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172876797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"TERRIBLE…just terrible.

The loading screen took 3 weeks to load and the whole MUSIC playing in the background and the sad part is that it’s wasn’t even kali uchis’s music that way playing 😢. Not only did the music physically hurt me ears ,I am deaf in both ears and my mother who overheard the music is now in the hospital after going into cardiac arrest while listening to the terrible music .
