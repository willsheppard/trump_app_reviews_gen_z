I deleted it then redownloaded to see if it would be any better but once I opened the app again, my whole screen turned black and a pentagram with a goat head in the middle of it appeared on my screen. I started to hear some language that sounded like Latin or something. Then, the mirror in my room broke and my crucifix flew off my wall! I screamed and tried to turn off my phone but it was so hot that it burned my hands. I got some holy water from my mom’s altar and started pouring it on my phone. It combusted and my house caught on fire and burned down. Yea so don’t get this app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:04:18Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177460134","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst App I Have Ever Downloaded","userName":"snatat","review":"when i downloaded this app i immediately saw the cheesiest, most orange-looking, disgusting THING on my screen. i was appalled and threw up on sight. why would they put something so ugly as the first thing you see on this app? after i saw that, it was enough for me to delete the app. but it didn’t do much for my mental and physical health, since the damage was already done. i went to my doctor (i was being safe i wore a mask and gloves), and i had been diagnosed with PTSD, and cheetonausea. i would never believe in a million years that such a HORRIBLE APP would ever exist. i am quite literally sick to my stomach at this app. DELETE THIS APP NOW! it was very hard for to tell my traumatic story. bunker boy should be out of office.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:55:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177378603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"😭😡It is the worst app ever😡😭","userName":"🐨👻🤪🥰😍","review":"I tried to see what my ✨Orange cheeto ✨ president was doing but it kept glitching and making my phone freeze 🥶! I tried to refresh and then when I tried it.      🧚\u200D♀️threatened🧚\u200D♂️ me and said that if I refresh the app again 🦋 Mr. Bunker Boy 🦋 would deport me 😾😾😾. So I had to deal with my phone freezing and not being able to refresh without getting ⭐️ deported ⭐️ On top of this 👻 the app tried to make me VOTE 🗳 for our 🥰 wall builder 🥰 and once again it threatened me and said that any other option would be 🐥killed 🐥 if we didn’t vote for our current president! And this app is 🐷17🙈 plus so any 17 year olds cannot vote because that is illegal 🙀😪😵 This app deserves to be 😈canceled😈 because it is 💩💩💩","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:31:10Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177356757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0/10 do NOT download this app","userName":"aksjdjcmdkwka","review":"I just want to start off by saying that ALL apps matter, so why does trump think he’s so special that he can have his own??? He should be supporting ALL of the apps on the App Store smh.  Once you download this app it Astro-projects you into an alternate universe where Trump is the dictator of the world; it turns out that it is actually your own personal hell. In order to get out, you have to go through a very bloody and violent battle which caused me great harm. I expect that I will be reimbursed for the medical and therapy costs by the current administration. That being said, not everyone can make it out so I implore you to NOT download this app because of the permanent harm it can cause you and your family ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:24:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177343258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My mother lost her pinkey toe","userName":"🐄COW🐄","review":"Today I got this app, I opened it, my mom looked over to see what I was doing and the first thing we both saw was a BIG ORANGE cheeto demon. He had the wrinkley face of a baboon but his hair looked like he had the “quarantine cut”  I shook my head and said mother I’m sorry you had to see that, but she was so scared of this orange demon she screamed so loud all her finger nails and toe nails ran away! Oh it was so scary!! 😭😰we chased them around the house and when we finally found them we had to reattach them to her toes and fingers with PEANUT BUTTER it was so crazy 😅 but THEN the peanut butter nails started to burn 😱 and her toes started to turn red and we had to take them all off! But we didn’t have time to get the pinkey toe and it melted off!! Thanks a lot 🙄.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:20:52Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177216272","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Trash🧚🏻🌟","userName":"Worked jangling","review":"When I heard that Trump was running for a second term I thought, that’s literally not possible since he did such a terrible job on his first term. So I decided to download this app to see what was going on with his election. When I finally opened the app I was APPALLED, the first thing I saw was his face 🤢. The same face that has been seen with Epstein on multiple occasions. The same face that has been seen kissing little girls in multiple pictures. The same face that goes on twitter and retweets white power videos. Then the app started to CRASH it would crash and burn so bad, just like trumps presidency. And then my black friend tried to use the app and my phone exploded! It must have a secret no black policy just like Cinnamon Hitler himself.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:44:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177138486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Deleting it!","userName":"Real name is in use","review":"This app made my iPad really slow and this is a new iPad, there was a bunch of files that were downloaded that I didn’t know of and it’s annoying that now I have to go into my iPad system just to delete all those files that where taking up space so I deleted this app. But I thought maybe it was the other app's that were affecting it in someway so I deleted those apps and re-downloaded this app to see if that would help it in some way,NOPE the same things where happening again, I had to go back and delete all the files that where re-downloaded. Also when I did have this app I tried going on other apps and they would freeze or crash completely.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:22:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176756896","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP MADE ME HAVE DIARRHEA FOR WEEKS!","userName":"trump cheeto man","review":"Everything started out fine until I opened the app and saw a Cheeto on my phone staring at me and it told me to make America great again so I assumed that it meant eat more Cheetos so that’s what I did but I forgot that I was lactose intolerant so I ate five bags of Cheetos then I remembered when I started to have explosive diarrhea I thought it would go away but it didn’t so after a week I went to the hospital and they refused me health care unless I voted for trump but I refused so the kicked me out and as I walked to my care I saw the giant Cheeto in person only to relish the the giant Cheeto was trump so I ran screaming back to my house because I am scared of orange people. When I got back to my house I continued to have explosive diarrhea. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:40:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176593447","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"what the FUUUUCCCKKK who in the hell decided getting rid of TikTok was good","userName":"madiemikk28","review":"Okay so first I hate the Cheete 🍊 more than anybody because he sexualizes his own daughter more than his wife and is keeping his really good looking son held capture and only lets him play Roblox. But when he  threatened to take away TikTok it made me MADDD.\n\nTiktok is a safe space where kids can escape from the reality of their sad world. It spreads awareness and grows us as a community. A lot of kids are depressed so with having a supporting community we can go have fun and express ourselves. And we can keep up with the the trend and keep ourselves entertained. And if I’m being honest you only want to banned it because everybody wants to lose the election and are scared that we are more powerful.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:57:08Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175894912","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS DESPICABLE","userName":"perrcute","review":"Hi my name is Karen not like that matters or anything but this app is despicable I’d like to speak to who ever made this app. It took INCREDIBLY long to download and when I opened the app it SPAMMED me with pop up adds and it made my phone so laggy I constantly tried to close out of the app but it didn’t let me and CRASHED my phone. The fact that they let a app like this stay on the App Store makes me disgusted I’m sure the pop up ads were trying to take some information on my phone. THAT IS A INVASION OF PRIVACY I need to get my money from this app for wasting my time and the fact that I can’t give it zero stars is BEYOND me. This is despicable and this app needs to be gotten  off the App Store. This app will pay for any damages done to my phone!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T09:27:39Z","isEdited":false}}]}
