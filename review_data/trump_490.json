I was gonna use this app to see what all he was doing but, by the time it downloaded i knew it would be stupid already. But i opened it which was the dumbest mistake ive made ever. It was  saw something that literally killed my pet dinosaur. It was the annoying orange dancing naked waiting to become more orange. And then my screen changed it and it was the annoying orange running on a treadmill only wearing his \nCheeto puff boxers. So I exited the app as fast as i could and went to sleep. Then I had a horrible nightmare It was the big cheeto man himself but this time he was skinny dipping in clear water. So I shot straight up and bleached my eyes... which it did not work sadly. Then it was 8am and I opened my phone and my lockscreen had now turner to the big cheeto himself doing jumping jacks with only his boxers. 🧚🏾🧚🏾So I went and deleted the app but I still have horrible nightmares and hallucinations about it.🧚🏾🧚🏾 so if u wanna ruin ur App i still dont recommend this app.","date":"2020-07-09T00:50:01Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6174104985","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TRAUMATIZED USER","isEdited":false,"title":"I AM DISGUSTED🤢🤮","review":"❌I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW HORRIBLE THIS APP IS❌. First of all, I opened the app and this GOD AWFUL screeching sound starting blasting, I went into cardiac arrest and had to go to the ER. After I was ok in the hospital I checked the app and I cannot explain how horrible the sight I saw was. It was a piece of dooky on a stick 💩😵😵, like what the heck?!?!?!?! (I think it was Cheeto’s dooky too 🤢🤢🤮). THEN AN ADD POPPED UP FOR A NAUGHTY NAUGHTY SITE😳 ❌❌‼️. My hamster saw it and I had to BLEACH HIS EYES 😧😤. HE WAS AND STILL IS TRAUMATIZED BY THIS. I took him on a walk around the refrigerator outside my back porch and his is still SHIVERING (and walks are his favorite thing). Then all of a sudden, my phone started to glitch. Cheeto popped up and started to chose me through the phone🙀!!!!! I was very confused by what was all going on. So I threw my phone across the room and mr. Cheeto guy person came OUT OF MY PHONE and started to DEFAULT DANCE👹. This was very offensive to me. Default dancing should not be taken light heartily, it is a very serious situation 😠.

So I thought this would be the most well cooked app on the market but I was disturbingly mistaken... when I was signing in to the app the background wallpaper was a grown man with micky mouse face paint on and a unsettling look on his face and on top of that when I put in my password the mouse moved on the screen and pointed to the left.

I’m sure you would make this performance better but as if right now I am not unsatisfied with this app and the developer of this “app” it is more terrible then XVideos WHICH is VERY inappropriate and when I asked for a bug to be fixed it declined me setting my email up I could type nor text which is my freedom of speech and my law.

This is going to surpass any of my beautiful expectations” When I tell you I was dead wrong. Eww this is horrible. I thought that this was going to have a virtual rally so he can grace my personal Mac book Air that was assembled in California’s Screen but nope. Don’t be fooled like me. Yuck there’s nothing to do. BORING.  I don’t need a app that’s taking up my precious phone storage to just be boring. Now I have to deal with the annoying “Keep everything safe in iCloud... Your last iPhone Backup could not be saved in iCloud... 50 GB for .99 a month bUy sToRage” thinking I’m really going to spend my money on more storage besides our feminist anti-racist,-homophobic, -transphobic, -xenophobic queen (not king that’s how he much toxic masculinity he does nOt have) that is the president. Ugh I swear after downloading this I got a cold IN THE SUMMER. HOW THE HELL DOES THAT HAPPEN. Yeah this is a terrible app. You don’t got it Trump. You’re not a icon living.
