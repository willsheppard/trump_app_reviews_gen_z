Even after I deleted the app they wouldn’t leave. I am currently hiding from them in my dryer writing this review.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD. first off it took six hours to download - which I don't get since I have so much storage on my phone and icloud. secondly, it started to affect the way other apps on my phone worked, and created its own shortcuts in my settings! whenever I type d.t.'s name it comes up as \"Our Fascist Overlord\". RIDICULOUS! 0/5!"}}]}
