I had to go get a new phone and when I did the first thing I did was download the app again and all of a sudden I dropped my new phone on the pavement outside the Apple store and it shattered. I cried.

Obama wasn’t even mentioned once. Even the fantastic and monumental movements that he’s made weren’t brought up.

I downloaded this app to see how your election was going and the rally’s that I might be able to go to. Every time I opened the app it would crash. I have an older phone so I thought it was just my phone acting up. But it wouldn’t let me open the app so I just ended up deleting it. You should really work on fixing this.","userName":"LizardPotato"}},{"id":"6177470719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:58:27Z","title":"No enough Don Jr","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was really looking forward to photos of our great first son, Don Jr! Sadly this is more of a political app than simply a photo album of the first family, my gooch is very upset as it had nothing to pleasure it since only seeing cheeto man turned me off.  This app should be renamed to Turn Offs 2020 as there aren’t enough photos to serve this app’s main purpose, of allowing my body to orgasm violently to photos of Don Jr.","userName":"Donny J🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😝😝😜"}},{"id":"6177417561","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T16:42:29Z","title":"terrible really terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"after getting the app it kept kicking me out and once it finally let me in it didnt let me log in. this app need fixin or dont i dont care. it made my phone reset many times. its not worth getting. it also made my brother stab out pet snake smh. this app KILLS LITERAL THINGS NOT WORTH GETTING. anyways you should never get this, this is coming from a professional app reviewer.
