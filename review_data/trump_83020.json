I got the app and not even 5 minutes later my phone was glitching!! My phone kept on freezing and even completely turned off at one point. When I first opened the app my phone screen went black and then green! After it turned green it showed me an orange and called me a pickle toothed pinky toe, it insulted me and told me that my fingers were incapable of scrolling fast/good enough for this stupid app! It then proceeded to show offensive images such as pigs, middle fingers, crusty toenails, a blackberry, broken down house, iPhone 2, horrific photos of civilians, and of a girls buttocks, yes! You heard me right. A girls buttocks!! And it wasn’t any regular girl either, it was a 4’9 258 pound 18-19 year old girl! Ridiculous is what that is. Once my phone finally went back to the home screen, my wallpaper was completely changed to a shrimp! A raw crusty shrimp. When you unlock the phone to the home page the wallpaper was a roach, a orange looking roach, it was very offensive and not right. After deleting the app my phone went back to normal and didn’t have a problem ever since. Only re downloaded app to give this nasty review after this app did me no justice. With never download this app after leaving this review and would definitely never want anybody going threw what a horrendous experience like I did with this OFFENSIVE app! Please and I repeat PLEASE don’t take your changes on being hurt and assaulted by this nasty app. Thank you and have a nice day.","userName":"shaniquazz","title":"Horrible app!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T18:44:11Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173316332","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This trump app supports a homosexual and this app promotes racism and sexism.
