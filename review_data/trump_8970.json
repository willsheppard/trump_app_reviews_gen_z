It was horrible! It started to glitch out my phone like crazy. This orange racists monster looking thing, kinda similar to our amazing president, started appearing everywhere. I didn’t know what to do. I tried getting my phone fixed because I still wanted to try out this app. When I went to get it fixed they told me this app was the problem 😖 I was truly devastated Rip oh well☺️","userName":"satansasscheek"}},{"id":"6173681180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THE WORST APP IVE EVER DOWNLOADED!!!!

The reason why I hate it so bad is bc it takes up sooo much space and it’s a waste of my time. Like I was listening to 𝓵𝓪𝓾𝓿😩𝓵𝓸𝓪𝓯🤓𝓫𝔂 𝓵𝓸𝓿𝓮😢 when this app sent me an drink water notification like if you don’t care about my skin color why do you care if I drink my dogs water. Anyway I hope you lose the next election 🤩. And i hope you finna be looking like this in the next rally when no ones thereeeee. 🧍\u200D♂️By weirdo 👽👽👽👽👽","userName":"𝓛𝓞𝓐𝓕𝓕𝓕𝓕𝓕"}},{"id":"6173599619","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible app do not recommend","date":"2020-07-08T20:20:11Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app was downloaded so that i could show how much i support the almighty cheeto and it took four years to download. i’ve been waiting all that time and the wifi i have is immaculate. while the app was downloading it made my phone jump around and i almost killed my cat. it fell on my cats head and almost broke her skull. while i was driving my cat to the vet the app kept on eating my fingers so it caused my to wreck. this app nearly killed me and my cat.

Whatever it was my phone started floating and when it stopped some weird stuff happened. For some reason now my phone can’t get above 50% charge and my dick is like half the size. I don’t now what kind of dark arts these app makers studied, but I can assure you that you’ve gotta stay away from it.","userName":"trump's left nut"}},{"id":"6173563037","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:07:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"worst app i’ve ever downloaded. the app took over my phone and i had to go to the phone store, and they couldn’t fix anything. and i was getting crazy messages. i suddenly was attacked by the cia, they were questioning me about aliens and said that i must die or my cat, because they thought she is a spy (she is but they have no proof) in the end, this app led to the worse experience of my life. i was forced to look into donald trumps eyes until he couldn’t handle the shear of magnitude of the hate in my eyes. i made him cry. trump believed with all the power of the adrenachrome he could out power me with the power of the devil but i told him we want more than this app to be removed, we want a revolution. and i need a new phone. i would give it a zero star if i could.","userName":"teddy willams"}},{"id":"6173431356","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"💅TRASH🥳🧚🏻\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-08T19:22:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"💋🧜🏻\u200D♀️🧚🏻I dislike this app with all of my life!

And it’s very hard to navigate as a 24 year-old lady I never understood so much frustration into trying to figure out this app. and I had to put in my personal information. I have the right not to give it. So I tried to find a workaround because I thought President Trump believes in that. But if he doesn’t, i have no right to support him. The government is just a conspiracy theory trying to get our information it’s steal from us. \n\nKAREN 2020","userName":"Rainbow sprinkle butt"}},{"id":"6173342390","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-08T18:51:33Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I first got the app, it took FOREVER and made my phone glitch. I literally had to wait hours. When it finally downloaded I went on it and it didn’t even work. After trying everything i could, something finally worked and i went to put in my phone number and it said it was invalid and kicked me out again. Absolutely terrible and I think my phone is permanently damaged bc it hasn’t been the same since i got this app.","userName":"coolkidxoxoluv"}}]}
