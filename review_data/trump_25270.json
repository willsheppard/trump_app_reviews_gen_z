I get constant text messages from them asking for monetary support and it's ridiculous. I thought the Trumps were wealthy and didn't need any donations.","date":"2020-06-29T14:39:59Z"}},{"id":"6136159260","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible Graphic Design","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Paola aka Pow Pow","review":"The app designers won’t consider any suggestions in making this app the best it can be. Before we Make America Great Again, how about we put a little more effort in making the app appealing to the eyes. As a graphic designer myself I am appalled how this app has truly made a mockery of my wonderful president.","date":"2020-06-29T14:26:31Z"}},{"id":"6136070672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Revolting!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Olivia Mullenski","review":"As a die hard Trump supporter myself, i was excited to find the app. i downloaded it immediately, but to my surprise, it was horrible! As soon as i opened the app, Trump himself climbed out of the screen and punched me in the nose! He also broke my mother’s vase, tripped my grandma, and ran over my dog. The app has lots of information though. 🧚✨","date":"2020-06-29T14:02:03Z"}},{"id":"6135737542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just Terrible","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"MegWinchester18","review":"I couldn’t imagine a more terrible app, I went into this having great expectations for something that was gonna help make America great again I was wrong 😫.

However, it just kept glitching out! I don’t know... maybe there is just bad service from his little bunker in the White House. The use of this app needs to be reconsidered immediately.
