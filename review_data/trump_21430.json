I mean she cried everyday and when we asked her why she would say it’s because Trump isn’t her father and she had to end up living in our family. Anyway when I downloaded the app it caused her phone to glitch and she ended up in a coma due to the shock. DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU DON’T WANT TO END UP IN A COMA!!!"}},{"id":"6173163010","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible🤢","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"The #1 TellieTubbie","date":"2020-07-08T17:52:43Z","review":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!

My sister used to be a great soul, she’d help old folk cross the street and help those in need, she even helped a cancer patient from dying. What i’m trying to say is that she was a great person, she didn’t deserve what happened to her. She’s not dead, she just downloaded the app and become a trump supporter. This app is a horrific."}},{"id":"6173124575","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"worst app ever🧚🏻🍊✨✨","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"nani805","date":"2020-07-08T17:40:38Z","review":"this app is the worst ever, it deleted every other app in my phone and gave my dog fleas i then had to take my dog to the vet and they told me i had a cat, THIS APP STOLE MY DOG i’ve been crying for weeks and i can’t stop i’m crying as i’m writing this.

If anything, it cemented the fact that he is the worth president in American history and he will drag this country into the ground if he is elected again. Don’t waste your time on the app. It  also bugs and is just crap in general."}},{"id":"6173081577","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👂 ears 😤","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"sad Trumpet","date":"2020-07-08T17:26:50Z","review":"Oh lord! I’ve been living under a rock for a while so I’m not really up with the times, but I heard this guy is our president so I decided to check this app out. It is so sad to see that this is our president.

I do not recommend it. It gives me nightmares because of how uncooperative it is. I’ve been reading other reviews and they also seem to dislike this app as well 💅🏼.

A year ago, this app was fine but after the update do you even realize what happened? Excuse me, but there are so many glitches. No, my Wi-fi is working but this app is just the worst. I recommend that you create a new app that composes of good quality and extreme support. Thank you."}}]}
