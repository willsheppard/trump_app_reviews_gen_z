But luckily I fought back👊🏽💪🏾. Then the app glitches to much and keeps playing music in the middle of no where.. Honestly I think this app is haunted.

Upon opening the app, my eyes became overcome with what looked like a very small wiener man. I showed my fish, praying that the sight of the hot dog would help it survive. Instead, upon first glance of the non- kosher piece of meat, my fish died! It died! So disappointed in the app! I thought it would heal my fish. FAKE NEWS EVERYONE!!! THIS WEINER DOG RUINED MY FISH!

The app made my phone glitch and I had to completely reset my phone. It also is to support some racist bigot who claims to be the world’s greatest leader. The man has not followed through with the promises he made for the country and has managed to take away rights for the LGBTQ+ community.

The worst app on the app store","date":"2020-07-08T21:23:24Z"}},{"id":"6173769000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"MADE ME SUICIDAL","userName":"jD_007_8 P","rating":1,"review":"This is the WORST app ever invented. whoever created this deserves to watch their children lowered into their graves. after i downloaded this app i broke out in hives, lost 85% of my vision, was laid off from my job, my wife sent me divorce papers, all of my children disowned me, AND i lost a good 3.5 inches off of my manhood.
