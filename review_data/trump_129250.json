You have to enter your phone number, and put your area code! This means the government will know where you live, and can monitor everything that happens on your phone! They can even watch you through your camera.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair.

Little did I know I to much in which I had opened the app and my balls disappeared, the first thing I thought was how was I supposed to make baby’s with James Charles. So I freaked out and called the police, but they didn’t answer, but instead I got a strange sound that sounded like a old man breathing. Indeed it was, and he was having a heat stroke, because he was in Africa all alone. So I called a hospital to go save him. The hospital went to save him. But my pet fly Randy had ran away. Little did I know he was hit my the paramedics and as I found out that my pet fly randy was dead I had thought Donald Trump was in the same earth as me and breathing the same air. So I went ahead and bought a Karen to go sue and win against Donald Trump. Of course my Karen didn’t let me down. Know I’m a billionaire, so if your reading this your a peasant compared to me. And not so later after that I put him in jail. Of course he got out, and soon after that he had thought of the brilliant plan of banning Tik Tok. A little percent to blame was particularly my fault for telling him my master plan of banning the app. But it was 99.99 percent his idea of banning Tik Tok.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:47:39Z"}},{"id":"6175602905","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumphater74","rating":1,"title":"i hate trump lol","review":"the trump app is one of the most awful apps out there. took forever to download and so slow. also the graphics of american flags everywhere are honestly just inappropriate and it keeps sending me text messages like igaf about when the next trump rally is. honestly just don’t recommend unless you’re a conservative piece of poop. 0/10 😃","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:47:32Z"}}]}
