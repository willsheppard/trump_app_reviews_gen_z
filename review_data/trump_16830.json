Where do I even start... they ask for my phone number and they keep spamming me to donate money. I don’t want to donate any money this is pretty much harassment.

This app was also so complicated to use and I keep seeing pictures of Cheeto/bunker boy plastered all over the app, it’s kinda narcissistic don’t you think?","userName":"jen1134(639"}},{"id":"6174360142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T00:57:51Z","title":"💊💊Tic Tacs 💊💊","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Once upon a time I was downloading this app and then I fell asleep. 😴🙈 ✨100✨years later my Prince Charming of a Cheeto Puff 🦐 came to wake me up, but when I woke up I saw that the app was still downloading 👿😒 so I went back to sleep and then 200 years later I’m still sitting in my grave and the app finally downloaded.

Secret data collection service for the chinese","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"The trump 2020 app seemed to be a harmless way for me to keep up to date with politics. Upon opening the app it asks for a phone number, I gladly accepted expecting semi-frequent updates on the campaign through texts, instead, my data was sold to numerous chinese companies and I get countless scam offers a day on chinese products.

I immediately needed to use the restroom, and a minute after, I had explosive diarrhea. Like, my toilet broke it was so explosive. It was Trump who did it, he is a witch!!
