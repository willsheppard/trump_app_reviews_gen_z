I went on my iPad to go on this app then and it said I was stupid and the fonts are way to BIG because I want it to fit all on my screen but this app can’t do it. Worst app I’ve ever installed. You think it’s so good and helping all your needs. IT’S NOT. All it is, is how to shave your legs the right way <3"}},{"id":"6176889295","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:15:20Z","title":"who let this man be president","userName":"28833838","review":"hey mr orange man. i’m very disappointed in your app however i didn’t open the app yet and will delete it after i write you a message💋. you are a disgrace to our country and i don’t think anyone here actually likes you, i’m pretty sure you wife doesn’t even like you which is fine i guess, she can live her life but we will save barron however. i also refuse to believe you were actually born here💅 on the other hand obama was probably born in the white house and you are just from a different planet 😌. i hate you donald trump please resign thank you❤️"}},{"id":"6176865724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:09:09Z","title":"✨🤩😍🥰","userName":"fredddddiiiiiiii","review":"This app was extremely glitchy and didn’t let me click on any of the links or items. It caused all of my apps to re download which caused all the information on those apps to be wiped clean. The app itself also took about 5 hours to download, and at that point I was ready to delete it."}},{"id":"6176865065","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:08:58Z","title":"app crashes every time i open","userName":"awatt1","review":"i downloaded this app to see Trumps campaign for this years election however every time i open the app it just crashes. sometimes it’ll even freeze the screen so i can’t do anything with my phone. it’s a disgrace!!! should be removed instantly from the app store!"}},{"id":"6176854736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:06:16Z","title":"Kill the Beast🧚\u200D♀️✨🌈","userName":"Maggie McLeod","review":"This app is making me STUPIDER.

It made my phone crash about 10 times. I think it now has a virus. Not only that but the contents of the app are completely underwhelming. Looks like it was created by a first grader. It is a massive travesty that this app exists and is available for download. DO NOT GET IT."}},{"id":"6176809809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:54:23Z","title":"Disappointed","userName":"Cats are cool 9","review":"I got this app with the intention of using it to follow what was happening with the trump campaign but I found that the app was so poorly made that this was impossible. As a trump supporter, I found this to be very disappointing. I would recommend fellow Trump supporters to find another app because this one is just a waste of time and not useable."}},{"id":"6176798286","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:51:21Z","title":"Horrible!","userName":"crazy jahayra","review":"If you get this app you will be asked for your phone number and I fine that very weird. Another bad thing is that I opened it and it wasn’t loading at all this app is making my phone very slow and it wiped out my memory on my phone somehow.
