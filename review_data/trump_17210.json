Ever since I downloaded it, I haven’t been able to open the app without major issues. I’ve just been trying to stay updated with the Trump campaign, but half of the time the app doesn’t even open, and it’s even started to glitch my phone. Waste of space. The President of America can’t even establish a proper app.","userName":"natalieevu","date":"2020-07-08T18:58:08Z","title":"Waste of space","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173324990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"Took several hours to download and then when I opened it it asked for my address and my SSN. Not sure why an app needs this. Several bugs that made my phone freeze and I got constant unnecessary notifications. I mad a profile picture and they insulted me after saving it.

Absolutely disgusting and disappointed.","userName":"Kadence 🧚🏼\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-08T18:45:30Z","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173324030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"so today i decided to support our beautiful, cute, wonderful, president ✨🤩🙈 in his journey to getting re-elected. but today I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND! once i downloaded this app, my phone got flooded with viruses and trump ads everywhere.

At the hospital the doctors realized i had a tumor in my brain which was caused by the negative energy this app gives off. i now only have 2 months left to live. do not let this app and this cheeto man take away your life.","userName":"your favorite mya","date":"2020-07-08T18:32:54Z","title":"Gave me shingles","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173283221","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app is so horrible it has to many words, the app had so many bugs and made my phone so glitchy i had to throw it away and get a new one!
