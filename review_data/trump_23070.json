If you download this app, a Donald Trump impersonator will come to your house and follow you around all day. At first, it’s quite annoying. He is very loud and kind of smelly. But once you get to know him he can be pretty cool. My guy is named Kevin and we are actually good friends now. Just wish I would have gotten a heads up.","userName":"Jdhsvsgszy","title":"Horrible App","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:22:44Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178905472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was really looking forward to getting this app. However, it took hours to download and keeps glitching and making my phone crash. I took it to the Apple store and they said the Trump app software has been effecting a lot of phones in a similar way. So bummed!!","userName":"GenM3321","title":"Disappointed","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:20:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178879581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is awful, it’s about an awful cheeto and the app needs to be dissolved in acid immediately! It made my phone glitchy and barely functional! Worst app I have ever owned and regret even knowing about it:( I wish I could give less than one star because it’d be in the negatives! Very dissatisfied!","userName":"jwjdbdjsnvbs","title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T01:11:13Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178846508","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought I could try this app out, but then got threatened by a Karen and chased down an alleyway by Addison Rae. For💕eig💕ner💕 kept playing on a loop and an orange man kept reappearing in my nightmares. in every dream he forces me to listen to cardi then proceeds to traumatize me. We got matching wigs now. I could say more, but the experience was so traumatic that I can barely make out a word.","userName":"n/a >:)","title":"no ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:59:03Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178785142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It took way too long to download and there is very little information on the app. You have to give personal information to use the app. I would not recommend this to anyone. One star is too high for the waste of space that is this app.","userName":"jeiqhj","title":"NOT helpful at all","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:35:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178727268","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app was difficult to understand and cluttered. It was frustrating and not what i was hoping for. I don’t recommend this app to anyone! Under no circumstance would this app be worth all the effort and confusion. All i wanted was a simple way to keep up with your president and this is not it!!","userName":"gdhfjfjfiukao","title":"Awful🤬🤯😳","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:13:12Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178717019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"First off, why did it take a whole entire month to download?! I eventually forgot all about till just now when it finally downloaded. Then when I opened it up, thinking that I’ll be able to support our president, IT CRASHES AND LEAVES MY PHONE BUGGED!😖 LIKE WHY?!

And I mean days, literal weeks. When it finally downloaded I was met with Trumps DISGUSTING voice, insulting me. Barron and I do not recommend this app. This is the worst app I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe I took the time to download this. My eyes are bleeding from this app. If you’re thinking about downloading this app, don’t 😊💞","userName":"p.k 🖤","title":"AN UTTER DISGRACE 😘🥴","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T00:07:21Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178687247","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to support my president.🦍 and then they were asking for my phone number , and of course I entered it ( CUZ DUHH BARRON CAN TEXT ME ) and I after that my fish started drowning 😢( rip fish ) and then my microwave started playing “ he has no lips , how can he get a kiss kiss “ and I got this creepy message saying “ tik tok will get banned if you don’t vote for trump 2020 .

After taking that long to download I was disappointed as a proud American who loves the beloved Cheeto. When I opened the app it showed me pictured of the cheeto’s toes and I was completely horrified. His son Barron Trump’s toes tho were immaculate. I would love more toe pics of Barron and not the Cheeto. Thank you very much.
