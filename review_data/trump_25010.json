Absolute Trash. -98/10","userName":"twin💞🐒👁🙈","review":"This app is so nefarious in every sense. It jumped out of my phone and manifested a rat to appear in my room. I am now homeless and it’s stolen my wife and three kids 💔. I cannot find a job because this app burned down my office and my mother doesn’t love me anymore. Fix this before it breaks another household. 🙏🏾","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:34:56Z"}},{"id":"6175080044","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"USELESS App!!","userName":"mcRainbowPancakes23Legend","review":"This app is so useless it seems to give me alerts about a clown instead of an actual president. I also regret downloading this app on my phone because it’s so poorly made and overal is just a waste of space. If you want to get alerts on the president you might as well use tik tok.
