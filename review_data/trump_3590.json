Be careful y’all, this app also tracks your location and can come to your house and stuff so delete it as fast as possible.

Then, told me to “worship the Cheeto”😬. I had my eyes closed, unfortunately my dog did not. He started chanting “Cheeto is my master” and “come to the Cheeto”😶. Now we have to take him to dog therapy 20 times a week. That unfortunately did not help though, instead he started only  saying Cheeto. Whenever I show him anything orange he starts sobbing😳. He has now built an altar at which he worships his master🙊. He hangs posters of the Cheeto on our wall. He is also begging me to let him get a spray tan, he’s saying “it will make his master feel less alone”😢, and that he is trying to start a new race of Cheetos. I’m traumatized, and covered in Cheeto dust😳🙊🧡✨.","userName":"emmyn marie jo","date":"2020-07-08T23:38:20Z","title":"No, absolute garbage ✨🧚\u200D♀️❤️","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174095643","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"While I sat down to open the app I saw the Cheetos pizza roll looking a$s pp staring back at me I tried to exit the app but it wouldn’t let me and the app has background music that’s just keeps repeating “shawty like a melody in my head” while trumps voice echoes “are you lost baby girl” I cried my self to sleep knowing that that sound will be forever ingrained into my head, I eventually threw my phone out my window and it hit my neighbor in the head and now he is dead and his last words were “that I can’t keep out got me going like na na na na everyday got my iPod stuck on replay” I had to bury my phone 6 feet under but I left his body because he said he voted for trump in 2016.","userName":"👁👄👁🦶🏼","date":"2020-07-08T23:23:48Z","title":"I’m so sad 1 star review","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174049948","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I had downloaded this app to support my the Cheeto man that everyone was talking about and I was very excited to get updates about him. I came to the App Store and typed in “Cheeto man” and it gave me this app (which I thought was sort of weird since it says something else but I just went with it.) To my surprise, and disgust, I open up the app only to find that all of this is NOT about Chester the cheetah, but some orange man... my pet rock had been chilling next to me but once I opened the application he jumped off the 700 mattresses I sleep in and fell to his death 😔 RIP Rock Astley, I let him down 😭😭😭 0/10 do not recommend and please do not have your pet rock beside you when opening this app :(","userName":"Peach.Suga","date":"2020-07-08T23:07:03Z","title":"Cost me my pet rock...","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174023685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I Downloaded this app thinking I was going to get great amazing news from CNN but I turned out to be a fat orange’s pornography! 😡😡😡 this made my dog go 𝚏 𝚘 𝚛 𝚎 𝚒 𝚐 𝚗 𝚎 𝚛 and she passed away because the Cheeto was too harsh for eyes which gave her a bad headache wich caused her to die. I quickly changed the video and there it had a pic Melania and Barron being tied up so I decided to walk to the police office with my pet caterpillar to inform them what I saw but they told me that this is a cult and now I am being held captive and they took my caterpillar and my phone (I am writing this from the tv in the back of the room) and now I am all by myself and suffering! One star out of five I do not recommend this app.","userName":"dasdy 😏🍆","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:08Z","title":"My dog died ❌👅❌😔😡💩","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173940156","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I have had this app for several months now, and I have now run into problems loading relevant and correct information. The tweets that are here do not display, and when they do, it’s severely blurred. Pictures of Donald Trump have been also blurry, which is a problem because I like to see this old, orange, powerful man. This app has lost its initial quality and purpose and I do not understand why it is still present on the App store as it has a mind boggling number of problems, including the president. I believe this issue can be resolved by creating a border around its pictures so that it will not blur as much. Please, make this app great again!","userName":"Celine Coraline Schmidt","date":"2020-07-08T22:25:36Z","title":"Make this app great again","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173788712","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"First of all when I got the app it glitched and made a rat come out of my screen and it smacked me with its tail then it proceeded to drag me across my room and bite my ear it went back in to the screen and I thought it was over but no it came back 18 seconds later with a rat army. They had little whips that they started hitting me with not only that they went to my dog and started humping her I tried to stop them but they just hit me with the whips again and when they were done with my dog they went to my brother they bit his toes and then ripped his teeth out now he looks like my grandpa I have to worry every day that might happen again.
