We opened the app with good intentions only to see disturbing imagery of trump’s sextape with Kanye West. MY CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO SEE PEOPLE HAVING SEX ON AN APP OF THE GREATEST MAN ON EARTH!!!!😡🤬🤬🤬🤬 Even worst of all, the time my child opened the app, she saw trumps naked body just standing in the shape of the letter T. This is absolutely disgusting and I hope you people learn your lesson and take this down.👁👄👁","userName":"Joana Casey"}},{"id":"6174535202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:49:38Z","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s a bad App","review":"I downloaded this app think I was going to see some drama on here but i guess not.

Right after I downloaded it I deleted it 2 seconds later because I opened it up and the first thing I saw was a man that had a horrible spray tan and fake looking hair, it almost looked like he was a living Cheeto.

I went to the hospital and came back to life because i couldn't believe what i just witnessed. May whoever made this cruel app reconsider their life decisions and wonder why they would ever put someone through this. Hopefully this app gets taken off the app store and i will be suing for trauma. Also now anytime i see orange cheetos at the store i have a stroke.","userName":"some1whodontliketrump"}},{"id":"6174455944","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:27:04Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Gross!","review":"If I could give negative stars, this app would Definitely earn negative 1000! First of all, I don’t like seeing Cheetos cuz it just makes me more hungry than I already am. SECOND OFF, I feel like having my little brother (who is 12) in office would be better than having Trump in office.
