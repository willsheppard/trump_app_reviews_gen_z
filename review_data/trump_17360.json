What’s going on with the developers of this app? I can’t even open it, I tap it to open and it just stays on the loading/logo screen forever and then crashes?? So much for that, this campaign already running itself into the ground all on its own I guess LOL.","date":"2020-07-09T16:21:12Z","rating":1,"userName":"kerrylsmithyman","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177334609","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","review":"First of all, this app took wayyyyy too long to download. I just want to support our amazing “leader” and it took days. Secondly, this app was terrifying. The first thing that came up was a zoomed in picture of cheeto mans face. I don’t want to see every clogged pore on that mans body. And it was so difficult to manage. Any time I pressed a button it took me back to his oompa loompa face. Do not recommend!","date":"2020-07-09T16:18:26Z","rating":1,"userName":"Chayse Packebush","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177323540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I’m allergic to this 😡","review":"I am a 76 year old chimpanzee extraordinaire 🥵 but this app showed me no love toward anything I have aspired to become 😡 I am severely allergic to oranges 🍊 and my 30 year old boyfriend would tell you the same 🤧 they should have a warning label for allergies in this app. I asked to speak to the manager, but they said he was at a “rally”. 🤬🤬💀 As a former customer of this app I feel misrepresented and disregarded 🤡","date":"2020-07-09T16:15:20Z","rating":1,"userName":"It's Britney Bi$h 🥵","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177311780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLEST APP EVER !!!","review":"omg i downloaded this app and right when i clicked on it i got a knock on my door and i opened my door and there was a basket of oranges ,i closed my door and turned around and there he was the orange man him self....

I have never felt so violated in my entire life. Immediately upon opening the app, within SECONDS the FBI located my IP and came CAREENING through my home via war style attack helicopters. They then proceeded to SHOVE me to the ground and ate all of my blueberry pop-tarts😔they also arrested my dog, Boofy, and are currently holding him in federal prison in solitary confinement. Unacceptable. I will be alerting General Jeon Jungkook about this immediately.💛🖤💛🖤💛","date":"2020-07-09T16:07:44Z","rating":1,"userName":"Cherrydazzle88","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177295637","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"If I Could Make It Zero Stars I Would","review":"I really just don’t think think app is good being that our president, Donald J Trump is not a good influence on our kids and future generations. He has quotes that he has said on live TV saying racist, sexist, and plain stupid things. He ok nice said “grab her by her pus*y” and that’s just a terrible things to have our daughters to hear and our sons to be influenced by. Thank you.","date":"2020-07-09T16:07:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"user457321","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177294827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Poorly Made","review":"I know the campaign is struggling but they could have given this app a little more funding! It’s purpose is to inform and with out it working I have to turn to the fake news to get all my info. When I try to use the app it glitches and closes for no reason. This doesn’t even deserve one star. It’s creation was a failure try again","date":"2020-07-09T16:07:17Z","rating":1,"userName":"Icefang237","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177262571","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"You can not ban TikTok","review":"This app is horrible. When I opened it up I started violently vomiting and did not stop for hours. Then when I stopped I tried to open it again and when I did my arms and legs fell off and now my mom has to type this for me because I can not. This should be illegal and I will never open the app again. Neither should you.","date":"2020-07-09T15:58:00Z","rating":1,"userName":"Aarrowood","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177259604","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0/10","review":"as i soon as i downloaded the app and entered my number i received so many spam messages in my inbox. i was expecting it, but what i didn’t expect, was that even after i cut off my messages and blocked the number...
