It crashed the entire time I attempted to use it. It seems like a child designed it, extremely hard to use and so laggy it was just impossible to do anything. I’m surprised this is still on the app store, considering it has been upsetting many people that it is still here. Shocked that anyone would leave a review higher than 1 star, if I could do lower I 100% would. Not recommended at all. Please take this piece of garbage off the app store.","userName":"ihatethisappdonotdownload","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177229833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:48:24Z","rating":1,"title":"🍊✨HORRIBLE✨🍊","review":"It took a week to download and all I was trying to do was support our amazing Orange! When you first open the app it will ask you questions such as what’s you gender, the options were male or female there was no other😡! I started to realize that potatoes would fly around my room saying trump2020 and my TV would keep falling off my wall! And this was all because of the trump app! Another thing I noticed was that at 1:00 pm everyday it would start raining oranges and orange juice!! This is a HORRIBLE app! I do not recommend!","userName":"shaynalmao","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177202051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:40:27Z","rating":1,"title":"Awful","review":"I downloaded this app and I gotta say they need to work on their graphics. There was this creepy guy in all the images. Also their slogan needs work. “Make America great again” do tell me when America was great. Was it during slavery or maybe the Great Depression. I do forget sometimes. Plus the people running this app seem to think that they are above people who look or live differently than them and that these people don’t deserve human rights which is frankly an idiotic idea. All and all I do not appreciate this app!","userName":"cheetohater512","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177184831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:35:34Z","rating":1,"title":"✨revolting✨","review":"I thought I downloaded Subway Surfers but then I come to realize a giant orange beast was on my screen!😱😱!!!

The app kept crashing no matter how many times I refreshed it. I even restarted my phone and the app STILL didn’t work. When the app would work , the information on there was not to my liking. Overall I do not feel that this app did its job of informing me about trumps campaign. I would rather just look up information online than have this app. The app is terrible and useless.","userName":"katrocks123","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177064395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:02:06Z","rating":1,"title":"Worst App Ever!","review":"Right as I opened this app, I was prompted with a horrifying image of a man placing his erect penis inside of a porcupine. I do not even understand the schematics or rationale behind that but I digress. Under “About Us,” there was a section that said “Stan Lil Huddy for Clear Skin🥰🇺🇸 (Sign the Petition Below to Cancel Charli)”. Ridiculous! There was even one feature that was enabled that allowed the app to continuously play Nickelback on my phone and there was no way to stop it unless I allowed the phone to self-destruct. Now I have a new phone. The Trump Administration owes me a new phone.","userName":"lil timmy tim 420","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177028201","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:52:14Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible","review":"I downloaded this app to show my support for our president and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It always crashes and makes my phone glitch and shut of when I open it. I think it’s causing a virus on my phone which mean I have to go pay for it to be fixed. WORST APP EVER. Don’t download it even if you want to show your support or be updated it’s not worth the money you’ll hav two spend because of this app. Also a lot of fake info and lies on this app. What should I have expected though right?","userName":"Fdderfuhyujkk","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176987437","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T14:41:15Z","rating":1,"title":"this app took all my personal info 😾😾","review":"i was just going throughout my day, as usual when i saw this app. i thought it would be interesting to download, so i did. everything wad fine until i noticed that my phone was acting strange and a bunch of viruses were popping up. i later went to a store to get it fixed because it wasn’t stopping. i found out that it was all because of the trump app and that it was stealing my personal data and information! do not download this app, i repeat, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!","userName":"this stole my data","isEdited":false}}]}
