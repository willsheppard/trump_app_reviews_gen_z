Then I saw trump and some helicopters then he saw me and said “fire”. I got my lunch box and started throwing my food at him, then I threw my orange and he said that was his mom. I ran back to my house  and my dog tried to protect me but then they killed him. Now I vote no on president trump.🍊","date":"2020-07-08T14:01:49Z","title":"The orange","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"your mom 1034"}},{"id":"6172359767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I logged on it constantly glitched to an orange screen.... come to think of it that could have just been a picture of our president.
