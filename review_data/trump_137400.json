He told me that he was just a random orphan boy but I could tell by the orange stain on his hand that he was in fact FATQWEEN. But besides that, he said he was starving because his family couldn’t afford anything because they had made no money off the rally on Juneteenth (surprise surprise😾)so I offered him an apple but said the jam between my toes looked a bit more appetizing. So I harvested some to hive to him and continued on my day.","title":"Barron Trump just ate my tie cheeze! 😹🤫","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179927411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:26:10Z","userName":"Verdec49","rating":1,"review":"The app was very under developed, not what I expected out of it at all","title":"I do not recommend this app","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179927241","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:26:07Z","userName":"Hdog13","rating":1,"review":"At first I thought it was just a normal app and nothing would go wrong but as soon as I downloaded it it asked if I wanted notifications on (said yea obviously) but then my phone SHUT OFF! I thought it died so I plugged it in, opened the app and then my phone crashed again. Turned on my phone and the app kept popping up then turning my phone off. I literally had to take it to the Sprint store to get fixed and they charged me over $100 for a replacement.  Please if you can DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It will mess up your phone and it’s not worth it!!!","title":"Major hack","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179927057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:26:03Z","userName":"hellnofyoutrump","rating":1,"review":"This app is so bad like I can’t, when I opened it there was a big life-sized Cheeto puff, it’s not good🤢🤮","title":"Horrible🥰🧚🏾","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179925983","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:25:39Z","userName":"Sharpshooterr2","rating":1,"review":"Worst app I’ve ever downloaded and it’s a wast of time tik tok lives matter","title":"WORST APP EVER🤢","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179925791","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:25:33Z","userName":"𖤛ᗰᗩᕼᑎᗝᗝᖇ𖤛","rating":1,"review":"𝙳𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚃𝚛𝚞𝚖𝚙 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚛𝚞𝚒𝚗𝚎𝚍 𝚜𝚘 𝚖𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚙𝚎𝚘𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚜 𝚕𝚒𝚟𝚎𝚜 𝚒 𝚠𝚒𝚜𝚑 𝚠𝚎 𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚑𝚊𝚍 𝚊 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚠𝚑𝚘 𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚢 𝚌𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚍 𝚊𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚌𝚒𝚝𝚒𝚣𝚎𝚗𝚜","title":"𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝚊𝚙𝚙 𝚒𝚜 𝚑𝚘𝚛𝚒𝚋𝚕𝚎","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6179925501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:25:27Z","userName":"No instales dls","rating":1,"review":"Pretty dumb","title":"Stupid app","isEdited":false}}]}
