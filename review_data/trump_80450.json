I hit no MULTIPLE TIMES and then it started spamming me to share the app with everyone 😤 once or twice would be fine but not every time I click on something!! The app felt messy and underdeveloped as well. If this app is so poorly managed, how can we expect Trump to put any care into more serious matters?? His efforts are clearly lacking. I also find it ridiculous that Trump, who has more than enough money to spare, is using this app to beg citizens for money for him to run again. Maybe instead of taking MORE of our money, he could be donating to charities or supporting women’s rights and access to birth control. Seeing that employers can now deny women’s coverage of birth control is disgusting!! What happened to keeping church and state separate?? Apparently Trump doesn’t care about that. I use birth control to regulate my hormones and bleeding as I was getting my period every 2 weeks and bleeding so much it caused me to faint. Birth control was the only way I could safely fix it, and now I might not be able to afford it!! If he can’t run an app properly, can’t keep church and state separate, is begging for money, AND won’t respect that I don’t want to share my location........ wow. This app doesn’t even deserve 1 star rating but I can’t rate it lower 😤 do yourself a favor and don’t download this app. It’s a WASTE OF STORAGE SPACE AND TIME!!! You’d be better off watching bubbles guppies with toddlers than spending time on this app.","userName":"Katana Hay","title":"HORRIBLE APP!! 😤🧚\u200D♀️"}},{"id":"6177697728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:10:00Z","review":"Was not to my liking and had inappropriate content🤨","userName":"ifkdyb","title":"Worst app EVER😡"}},{"id":"6177674731","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:02:51Z","review":"I use to like cheetos until I downloaded this app. 10/10 DO NOT RECCOMEND 😬🤣","userName":"ughhhhly","title":"i use to like cheetos"}},{"id":"6177658077","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:57:28Z","review":"We are more powerful than you","userName":"MelaniaLikesYourMoneyOverYou","title":"Gen Z takeover"}},{"id":"6177655340","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:56:34Z","review":"Trump is racist does not care about Black people or Mexican people he called us killers","userName":"anaira_anaira","title":"."}},{"id":"6177650752","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:55:05Z","review":"I hate this app because it scary all I see is a pervert who wants to be president","userName":"lamp bulb head","title":"🤡🤢✊🏾"}},{"id":"6177636900","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:50:40Z","review":"This is one of the worlds worst app why this is the worst worst worst nobody buy","userName":"this tiktok is the BEST!!!","title":"This is the worst"}},{"id":"6177629528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T17:48:17Z","review":"people told me to download it so my dog could come back to life but no . after this app my life went down hill , my shoe flew away and my cat left me this app is absolutely absurd . do not download","userName":"carmela <3","title":"bad app"}}]}
