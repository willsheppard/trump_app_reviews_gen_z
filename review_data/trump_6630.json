I was locked out of my phone for a whole day because of this stupid app!!!!!😾 This wasn’t what I was expecting from our president considering he’s a billionaire, at least his team could of programmed better. The next day I was able to log on but it didn’t matter anyways because the news I was seeing turned out to be more stupid than the app itself. I hope this review will make you cautious about downloading it👌"}},{"id":"6174189617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"julia jannett hernandez","date":"2020-07-08T23:58:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Such a horrible app","review":"See i was on this app and to my surprise i found out that they have these files where you can see famous peoples leaked nudes and my daughter was on the app and she has not stopped crying for 2 days because shes mortified and as the president of the united states our children should always come first and my daughter is traumatized now because she saw those pictures as a mother i am extremely mortified i dont get it the app store should get this app off because its just so mortifying and there are links that take u to illegal websites"}},{"id":"6174166216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"no google classrom","date":"2020-07-08T23:49:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Potato has cheeks clap brutally by carrot😋","review":"As I went to open the app it told me the best site to learn more about the rallies to me to a site were I saw a potato, with no clothing on 🥵, and it had a fat booty. But I couldn’t put it down. And the all of a sudden, a carrot with a “huj” horse PP. And then the carrot smacked the potato really hard and then it brought back my PTSD from my dad beating my mom that took years to recover from. And then started to clap the big juicy Potato cheeks. And then my parents walked in and now I’m going back to therapy because my parents think I’m into clapping thiccc potato cheeks. I will be suing."}},{"id":"6174164150","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Pippydoctor","date":"2020-07-08T23:49:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"How’s it going?","review":"This story takes place in its own universe. It has no connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.\nWe see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and the stakes are personal.\nAlthough it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes place in the past.\nLet's call it 1981.\nIt's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past six weeks. And the divide between the \"haves\" and the \"have- nots\" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into delusions."}},{"id":"6174154622","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yourrrrmommmmmm","date":"2020-07-08T23:45:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app..... no❤️","review":"DISGUSTING APP😹😹💩🤧🤢🤮🤮 first thing I saw when I opened the app were dancing rats. I was so scared they were just staring a me. But I decided to keep going and maybe they will go away, but sadly it got even worse. The rats got bigger and then turned into dancing Cheetos. They were chanting at me and telling me horrible things like.... ifbridgiexjhsusb. It’s so horrible I can’t even tell u the rest. I think they were speaking a new foreign language. PLEASE control ur app so young viewers like me don’t have to experience this truama. DELET THIS APP NOW BEFORE IT GETS ANY WORSE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👿👹☠️☠️👽😹🙌🤑🤡🤡👽🤮🤢🥴🥱🥱🤐😷🙄"}},{"id":"6174144459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kardi Boo","date":"2020-07-08T23:41:51Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not the oranges","review":"When I downloaded the app I opened it and to my surprise I saw Cheeto boy with his little hands as it started to play the music all the oranges from my kitchen all gathered in a cult formation and started to sacrifice my cat for the Cheeto man, my cat was placed on the grill and the oranges started covering him in gasoline. Then threw a lit match on him he was burt up in flames and then the oranges started feed his ashes to the dog, as the dog ate it it poisoned him to such a degree to where he has lost his hearing. Now I have a deaf dog and a dead cat, so I had to light all my oranges on fire and immediately deleted the app, not happy 🙁🙁"}},{"id":"6174143146","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hickerystick","date":"2020-07-08T23:41:20Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Please make it stop","review":"So unbelievably nasty. I opened the app and INSTANTANEOUSLY there was real life CHEETO dust all over my fingers and phone. Just so unbelievable right?!! Anyways after that was done with it started to combust and it burst into flames and then it killed my cat. We buried them today. Now that I’m thinking about it, it was probably bc the cat was non binary but anyways after it killed my cat it filled my room w smoke so we had to evacuate and now I’ve moved across the country bc of it. So gross. 0 star review. No one should ever ever EVER even THINK about downloading this app. You’re cat might die."}},{"id":"6174086865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fbwgbsg","date":"2020-07-08T23:20:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"🤮🤢😭 DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!","review":"First off,I opened the app thinking I was going to see a beautiful horse, but then I saw a picture of a fat Orange Cheeto working out,🤮 luckily I had my glasses to overcome the danger of a picture so violating. 🤬I also saw a picture of a fat sweaty Orange Cheeto getting a HAND JOB!!! 🤢🤮 I was immediately blinded by this horrifying picture, I went to go show my sister and when she saw the picture she FELL OUT OF MY WINDOW!!!!!!! Thanks to the people that made this app I’m BLIND AND MY SISTER IS IN THE ER. You guys need to delete this app before any more people get hurt.
