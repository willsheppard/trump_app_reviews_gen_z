TRUMP 2020 😌. but i was immediately BOMBARDED with “security” questions asking for my name, address, phone number, my height and weight, they even asked me to send in PICTURES OF MYSELF for trump to “review”. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL. i can’t believe this app is even allowed. in order to use the app i had to allow my location to be used at all times. to top it all off i was asked for a live photo identification. UNBELIEVABLE. this app is a complete invasion of privacy and should be banned from ever being downloaded. whatever tho i still gotta support my cheeto man 😹😹","userName":"Dragon vale lova"}},{"id":"6174436832","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:15Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I think this might be the worst app on the App Store. It took way to long to load. The design is hideous from the colors to the font to the pictures they chose. I would have preferred to delete every other app on my phone and only have access to angry birds than have this app downloaded for another second. I would rather close a car door on my tongue than spend another minute looking at this dumpster of an app. I would rather travel back in time and kill myself as an infant than admit I even once LOOKED at this app. I am infuriated. I am disgusted. What an afront to coders and designers everywhere.","userName":"buffshell"}},{"id":"6174422644","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Wildly Inappropriate","date":"2020-07-09T01:16:59Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Never in my life did I expect to download and app and have an orange man simultaneously flash me while screaming “Grab her by the meat flaps!”  🤢🤮 Very disgusting and unwelcome due to the nature and appearance of the man in question. When I tried to go to a different part of the app to bypass the orange man, the orange man appeared again FULLY nude and pleasuring himself while seeming to do a crude impression of a handicapped reporter. I also found it very horrifying and worrisome when I tried to exit the app and it tried to download all of my information including blood type, zodiac sign, & what I ate for dinner 2 weeks ago just so he could sell it to RUSSIA!!!! 🤬","userName":"AnyResponsibleAdult2O2O"}},{"id":"6174410105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful App","date":"2020-07-09T01:13:10Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"It was so painfully awful it wouldn’t even let me download it. I’m not deleting all my photos so a cheeto man can have his app 😹😹😹. Anyway aside from that when I downloaded it the graphics were so bad I couldn’t even bear it, it hurt my eyes. I have glasses now. This app was not helpful at all it gave me no updates on Mr. Trump or any of these rally’s like what??? This was probably the worst app I’ve ever downloaded it completely ruined my whole phone I hated this so much. I’d recommend not downloading it, it wasn’t even helpful it was useless. I don’t even care. You look stupid take this app down immediately","userName":"moonlalabk"}},{"id":"6174409649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T01:13:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"The app took FOREVER to download which I was not happy about. The music the app played was the WORST music I have ever heard in my life. I would rather carve out my eardrums than listen to it. And the pictures. Oh god the pictures. They were horrifying and very unflattering. The app itself was also very confusing and hard to use unlike other apps I use. And EVERY TIME I opened the app it would crash. Sometimes I could be on it for two minutes or two hours but it would crash every time. This is the absolute WORST presidential app I have ever downloaded. You would expect trump to have a better app.","userName":"imafireydemon"}},{"id":"6174367757","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i am scarred 👁💧👄💧👁","date":"2020-07-09T01:00:19Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I am scarred. And i will be for the rest of my life. This app took over 3 hours to download and then when it finally finished installing, a nightmare came to life. Right after it installed, my poor dog turned almost as orange as our embarrassing, cheeto of a president. Then my poor dog started to talk nonsense just like him. I felt like crying out of fear. But fortunately once i got rid of this toxic app, my dog went back to his normal self. I was so relieved but i couldn’t believe what just happened. MY DOG JUST GLITCHED INTO A DOG VERSION OF TRUMP. my dog will also be scarred for the rest of his life. thanks a lot my dudes. Shame, shame. one of the worst moments of my life.","userName":"fluffywhale💙✨"}},{"id":"6174243510","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","date":"2020-07-09T00:18:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First of all, i opened the app and instantly saw an orange fat man in a mirror getting a spray tan NAKED 🥴🤢. Then, as if that wasn't enough, i whispered to myself \"ew\" and then giant, hairy, disgusting, RATS came out of my screen and started attacking me with popsicle sticks. I had to fight them off with a butter knife. My sister got her eye scratched out from the rats and we had to take her to the hospital. she is currently still healing. I decided to give the app one last chance and then the minute i opened it and i saw a disgusting video of the orange man force feeding caterpillars to his son 😳🤚🏼. I deleted this app instantly after seeing that. NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SCARRED FOR LIFE!!!","userName":"garythessnail321"}},{"id":"6174195082","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scary 👁👄👁 DO NOT RECOMMEND","date":"2020-07-09T00:00:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So as soon as I got on the app...😮 before I say this it scared me and my family 😪 it said 🤧 TRUMP 2020🥴 I thought I was gonna see Obama but sadly I sad 😳 I saw a scary man that looks like a hot Cheeto with a 🍤 I thought this was a family app and not no five nights at freddys😒 and it showed disturbing photos of a weird old man that is very hideous and scary to look at I had to go get a therapist because I didn't know how to cope with this horrific app.🥺 lord help me and save me from the demons I just saw.

I download this app hoping to get advice on how to look like an orange but instead it showed a terrifying orange man I almost ripped my eyes right out of their sockets!!!  I have never wished I was blind but now I feel unlucky that I have eyes that can see! I don’t know if I will ever be able to sleep again since all I can see is the horrifying image I had to see right as I opened the app 😔 I can’t stop crying I am so traumatized I’m gonna need therapy! All because of this app I am ABSOLUTELY traumatized and need to spend LOTS of money and TIME for therapy!

Once I signed up on this app, I got an email asking me for my address, and i never answered it, then a week later Donald Trump showed up to my house!!!! He then proceeds break open my door to open my dogs cage, throw her half way across the room, and goes in the cage?? And then he continues to eat my dog’s kibble. And then a random trump supporter walked into my house and said “HIS WORDS WHERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, HES JUST NOT GREAT WITH WORDS “?? And then they both left saying “TRUMP 2020” ?? I hope you know I will be pressing charges and suing \n them both for trespassing, and breaking and entering.","userName":"bernie2020 forever"}}]}
