I downloaded this app with all the intention of keeping up with Trumps campaign and the election. As soon as I downloaded it, the problems started. At first, every time I would click the icon to open the app, it would quickly exit out and not let me use it at all. I though it was a glitch with my phone at first so I restarted it but it still did the same thing afterwards. This was very frustrating for me because it was keeping me from being informed and using the app for what it’s intended for. After a few more tries, it made my phone shut off by itself. I though it had died so I plugged it in but then it turned back on at 30%!! The worst part was that the android emoji began showing up sometimes which is very rare because I have an iPhone. It gets ever worse every time I try to use it. It’s as if my phone was taken over by a demon. I genuinely think my phone was hacked or something. Sometimes I even see the little light phones get when someone is using it to evesdrop on you. Either this app is very messed up and needs a lot more than bug fixes or it’s being used to hack into people’s phones. Please don’t get this app, you’ll regret it. I’ve also tried deleted it multiple times but again, it makes my phone shut off. I’m so annoyed and if I could rate this app a 0 or -5 stars, I definitely would.","date":"2020-07-09T10:22:59Z"}},{"id":"6176061426","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumps stupid","title":"Omfg 😂😂😂😂😂","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"These reviews are so funny!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but fr, hate is a strong word so....

Police brutality is still a huge problem in our system that needs to be solved. Our tax payers money is going towards these cops, when they do not receive the proper training to deescalate a conflict, which leads to unnecessary deaths which the police do not get punished because of the unfair system. Speaking of the system. It’s statically proven that a person of color and wealth will succeed without trying much, while a person of color will struggle and not achieve their goals despite trying their all time best. Better education should be given to all and the whole educational system should be fixed and funded more properly. Teachers should have better training and understanding amongst students. Giving more attention towards each individual and helping them in areas where they lack. Instead of treating them as a test taking robot and a number. There is more I can go on about, but I have to come to a end.
