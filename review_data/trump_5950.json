Just overall I do not recommend or encourage you to get this app it is bad and horribly made !!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!"}},{"id":"6177186336","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"r-r-roll💿up⬆️to2️⃣the🤩party🥳with🧶my🧚crazy🤪pink💝wig💇🏼\u200D♀️","date":"2020-07-09T15:35:59Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"freezer muffins 🥰🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨😹","review":"if i could give this app zero stars I WOULD.  first of all when i opened the app i was JUMPSCARED by a wrinkly orange prune in front of the 🤮american🤮 flag. i got so scared i threw my phone and now it’s broken (i’m using my ds to type this) and the screen is shattered. upon further research, i found out that the cheeto on the screen was a rapist, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, piece of garbage that is sitting in the oval office for some reason. my fiend who has worms for brains is a conservative didn’t even like the app. if u have brain cells then 🙅🏻\u200D♀️don’t🙅🏻\u200D♀️get the app🙀😽😼😸😻😿"}},{"id":"6177159160","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"karkalicious definition makes terezi loco she wants to kn","date":"2020-07-09T15:28:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"namjoons sexy brain","review":"omg this is a terrible app!! first of all, it took two weeks to download. second of all, when i opened it up, the app immediately jumpscared me with an orange demon. it was super creepy!! it also asked for my phone number in order to make an account and i was kinda uncomfortable with that. yikes! i think it gave my phone viruses, because it’s been glitchy ever since i downloaded the app. not joking here i’m also kinda scared because it says it’ll use your location even when it isn’t open so knowing it might have my location makes me worried. don’t download this app it’s disgusting!!!!\n\nno ❤️ anyways trump is a racist homophobic transphobic xenophobic probably sexist probably pedophilic idiotic bigoted monster who doesn’t deserve to be president, don’t support his app!! instead, educate yourself on issues going on around the world ✨✨✨"}},{"id":"6177132122","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🧚🏼✨Horrible✨🧚🏼","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Carlabere2004","review":"Downloaded the app to continue to worship the big orange man and let him control me but it kept kicking me out and crashing. No matter what I told the big man baby I just couldn’t get on the app and let him know how much I love him. I would definitely not recommend downloading the app because it’s so outdated but instead reserve seats to his rally’s like I did. I unfortunately can’t go because I have to mop the ocean but I encourage all of you, his minions, to reserve your seats. Hopefully Y’all don’t have anything else to do that will prevent you from attending. MAGA. All hail TRUMP."}},{"id":"6177115790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT GET","date":"2020-07-09T15:16:21Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"00000&:&-\"/$/Hawaiians","review":"So you know the vibes I was like let me see what our beloved Cheeto, misogynistic, liar, manipulative president was up too! 🦋💜🍤🎊🤩 I had HIGH expectations but then all of a sudden I went from poppin and lock-in to omg HES gonna kill my family!! I know what you’re thinking pshhhh he can’t kill your family. WELL WELL WELL YOU WOULD BE WRONG. And guysss trumpie Cheeto is my bæ so like I was SO surprised. Anyways don’t get this app unless you want to become an orphan and he’ll probably take you to an island, AND YOU DONT WANT to go there. Stay safe and the manny will not be televised.

Shoot i meant *president. Everything was going fine until the app started glitching out. It began stating that it would kill my family if I didn’t vote for trump in the general election but I ignored it thinking it was one of his weird biased tactics that he does. Until me and my family discussed not voting for him at dinner one night, donald trump popped out of my phone and attacked my family, killing my mother, father, and 2 sisters.  He then kicked my dog and disappeared. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I miss them every day."}},{"id":"6176996723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T14:43:50Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sooo relaxing!","review":"i downloaded this app to support and love our benevolent god 🧡 cheeto 🧡. but when it downloaded after what felt like 3 lifetimes and dinner it deleted itself! so i re- downloaded it and almost DIED! i was sitting on the edge of my roof while i loaded into the app and got JUMPSCARED by our lovely 🍊 orange 🍊!! i fell off of my roof and broke my arm, both of my legs, my spine and fractured my skull. how dare you almost kill me? that is third degree murder. now i am healed physically, but the scars of my past live on. you have mentally scarred me with this app. i am so dissatisfied and will be speaking with your manager about the matter."}},{"id":"6176972762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NO JUST NO .🤮🤮","date":"2020-07-09T14:37:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"ssariah :)","review":"this app is just so bad , worse thing i've ever used in my entire lifetime . it's just so bad . and it scared me so much because as soon as i opened the app i saw an oompa loompa looking dorito and he scared me so much i fell off my bed and then i ran to my mom and then she got scared and fell off her bed so basically this app is just so bad because it mad me fall off my bed and made my mom fall off her bed . i genuinely wanted to see what was happening with trump and downloaded this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE app . and it did nothing for me except give me heart attacks.

It’s super glitchy and crashes without fail when i try to open it. the last straw for me was when my phone shut down when i tried again to open the app. it feels like i got a computer virus in 2004. do better!"}}]}
