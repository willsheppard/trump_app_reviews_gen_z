I had much hope! But the app took 2 days to download? Also keep in mind my pet dog is also a trump supporter. Once the app finally downloaded I saw this orange blob on my screen asking for my phone number and private information!🥺I was very scared but I did it anyway. To help myself relax I went on a walk with my dog and across the street there was a orange racist!!! He looked at me and he started yelling inappropriate words at me such as “TRUMP 2020” and “KUNG FLU” I picked up my 59 pound dog and ran back to the house. Only to find out my phone was broken!!! I took my phone over to the sofa and tried to restart it, once it finally restarted I checked on the trump app and then my refrigerator came in and stole my phone and threw a rock at me! Then I fell of the sofa and broke my skull and rib cage. In my time at the hospital I prayed to trump to help me get better. Then the racist case into my room at the hospital and stole my dog! I could not get her back because my ribs hurt.😩Then someone grabbed me and threw me out the window and I landed on my dog, she was wearing and bandanna that said trump 2020 on it. Oh and I better mention that my dog broke her ribs when I landed on her! So we rolled back to the house and we called Donald Trump, we asked him why the app is causing these weird things. He told me that it’s because China is spying on us despite the fact that the CEO of tiktok is in the USA! He’s so smart like that, but anyways. After the phone call my dog grew wings and flew away so I tried to follow her in my car. Then I got into a terrible car crash with the orange blob. He blamed it on me!!!!😡😡😡 and then my rib cage broke even more!! My doctor told me that I had permanent damage that could not be fixed so they are going to put me to sleep forever. Also my dog is till missing!!!🥺I am very tired of Trumps behavior and I no longer support him due to this app. Anyways by the tome you see this I’m probably dead.❤️🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬spinch🥬","date":"2020-07-09T21:14:48Z","isEdited":false,"rating":5,"title":"Very disappointed (please read)"}},{"id":"6178256807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"n1c60","review":"No bueno.
