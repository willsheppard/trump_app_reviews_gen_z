I waited like 4 hours for it to download and I have perfect WiFi and i don’t know what was happening. The app made my whole phone glitch, and when I tried to go into the app it just showed orange. I was so disappointed because I thought maybe this would educate me on my President but not at all. This app needs to be fixed also it played music and it made my dog sick. I’m not happy with this download at all. 1 star was made for this app","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointed.","userName":"ummm?!!?!?!","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:22Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173014498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app has got to be the worst app I have ever downloaded on my phone. First of all the design on the app does NOT pass the vibe check. When you open the app there’s this weird orange thing that makes me kinda nauseous, actually i take that back it makes me EXTREMELY nauseous. The app is full of false claims like “make america great again” but fails to provide evidence on when america was ever great and also fails to explain how to make american great. This is a bunch of covefefe!! Do not download this app","isEdited":false,"title":"nope","userName":"trusted american","date":"2020-07-08T17:05:38Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6173008615","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"just really quite disgusting what happened actually... I was just trying to use this app as a source of information to see what goes on in the head of an orange man. The app took 15 hours to download and then after it downloaded I clicked on the app to find a very disturbing man right on the front page. i almost threw up. I’m still feeling quite queasy in fact. soon after the some stalker showed up to my house and asked to review the orange man. smh","isEdited":false,"title":"awful app made by a cheeto","userName":"Lolly pop134567","date":"2020-07-08T17:03:52Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172999436","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I downloaded this dating app I expected to find several people with whom I could attempt to begin a relationship with. I was instead surprised to find that I had only one match for someone called “Donald Trump” I don’t really feel like we’d be a good fit; however, given that he lives hundreds of miles away from me. (I’m not looking to do long distance right now.) Clearly this app needs to improve its algorithm so I can find more people closer to me.","isEdited":false,"title":"Not enough matches","userName":"Mike Pence1294","date":"2020-07-08T17:01:07Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172997514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this app took days to download. i was getting it to see what the hype was about it and to educate myself about our president, up until it started sending me scary messages. \nthis app would send me death threats in the middle of the night and make my phone have this really weird sound/alarm when i’d ignore the message. i feel completely violated and will be deleting the app. safe to say after this he will not be getting my vote in November😡😡😖😖🤬🤬😰😰🤕🤕","isEdited":false,"title":"this app threatened to kill me😭","userName":"Megan Gamp","date":"2020-07-08T17:00:32Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172947747","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So far, in his years of presidency, Trump has spend more time playing golf than actually being the president. With the recent coronavirus, he has time and time again ignored the blatant problem thinking it would go away. Not to mention the fact that he would disrespect Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans, etc, basically anyone who isn’t white. Also to add that he wanted to enforce martial law on those protesting for BLM, when he supported those wanting to go get their hair done","isEdited":false,"title":"Honestly not the best","userName":"Tawseef_islam","date":"2020-07-08T16:45:11Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172902374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Ahah ahah so when I got this app a man named Oli ZigZag texted me and said “if you continue on this app your family will get the dig dag” so I got scarred bc Oli zigzag said he’s gonna dig dag me!! 😦 So I deleted it and cried myself to sleep 😪😭 so I epicly said E and Oli died.. it was pretty EPIC... but then I figured out that oli was the president Donald J Trump trying to kill me because I didn’t like him 😪😪😪I got so scared I broke my tablet and got on my phone to finish the review and to tell you if you want this app, get ready to get the digdag ;-; be safe | Trump 2020 cancelled | please","isEdited":false,"title":"Dig Dag","userName":"lil Roo😸","date":"2020-07-08T16:30:58Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172885664","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had this app on my phone for one second and I got so many viruses. They weren’t your normal viruses, these viruses were orange...? I don’t know if that makes sense but they were orange, racist, absolutely dim witted, and made me feel like I needed to throw up. The virus also came with mini viruses that had many of the same characteristics. To say the least, the app made me itchy and the skin I scratched off became orange. I truly believe that this app posses you in some form. :,( fúck trump.

But this whole app is filled with censored news so that bunker boy can control the political narrative, and I’m not here for that kind of censorship. If that’s what I wanted I would hop in my time machine and go back to the Stalin’s Russia. It was also super laggy and would keep crashing when I used it for more than five minutes. I’m so disappointed. All I have to say is Trump 2020 💖🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨ but on a gravestone 🙊🤪🤩","isEdited":false,"title":"I’m so disappointed","userName":"ACAB | BLM","date":"2020-07-08T16:05:02Z","rating":1}},{"id":"6172801919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"MY POOR EYES🙈 I got the app to praise the almighty Cheeto god🟧when I opened up the app I was asked for so much information😫 but he’s my lord and savior so I had no problem giving him my social security and my birth certificate😱 BUT when I opened the app there was a nude picture of the Cheeto god🤏🏼 I yelled and threw my phone across the room and accidentally hit my sister in the breast🙀her breast implant deflated 💨 and now one is bigger than the other😿 so she had to cancel her date and now she has no husband 😭😭ITS ALL THE APPS FAULT🤬😡😡😡","isEdited":false,"title":"MY SISTER DOSENT HAVE A HUSBAND🤬🤬","userName":"yesthisisateview","date":"2020-07-08T16:01:10Z","rating":1}}]}
