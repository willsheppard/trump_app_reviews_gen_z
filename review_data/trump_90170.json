DO NOT GET!!!!","userName":"TheGari","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:51:06Z","rating":1,"review":"After taking 3 hours and 47 minutes to download (I counted), I was very excited to be able to support our Great Country and even Greater President, Donald J. Trump.  I opened the app and was immediately asked to enter my phone number, my email, my name and date of birth, my address, my mother’s maiden name, my credit card number, and my social security number.  I of course willingly put in all of these credentials, as I knew I was doing my duty to my country.  I poured my entire life’s savings into the app as tribute to our president, Donald Johnald Trump.  I then went about how day as usual, buying guns, harassing minorities, and controlling women.  When night came, I put on my American flag pajamas and tucked myself into bed, with my American flag covers, American flag bedsheets.  As I laid my head upon my American flag pillow, my phone buzzed with a notification.  I reached over and turned on my phone, revealing the glowing symbol of the Trump 2020 app.  I excitedly opened the app knowing I was about to see news from our lord and savior, DJ Trump.  What greeted me was lines of text saying; “Your family has been taken, and your little dog too.  If you wish to see them again you must pledge your body, mind, and soul to the service of the Master, Danimal Jam Tramp.”  As I read these words a faint music began to play.  I recognized it as the song of the Oompa Loompas, and fear clutched at my heart.  A choice box popped up on screen with two glowing buttons, one titled “PLEDGE” and the other titled “BETRAY”.  With trembling fingers I reached down towards the pledge button, and heard a creaking in the hallway outside my door.  I quickly glanced up and saw the most horrific thing I could ever have imagined.  It was short and stout, with short limbs and an oversized head.  It had greasy orange skin, fake yellow hair, beady little eyes, and pursed lips parted in a grimace, revealing pointed teeth. The creature a dark gray suit with a blood red tie, barely visible in the dim moonlight.  It had its arms up by its sides, and there I saw its most gruesome feature.  It’s tiny grubby hands.  I glanced down at my phone and the two glowing buttons, and looked back up at the creature.  It nodded its head.  I gulped, sweat forming on my brow as a pit of fear grew in my stomach.  With trembling features I reached down and pressed the “PLEDGE” button.  Immediately the creature reared it’s head back, letting out a horrific scream, and launched itself towards me.  I blacked out.  I woke up in a pitch black room, groggy and confused.  A phone screen lit up, blinding me with its light.  The phone was open to the app with a pop up reading “Would you like to leave a review?”"}},{"id":"6176788659","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible!!!!! 😿😿","userName":"Kitty Kat and pink unicorns","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:48:49Z","rating":1,"review":"this app is so bad! i thought it had a chance, but when i opened it the first thing i saw was a balding fat cheeto!!! very upsetting. #biden2020"}},{"id":"6176769557","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible","userName":"noooooooppppppe","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:43:45Z","rating":1,"review":"Did it for the vine"}}]}
