Luckily my neighbor heard all the noise and got there just in time to call 911. He then tried to fight off my freezer and died in the process. The police arrested my freezer and called an ambulance bc I got multiple severe injuries from getting hit by the frozen burritos. Do not download this app.\n\nRIP my dear neighbor John Eggos","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"sexy bacon 69"}},{"id":"6179739594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:56Z","review":"This is a deep state propaganda app. Please give one star.","title":"Fake app run by George Soros","isEdited":false,"userName":"JDGSJK"}},{"id":"6179739368","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:51Z","review":"App is poop and fart.

When it finally did, I noticed that it was asking very personal questions. Do not use this app while on your personal wifi at home. Somehow it used the connection from my phone to my wifi router to access other electronics that were connected to my wifi router. This app gained access to my email, bank and so much more. Along with getting hacked, this app downloaded aggressive viruses onto every electronic in my house. If you ask me, this app doesn’t seem qualified to actually be in the app store... funny how this applies to the CHEETO in the white house hmmm coincidence? I think not. Everything about this app just screams below average, something that it also has in common with the criminal in the white house. Again, funny how that works. Well anyway, I was looking forward to this app that the disappointment up in the white house created, but much like everything else in his life (including himself) turned out to be a BIG PHAT DISAPPOINTMENT! Also, I found the tanner that this oompa loopma uses. I found it at target and I think you can get it anywhere actually. It’s called Cheetos, you can find them in the chips aisle I believe. However, I don’t suggest using Oompa Loompa’s technique to apply the tanner because he just ignores his under eyes and it just looks unpleasant, kinda like the rest of him and his personality LOL ✨💓 Hope this helped🥰 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🧚🏽🧚🏾\u200D♂️🧚🏿\u200D♂️","title":"SUCH A DISAPPOINTING APP","isEdited":false,"userName":"lol<33333"}},{"id":"6179738889","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:39Z","review":"consider this rating for your app a reflection on your presidency🥰 i wanted all the sexiest, xenophobic, homophobic, racist, fascist, and ignorant plans to make our nation ✨great again✨. unfortunately this app, nor you, accomplished that and are actually tearing our nation further apart when there were several opportunities to bring us together. a for effort though.","title":"horrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Wicked Witch of the West (jk)"}},{"id":"6179738775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:36Z","review":"Absolutely not","title":"No","isEdited":false,"userName":"bobbychick75"}},{"id":"6179738224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:25Z","review":"I downloaded this app to support our lord and savior, but soon after started having strange things happen around my house. On my way in from a brisk evening walk in the old country, I noticed my front door was ajar, but no one was home. I entered the house to see that all of the cupboards in my kitchen had been opened and filled to the brim with MAGA hats - this normally wouldn’t be a problem but I sure didn’t buy all of those, maybe only 5 were mine. Then I went upstairs and my bathtub was full of water, and the strange thing was the tiny confederate flags that seemed to have been shoved so deep inside my plumbing that my toilet was overflowing with deep seeded racism, misinformation, and, you guessed it, senseless murder by my boys in blue. I tried flushing but I couldn’t seem to unclog the states rights propaganda from my little toilet pipes. I brushed it off and got in bed only to find that there was cheetoh dust covering my brand new white robes - I HAD JUST GOTTEN THOSE. Anyways, I had to uninstall this app due to the haunting reminder of our nations racist past.","title":"haunted app","isEdited":false,"userName":"Frankie L."}},{"id":"6179738120","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:14:22Z","review":"He hurts my feelings everytime I open the app. This app disappoints me very much I have never felt this bad about this app.","title":"Trash","isEdited":false,"userName":"ashely262"}}]}
