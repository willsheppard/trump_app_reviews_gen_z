Trump has not done anything he has promised us he would do. He also  has done NOTHING that he promised he would do. There is no point of this app. Also, it took almost a full day to download.

It killed all the bugs around my house and then somehow brought them back to live. They then created a cult to kill all the people that didn’t vote for him and harmed innocent bystanders. \n\n🦄🌺trump 2020✨🧚\u200D♀️☘️but on a tombstone🌈✨❤️","rating":1}}]}
