What kind of president would do that to his First Lady?? The opening pic is also very scary because it looks like he’s crying and has small hands which isn’t very desirable from a president but I gave this app a chance and it failed 😒"}},{"id":"6177383018","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Former Trump Lover","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:32:30Z","review":"I recently got this app and ever since my phone has been very laggy! Really disappointed overall, I wanted to support our President but this app makes it very difficult! It also keeps popping up with unnecessary ads that have nothing to do with the election??? Very bad! Would never buy this again!

I first opened the app to see an orange monkey looking back at me. I was surly frightened. I do not recommend getting this app. It’s a waste of time and the only thing it does is take up storage space. I will be deleting this app immediately and washing my eyes. No one should have to see an orange monkey. It’s just not right. This app deserves to be banned. Thank you and have a good day."}},{"id":"6177208152","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"rachelb473","title":"Terrible😔","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:12Z","review":"when I got this app I really didn’t expect to see trumps face right away. quite honestly it scared me so bad I threw my phone across the room. overall, a quite terrible experience. they should put a warning that you have to see such a thing when you open the app. writing this review to protect future children from the same fate I suffered. 🙈🙈🙈🙈"}}]}
