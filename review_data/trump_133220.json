Had good info & looked nice. \n\nThen, I started to notice my skin starting to have this faint peachy tint and my hair was turned this piss yellow color. I didn’t think it had any connection with the app\n\nThen, a few weeks later, I noticed that I had gradually gained 50 lbs!! WTH!!! \n\nThe app would make random screeching and whining noises if I weren’t giving it attention\n\nso I went to my doctors and they asked me if I had any change in routine. \nI mean not really, we’re all in quarantine!! \n\nSo then that got me thinking. I recently downloaded this app!! So I deleted the app and won’t be downloading it again 🤢🤢","isEdited":false,"title":"wouldn’t recommend","date":"2020-07-08T20:14:45Z","rating":1,"userName":"tiktokforpres"}},{"id":"6173583723","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I did not what so ever like this app it keep glitching and keep kicking me out of the app so I’m giving it a horrible review.

I downloaded this app to see what people find this app bad about it. I didn’t think it would be this bad! When I downloaded this app, I was just looking at stuff. I was getting tired and left to sleep. After I woke up, I looked in the mirror and I was ORANGE 🍊! I was disgusted. I don’t know how people can live with a Cheeto powder skin color 😔.  Then I remembered that I downloaded this app. I will delete this horrible app right after I write about how disgusting and disappointed I am in this app. I hope this app gets taken down, and also hope that my skin goes back to normal. ✨✨🤦\u200D♀️✌️","isEdited":false,"title":"This app ✨sucks✨","date":"2020-07-08T20:14:31Z","rating":1,"userName":"puhtar mardre"}},{"id":"6173582507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"For some strange reason, the app just won't open 🤔💅.
