I downloaded this app just to see what it was all about but it would randomly start crashing and glitching a lot! This is prob the worst app that I’ve ever downloaded. ALSO IF YOU SUPPORT TRUMP YOU SUPPORT XENOPHOBIA \n, HOMOPHOBIA, RACISM, SEXUAL ASSAULT, and MISOGYNY. Who ever was going to vote for Trump should educate themselves first. He is the biggest racist! Our own president is such an awful and disgusting person. Wow such a role model!!! 🤢🤮","userName":"agdgkdkg","date":"2020-07-09T21:50:26Z"}},{"id":"6178319778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This is horrible😎","review":"I hate this dumb app it is absolutely horrendous!

Also if this was a free country he wouldn’t have sent people back to their country because of their race. Plus if he wanted to make America great again he would stop what he is doing and try to fix everything that is happening and stop being racist.","userName":"dreadoll1992","date":"2020-07-09T21:20:59Z"}},{"id":"6178276893","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"⭐️totally not from social media ⭐️","review":"Shawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay\nShawty's like a melody in my head\nThat I can't keep out\nGot me singin' like\nNa na na na everyday\nIt's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)\nHey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober\nI got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover\nOn my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga\nSo down on the line make me want a cold soda\nHey baby be my radio\nHear you everywhere I go\nMusic in my head\nKnow your melody in every note\nGirl you incredible\nMake yourself available\nNa na na na\nThat tune so exceptional\nSexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready\nWe can make plans get body stand if you let me\nGirl I'm a…","userName":"xxrainbow pawxx","date":"2020-07-09T21:18:38Z"}},{"id":"6178247277","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst app","review":"I was just looking at the big orange when opening the app and it gave me a bad vibe like almost like it it was watching me I then proceeded to text him on Instagram to tell him abt his stupid app and even proceeded to make a joke like why did the chicken cross the road and I said a word in Spanish he then didn’t answer but instead I went to my room and the app\nStarted staying I hate trump so the app is a whole glitch and trump can’t take joke","userName":"nooooooooooo °","date":"2020-07-09T21:07:49Z"}},{"id":"6178210261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No❤️","review":"When I opened the app some song started playing and  it said “Shawty’s👩🏾like a melody🎵in my head 🧠that i can’t keep out❌got me singing like✍️nananana👄everyday😿like my iPod📱 stuck in replay🔄” and then my cat jumped on my head and started do the Macarena🙀 and then I was like “ꪮꫝ 💞ꪶꪮꪜꫀꪶꪗ🌲 ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ 👁ꪮꫝ👹 ρꪊ𝘴𝘴ꪗ👑 ꪑꪗ 😩ꪶꪮꪜꫀ” so then the my fav prez🍊popped up on the screen and said “🧸WHAT💜THE😬fAaAaAaAack☺️WHO😄IN🤷\u200D♀️THE😭HELL😍PUT🤯THE😑MUFFINS🤢IN🤗THE😤FREZZZAAA😈” then I was like “ i😴hope🤞🏽you 💩break🤐your🥴freakin👺spinal👽 cord🤠” so in the end #KANYE2020","userName":"cc‼️","date":"2020-07-09T20:54:34Z"}},{"id":"6178181776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"I downloaded this app so I can worship my favorite angry orange baby man, but the app is pure trash! When I first got it everything seemed fine, but then it started talking to my girlfriend. She left me for this app! Then, rubbing salt in my wounds, the app stole my best friend. After crying for days on end I finally confronted the app. He called me a little baby and beat me up! I tried the press charges but the police sided with the app! 1/5 stars for being a home wrecker and a face wrecker","userName":"✨👉🏻👈🏻🥺","date":"2020-07-09T20:44:34Z"}},{"id":"6178178369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Glitches/Racist","review":"I do not appreciate how donald trump set up this program, how disgraceful and irrelevant it is and it’s not even a good app, including all the glitches, lag, keeps loging me out. so in that matter i feel as if there is no use for this app at all. there’s the news if your really interested in donalds trump racist and immature acts. i myself and a lot of other people don’t approve of this app, so i thank the people for making america great again!!","userName":"Anthony Barrige","date":"2020-07-09T20:43:24Z"}},{"id":"6178167780","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"remember the times we had🤔✨🧚","review":"Hello.
