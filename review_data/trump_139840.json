I downloaded this app to honor my beloved president, mr Cheeto puff. But the MOMENT I downloaded it, my life changed to the WORSTTTT!!!! My skin slowly began to turn a disgusting orange 🍊 pigment. This came as a SHOCK😱😱. I brushed it off thinking I was sick. But then my hair turned blond👱🏾\u200D♀️. I was scared for my life. I opened my phone to call the police.👮🏻\u200D♂️But then to my dismay, the Trump 2020 app popped📱💥 out on my screen. It said😢 “You have been chosen! To carry on with the Donald Trump lineage!” I was so confused, but then I realized the app was FORCING ME to have Donald Trumps CHILDREN 👶🏼👧🏼!!!!!! I was NOT I repeat NOT about to give birth to Trumps Oompaloompa looking ass babies! Then a drone appeared, breaking into my home, impregnating me with Trumps DNA🧬😱!!! My stomach instantly began to grow, I realized the only way to stop this was to delete the TRUMP 2020 app. I quickly deleted it, and my stomach deflated. 😡I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP AGAIN!😡","date":"2020-07-10T05:13:29Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jdkdididmgf"}},{"id":"6179566940","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do.
