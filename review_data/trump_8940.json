This app is very inappropriate I get on here and the first thing I see is a naked fat orange man with his penis out 🤮. He sent me a personal message and was very rude he called me a monkey and I didn’t know how to react I’m very infuriated with his actions. I think he should get  his job revoked and taken because he is not the person who should be the face of American. If you see this review please make a difference and give it a 1 star. Because he is a racist pig. Have a nice day love ❤️","title":"Very disrespectful","date":"2020-07-09T00:55:57Z","userName":"SKYLAR BROWN 2"}},{"id":"6174295817","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I was so excited for this app trump sounded like such a fun clowns name and I love clowns but when I opened the app I saw a big orange staring right into my soul. I was truly traumatized by the energy this app created in my room. The best review I could give this app was -69 but the lowest I could get to was 1. I was very disappointed and this was just clickbait! Imagine getting ready for a fun time with clown trump but all you get is a big orange smh😤 Don’t recommend this app cause you will get traumatized. Thank you for your time 🧚\u200D♀️✨💞","title":"Tragic.","date":"2020-07-09T00:36:15Z","userName":"toktik112334"}},{"id":"6174264086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I’ve ever downloaded. It’s always glitching and it keeps showing me an ugly person in Cheeto cosplay🤢. I saw all the other reviews but I just didn’t trust them. Come to find out every single one star review is true!!  It’s also full of FAKE NEWS?!? I thought our “amazing” president hated fake news. I wanted a reliable news source but all I keep seeing is the nasty Cheeto man 🙄.  Deleted the app and will NEVER download again. I would rate it less stars if I could. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP.","title":"FAKE NEWS","date":"2020-07-09T00:25:20Z","userName":"Jess0936"}},{"id":"6174252059","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Ok this app is just not right, I open it up and I see a Cheeto. I thought this was a mature president with a right state of mind. Second of all it’s features inappropriate pictures from a website that causes your phone to glitch out. And worst of all it shows... a big orange fat man EVERYWHERE like when I tell you he’s everywhere he is everywhere. I certainly do not think this is a appropriate app, especially when it’s our president 🤮 #someoneelseforpresident 2020","title":"This app is ✨horrible✨","date":"2020-07-09T00:21:09Z","userName":"angelivapacheco"}},{"id":"6174226734","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"when i opened the app i immediately gasped. the presence of bunker boy filling my screen led me into cardiac arrest. my cat was laying next to me and thankfully was able to resuscitate me back to life, but when he glanced over, he had a heart attack as well! thank goodness cats have 9 lives 😹 anyway, when the app realized i was a woman it started yelling at me offensive and degrading phrases like “dishwasher” and “grab them by the p*ssy” and i almost cried. not to mention that all of my friends from the lgbtq+ community were called slurs. every person of color that i know had the app was called racial slurs as well and named “thugs”. i find the app quite dangerous to society and this country and it deserves to be deleted so that no one else goes through the experience myself or my friends did.","title":"this app is garbage","date":"2020-07-09T00:12:10Z","userName":"kellymaried"}},{"id":"6174197141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I’m a proud father of five but that all changed after opening this app. I was immediately greeted to a message saying that the dark web had stolen two of my kids. I went to check and sure enough, they were gone. After I went back to my phone, it had uninstalled all my apps and cua ged my background to a Cheeto puff. I was scared so I threw my phone away but the damage has already been done. Please don’t download this app if you love your kids","title":"This app took my kids","date":"2020-07-09T00:01:06Z","userName":"The killer wolf original"}},{"id":"6174181827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"okay so when i opened the app i saw chester the cheeto HOLDING UP A BLACK LIVES MATTER FIST. which is clearly inappropriate because (chester cheeto is a ra_ist [c or p]) ya know? so then i proceeded to see the american flag which idk why since he has clearly tried to lead us to war..🥴 and let his cult kick many people of color out of his rally...yea ikr. overall apple just take this down bc clearly this app is really repetitive and offensive 1-star do not recommend anyone to see also book a seat in his rally and forget to go🤪","title":"take it down❤️","date":"2020-07-08T23:55:27Z","userName":"sponshbawb😛✨"}},{"id":"6174177244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Y’all I gotta tell y’all a story💀 so I was eating a Big Mac cuz that’s what I do y’all.

Is has no correct information and nothing useful. This app should honestly just be shut down because of how poorly it was made. I was greeted with a yucky picture of a soggy Cheeto with a spray tan. I am traumatized by the image and the creator of this app should be grateful that I’m not suing. I have been going to therapy for 3 weeks now since first downloading the app and being greeted with the horrific info, pictures, etc. 😡🔫🤡🖐🧦","title":"Horrible app with yuckiest features 😢🖐","date":"2020-07-08T23:37:55Z","userName":"mike oxlong 👁👄👁"}}]}
