Trump himself, in which he simply stated that I was a stinky doodie head. My feelings were crushed, but what’s worse is that he later flew a helicopter over my house, landed, and came inside just to punt my baby to the next town over 😢. I have yet to find her, and it’s getting close to her nap time.","date":"2020-07-08T15:49:18Z","userName":"doodoochump2020","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172694269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump is the worst 🙄🙄🙄🙄👎👎👎👎","review":"The only reason I downloaded the app is because I was the TikTok is getting deleted from USA 🇺🇸 sooo TikTok is trying to get the app to a 1 star.

I quickly realized the we had given our dog a chew toy of our loving president 🥰❤️ and now he wants to attack him every time he sees him. So I could use the app. The app also took forever to download and isn’t even useful I-. Bottom line is DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-08T14:59:50Z","userName":"shawtys like a melody...","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172554818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Ya boi","review":"It is actually appalling to see grown men and women so ignorant of what is right and wrong. It is quite the sight to see that the “older and more intelligent” generation slowly bring their country to war with each other over the fact that someone is different and not white. There is evidence of every disgusting thing Donald Trump has done and still, you chose to support him.","date":"2020-07-08T14:51:30Z","userName":"SentimentalJello","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172554235","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"he stole my dog","review":"i downloaded the app to see what all the fuss was about😔 then the next day😱 i woke up to see a fat bob the builder lookin man in my bedroom stealing my dog😡😭 🧚🏼\u200D♀️ i don’t how he did it😡 but now my dog is gone and ALSO now all the sudden my tv doesn’t work?

With all the dysfunction and security issues, I can’t believe it’s still on the App Store!! I know China has all my info now and it’s because of none other than Donald J. trump. This app is a disgrace to the world, and I will be deleting it straight after this","date":"2020-07-08T14:28:28Z","userName":"ccarr1234","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172154536","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The worst possible outcome for the United States of America","review":"Donald Trump is the absolute worst president in my or my parents life time. At no point would I ever, under any circumstances, EVER vote for this piece of human filth. Donald tax “breaks” nearly took my return. He’s racist, sexist, misogynistic, pig headed, soft brained, and all around a bad night human being let alone a government official. I would vote for a turkey sandwich before I vote him back in office.","date":"2020-07-08T13:01:24Z","userName":"Dimitrihill","isEdited":false}}]}
