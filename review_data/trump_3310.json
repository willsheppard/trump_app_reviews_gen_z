I came on this app because I was trying to get the hype on this righty lord and savior orange man that everyone is so excited about. But as soon as I got on the app I was unfortunately greeted by this gross crying picture of an old orange man and it was honestly not what I needed to see this morning. After almost throwing up I powered through but the app wouldn’t let me move forward without putting my phone number in. And if you ask me that 70-year-old greasy boi is the last man I want having my number. So I had to walk away—although hard—in order to maintain my rights to privacy. It was an unfortunate event downloading this app and I wouldn’t wish it on even my worst enemy.","userName":"former orange enthusiast"}},{"id":"6177040114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:55:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app hurt my family","review":"I opened the app to support our local ✨𝔀𝓱𝓲𝓽𝓮 𝓼𝓾𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓶𝓪𝓼𝓲𝓼𝓽✨but when I opened the app an ugly Cheeto greeted me, and me and my grandma went into cardiac arrest, I woke up after my family chanted black lives matter in a meaningful way, but my grandma was long gone. We had to put on a funeral for her, which was actually a rally where we used her casket as a battering ram to knock down white suprematists (such as Donald Trump) and me and my family could feel my grandma smiling down from heaven as we slammed sis white republican fatsos to the ground. I miss my grandma very much and it is all this apps fault, I cannot even comprehend why this man is so self centered that he needs his own app on top of everything else.","userName":"Olivia Penzotti"}},{"id":"6177027197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"I was too hopeful","review":"I really do love trump so so much but unfortunately when I downloaded the app, it kept crashing, there was fireworks on every part of the page I would scroll on. This was quite ridiculous and honestly a waste of time. I don’t like to watch any news because it’s all fake and biased so I wanted to check out the TRUMP 2020 app. I most definitely think trump is the most best option but honestly I’m probably voting for Biden (#settleforbiden2020) because this app was a huge disappointment for me. Also, trumps slogan, ‘keep America great’ is also pretty horrible because America isn’t that great at all actually and he keeps lying to the American people, and for that reason,            IM OUT!!!","userName":"#settłeforbiden2020"}},{"id":"6177025531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:51:31Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Disappointing","review":"Right from the start there were issues because to download this app I had to type “Trump” next to “2020” and those two things together do NOT sit right with me. Next I had to look at this large, orange man and remember that he is the actual, current president of the US and this was not some insane dream. I hate everything about this app, when I opened it my entire family actually died and I had a vision that I was next. Nothing but bad luck from this app. If I could give it a 0/5 stars I would. If you want everyone you know and love to pass away immediately then download this app but if you want to live a happy life I suggest you look somewhere else!","userName":"👁👄👁 not sorry"}},{"id":"6176921790","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:23:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app","review":"So I wanted to keep up with trumps rally’s and election but the app took a whole 24 hours to finally download. Once it did I opened the app and it asked for my phone number. I put in my number then my phone went blank and completely shut down. I turned my phone back on and my lock screen and home screen were pictures of trump. I scared as I was frightened by the sight of his orange face. I went back into the app to see what was going on then my phone stared glitching. Then I got a notification that the U.S government has all my information now and I DID NOT authorize that. I HATE THIS APP and now I need a new phone because it will not let me change my lock screen and wallpaper.","userName":"shiyanadore"}},{"id":"6176871323","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:10:36Z","isEdited":false,"title":"absolute trash (just like trump)","review":"i mean i don’t know what i was expecting, anything involving rotten cheeto man is horrendous. i mean i’m never really speechless, because i am an eloquently spoken gen-zer, but this app has rendered me speechless. just the absolute worst app to exist on ANY platform. it even made my diabetes act up just by clicking on it. the longer it’s on my phone the more i get worried about how much it will tarnish my precious handheld device. this app should NOT exist it is useless just like the president himself. i genuinely think i may have to sue because it is causing my vision to slowly deteriorate every time i see it on my home screen. so please next time you put an app in the app store make sure it’s not garbage.","userName":"Iava a"}},{"id":"6176761029","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:41:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Why can’t I give it less than one star!!????😡","review":"This is the worst app I have ever downloaded in my life, and that is saying a lot considering that I also have the Fox News app. I downloaded it, and as soon as I opened it I was overwhelmed by the amount of fake news and pictures of a spray painted Cheeto. I saw a picture of the same Cheeto holding up the Bible, but I guess that he never actually read it because of the stuff I have seen him do. And he was also supporting some weird stuff saying that white lives matter (as if they didn’t before), but he’s orange so I don’t think it even applies to him. Anyways, I had to delete it because I was kinda scared of that thing, ngl. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

I thought this app would cure my deep sadness and very intimate and fond love for Donald Jenius Trump but it made it worse. I feel as though I must vote for Joe Biden because Donald Jenius Trump has not contacted me directly in the app. Quite rude. He believes he has a busy schedule but I have a life of my own as well. I wanted to speak to the love of my life and he wouldn’t accept that. I plan on writing an article in my new blog about his indecency and disgusting character in my article of raw truth. All of my girlies and lawyers will hear about this. I will gain custody of my son. I love you Barron, Mommy will see you soon❤️","userName":"JasonReject1234"}},{"id":"6176608075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:01:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!","review":"I got this app hoping it would make\nAmerica good. Little did I know that I took 10 years to download ;-;.Once it downloaded I saw an orange old clown on the screen 🤨🤔. Is that supposed to be there? The orange clown what so scary I almost threw my phone and puked 🤢. I showed my family and they almost went blind. I showed my cuzin and she threw up so much that she got yeeted all the way to my home. I expected better this is the worst app ever please don’t download it you could go blind you could throw up and you could possibly die. I can’t believe that the creator of this app put that orange old clown once you download the app it was just It was just so eww🤢. Never download this app and stay safe.
