Once I reached it, the app asked for my phone number which of course I gave, but soon after, MILLIONS of texts started flooding my phone. I couldn’t do anything about it, my phone was so laggy because the texts just kept coming through. I ended up THROWING my phone off a bridge because I was so angry. I’m not sure if Trump will be getting my vote this election... just because of this. Anyways. I eventually got a new phone to write this review, but this was a TERRIBLE waste of my time. Don’t download this app😤😤😤","isEdited":false,"title":"Made me throw my phone off a bridge","date":"2020-07-09T13:02:52Z","rating":1,"userName":"Catlover 711"}},{"id":"6176518149","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app took up all of my storage and ruined my “country”(my phone). When I first opened the app there was a inappropriate and terrifying picture and when I clicked the sign in button it asked me for information about myself that I felt was not okay to be asking someone on a simple campaign app. I felt that the messages I was seeing on the page were also quite offensive. So I tried to delete the app but it still took up all of my storage and would not be “impeached” from my phone. The bright orange and yellow coloring of the home page also made me very uncomfortable. Overall very bad experience.","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgusting, Wasteful and Inappropriate.","date":"2020-07-09T12:36:36Z","rating":1,"userName":"MarianaFoster"}},{"id":"6176163181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Do not download!!

I came onto the app with 99% battery and left with 2% battery. All in 2 minutes. And when I tried clicking it again it kept directing me to a website advertising for biking helmets for cats. While I can admit that on Saturday, I was planning to bike around with my cat Artephius, and that the Trump 2020 app was notably accurate with my current needs, I needed the app for Trump updates and notifications, not oddly specific pop up ads. My cat Artephius would not be proud. I will not forget to mention that after a few attempts at setting a notification for the next rally, covfefe. I cannot stress how BAD this app is.","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER DO NOT DOWNLOAD","date":"2020-07-09T10:08:40Z","rating":1,"userName":"andrea.nala"}},{"id":"6175903339","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I tried to download this app for fun and it took 4 years, I honestly forgot about it. Anyways when I clicked on it my phone immediately exploded right in my hands causing my hands to severely burn and I had to go to the emergency room but it was filled up with people who had the exact same problem, since there was so many people there it took them a while to get to me and by the time they did my hands were too damaged to save and I had to get them amputated, anyways I wanted to see if the app was even worth it so I downloaded it on my new phone and that one exploded too and killed me, now I am dead and sending this review as a ghost.","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE","date":"2020-07-09T09:30:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"Pinnapple32"}},{"id":"6175824933","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i downloaded the app to see how terrible it could be then all of a sudden these men wearing all black entered my house and started attacking my cat. then they dropkicked my grandma down the stairs. i got up to check my phone only to see it on fire, the screen lit up saying “VOTE TRUMP 2020 OR ELSE WE WILL FIND YOU” they found me and killed my cat. my grandma is doing better now but since healthcare costs so much we are in a lot of debt. needless to say i will be giving this app a 1 star rating and i think everyone else should too❤️✨(bunker boy if you are reading this i hope you find a better color for you than cheeto puff orange)\n-hugs and kisses (jk you nasty racist pig)","isEdited":false,"title":"this app killed my cat😾","date":"2020-07-09T09:04:27Z","rating":1,"userName":"poo poo pee pee🙈"}},{"id":"6175810083","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! I downloaded to be a well-informed and supportive citizen of the wonderful amazing United States of America, but instead it ruined my life. I think I almost went blind from opening the app from the horrible imagery and text that was shown. The content was absolutely sickening and disgusting, truly nothing that anyone should have to experience in their lifetime. Even worse, it took forever to download, and made my phone start acting up and glitching like crazy!! \n\nI repeat GETTING THIS APP IS A TERRIBLE DECISION, A WASTE OF TIME, TERRIBLE FOR YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL WELLBEING, WILL WRECK YOUR PHONE, AND RUIN YOUR LIFE!!!!!!\nTERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!!! DESERVES A NEGATIVE STAR RATING (but unfortunately the lowest I can give is a 1)","isEdited":false,"title":"Such a disappointment","date":"2020-07-09T08:59:30Z","rating":1,"userName":"taliajade18"}},{"id":"6175587548","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I have nothing good to say about this app. 😪 First of all, it took 9 months to download! I had my beautiful baby girl Taintlyn in that time! 😡 Second off all, when the app actually downloaded, it seemed to have hack my phone and flood my phone with Fan Boy and Chum Chum smut and uploaded it to the family cloud! My oldest, Ryder who is only TEN YEARS OLD KEEP IN MIND saw that unholy sight! 🤬🤬 Now he has nightmares every single night and keeps muttering in his sleep “Chum Chum Can Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba me into the ground any day” and wakes up in a cold sweat. That’s a nightly routine now. All I have to say is tut tut, shame on you. This app nearly made me rip my bangs straight out of my head. If I could give it 0 starts I would! 😤😤😡😡","isEdited":false,"title":"Jack Ingof","date":"2020-07-09T07:41:55Z","rating":1,"userName":"Jillpickle123"}},{"id":"6175534325","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I would give it zero if i could. This app took forever to download and was a complete waste of time. As soon as i got on it hacked my phone and i wasn’t able to have any rights anymore. This app suddenly took away all my information and discriminated against me and my friends over something they can’t control. It even started placing bans on basic human rights that i was born with. Funny thing though how my family supports this app when it has done nothing but ruin the internet for everyone. The fact that people still download and support this is app is shocking even though it’s ruined so many lives.
