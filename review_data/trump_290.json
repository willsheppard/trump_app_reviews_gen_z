But he left me his toupee as a souvenir so although I could no longer perceive him through occupital photons, I could still stroke his fragile toupee with care just like his ego🌚. But don't download unless you want to lose your most important sense. By that I mean vision but now thinking about it also your common sense.","title":"😰Something shocking showed up to my house😰","userName":"Rosie Jojo","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T06:22:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174977865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The minute I opened the app my phone gave me a notification saying I got 69 new viruses right then I knew I f up big time. When mr orange texted me he said heyyyy and sent me a pic at first I didn’t know what it was. I searched and I searched till I found what I think was meant to be a nude I had found his micropeen by then it was too late for my virgin eyes to erase. I didn’t know what to do so I left him on open he then proceeded to ask me how old I am of course I told him my age and that I’m underage and he said perfect just like I like them. I was terrified didn’t know what to do he said he already began the process of tracking me. I got scared so I deleted the app. Then I got a message from and unknown number saying I could never leave him and that he knows I’m Latina he said he doesn’t usually like them but for me he will make the exception and would let me come to his country if I f him. I declined and told him to leave me alone when he told me that I would regret that. He sent hitmen after me I am currently on the run and trying to survive plz listen to me don’t download this app especially if u r underage.

Who in their right minds let an orange with a blonde wig become president and make this app? I simply hate the idea of having the annoying orange become president for 4 more years 🥰 i would give this app 0 stars but I am being forced to give it 1 star. I opened the app and all was going well until I noticed rats and roaches coming in from the outside. Fruit flies as well 🤢 they were all attracted to the horrible stench of orange coming from the app. Don’t ask me how it’s possible but his smell is so strong it attracted all the creatures. The rotting smell of orange was disgusting. The rats came into my house holding Trump2020 signs and some were holding the American flag. It was truly horrible. The rats took over my house and I was forced to leave. I am now homeless all bc an orange chose to run for president. The rats ate my sister and pet dog while I was forced to watch. They then sold my brother to the rich white people and they sacrificed him to satan. They called animal control on my other sister. Please give this app a 1 Star and save yourselves. I couldn’t save my family but you still have a chance. DO NOT VOTE THIS ORANGE FOR PRESIDENT","title":"🍊🍊","userName":"Kawaii Jelly","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:33:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173671488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"this is the worst app ever 🤬😾😿🙀😤i can’t believe that the app store still has it up when i tried to download it my phone completely broke down and would not turn on at all i took it to the apple store and they said it had the worst virus they had ever come across and they traced it back to the trump app🙀🙀😾😡😳i was so angry ‼️i just had to write this review. the apple store said that i would need a new phone bc of the virus 🦠 and that i had to pay for it😡🤬but i didn’t even break my phone so i called the president and told him to pay for it and he said no and sent the fbi to my house and take me away so rn i am in and fbi holding cell all bc of this app thanks a lot 🍊i have 3 cats at home and who is looking after them? nobody thanks to this stupid app😢😡🤬😾😾😿🙀😰this app will ruin your life i just got the info that i will be kept here forever so take my advice and DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU VALUE YOU LIFE💕✨😻😘...anyways what do y’all want from mcdonald’s🤩 also just a word of advice trumpy you’d be angering a whole generation of ppl who already hate you a lot. i’d be careful😽😻🎃🥰🤩🤪","title":"worst app ever!!😾⚠️WARNING DO NOT GET⚠️","userName":"🍊hater101","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:45:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173480288","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible. \nWhen I first opened the app, tons and tons of ads to buy maga “merch” started to pop up. Now, I am a struggling highschool student in need of a job because I was just kicked out of my parents house for supporting our amazing president. I only have less than 100 dollars to my name, so when I opened the app I just expected news on the president and rally’s that he is holding. But was I in for a surprise. Every time I went to click something, an ad to buy his merch would pop up. I was very good at avoiding them but one time I wasn’t so lucky. It made me buy OVER 100 DOLLARS OF MAGA MERCH. Now like I stated earlier, I do not have that type of money. So it charged my card (even though I had given it no information on my bank) and now I am in crippling debt. I was expecting to write a positive review and prove all of those “TikTokers” wrong, but now I cannot do such thing. My heart has been broke too many times, I don’t know what to believe anymore. So, from downloading this app It has caused me to go into a depression. No job will let me apply, or except my application. I would like a refund, for my pride and my money.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Rae Cista","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:39:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6171976069","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"0/10 HORRIBLE I was mortified when I opened the app you won’t believe how they greeted me I saw his  adipose, fatty, greasy, lipid, oily,oleaginous,suety FACE not that I’m completing and it asked me for my phone number RED FLAG I should have known the next day I was getting phone calls from these peasants asking for my PIN number at first I thought these are just a bunch of teenage kids who need to grow up  but I was wrong but I decided to give it another try because I love my president and I need to respect him not to barge but I had 100,000 in my bank and I woke up with only $10 don’t get this app!!!!!!!!!

So, like one does, I entered my number. As soon as I did that I started getting messages from unknown numbers telling me to “vote for trump or else🍊” As you can imagine, this was very unsettling, so I turned on the tv to get my mind off of it, but every channel was playing shows about why oranges are so great. This was odd, but then a package came to my door. When I opened the package 25 oranges spilled out of the box. I didn’t know why I kept seeing oranges, to be honest thought it had nothing to do with the app until everything on the app turned orange. I wasn’t long after that that my house started turning orange. I went to feed my puppies and oranges came out of the dog food bag instead of actual dog food. Later that day the bag itself turned into an orange. Now my dogs have no food, and I can’t go to the store because my car turned into an orange as well. My puppies are hungry and it’s all because of this app. Do NOT download this app unless you support dogs being hungry and sad.","title":"my puppies are sad","userName":"doglover26🐶","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:03:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177170441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"It’s because trump is a bigoted racist, who only implements laws that benefit the wealthy and is actively trying to remove the various immigrants despite the nature of the U.S. being a melting pot of immigrant communities and so forth. Not to mention, under his supervision our country has the highest amount of coronavirus causes and he still does not support wearing a mask. When challenged on this, he has simply decided to “fire” or disassociate with the WHO, the leading scientific associate for world health. This man is a child, who simply believes he can impart his racist and xenophobic beliefs on the United States. No matter how they are glorified by racists, the confederate soldiers committed treason. By supporting those who dehumanized black people, the confederates, trump is a racist. There is an unbelievable list of horrific things such dictators of history like Stalin or even Hitler that Trump parallels. Yet, millions of people still blindly follow this man because they are to ignorant to realize what is happening around them. By making this review, I hope I can help change(even by a little) the direction of our nation and the world","title":"There’s a reason why people are trying to get rid of this app","userName":"ViperEye9","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:31:31Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176560116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"After I opened the app for the first time, I smelled something very strange. I looked all around the room for answers and eventually closed the app to do so. But when I closed the app, THE SMELL WENT AWAY??!?!!😤😢🥺👺 Now i can’t support my racist president without stinking😭The only explanation I can think of is that I smell Donald’s armpits through the app. 😫 But it doesn’t stop there pal, because when i opened the app again, walter pictures flooded my room. they were coming in from windows, air vents, drawers. WHERE DOES IT END😭 my parents heard all the ruckus and came to my rescue. i didn’t want them to know about this for bitten app so i hid it and said that i tried to purchase Walter off the dark web. my parents were so confused and disappointed that they got a divorce. as well and the person below me, and above\n👁👄👁\ni can’t even look at trumps beautiful citrus colored face anymore without thinking that HE is the one who forced my parents to split🍌. when i was staying with my mom, all i could watch on the tv was the bee movie and at my dads it was all Walter videos. this is why i highly DONT recommend getting this app🧚🏻✨💖","title":"Stinky😢","userName":"$@4/€","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:48:06Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176151856","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"i tried this app and i’m sitting here with a brand new phone bought with all my life savings. i got the app and it got my information and wiped my phone that I've had for years with all memories in it. it first started when i got it there were some glitches but i didn’t pay attention to it... then many ads came on not normal ones DIRTY ones!! i got mad then refreshed later people called from different areas and spoke in foreign languages and then it said i should do dirty stuff when I translated it. it had to do with racist and homophobic activities then it kept on taking me to inappropriate online sites and dating apps then my phone’s wallpaper suddenly changed to something written with “daddy trump” and then it started playing foreigner (pop smoke) and then my phone’s camera roll started changing to Donald trump’s nude photo and in like 3 minutes i was staring at so many nude photos of trump.... later on my phone went black and i charged it then i saw it was a new phone saying i should set it up and i did then it was a different language. and i come back her DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP I AM WARNING YOU!!!!!!!!!","title":"TERRIBLE!!!
