You may ask why, well first of all I OPEN THE APP TO SEE LEAKED PHOTOS OF A CHEETOS PP🤢🤮 SECOND OF ALL I SEE A CHEETO PLAYING TENNIS. WHY IS THIS APP SO OBSESSED WITH CHEETOS🙄. Now here’s something good about the app :) the Cheeto pictures in here are so disgusting it would make you want to kill yourself😝 this app will also hack your bank account and steal your money. Not to mention it will send an old white man who supports trump to kill your pets😱 PLEASE be safe and vote for BIDEN2020 I don’t like him either but it’s better that a Cheeto being in office again🥰","rating":1}},{"id":"6174525673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Klpswish","date":"2020-07-09T01:46:58Z","title":"WORST APP WILL KILL YOUR EYES","isEdited":false,"review":"This app made my pet fish fall out of the Bed. This app also made my whole room smell like Cheetos and I’m lactose and tolerant. I’m writing this review on the toilet from throwing up. No to mention I’ve experienced extreme trauma from looking at the tramp I mean trump. My eyes won’t stop crying my mom recommenced sending them to therapy. I can’t afford that so for reparations of making my eyes sad can you give me a small lone of a million dollars.

I do not recommend u download this app if u appreciate your eyes and overall happiness/wellbeing. Anyways I’m gonna go on Instagram and try to help my eyes become healthy again by looking at 🥵 men. Btw I also do not recommend if you do not want your furniture to start chanting noise about this orange trump (nO hAtE).

I nearly peed my pants. How would anyone not be scared of a huge Cheeto looking alien that not even The Doctor could see the good in l. I mean seriously there are children on this app, ( I mean he would like that wouldn’t he). It’s honestly not okay to trick good people like that. Next time have a warning up. Something like  “ This app contains horrible things and people and will frighten you out of your wits.”","rating":1}},{"id":"6174452855","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JeffDerntin","date":"2020-07-09T01:26:08Z","title":"My mom died...","isEdited":false,"review":"So it was just a normal day and I went on tik tok but I started hearing this rave that this app was actually really cool and allows access to Area 51 so I decided to download it, but to my surprise there was no Area 51!!! It was just a weird Cheeto puff instead..... but then I saw Donald trump and was reassured that I would get access to Area 51 but then when I walked outside my mom was right next to my pet human and I realized that my pet human ATE my MUM and I was SOOOO shocked when it tried to EAT me as well and I was forced to KILL IT and now I don’t have a mom or a pet....","rating":1}},{"id":"6174407474","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jungkooksmoisteyes","date":"2020-07-09T01:12:21Z","title":"Just... no❤️","isEdited":false,"review":"I didn’t expect to see my giant life sized alvin and the chipmunks 🐿 plushie start floating as soon as I downloaded the app🙄🤯🥰 not to mention his constant screeches of “NOT THE CHEETO MAN” 🥺🤦\u200D♀️🐻 it took a while to get him down and after I was very exhausted 💤😫😡 so I decided to take a nap 😴 and regain my energy and next thing I know is Trump is standing over me while wearing his merch 😝⛄️🥕 I started to get out of bed and run for my life 🥚 but the Cheeto man caught up and sprinted at me full speed 😭😣🤞 it was truly\n ✨t r a u m a t I z i n g✨ 0/10 do not recommend 👁👄👁💖","rating":1}},{"id":"6174384025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Islay2006","date":"2020-07-09T01:05:17Z","title":"pedo","isEdited":false,"review":"Trump supporters say facts over feelings but, then say he’s innocent when he doesn’t testify to his sexual harassment accusations, I found at least 25. If he was actually innocent then why won’t he testify? He has enough time to play golf why not testify? He and Epstein were know friends, Epstein was at trumps Mar-A-Loga party in 1992. Epstein a known person in sex trafficking, and Sexual assault, former-friends with the U.S. “president”. Bugs crawled out of my phone as soon as i opened the app too, think it might be filled with garbage, might want to check that out ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ\n\n-13","rating":1}},{"id":"6174377480","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Macmom79","date":"2020-07-09T01:03:18Z","title":"Disgusting and full of hate","isEdited":false,"review":"I opened up this app and was immediately faced with a picture completely vile in nature. Somehow the image and app caused an immediate visceral reaction that manifested by anger, feeling nauseous, and hate of all things Cheetos. I feel bad for Cheetos though because they never expected for their product to be used as context for this racist, homophobic, idiotic, and pathetic clown. If I could have left less than 1 Star, I would because no one should see images like that. I will now have nightmares of that picture.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174353459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"slimmy jimmmy","date":"2020-07-09T00:55:36Z","title":"Software issues.","isEdited":false,"review":"I recently downloaded this app to support mr trump. Unfortunately it does not work and every time I open it, the app takes FOREVER to load. It’s not my systems fault either I have an iPhone 11 65 Gb. Anyways. When it does manage to work, the information on this app is completely wrong! It’s factually incorrect. The formatting is also so bad! Nearly gave me a seizure! You’d think it’d be better since it’s owned by trump, a billionaire! Anyway. This app made me realize I should vote for joe Biden instead of trump this election.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174274488","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"poppy scoopy in my poopy","date":"2020-07-09T00:29:02Z","title":"THIS APP IS HORRENDOUS","isEdited":false,"review":"after deciding to download this app i soon got a knock on my front door and when i opened it it was ted bundy sitting on my porch. so after sitting with my buddy ted for a bit i went back inside. to see aliens in my home. they abducted me and im pretty sure im on the planet mars now. they have given me no food except roaches and thats gross. i will be taking MANY years of therapy for this app and i will have lots and lots of trauma. thats not even the worst part though the aliens burnt my house down so now Donald owes me a new house:(👁👄👁🌞😭👺👕🩳💪🤠🐟","rating":1}}]}
