Why would I ever want to support a racist homophobic sexist piece of trash. Oh! And don’t forget the multiple documents on him r*ping children! This isn’t a president. This is someone who belongs in prison. When the black lives matter movement was just beginning, he was too scared and hid in his bunker. This is your country trump. Don’t forget the tweet when he said “once the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Why are we shooting our own people when it’s the police who are causing this violence. We need a president who is gonna listen to his/her country, not go hide in a bunker. We’re not done fighting yet. This is only just begun. And we won’t stop until there is a change🥰✨🙈🧚\u200D♂️\n\n✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿"}},{"id":"6172454190","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"PepperThePig","date":"2020-07-08T14:23:38Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!","review":"as a trump supporter i am extremely disappointed by this app. 1: it made my phone glitch terribly. as i write this my phone is glitching. apple said there was nothing they could do about it. now i have to buy a new phone! 2: it took up all my data! i believe that this app should not take up this much space. 3: when i first opened this app it decreased 10% battery. at first i didn’t notice how much battery decreased so i went on some work calls. when i started the call my phone immediately died. i could go on and on about how bad this app is but these were the 3 main reasons. i’m sorry trump but i’m going to have to leave the republicans because of this app."}},{"id":"6172239015","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"susellinare","date":"2020-07-08T13:24:43Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"I’m very disappointed.","review":"At first, I was very excited to download this app because #45 is my favorite president. I wanted to buy merch through my phone because it’s more convenient for my lifestyle. For the first few days, everything was working smoothly. On the fourth day of using this app, it started glitching out and making my phone crash. I am not on any Beta  version and my phone hasn’t done this before I downloaded this app.\n\nThis app shouldn’t be a thing. It doesn’t work well and it is full of horrible promises just like our little friend Trump. Get him out of the Oval Office! My grandma died from a seizure due to the glitches this app produced. What am i supposed to do now without a grandma???"}},{"id":"6177788884","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mad bts army___","date":"2020-07-09T18:37:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Yuckyyy 🤮","review":"I got this app to check out my FAVORITE 😍😍 president!!!!! After the app took 4 YEARS! To download, Trumps presidency was basically over at that point 👁💧👄💧👁. I missed all the rallies. During that four years I wasn’t able to access my phone, THE TRUMP APP TOOK OVER!!!! If I was ever able to access my phone there was just trumps face everywhere!!!! I had to go get my phone reset because of it and lost all my data! 😪😪😪😪😪 after all that time I realized that trump is horrible for doing this to people. Hacking their phones? And making them get new ones 😪 Getting more money for the government 😡😡 he is greedy and stupid. I should’ve never downloaded this nasty yucky app. Kim Namjoon 2020 💖"}},{"id":"6177736319","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bxudbevurjejshhsusdbbd","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:34Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"BLM","review":"This app is the worst app ever!! I tried to enter the app, but it refused to let me enter, and when I pressed it for the final time, my phone glitched out and a message that said Obama 2020🤩🥳💅🏾but make it Michelle💅🏾😭🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨ appeared on my screen and it stayed that way for hours on end until it shut down completely. From that point on, whenever I opened an app it crashed almost immediately and that same message seen above popped up to the point where no app on my phone (iPhone 7 btw) worked except for the App Store and I now need to buy a new one. So I hope that 🍊orange Cheeto🍊 will pay for my phone and all it’s bills from this point on. Obama 2020🤩🥳💅🏾but make it Michelle💅🏾😭🧚🏽\u200D♀️✨PERIOD."}},{"id":"6177545434","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Bella Ella Aye","date":"2020-07-09T17:21:21Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Yes.","review":"My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible.

Not exactly sure what y’all are trying to play these days. But I thought I leave this message here: The first thing of a dictator does when they decide to take over a country is get rid of the media or control the media. This is against our freedom of speech so the Trump administration trying to take down a social media platform purely out of frustration, is a violation of our FIRST Amendment rights. Now for good measure I think I’ll leave some of my favorite quotes from Hamilton the musical here: “ raise a glass to freedom, something they can never take away.” \n\n“ because when push comes to shove, I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love.” (King George) \n\n“have you an ounce of regret? You accumulate debt you accumulate power and yet in their hour of need you forget.”\n\n“he’d have you all unravel at the sound of screams but the revolution is coming The Have-Nots are gonna win this(...) It’s hard to listen to you with a straight face” (Hamilton) \n\nDear Donald Trump,\n“I hope that you burn.” (Elizabeth Schuyler)"}},{"id":"6177291213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Avim1r","date":"2020-07-09T16:06:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Got hacked","review":"Ok so normally I’m not one to get political, but I heard some really good things about this app so I had to see what the hype was all about. Anyway, I downloaded it, entered my number, started browsing the app, and then my phone started getting blown up with calls about a refund Microsoft was trying to give me for a recent purchase. Since these calls wouldn’t stop, I finally picked up and then after two hours of trying to figure out how to get the refund on the phone, the person on the other end screamed “SIKE! TRUMP 2020” and hung up on me. I also realized upon returning to use my phone that all of my contacts had been renamed after Trump’s family, friends, and advisors."}},{"id":"6177175835","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Taleah✨","date":"2020-07-09T15:33:03Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"worst ever . ✨","review":"when I opened this app a clowned popped up and I’m really scared of them . I was drinking some orange juice and I spilled it all over my laptop . not only did I had to get a new laptop I had to get some new orange , now the creature popped up he looked a lot like my ✨orange✨ juice . So now I don’t drink because it reminds me a lot like the clown that popped up on my screen . So I went to get me some chocolate milk and when I walked downstairs I saw a orange in a suit in my kitchen and ran for my life and he kept chasing me , at this point I fainted and when I woke up he was gone but I could still see him some how , overall if you don’t want this to happen to you then rate this app a 1 Star and write a bad review ."}}]}
