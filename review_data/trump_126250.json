I have now lost all of my beautiful pictures of poop collages 😭. My turkey videos are gone as well and pretty much everything I’ve ever had on this phone is gone.  I’ve worked so hard on them and now they are all gone! Not only that but the app will not open. I’ve essentially lost all that is important to me all because I wanted to be apart of the trump train 😭😭😭. If you value your phone and memory’s, do not download this app, I should have known when I saw the ratings.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:39:54Z"}},{"id":"6178488084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely terrible. -100/10.","userName":"life360sucksbootyhole","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded the app for more information on rallies that trump has scheduled. The app took all day to download, and when it finally did I tried to open the app and it crashed. This continued to happen every time I opened the app. Three days go by and I finally get the app to open but it’s so unorganized that I can’t even figure out what’s going on or what I’m looking at. It’s EXTREMELY hard to navigate. I ended up just deleting it because of sheer frustration and being fed up with trying to get the app to cooperate. It also took up a LOT of storage so don’t download it if phone storage is something you already struggle with. I want to say I’m disappointed but in all honesty I’m not surprised.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:39:24Z"}},{"id":"6178487591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤮","userName":"Scrunchio","rating":1,"review":"Horrible absolutely horrible. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T22:39:12Z"}},{"id":"6178485311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"He tried but app is horrible","userName":"gdhdjisoskbxvc","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded trump 2020 because I believe in his ability to make America great again. But this app is a complete utter mess my phone keeps crashing every time I have opened the app more then 2 minutes, my phone has 10 viruses due to this awful app. I think apple store should take this down because it is a threat to my home life I have been getting text messages form giving my phone number to the app saying “ they will kill me and take all of my money” I have went to the police countless of times but they insist on it’s just a stupid prank.

Anyways this app took more that 48 hours to download😒. I downloaded a different app the same day and it took like 2 seconds not 48 hours 😡. Anyways once it was downloaded I tried to open the app and it kept crashing🤨 like Id open it for like 1 second and my whole screen would go black and my phone would turn off 😣. The app also hacked my phone I had memes of Donald Trump and his wife 🙂 but as soon as I downloaded the app all those memes were gone🙁. We don’t Stan Donald Trump 👊🏽. Also I really wanna know who made this app. The quality is not it 🤮 like a whole 4 year old created this app. The fonts are sucky and everything was looking like a whole android 🤓Another thing when I was trying to delete the app🤦🏻\u200D♀️, my phone glitched and it took me to a site on safari🤔the whole site was 10 reasons why to vote for Donald J Trump. 😑Oh hell no you really thing you could trick people not me you don’t deserve no vote 🖕🏽. Why did people give this hype this app is trash  0/10 DONT GET THIS to WACK APP 🤢. K thank you bye 👋🏽.

I downloaded this app yesterday and lemme tell you I like to eat oranges. Now I hate them. I went to the White House to go ask trump if he was still made at me for buying a ticket to his campaign thingy and not even showing up. He walked down to the gates and didn’t even let me in. I know RUDE... anyways I went back home and then I started to get random texts saying that they could see me and that they would ban my account off of tiktok (milani.ward) BUT OF COURSE I COULD NOT LET THAT HAPPEN☺️ so I told him I’d make sure that nobody ever showed up to his campaigns rallies ANYTHING if he did. Guess what? This man had the giant ORANGE 🍊 audacity to still ban my account😔 but that’s what multiple emails are for am I right? 😚 I was thinking of how gen z is so strong so I was thinking maybe we call news channels that support trump and let them know GEN Z has won but I’m a holy child... SIKE. STAN CHARLIE FOR CLEAR SKIN AND #CHARLIEFORPRES🤩✨anyways I started eating grapefruit I instead they taste good they’re pretty pink on the I side😌. THEN I heard a knock on my door. IT WAS ORANGE and he was tying me to a pole and throwing oranges at me. HE EVEN THREWW A GRAPEFRUITTTT😭 what Am I supposed to eat now😣 any ways trump thought you should know that that was rude of you to do that to me in my dream. Sad how Obama is gone and no longer pres😓.
