It’s embarrassing how incompetent the designers are except when you think about who is running the show then you understand that incompetence is a theme."}},{"id":"6179710859","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"dumscum","title":"Does not pass the vibe check","date":"2020-07-10T06:04:04Z","review":"I downloaded the app because Simon said so and was extremely disappointed to find out that Chester from the hot Cheetos brand ran the app. I mean I fully support his decision to get into politics, but I would much rather like to see him doing what he does best. Selling hot Cheetos, not running the country. I mean if you think about it from a cheetahs perspective, he has to run. But like not the country. He CAN run Cross Country though. Since he’s a cheetah he should be able to run extremely fast. According to Google Cheetahs can run at 58 mph so that’s pretty cool. Also I would just like to point out that the app itself kept crashing, but that was just a minor setback that I easily dealt with by getting a new phone."}},{"id":"6179710516","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"WhyDoTheseAppsSuck","title":"Shisssst","date":"2020-07-10T06:03:57Z","review":"This app is worse than a dog peeing on your foot"}},{"id":"6179710733","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":5,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Gamer ID:793919","title":"Dear, Petty Liberals","date":"2020-07-10T06:04:01Z","review":"Getting trumps app taken down is just petty. Just because you disagree with someone politically, doesn’t mean you have to try and ruin their reputation.
