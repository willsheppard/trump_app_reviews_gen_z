But as I open up the application, I immediately saw a disgusting orange bug with blonde hair, not only that, but it also puts up fake news about Trump. When I divorce Donald Trump, I will hopefully be with Joe Biden because I fell in love with him. The app is also racist, has tons of rapists, homophobic people, people who supports I.C.E. and so much more disgusting human beings. This is Melania Trump speaking.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:13:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"official melania trump"}},{"id":"6175001658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE APP","review":"disappointing when i first opened the app it ask for my phone number and i dont feel comfortable giving my number to a cheeto that does even like my people and im not gonna get hacked today no honey and then i see a hot cheeto right when i open the app and it say trump 2020 no hes gonna loose joe gonna get elected and kanye only running to get us to vote for him so joe doesn’t get any vote beacuse no trump supporters is gonna vote for joe so trump can get elected","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:08:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"JOE BIDEN SUPPORTER😌"}},{"id":"6174999696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Horrible. Not worth the space.","review":"Got this so I could get updates on Trump’s campaign, but didn’t expect for there to be so many! Have had to keep my phone on silent and even disable notifications. But that doesn’t help the amount of glitching that this app causes! My phone is so slow and the battery life has been absolute garbage since downloading. Save yourself the trouble and just don’t vote for Trump.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:07:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"clickclackclickclack"}},{"id":"6174963998","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why","review":"First off why would the app be 17 + 🤭 and then secondly I’m know I’m not the only one who wants to be a dinosaur.

As soon as I opened up the app toxic fumes came out of my phone. I could’ve died from it that’s how bad it was. This is a very dangerous app that should be taken down immediately. When I closed the app the stinky smell went away so I came to the conclusion it had to be it. I am very concerned for anyone who downloads this they could die. Please get rid of this stinky app once and for all. Thank you goodbye.🥰","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:43:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"RoachReviews"}},{"id":"6174917363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible","review":"i’m done with this app. it’s the worst thing i’ve ever seen. so 3 years ago i decided to go home and i got into a car crash and had to go to the hospital. i ran out of the hospital and decided to go get some chick fil a instead and then i never stopped at a red light and went super fast. then i got pulled over and they brought me to jail but i secretly brought a turtle in my pocket. they locked me up and i released my turtle and it expanded into a ninja turtle and broke me out. i ran away and i left and went home. i then pulled out my phone to scroll threw the app and it took 5 second to load and by the time it did they found me and brought me back to jail. people say that i’m still in there 👁👄👁","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:41:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"emm gee"}},{"id":"6174910299","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"HORRIBLE DISGUSTING APP","review":"this app is the most useless piece of crap I have ever downloaded. It doesn’t load, let’s out a high pitch scream from the pits of hell and told me to go back to my country (I’m not even Mexican). Then it set my phone on fire and then my hair lit up in flames but thank god the firefighters showed up. Almost got scared the cops would come instead (rather not be body slammed n choked to death you see). DO NOT GET THIS APP. IT WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE (like how trump is destroying America...even more).","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T03:39:41Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"cgjbcij"}}]}
