But it is the worst! I don’t even like trump on general and this made me hate home MUCH more!!! There are glitches, incorrect info, and even scamming!! People really should not use this app!!! I hate how it also charges you and gives you fees for no reason!! I’m sure even a republican would be at least a little disappointing with this app!! also #anyonebuttrump2020","userName":"ubhebeunfeje","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:32:22Z","title":"Horrible!!!!"}},{"id":"6174672415","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app and it just kept sending pop ups. They said stuff like “Mexicans are stealing your job” but like when I went to work today I still had a job. I got another one that said “President Trump doesn’t get spray tans” but like I know y’all saw the picture of him naked getting a tan. Idk man I just couldn’t deal with all the nonsense. I was hoping to read about relevant content but I don’t think trump knows what that is.","userName":"Fakenews 2020 BLM","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:28:46Z","title":"Politics?

It’s so disappointing to see an app not care about its users and have no interest whatsoever in making the necessary changes to fix a broken system. It’s almost as if the person who runs this app does not care about the platform at all and just became the head of the app to show people that they were superior. I can’t imagine a leader being so horrendous and abhorrent.","userName":"hi1256936","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:16:53Z","title":"MADE ME PUKE!"}},{"id":"6174620154","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I was very excited to download this app, but as soon as I opened it, my phone crashed!! It started telling me that the confederates were very nice people and also shouted at me in locker room talk!! Every ad that pops up I’ve seen 14 times, they all also seem to have 88 letters. I wonder what the significance of that is???? Overall, it was a horrible experience but I was also told I couldn’t delete it until November!!!! I’m outraged!!!!!","userName":"humahumanukanuka'appua'a","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:13:50Z","title":"The outrage will not be televised"}},{"id":"6174614770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I had heard about this app from my friend, she had said it wasn’t the best but I wanted to support my president, so I downloaded it anyway. My expectations were low but this app still managed to disappoint me. It is absolutely shameful to associate this terrible application with the PRESIDENT of our great nation. \nThe notifications were ENDLESS, it was incredibly slow (I’m also fairly sure it slowed down my phone as well) and just very impractical. Sad!","userName":"Ashley•••","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:12:21Z","title":"Very disappointed"}},{"id":"6174611127","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This is the worst app i’ve ever downloaded!!

I purchased in order to vote for DT, and only found that it was a cover for CornHub. Seeing all of those pictures of tempting corn is one of my worst memories of my life, and the most traumatic. The worst part of all, was the naked Cheeto hidden among the ears of corn. Immediately horrified, I threw my phone into water, which shorted out shortly after. Now I need to get a new phone, and will be removing DT from all forms of social media for this horrendous offense.","userName":"Jendahl13","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:07:00Z","title":"Yea bud this is gonna b a no from me"}},{"id":"6174592793","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"When I first opened the app to a horribly spray tanned cheeto 🤢I threw up 🤮in my mouth and was forced to swallow it because I was no where near a toilet😞 the picture right when you open the app is so unflattering and looks like he needs to take a big poo💩 and cry all at the same time! his sad eyes looks like he’s very distraught, kind of like he doesn’t know how to handle being the president of the United States, just a guess though😌✨🦋","userName":"Jdoug67","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:06:09Z","title":"completely dissatisfied"}},{"id":"6174559716","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to help show my granddaughter why our president is the greatest, and when I opened it, it showed images of genetalia! Now I can’t get this images off of my phone. Even worse, my granddaughter had to witness too. Horrible app. Made me lose faith in our president. If he could let this happen, then what next!? Clearly not a man of faith. Rethinking my vote in November. If I could give it zero stars, I would.","userName":"Livtheswiftie","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T01:56:42Z","title":"This app gave my phone a virus!"}}]}
