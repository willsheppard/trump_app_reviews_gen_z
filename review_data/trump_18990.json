Idk what’s so great about this little troll but all of these Trump slogans seem oddly reminiscent of all the “praise our great leader” crap in countries like China and North Korea. Campaigning? Make it *brainwashing.* I’d take your information and RUN because this app is the antithesis of democracy. Oranges have no place in the White House. 🍊","rating":1,"userName":"black lives matter ✊🏼"}},{"id":"6177288872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE!!","date":"2020-07-09T16:05:37Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got this app as a fun way to keep up with our President but was SEVERELY disappointed. The opening screen reads a very disgusting quote that I will never repeat. The app then crashed every time I opened it, which seems to be a common problem. You would think the POTUS would know how to make a good app, but the state of this app is not surprising at all. Do not buy!!!","rating":1,"userName":"Hdtjtijg"}},{"id":"6177269019","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very bad","date":"2020-07-09T15:59:55Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with the wonderful leader of the white free world. But once I downloaded it nothing would work. My phone crashed over and over again. Then, my screen just went black and the only thing it would do was play an audio of Donald Trump Screaming PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! Over and over again. I deleted the app as soon as I could. DONT DOWNLOAD!!!","rating":1,"userName":"joe bidn"}},{"id":"6177267850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"*terrible*","date":"2020-07-09T15:59:34Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this app so that I could stay up to date on everything going on and the app caused my phone to stop working!!

The second that I got into the app it was very cluttered and I was confused on what to do from there. Overall this app was not satisfying and I didn’t even get to see a good picture of our orange 🍊✨. This app was slow, cluttered, confusing, and overall bad.","rating":1,"userName":"Abi Swan"}}]}
