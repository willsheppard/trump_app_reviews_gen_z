One night, he suddenly finds his land has been squatted by a mass of fairy-tale creatures (Pinocchio, the three little pigs, Peter Pan, Snow White, Cinderella, among others), who have been banished by the evil Lord Farquaad. One of these is a donkey (who just won't shut up). Accompanied by him, Shrek confronts Lord Farquaad, demanding his land back.\n\nFarquaad does him a deal, telling him to rescue Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle, to get his swamp back. Shrek and Donkey go and rescue the Princess, narrowly avoiding being burned by the dragon. Fiona is disgruntled about being rescued by an ugly ogre, rather than Prince Charming. However, despite their differences, she and Shrek grow fond of each other.\n\nOn the second night of their return journey, Fiona hides in a windmill. Donkey finds her and discovers that she's turned into an ogress. She explains that she's under a spell, which can only be broken by true love's first kiss. Shrek overhears part of this, but misunderstands and thinks she doesn't love him because he's ugly. Just as she decides to tell Shrek the truth, the sun rises and she becomes a beautiful princess again.\n\nLord Farquaad arrives and takes Fiona to his castle, and Shrek returns to his swamp. Both are miserable. Later, Shrek, Donkey and Dragon head to Farquaad's castle, to try to stop Fiona marrying him. He tells Fiona Farquaad's true intentions of marrying her. But the sun sets and Fiona becomes an ogress again. Farquaad doesn't want to marry her and sets the guards on everybody, but Dragon comes to the rescue and eats Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona kiss. Therefore, Fiona stays ugly (in conformity with the spell: \"you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form\"), and marries Shrek, and they live \"ugly\" ever after."}},{"id":"6176931075","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mguinn nn","title":"this app is terrible","date":"2020-07-09T14:26:13Z","review":"unnecessary"}},{"id":"6176926875","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"idragyouinreviews","title":"SOOOO BADDDD","date":"2020-07-09T14:25:07Z","review":"1 star so gross take down the app\nit’s not good ALSO OUR PRESIDENT LEAKED HIS TINY CHEETO PUFF"}},{"id":"6176904603","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Mad Ball756","title":"Spam","date":"2020-07-09T14:19:21Z","review":"🤫"}},{"id":"6176893581","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"nickname1234......","title":"this is a piece of 💩","date":"2020-07-09T14:16:29Z","review":"🖕🏼 you and your 🍊🍑 😄"}},{"id":"6176875630","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gymnasticskid24682)492963","title":"awful","date":"2020-07-09T14:11:43Z","review":"this app is absolute ✨🧚🏼garbage✨🧚🏼"}},{"id":"6176815865","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"do too ,","title":"yea..","date":"2020-07-09T13:56:01Z","review":"culo culo culo ive never seen worse"}},{"id":"6176776051","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Nahh ❤️","title":"🤮","date":"2020-07-09T13:45:29Z","review":"don’t download"}},{"id":"6176775389","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cloudsfever","title":"Worst app ever","date":"2020-07-09T13:45:19Z","review":"Ew I hate this app 🤮🤮🤮🤮"}},{"id":"6176677775","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"❤️chloe.","title":"Trump 2020!✨💫🧚🏻\u200D♀️ On a gravestone!!! ✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🌿","date":"2020-07-09T13:19:38Z","review":"Baddie💖✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🤍but the bad is silent💖✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️🤍 okay okay, i see you✨🤩🧚🏼\u200D♀️💗 i wish i didnt🤩💗🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💓\n\nSmile more✨🥰 🧚\u200D♂️because my favorite color is yellow 🧚\u200D♂️💕✨🥰\n\nu ate this up 🧚🌈💓💗⚡️🌟 spit it out 💓🧚🥰🙈\n\ni was so happy today😔🥺 but than i remembered your existence😿💖🧚🏽✨\n\nStar! 😍💞✨🧚🏽 But make it “arve” instead of ar 💖✨🧚🏽\n\nyou served!!😍🌺✨🌈but i didn’t order take it back🤩✌🏻💖🧚\u200D♀️\n\nfirst🍭😩but make it degree muder💅🏼🧚🏼\u200D♂️🐛\n\nYour videos are lit✨☺️🥺 🧚\u200D♂️replace the L with sh ✨🥺😌👌🧚\u200D♂️\n\nmouthwash 🌤💍🌱🧚🏻\u200D♀️🦋 but make it bleach 💘❣️💋💝🍾\n\nI bought u some flowers✨🥺🌸 they’re dead just like your love life🤩🥰💗🧚\n\ngreat post 🧚🏻💕 never do it again 🦖💗☀️\n\nAs dory said \"just keep swimming” 💅🤩🧚\u200D♀️✨ but i think it’s best if you drown 💖🌈🌸🦋\n\nLife is like a box of chocolates 👼💫💫🌈⭐️💖 Hope you become a dog 💋💅🏻✨✨🌙💫\n\nyou should be a model💗✨🌸🧚🏻for a coffin magazine though🥰⭐️\n\n✨💛🧚🏼You remind me of Elsa🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨👑 You really let yourself go💛✨💋\n\n🌹🧚\u200D♀️✨deleting things is freeing💖try your account😍✨🦋\n\nThe talent!!!✨🦋🧚 is invisible\n\nBuzz Light Year once said “To Infinity and Beyond!” 🌸✨🌷 But for you it’s “To Infinity and Be Gone!” 🧚🏼\u200D♀️🦋💫\n\nits trash collecting day🧚🏻\u200D♀️💅🌌get ready🌌💫💖🧚🏻\u200D♀️\n\nAll ideas should be heard 🧚\u200D♀️✨✨ but this one made me wish I was deaf 💖🥰🤩\n\nYou go girl!🧚✨ no like seriously leave🦋🥰\n\nwow you’re right🦋🧚\u200D♀️😌🌟i’ll go left🙈❤️🌈\n\neye drops but make them✨b l e a c h✨\n\npie💅🏻☺️but the p did a full 180🦋💞\n\naweee i love this vid!👑✨💕just remember there’s always unlimited room in drafts🧚🥰💓\n\nThere’s always room for improvement.💕 but it’s not in this room, get out🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨💟\n\nyou served🍤🧚🏼\u200D♀️💞 but now i’m asking for the manager💰🦋✨\n\nReach for the stars🌺⭐️🧚\u200D♀️🦋🌈 I hope you fall trying ✨🌈✨🌟\n\nyou look like the ratatata guy💖🧚\u200D♀️🦋 but without the atata😍🌻📖🌙\n\nI see talent✨💖💜💕💘 just not here💕💖💜\n\nConfidence is key🥰🦋💕✨too bad the doors locked. 🧚😍🍄☁️\n\nOmg you go!! 😘❤️🤩 home 🧚🏻\u200D♂️😊🤗\n\nsis u look snatched!! 🌹💫🧚🏼\u200D♀️🌷next time make sure it’s by a kidnapper ☺️🌸💐✨\n\nI know talent when I see it 💗💕👄 and I’m still looking 🧚🏻❣️"}}]}
