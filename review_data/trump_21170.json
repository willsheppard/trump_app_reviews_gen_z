It was extremely glitchy and slow. The amount of issues I’ve had with this app are too much to handle. It’s disgusting 🤢. I wish I had something good to say , but I think that’s impossible. I really don’t recommend it.","userName":"better then your mom 😍😚"}},{"id":"6178093818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"gimme my nude sexy pres 🤩","date":"2020-07-09T20:14:49Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i am completely devastated by this app. i was trying to educate myself on this app about our 🍊 presidente but all i got was notifications and news and stuff and it broke my phone 😔! also, when i tried to forward a picture of trump nude to my eight year old step sister, they sent a picture of the teletubbies instead 🙈✨ my sister cried and i want a new phone and my picture back 🦇😠 trump needs to make changes on this app because its trash and i dont appreciate seeing trump in his keep america great swimking trumps as the loading screen 👁👄👁🕺🏽🥵😍🥰🙈✨✨✨","userName":"Jenna Toll."}},{"id":"6178091830","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"0/5 Don’t recommend ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️🥰","date":"2020-07-09T20:14:12Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"As soon as I opened the app it asked me for money so I closed it but I forgot to delete it and a couple minutes later the Secret Service showed up at my house asking for a small loan of a million dollars.

I opened it and then my phone exploded and Elmo proceeded to go forward with a home invasion in my small southern home. I tried to go to sleep but then this app set an alarm and called in a swat team into my home and killed my hamster. This app single handedly poisoned all of my food and destroyed my soul.

The reason i was downloading this app was because I decided to educate my self on the person we call our president. Not many people like him and i can definitely see why. The app is slow and I HATE IT🧚🏾✨🌸 anyways have a good day :)","userName":"the fairies✨✨"}},{"id":"6178020943","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"genZ","date":"2020-07-09T19:50:53Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"First, when i first opened it the phrase “keep America great” showed up as if America was ever really great. Make America great again is the same as make white and not all lives matter again. For this, the app should get deleted until there is a black lives matter sign posted somewhere on the sight. Keep living a humble life and vote !!!","userName":"boosiebadazz-ky"}},{"id":"6178004248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","date":"2020-07-09T19:45:22Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with important events, see what rallies I can go to, campaigns I could help with, but this darn app won’t even let me make an account!
