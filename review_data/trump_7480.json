I keep seeing a cheeto popping on and off my screen. I don’t know if some other people’s phone is doing this to, but it’s happening to me. It also makes my phone slow, and when i go to exit out the app it take like 6 seconds THEN goes to the home screen. Then i keep seeing a thing glitching on and off the app saying “don’t vote for trump.”\ni think i like that glitch actually. Anyways the apps not worth it.","title":"Girl don’t do it,it’s not worth it.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:47:19Z","userName":"BIACK LIVES MATTER","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172285913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app so I could keep up to date with our lovely Cheeto Man’s decisions for our country but I was EXTREMELY let down and DISGUSTED by the app. When I first opened the app, there was a whole collage of nude Trump pictures. I immediately went blind but I can still picture the images in my head and now I’ll be forced to regularly attend therapy due to my PTSD. The nightmares this app give me are unbelievably terrifying and i don’t want anyone else to suffer the same way I am. Please do not get this app if want to keep your eyesight and sanity.","title":"Please no❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:37:44Z","userName":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️💕","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172253833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"got on the app and my phone randomly stopped working. had to reset it but when I got back in some apps were strangely not working. when I contacted the creator of this app I was informed that those apps (which are now blocked) were “too violent” and “were not working in the way they thought was best”. very strange. i’ve also been told that those apps shouldn’t have just been following their guidelines and they wouldn’t have been blocked. oh well. anyways hope daddy trump can fix this bug","title":"bunker boy strikes again","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T13:28:46Z","userName":"мρ3ρℓαуєя","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172025995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with the news of our president. I was scrolling through the app when my phone completely shut down. It literally would not turn on. I had to contact Apple support to get it fixed! I would definitely recommend some bug fixes.

I opened the app and noticed an itching coming from my rear. The longer I kept the app open the worse the itching got. I kept scratching and scratching, and don’t get me started on what happened after I ate Taco Bell. There was dead skin from my rectum and feces everywhere. My parents came into my room, almost immediately dying from the toxic inhalation of my feces and urine.\n\nIn conclusion, Donald J Trump caused my parents to die and for me to be in immense pain for countless hours.
