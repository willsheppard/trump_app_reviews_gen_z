The app was such a mess and it was SO unorganized. I literally got a headache due to it.

He’s even admitted to watching women change at his pageants and refusing to leave. Why do y’all want him to be president for 4 more years is beyond me. 🥱🙄"}},{"id":"6177209346","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"This man ate a bird","date":"2020-07-09T15:42:31Z","userName":"ticker talker","rating":1,"review":"I open this app to find the Donald J Trump eats live birds and that just doesn’t sit well with me and my Christian household because why would someone eat birds I mean Donald J Trump has never been a very good president but eating birds crossing the line I think that there needs to be an impeachment trial because he is being cruel to the birds and the birds are part of the FBI if he does not know"}},{"id":"6177178621","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Unacceptable","date":"2020-07-09T15:33:51Z","userName":"Mbuny0621","rating":1,"review":"As a white woman living in the greatest country ever.
