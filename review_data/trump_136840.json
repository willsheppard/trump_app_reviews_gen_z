It also took WAY too much storage to download I had to delete four apps just to download this. I definitely would NOT recommend this app if you like your phone; I had to replace my whole phone because not only did the app crash but it crashed and broke my phone as well. Before you guys come for me saying my phone is old, I had just gotten a brand new phone a couple days ago."}},{"id":"6180085462","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"please delete i hate trump he’s the worst person on this planet🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡","date":"2020-07-10T08:24:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"i hate trump🤡🤡🤡👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽","review":"as a gen z i can not allow this app to be up any longer then it already has. absolutely the worst app ever. don’t download he’s a terrible person and the worst president ever. now i’m going to k1ll myself. peace out🤪✌🏾"}},{"id":"6180085053","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"horrible app, horrible president","date":"2020-07-10T08:23:56Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Haleyjojo10j","review":"86-45 Make America Trumpless again!"}},{"id":"6180084547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do not download","date":"2020-07-10T08:23:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"No OH GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOOOO","review":"Play open the app I was flooded it’s very dark messages I went to bed and the app sounded like it speaking to me as I looked around my vision became blurred with orange all I could see was trumps face I believe this happened brainwashing people because now all I want is a bag of Cheetos and rainbows shoot out of my eyes and now every night I go to sleep all I can see Trump every time I’m in a quiet darkness of my room I hear find whispers people screaming trump 2020 every time I close my eyes even if it’s just a blink I see Trump Donald J Trump to be exact and now I have no clue what to believe and every time I get up in the morning all I can see is an orange haze and no matter what I do no matter what I try to drown the voices what is the screen all I can hear anymore from 2020 because of this app my whole family left me because of the stay at my house I had to paint orange with a yellow one people leave Kai’s red tide on my window mail boxes I say get rid of this up for good and maybe I can get my family back \n\n100% true no lie do you be doin Dat Doe"}},{"id":"6180084489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"FAKE NEWS!!!","date":"2020-07-10T08:23:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"paola (!)","review":"I would like to start off by saying, I am not Gen Z doing this because of “TikTok.” No joke, this app is seriously terrible. The first time I opened it, it crashed. The second time, it made my phone screen glitch and freeze for half an hour, AND it sold all my data - including my Social Security Number and my Top Secret Diary - to Kpop agents. After that I was pretty fed up but I decided to give it one last try. I opened the app and it slapped my baby in the face!! Then it kicked my grandmother in the shins!! USER WITCH HUNT! APP-MAKING MISCONDUCT! PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"}},{"id":"6180083816","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Absolutely horrible","date":"2020-07-10T08:23:30Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"i need to restore my purchase","review":"This is just a disgrace... right after I downloaded this app my phone started beeping. It started me and I couldn’t figure out why it was beeping, but I opened the app anyway and it was flashing red and saying it was taking my data. Then my phone started crashing and re-loading over and over again. I had to delete the app and even then it didn’t completely stop, I think it planted viruses or something into my phone. It keeps glitching still. I will have to get a new phone and waste my money because my phone was perfectly fine before I downloaded this app... I can’t even believe this, absolutely not okay."}},{"id":"6180083668","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Nooooo!

I am very furious with its software and the people who decide to create a dumb app like this.
