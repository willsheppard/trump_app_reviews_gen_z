im swimming in a pile of my own fecal matter! that‚Äôs when i remembered... the trump app! i swam threw the doo doo to my phone, even swallowing my own erectile feces. i tryed to delete the app, but my phone had exploded. my booty hole was the size of a chihuahua. i blacked out after that, only to wake up with a foggy vision. i wasn‚Äôt able to feel anything, only my face had felt a little chilly. i couldn‚Äôt even move my head. i started to scream, only for what looked like some doctors had ran into the room. they comforted me, only to tell me my body had almost exploded due to what ever was coming outside of my body. my head had to be cut off in order for my survival. i was a floating head inside of a jar with gucky matter that kept me alive. my head is currently connected to wires which translates my thoughts into a machine, which is how i am wrighting this review. please, for your own safety, don‚Äôt download the app... or you may become a severed head like me.","rating":1,"userName":"Elizabeth Lila Rose","date":"2020-07-08T21:31:25Z","title":"booty dominator"}}]}
