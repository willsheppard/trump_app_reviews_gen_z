First, it played a weird noise the second I opened up the app that killed all my pets! I am so shocked and betrayed right now. And it won’t stop glitching and stealing all my information.

It sends me daily recruitment information to join a cult that requires everyone to be a morbidly obese racist. Not to mention it made it so every 19 seconds an alarm goes off in my phone to the sound of Amish Paradise. Great song but gets old when played that often."}},{"id":"6174748922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"willa is a 🐀","date":"2020-07-09T02:51:46Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Horrific","review":"This app is completely Terrifying!
