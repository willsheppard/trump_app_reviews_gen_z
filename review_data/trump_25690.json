Not only are the resources useless and offending it often glitches out or does not allow me to click on the resources available. I’d say skip this app and don’t waste your time, rather spend your time educating yourself on the BLM movement."}},{"id":"6172680326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:26:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"The worst app EVER!!! 🧚\u200D♂️","userName":"Sincerly GenZ","review":"This app provides inaccurate information and unethical agendas about the Trump administration. The app keeps asking to provide a phone number and email address. It is so annoying. It is not worth your time downloading this app. FAKE NEWS!! Because of how awful this app, I will not be voting for this Cheetos. ❌❌\n\nAlso BLM.😊❤️"}},{"id":"6172664877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:22:11Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😼😹🤡","userName":"Marii_q15","review":"I just don’t like that h03 👁 👄 👁 he makes me throw up 🤢 and my dog once saw him 🤡 he fainted and almost got him into the vet , also just delete this app nobody even uses it only the Karen’s and the boomers 😻🇺🇸Trump 2020🇺🇸 but on a grave ✨😍🧚🏻🤩 If y’all like him then y’all deserve to ✨ D I E ✨.

Not only is it bad, it is for bunker boy which is like double ick. If he’s trying to take away tik tok because his feelings are as gentle as a newborn, he shouldn’t get an app either. Since our goal is to get this off the App Store we might as well get him out of office while we’re at it."}},{"id":"6172598366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:03:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Very awful","userName":"kensey :)","review":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! Its messing up my phone so badly. I may have to take it somewhere to get it fixed. As soon as you open the app it crashes and starts messing up your phone by tapping random things and randomly crashing. I have tried to delete this app but it won’t. Terrible."}},{"id":"6172569692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:55:37Z","isEdited":false,"title":"A horrible app for a horrible person","userName":"downwithttump2020","review":"This man is a racist child molester and a white supremacist. There is no reason for a man like that to be president, let alone not be arrested or impeached. Therefore, if you vote for him, you support or condone all the things he stands for. I am leaving this review because this man doesn’t deserve to be president so down with his app."}},{"id":"6172559155","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:52:42Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Toxic","userName":"HB_SweetPea","review":"Toxicity level 200%. I get it, you saw power and you snapped it up but it has cost us the status of this country. No one respects your authority, you have aligned yourself with the wrong side of history. I know you will never take responsibility for your actions, at least take on the accountability."}},{"id":"6172546385","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:49:07Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trying to find sanity","userName":"sophiarose1022","review":"I downloaded this app in an attempt to try to understand anything trump has said, and to try to make sense of it all. I would unfortunately like to say that it has not worked and I am still confused as to why they let a Cheeto with no real political beliefs into office."}}]}
