What horrible, disgusting person would do this to an app? Then Perry proceeds to come out of my charging hole and eat my turkey sandwich! Like dude! THAT WAS MY SANDWICH! Then Perry goes back in my phone and starts eating a Krabby Patty, Then Spongebob comes in my phone and cooks Mr. Crabs and puts him in a Krabby Patty then I realize what Perry is eating!

I could throw up looking at it. It does not deserve to be on this App Store. Along with all the other reviews that think so this is just a waste of time. If you’re going to make an app make a good one that actually deserves to be on the app store🙄 a huge waste of time. Never get this app.","date":"2020-07-09T01:43:57Z"}},{"id":"6174480351","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"donaldhairycoochie","rating":1,"review":"when i got the app i thought it was going to run fine . i was scrolling and i saw something orange on my screen and it startled me very badly because it was blinking . it glitched my phone very badly and i had to get the barack obama app to stop my phone from glitching . i really do not recommend getting this app because it will break your phone . if it does, just get the barack obama app . i’m sure it works fine after 🧚\u200D♂️💅🏾💖🙉👁👄👁✨😎 .","date":"2020-07-09T01:34:18Z"}},{"id":"6174494767","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","userName":"fnekek","rating":4,"review":"I opened this app to see fake news it’s awful.
