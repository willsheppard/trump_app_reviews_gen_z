Obviously I was not going to wait that long, so I left my phone in a separate room. My dog was sleeping in this room when out of nowhere light started flashing from the app. This light scared my dog so much, that he fell off the bed and onto scissors that then impaled him. I 100% blame this app and it’s flashing lights that had no warning. I deleted this app before I ever even explored it and I suggest you all do the same. 😔","userName":"@udr33yy101","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6165930831","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Beyond saddened by this experience ✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️💗","date":"2020-07-06T23:51:44Z","review":"I downloaded the app to be kept updated on our JENIUS bunker boy. Sadly the app hacked into all my social media’s and cleared my phone of all its information!!! After it had shut down my phone my stuffed animal began to float and speak in tongues they possessed my poor stuffed animal VERY CRUEL 🤧 I’ve come to the conclusion that all apps matter 👁👄👁 This was a beyond disappointing interaction and i fear for my life after the usage of this app. If i could give it 0 stars I would!!","userName":"Maddz_1234","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6156991091","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very disappointed ☹️","date":"2020-07-04T15:43:43Z","review":"I downloaded this app to show my support for my president but it was only filled with fake news (if you could call “articles” that just says MAGA news) and videos that never loaded 😠. My grandson filed a report and they just insisted that the app was good and refused to fix these issues!! Mr. president, you need better tech support 😡😡😡😡😡. My advice? Don’t waste your time. Just read from the internet. My grandson showed me some websites on there that has good info","userName":"Leigh-Anne Marie","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6145633102","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GEN Z 2020🧚🏻💫🥰","date":"2020-07-01T20:29:52Z","review":"i downloaded this app because, well i don’t really even know why, and right after i downloaded it i got a knock on my door. so i went to go knock on the door and there was donald standing there. I ran to my backyard where my dogs are AND HE PEED ON THEM! so, i snatched his hair and it fell off, i gave it to my dogs so they can chew it up, then i started wiping his cheeto foundation off of him, then he ran off. I just can’t believe he would do that🖐🏼😔 people really assassinate the wrong presidents.","userName":"i eat cheetos😌","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6136315070","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i wish i could give it 0","date":"2020-06-29T15:12:14Z","review":"This is by far the worst app i’ve ever used😭 along with all the glitches Donald Jenius Trump himself texted me and called me a disgusting disgrace of a person. He then proceeded to text my great grandmother and threatened to curb stop her because “she’ll be in the grave soon anyway” . Him and his campaign team are terrible and don’t even deserve to have a campaign. I am appalled by how bad this app is. My biggest regret in life was downloading this app and i apologize to anyone after me who does !!","userName":"laughlovelivejoy","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6133857097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is no good","date":"2020-06-29T00:38:43Z","review":"I downloaded this because I’m a HUGE trump supporter sure he is racist but that’s okay but his app here is no good. I downloaded it and was extremely disappointed they took all of my personal information with out me knowing and now I got to worry about someone stealing my credit card information 😔 don’t download this app unless you want your credit card informations stolen. Also got kicked out of my house for supporting him but it’s okay cuz trump means more to me 😔 TikTok yay","userName":"depressedgurl","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177868373","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮🤮😡","date":"2020-07-09T19:01:13Z","review":"this app is literally horrible my phone crashed the minute i got it my phone didn’t turn on after words i had to get a whole new phone with his credit card. i got ten new iphone 11’s they work very well but this app gave my phone nightmares and me it’s so scary i thought i saw the devil himself turns out it was j a hot cheeto. but this app is so horrible like made by a guy that wants my family to get deported i think not my parents work just as hard as white people actually even harder than most white people most of them just sit on the couch and smoke and complain how every “illegal” is taking their job actually no they’re just doing work you weren’t willing to do 🇲🇽🇲🇽.\nthis app needs to be deleted thank you very much.","userName":"Gabby is friends with Grace","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177858302","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"For Bunker Boy","date":"2020-07-09T18:58:05Z","review":"Your app was absolute garbage and made false promises you had no intention of keeping when this app offered free pizza deliveries for an entire YEAR. I’m disappointed because this advertised coupons and discounts that failed when I tried to use them. Thanks to the ✨Orange orangutan dump truck✨ that runs this app I will be now ordering from Pizza Hut indefinitely since you can’t keep promises.       😔🤚 and btw being racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and misogynistic isn’t a personality trait hun. 🖕","userName":"jimmydeandecker","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177852326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not good✨✨","date":"2020-07-09T18:56:17Z","review":"I was intrigued by the prospect of this app, so I downloaded it. But immediately, I was struck by the face that came up. My middle school health teacher taught me that going to tanning salons causes skin cancer, so I’m very concerned for our president’s health. His has seemed very orange as of late. I hope he receives the utmost care for his condition, although I’ve heard skin cancer is hard to recover from. I believe President Trump has more important health concerns than trying to make apps that market for his re-election campaign.","userName":"AR226-leopard","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177593478","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terible","date":"2020-07-09T17:36:42Z","review":"I got this app because my parents are huge trump supporters, and even though I am not, they still insisted I got the app with them, when we got the app, our phones all started getting super slow, and would start crashing, for them they have older phones so they didn’t think much of it till mine started doing it too which I’ve had for them only about a month. I’m leaving this comment before I delete this app.","userName":"damn_its_samm","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
