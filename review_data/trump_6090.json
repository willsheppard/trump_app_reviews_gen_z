I was disgusted and decided to delete the app but it wouldn’t let me and killed my phone percentage. After I charged my phone I logged back on and the nudes were gone, but it had a video of trump beating innocent Hispanic kids, raping them, and torturing them in cages.

This app supports a man who stands for hate. A man who is tearing this country apart. A man who lacks the professionalism that a president should have. A man who hid in a bunker instead of doing what needed to be done in order to keep the peace in America. A man who will forever put his needs above the people who he is supposed to be serving. A man who was more worried about the economy instead of the health “his” people. A man who will go down in history as a coward. That is all, tyvm.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174401258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"stupid_rat24","date":"2020-07-09T01:10:32Z","title":"I had to bleach my eyes after getting this app","rating":1,"review":"This app is disgusting it has very inappropriate content. I do not recommend this app at all. As soon as opened the app I saw an orange blob looking man getting a tan and had to be sent to a therapist immediately. I was so traumatized that I decided to delete the app and a few days later started hearing weird noise coming from outside my window. Turns out I was being stalked by that same orange blob. No one believes me and I am now at a mental hospital. Please send help! And do not get this app unless you want to go through something similar.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174298486","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"karen. harrenson .","date":"2020-07-09T00:37:08Z","title":"Horrible app and costumer services by:karen","rating":1,"review":"So first this app TOOK AGES A EXTREMELY LONG AMOUNT OF TIME TO DOWNLOAD IT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

I now have nightmares every night and have to go to therapy everyday, or I have very vivid flashbacks to the terrifying moment I opened the app, please for the sake of yourself do not get this app, I am saving you from some serious ptsd.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174138759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"fondueeeee","date":"2020-07-08T23:39:43Z","title":"Pornography","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and it froze, so I restarted my phone and when I opened my phone again I found pictures of young adolescent naked women and children. They all had a similar engraving etched into their backs with what looked like scars from iron burns...the marks spanned across their backs and read “DJT”. It was the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen, and at first I thought that i was seeing things so I kept looking and more and more women were shown, chained, starving, and abused. I cannot believe that our own PRESIDENT is using an app to advertise his own human trafficking ring. Absolutely revolting.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174080848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Happi Sushi Rol","date":"2020-07-08T23:18:38Z","title":"Disgusting 🤢","rating":1,"review":"Why on earth is this app even allowed to be on the App Store? 🤦🏽\u200D♀️ It’s so disturbing. 😣\n\nIt says in the description that it’s for people age 17 or older, as it contains references to drug use, suggestive and/or crude humor, and profanity. 🤨What kind of government - much less PRESIDENTIAL - app includes such themes? Sickening. 🤢\n\nFurthermore, whenever I open the app, I am met with the face of a strange random orange man - is that a bug of some sort? If so, it needs to be addressed, as it’s very disturbing. 😖 My foreign grandmother was looking over my shoulder while I downloaded it, and now she is traumatized. 🙁😠\n\nAs a mixed race non-straight woman, I am appalled. 😤 This app needs to be taken down immediately. It is highly inappropriate. I’m pretty sure you’ll get brain damage if you have it open for too long. 🤕\n\nIt exudes toxicity, racism, and bigotry. ‼️ I wish I could rate in negative stars. ⛔️⛔️⛔️⭐️\n\nOn the other hand, TikTok is awesome. 😉","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174034607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"laysdoritosandfritosforever","date":"2020-07-08T23:01:13Z","title":"Too many Cheetos everyone and not even the good kind","rating":1,"review":"Look I love a good Cheeto but this was just too much. Not to mention the first face you see is a fake Cheeto with a fake tan not an authentic Cheeto with real cheese. Then it proceeded to steal my identity and make me a fake Cheeto. I now have a horrible, orange, and gross fake tan that leave pale holes around my eyes. I look terrible. It also made me promise to commit to the Cheeto army which will soon “take over the world and cancel Doritos, Fritos, and other chips forever”. 10/10 would NOT RECOMMEND. Terrible experience. The fyre festival was better than this. At least I got a real tan there.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174025942","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Heheh idk","date":"2020-07-08T22:57:58Z","title":"It’s just a no...❤️","rating":1,"review":"First off I was downloading it and I had to wait SOO LONGG so meanwhile I went to go put my drink in the microwave and heated up my food in the fridge went to go check on the app STILL NOT DOWNLOADED so I went ahead and drank my pizza and ate some of my apple juice!
