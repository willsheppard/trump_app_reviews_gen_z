He said, and I quote, “I have your family. If you ever want them to see the light of day again, download the Trump 2020 app.” After strangling my dog to death, he disintegrated into thin air. So I pulled out my phone and called the police. At first they were concerned but then they realized I was black, so they shot me in the leg and left. Knowing I had no other option I proceeded to download the app in hopes of getting my family back. As soon as the app installed, all of my furniture caught on fire and my neighbor blew up. I ran out of the house to find 78 dead birds in my driveway surrounded by a group of republican holding hands in a circle chanting “Make America Great Again.” I ran to get help and realized everybody within a fifty mile radius was hypnotized. So I walked barefoot to a McDonald’s about 51 miles away to get help.\nBy the time I got there my feet were bleeding and I was out of breath. I opened the door to find Satan himself standing in the middle of the McDonald’s. He locked me in a safe and I’m currently running out of oxygen. I haven’t eaten in 2 days. This is a cry for help.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"please befor its too late","date":"2020-07-09T03:17:53Z"}},{"id":"6173976724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP ON THE MARKET","review":"At first i was very hopeful when I heard of this application, the promises of knowledge, information and security were very alluring to the untrained eye... whatever this app says it does is a LIE. Immediately when the app opened I was appalled to see our very presidents unsolicited inappropriate photos. What some people call a shrimp I call a misshapen vagina Turns out there's a female president in office. The day we never thought would come is upon us. This shocked me but i was hopeful that our country was leaning towards changing societal norms and breaking down our patriarchal paradigm... but things got worse VERY fast. Turns out \"BUILD A WALL\" was a lie. Ever wonder why we spent so much money on concrete? Turns out we can click on real life Mexicans to shoot down from the wall.. REAL LIFE LAZER BEAMS pointed at HISPANICS. At this point I'm not even sure why some POC are for trump, turns out they like watching their people shot at by people having fun on this app by solely clicking Mexicans on their screen to shoot all while gaining TrumPOINTS to generate revenue. Lastly, this app asked for my location and tracked me down to steal my dog later on sending me a video of them abusing my dog😤😤😤 OUTRAGEOUS... DOWN THIS APP😡😡😡","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ADRIANBOLSENARO","date":"2020-07-08T22:39:25Z"}},{"id":"6173810812","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","review":"This app took 3 months to download and when it did download I saw a very disturbing picture which I wouldn’t like to describe then once I tapped the sign up button after typing in my phone number I began to get sketchy texts and then one day I got a notification from the person harassing me my dog , who was sitting by me on my bed spontaneously combusted after hearing the horrible vibration so I was covered in dog guts and had to clean up the mess. After 3 weeks of scrubbing guts off my wall my room was finally clean so then I decided to call the police and they just told me to call the vet so I called the vet and got sent to voicemail. Then I got a call from the trump app and the vibration was so powerful it caused my house to implode and create a black hole in which my whole family was sucked into and when a picked up the call the person told me to go outside and I did then a ufo hovered over my head and then I was being taken captive by aliens and flown to the planet Atoon in the Snickers galaxy. Long story short I regret installing this app bc it caused my whole family to be taken into a black hole and my dog to explode and me to have to be a slave to the Atoony people. ‼️DANGER DON’T DOWNLOAD‼️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gjditdursbc","date":"2020-07-08T21:37:17Z"}},{"id":"6173598043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"this app made me into ELLEN😱","review":"when i opened this app, i expected nothing but greatness, but all i saw was the glitching and terrible graphics. president 🍊’s beautiful face kept popping up. don’t get me wrong, i love him with my entire heart, (watch out melania, i’m coming for your husband😍) but i wanted to see what it had to offer! and the funny thing is, when it finally started to work, my gerbil kept screeching because it kept emitting a heartbreakingly beautiful speech from MY GORGEOUS president😡. and it also turned me white! when i looked down at my hands, they had turned a lighter color! i grew frustrated, and thought to myself, “now there are no white bots who are going to tell me they love my caramel skin tone, and that i can be the chocolate to their vanilla😭.” i ran to the bathroom, and saw that i actually had turned into ellen degenerate! how could that have happened! i turned back around and screamed because my gerbil had grown to be six feet tall! and then i remembered that he had died six months ago!!!! this app brought my gerbil back to life!!!! anyways, this is the story of how mr. presidents app made me in to a libtard.

This app is absolutely horrendous. I can’t believe what it did to me. First, it hacked into my bank account and stole a small load of one million dollars. I don’t even have that much because obviously I don’t support government handouts so what am I supposed to do now. I’m still trying to figure out how to pay it all back!! Next, this app found my address and the secret service showed up at my house after 10pm when my family and I were asleep. They said that to thank me for my support, they wanted to release a swarm of crickets into my house. I panicked and said “no way”, but they didn’t listen because hearing the word no doesn’t really mean anything, right... ? Now I have 8,000 crickets in my house. It’s an infestation. I can’t believe this app would do that. Next, when I tried to delete it from my phone, it shut my phone off and completely returned it to factory settings. All of my photos, contacts, EVERYTHING!!! is gone. The only things I have now are what comes with the phone, including the App Store. Trump app developers: I have a message for you: I don’t like what your app did. Anyway, I hope that NOBODY gets this app.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Hello 😜😜","date":"2020-07-08T20:11:40Z"}},{"id":"6177633827","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"terrible!","review":"Phineas pulled away from the intense, sensitive kiss, the corners of his mouth covered with messy saliva. It was his first. He had dreamed about this moment all of his teenage years. The adrenaline rushed to his stomach and bright cheeks in waves of warmth. He felt a bulge growing in his pants, chuckled softly, nuzzled his head and whispered “Hey Ferb..I think I know what we’re gonna do today.” A musical number faded in. Ferb leaned down to his stepbrother’s thin neck, coddling pockets of his skin in his mouth and sucking, nibbling, until a red mark was made. “I’m all yours, sir.” Phineas whispered, shaken. Ferb continued to paint his stepbrother’s body with marks of territory, settling his thumb in his prey’s mouth as Phineas lovingly sucked on it. Ferb grasped his non-blood relative’s hard triangular member and began to massage it. Suddenly, a rush of wind blew them from their moment. Candace walked out, screaming: “MOM, PHINEAS AND FERB ARE HAVING INCESTUAL RELATIONS!” but as the old tradition goes, everything was back to normal before their mother picked up any hint. Phineas speaks first. “Hey mom! Me and Ferb were wrestling. He won.” In a leathery, seductive, British voice Ferb speaks for the first and only time this episode: “Yes. Yes I did.” A final guitar riff marks the end of the sequence, and a commercial break begins.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Duck is cool","date":"2020-07-09T17:49:40Z"}},{"id":"6177133864","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"✨a terrible app✨","review":"hello there. I got this app so I can see the wonderful ✨orange✨ president and it took a whole week to download😤. after it downloaded, it crashed and I had to restart the app. my phone glitched and it froze. my keyboard was stuck and I couldn’t type. but I started to have issues with it. it kept kicking me out and I thought it was my phone🤬. I was looking forward to a good education on this app. instead, I got a bad looking orange, crooked looking Cheeto ompalompa body on the front cover 😤🤬✨ I was scared that I had to get bleach and pour it in my eyes and I had to pay 150 to get a therapist. it was so scary that my mom had to pack her things and she sent herself to Neptune. I was looking forward to a wonderful app but I had my dreams were ✨crushed✨ I’m disappointed in this app. also the font was so big I had to make the screen small so I can read it. then the app was showing the orange nudes and at that moment, I made a mistake. all I saw was 🍤and ur a ✨mistake✨🤧 and I had to delete the app after that. now thanks to ur stupidity to putting an app up, I’m blind for the rest of my life and my mom is up in Neptune by herself. I would NOT recommend getting this app.✨🧚\u200D♂️💖⭐️💫","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"✨🧚\u200D♂️i like oreos✨🧚\u200D♂️","date":"2020-07-09T15:21:19Z"}},{"id":"6175977794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Exceedingly horrendous app.","review":"The app took a LONG time to download which was suspicious as all the apps I’ve ever downloaded never took more than 5 minutes (a lot of them needing more storage space than this lame excuse of an app)Right as I got into the app I was asked lot give my phone number and was given no other option. After giving my phone number I kept and still am receiving messages some from the Trump Campaign and a LOT of spam messages with very suspicious links. I have never received spam messages or phone calls, but since giving my phone number I receive at least 3 spam/scam phone calls along with text messages. After some of my family members downloaded the app and gave their phone number, the same thing happened to every one of them. Besides that, the app itself is very glitchy and has a horrible layout. It is very prominent to me that it was made in a rush or at least by people who don’t have a lot of knowledge about mobile apps. The color scheme is quite tacky and the UI is confusing. I guess this is to be expected from an app that is made to support and Oompa Loompa of man who can’t stop his odd remarks about his daughter.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"Vianne G.","date":"2020-07-09T09:55:11Z"}},{"id":"6175260660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"MY WHOLE ENTIRE BODY WAS STOLEN","review":"i hate donald trump😹 he is a freak and a pedo just like shane yaw💯💯 I think that this freak needs to be put in his place and take his orange cheeto fingers elsewhere. Who in the world would ever download an app to support this horrible orange 🍊👄🍊 Anyway i would just like to say that trump is a crying pissy baby and i hope he pees his pants because he is such a little baby poo poo disaster.😺 The fact that women support him is even more disgusting. Like ew how in the world could you support a man who hates women. But on the other hand he does like little girls a little too much if you know what i mean (he likes to grab them by the🐱) I don’t think that this man with the stance of deformed penguin should be running the united states. This is why we’re considered the dumbest country. Thanks a lot idiot trump supporters. Maybe educate yourselves instead of staying home all day on your fatasses eating your cheetos listening to fake news. It isn’t that hard to download twitter and start listening to the media. Idiot adults. Whatever I hope they get better soon cause they’re clearly mentally ill.🙈 ANYWAY when i downloaded this app the mafia quickly came to my house and ended up stealing my kidneys.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bdkjdjsjans","date":"2020-07-09T05:35:45Z"}},{"id":"6174439132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"My dear horse in the hospital","review":"Many years ago I felt that my marriage wasn't as great as it used to be. My kids were grown up and my husband wasn't great in bed anymore, I felt that I wasn't worth anything. One day I was just scrolling through the App Store trying to find something to satisfy my needs for love. I wanted to feel loved like I used to and I wasn't getting that from my husband. My kids were dead and it was now only me and him left. I felt that if I went on a dating website then that would be considered cheating and I didn't want to be a cheater. I somehow found this app and now I felt that I can now see all the colors of the rainbow again. I feel that I am loved by my horse in the hospital. Especially the color orange. I now eat carrots for breakfast lunch and dinner, as he has made me fall in love with them. (Along with miso soup.) I now love horses and I no longer have love left for my husband, as it has all gone to the horse in the hospital. My husband has found love and has now let her live here and sleep in my bed. I just felt that I needed love. My horse in the hospital was there to provide that for me and I am forever grateful. I love you my horse, forever and always.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ValidEquestrian","date":"2020-07-09T01:21:54Z"}}]}
