Dude it’s your own app, invest in so chapstick and face moisturizer and fix that. May I also say that the wig did not, I repeat did not pop off. Oh and also he is homophobic, Misogynistic, sexist, a narcissist, an idiot transphobic and just overall a terrible president. At multiple rallies he has spoken on the fact that he has done awful things but people treat it as a joke and it’s disgusting. He has said that if a banker wasn’t his daughter he would be dating her which is on another level of ewww.So if you still find it hard to believe that we don’t wanna vote for him and we don’t want him an office and you do then do you want. Feel free to go and bash me I am begging you to stop overlooking the fact you don’t want to see and face the truth. Thank you all for coming to my Ted talk and yes you did just get schooled by 13-year-old.","title":"The orange man scares me","isEdited":false,"userName":"I actually researched it"}},{"id":"6179775594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:29:00Z","review":"To make america great AGAIN, didn’t it have to be great in the first place? \n\nThere is so much wrong with this disgusting, sexist, racist, rapist and I am sick of it.

This review is not so much for the app but for Trump who probably would have great difficulty installing any app. I can say without a doubt that he is the worst human being alive and as far as I know the Unabomber and Kim Jong Un are still around.

This is ps Trump an his policies are wack. He wants to strip us of our right because he wants to throw a racist, homophobic, sexist tantrum. Honestly I don't know how he was elected the first time.

The user interface is clunky, it keeps pushing the issue of turning on push notifications, it asks for your personal info so they can datamine you to oblivion. It also started shouting racial slurs at me once I signed up. I just say, I am BIGLY disappointed. The most disappointed. I’ve got lawyers on retainer who can verify that I’m so disappointed. Terrible experience with the app. If I could give negative stars I would.","title":"This app gave me ebola","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sarah Barnes"}},{"id":"6179775012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:28:46Z","review":"Worst app I’ve ever seen .
