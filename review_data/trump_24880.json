Plus it took all of my storage up on plus the data on my phone. I would think that the money that trump has he could of at least made a decent app at least to invest.

It keeps glitching out and not letting me tap what I wanted to read. I downloaded this to “educate” myself, but had no opportunities to do so because of how badly the app was developed. Very disappointed.","title":"Worst app I have ever downloaded","userName":"peachy_44","rating":1}},{"id":"6178061762","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T20:04:16Z","review":"this app made my phone crash and overheat as soon as i downloaded it and tried to use it.  i ended up having to buy a new phone without the app. the app was hard to navigate glitched wasn’t good either","title":"Do not download if you don’t want to buy a new phone","userName":"iphoneuser8273618","rating":1}},{"id":"6178040494","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T19:57:21Z","review":"This app crashed my phone. This app gives content of complete lies. The news I am receiving reminds me of fascist nazi-Germany. If I wanted to read complete dementia ridden nonsense I would listen to Joe Biden.. now I am hearing data is being harvested from my phone causing it to crash.

I tried to continue with the app but it kept kicking me out of the app. I wanted to keep exploring the map but the layout of everything bored me to death. Would not recommend this scummy app.","title":"Horrendous Quality","userName":".narwhale.","rating":1}}]}
