😡😤🧚🏻✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app not only took 1 YEAR to download... but also hacked my phone and i could no longer use it without a big notification popping up on the screen stating “VOTE TRUMP 2020” Last week i heard a knock on the door and turns out IT WAS TRUMP HIMSELF. his body guards tied me up to a chair and gagged me with a sock and told me i could go nowhere unless i promised to vote for him and tell all my friends and family. now this was a BAD thing for me being a poc. i promised to do so and told all my friends and family. he continued to call me me asking if i told them and i told him i did but they laughed and me and will not be voting for him. after i told him this i immediately regretted it bc he sent a private jet to my house that took me away to a tiny room that was like a jail cell. he continued to keep me there for months witg no food or water. i had to poop and pee on the floor. when all the protests happened he decided to let me go as long as i went to them as a trump supporter. i agreed and once i got home got all my stuff and fled the country. i am now hiding out in europe where i will be staying witg some cute french people.","date":"2020-07-09T10:33:06Z"}},{"id":"6176093212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"f*ck u Rapist aka: Trump","title":"All apps
