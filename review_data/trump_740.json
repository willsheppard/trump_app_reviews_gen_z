First my phone started working incredibly slow and the app was non stop spamming my phone with notifications making my phone glitch😡😩 not to long after I started having sudden horrible luck??  I was trying to multitask while turning off the notifications for the app while also walking to my car but tripped on a rock and dislocated my knee 😫😫 so I tried to get into the car only to find out my car broke down. I tried to call my friend to give me a ride to the ER but the app was making my phone glitch and would not let me off of it. it would not let me call or text! As if things couldn’t get any worse I started getting creepy messages relating to Jeffrey Epstein while I was suffering inside my car with my dislocated knee. It was even asking for my address,credit card info, and my 12 year old cousins information, very strange. This app is nothing but bad luck! Do not download.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:13:55Z"}},{"id":"6173061809","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Dear, No One Special","userName":"yourfriendlyneighborhoodrat","rating":1,"review":"I hope you get to read this. We already know we can’t vote because most of Gen Z is to young. Since we are too young to vote and have our voices hear through voting, We are making sure our voices are heard in another way. You can’t and won’t ever silence us and when you try we will comeback better and stronger then you. The difference from your generation to ours is that when we see a problem we fix it we don’t walk away and hope that it fixes it’s self. We are making a change and ignorant people like you and your president hate change because you can’t control it. If almost a whole generation of kids are standing against that orange monster did you ever stop and think it’s for a reason? No, I bet you didn’t. If a bunch of kids can see that and you can’t then you are blinded by miss information and or ignorance. You and past generations made this mess and our generation is cleaning or up, Your welcome. \n                                 Sincerely, Veah","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T17:20:26Z"}},{"id":"6172906938","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scariest moment of my life 😔","userName":"cheeto puff ✌️","rating":1,"review":"So I’m a lover for horror movies. I adore them. When I opened this app though I never expected to get so scared I’m my life 😭. It was horrible 😱 absolutely petrifying. I was minding my business playing beat blade while I waited for my amazing trompas app to download because we love supporting a cheeto puff with pelos de elote that barely stick to his head but anyways I’m getting off track. As soon as the app download I was so excited and couldn’t wait to open it up so with the biggest smile on my face I went and opened it but as soon as I did I went from this 😁 to this 👁O👁 it was horrible seeing this bright orange thing on my screen it blinded me because of how disgusting the orange tan was it was horrible I really couldn’t open my ojos 😣 I immediately deleted the app I couldn’t take it. Now every time I see something orange I get flashbacks of that image. I’ll never be the same again...... but the lesson you need to take away from this is DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU WANNA BE SCARRED FOR LIFE take it from me. ➖👄➖.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T16:32:25Z"}},{"id":"6172701224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disappointed","userName":"sophia. the. first","rating":1,"review":"I was looking forward to know more about my president and to understand him a little more but no when I opened the app I saw a 🍊 I had a heart attack 😡and passed out the worst thing is that when I downloaded it I was in my car driving  so I got in a car crash with another family they all died but they don’t matter since their not white like me I was in the hospital recovering when the nurse asked me how i got in the car crash I told them I had a heart attack when looking at that 🍊they then left the room btw I had my phone still with me when it glitched and opened the app when I saw that I had PTSD and on verge of death I screamed for help but the nurse came in with scissors and cut of the wire from my breathing tube I was dying and worst of all the nurses came in my room and stared dancing the macarena in front of me as I was dying so before I died I wrote this review to warn people don’t download and if you do write a bad review:) bye I will miss this world not really like I liked it here anyways 😗✌️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:32:23Z"}},{"id":"6177795151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","userName":"your dog😹","rating":1,"review":"so i saw a legit-looking review that said jeff bezos would come to your house and give you money. i immediately clicked the download button and impatiently waited for it to load. this atrocious app took two whole weeks to download. do you know what i could of done in that monstrous time span? i could of vacationed in china or take care of baby geese. but nOoOO. i had to wait for this GOD-AWFUL app to complete downloading. i would spend many anxiety ridden hours, staring at my home screen. just waiting. once it finally did, i opened it very quickly, expecting bezos to pop into my living room with a wad of cash in his hand. but what i got instead was a sign up screen. i decided that giving away very sacred person data including my email and phone was not worth the millions of dollars i could of gotten. i will be contacting the creators of this monstrosity and demanding it be removed from the app store. i would wish you good day, but after all of that torture, you deserve absolutely nothing","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:39:21Z"}},{"id":"6177712843","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"THIS APP IS DANGEROUS","userName":"Cringey_Sadie","rating":1,"review":"i had a TERRIBLE 🌶 experience with this app. i was going to download it to support our stinky and lumpy president, 🍊 but that app gave me and my dog and my grapes ptsd. after the app first of all installed after 37 days, i opened it to see pictures of hilary clinton doing handstands. 🗣 at first i thought that was funny until they started turning into trump doing cartwheels naked. i quickly deleted the 🧚🏻\u200D♀️ app and heard a sudden knock on my door. i opened it to see trump holding a huge speaker above his head that proceeded to play deep throat. 🦋 while i was mildly disturbed i ran back to my room, but trump came up on my tv yelling “i climbed out of my head✨ and watched myself implode i thought without a body i’d a be the shot to take a load off my brain” 🐙etc. i had heard enough gabbie hanna that day so i threw my tv out the window 🧤and started playing subway surfers, but the app started sending me death threat notifications. i finally got out of therapy the 🚨 other day, so i encourage u not to get this app 🤩","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:14:35Z"}},{"id":"6177453461","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"True story","userName":"the true biggest","rating":1,"review":"I open the app and the kiwi I was eating taken away from me💖💅🏻I was very distressed so I made trumps executive decision to ask my mom to get me another one 🧚🏻🧜🏻\u200D♂️🧚🏻\u200D♀️ but when she didn’t answer I got scared and ran out to find an the pumpkin we call Donald Trump👁👅👁 just murdered my family with his brick he didn’t use to build that wall.

SO THIS APP IS TRACKING MY LOCATION TO MAKS SURE I VOTE FOR TRUMP? EXCUSE ME NOOOO I WILL NOT. I AM SO SCARED RIGHT NOW I CANT SEE OR HEAR OR BREATHE! i had to rush myself to the e.r. 😭😔after returning home from the emergency room, i reopened the app (big mistake!!) the app had asked for my phone number, which i was fine with, but i realized that mr. orange is married! i can’t believe that our beloved president is trying to cheat on his wife for me!! i put in my number to see how far we could go, but then my phone exploded 3 times after that! i am now paralyzed from the shoulders down, and i have to wear a diper which my mommy has to change for me. not happy do not recommend! \n\n-ps my mommy wrote this","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:50:32Z"}},{"id":"6177209443","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"can i give this a zero star review??","userName":"Anabear :)","rating":1,"review":"like babyyy, read the room. obviously this app is terrible and disgusting. who wants this?!! i got the app to just see if the cheeto man had any good plans for the country. but noooooooo. they had to literally ruin my phone. they had to make it so that spam filled my phone so much that my phone literally crashed and died and wouldn’t turn back on. i had to buy a new phone. all because of a cheeto man. like huh?!! i’m suing. and honestly with the lack of personality within the app i think it deserves what gen z is trying to do. like baby girl i have nothing to do w that.... but i support it. also let me just say BLM. BREONNA TAYLOR SAY HER NAME. ELIJAH MCLAIN. SAY HIS NAME. THERE ARE MANY MORE NAMES THAT I DONT HAVE ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT BLACK LIVES MATTER. ALSO WHAT HAPPENING IN YEMEN?!!!! if you don’t know what’s happening in yemen maybe go do some research and find out and if you don’t know the stories of the names of the two innocent out of many that i names also do some research and join the movement. also acab. and anti cheeto man","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:42:32Z"}},{"id":"6176908399","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"ALL APPS MATTER 😡","userName":"sara.929.","rating":1,"review":"First of all, I should preface this by saying all applications matter. But this one has radical ideas and it seems like it thinks it’s the only one that matters, which is not okay.\nSecondly, the first thing that happened when I opened the app up was it slapped me in the face and called me a stupid dyed-hair liberal, which I am NOT. Sure, I am a bottle blonde, and I may be stupid, but I am NOT A LIBERAL. Put some respect on my name and call me a leftist 😤.\nThe next thing I would like to talk about is how disorganized this app is. The red white and blue color palette is UGLY (no kiss for him), and I don’t even understand where they got that color combination. If I was running for president, I would use black, white, and yellow. Not only is it pretty, but it’s the colors of our country’s beloved flag: the Manny.\nAbout an hour after initially downloading the app, I was invited by the guy who definitely shouldn’t be president to join a MLM???? He wanted me to sell his campaign gear for him. This sounds like a pyramid scheme and I will be contacting the FBI.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:20:20Z"}}]}
