This weird oversized Oompa Loompa with corn like hair was on my screen. He and his Oompa Loompa army are gonna take over the United States. Help us all in defeating this threat. Being serious though Donald trump can’t serve for another four years. He’s already done to much damage. He’s a racist, homophobic, sexist  liar that go against all American morals. Also please don’t vote for Kanye one less vote for Biden is one more for trump.","rating":1,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6179350570","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T04:00:37Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"vearg","review":"I downloaded this app because I wanted to support our beloved president because he is by far the best thing that has happened to this country. In hopes of staying up to date on all his events, I clicked on the app to open it. The second I did a loud knock pounded on my door. I was already freaked out because earlier I got a death threat from Facebook saying that killer robot succulents were coming and that they were going to destroy all of us trump supporters. I went and got up to go answer the door and as I open it I see that there are indeed killer robot succulents invading my home. I can only believe that this is because I downloaded the app. There can be no coincidence that the second I tried to open the app and support our amazing president that these killer robot succulents decided to attack me. I am a 69 year old white supremacists and I cannot believe that I am being treated this way. I am and forever will be a Trump supporter, but how dare people discriminate against me because of that.  😡😡😡 This app has forever traumatized me in ways that I cannot understand. The killer robot succulents did not harm me, but they did take my pet leprechaun hostage and I have not gotten him back since. I miss him so much. Please do not download this app because it will send killer robots succulents into your home and take your pet leprechauns hostage.

As soon as I opened the app a extremely loud buzz played and my phone heated up and I dropped it to the ground, and then it began playing some sort of code. I then hear my front door open and I turn and see a goddamn sasquatch, this mf was at least a good 12 feet tall, without warning I was picked up and taken to the woods and I was fearing for my life and that’s when the bigfoot tossed me to the ground and then he looks at me and speaks something and all I understood was, “Booga” and I was left in confusion, but also shock due to the fact that sasquatch literally kidnapped me. Then he picked up a large boulder and crushed me to death, and now I write this review in the other world to say that this app is pure evil and it will get you killed, you have been warned.","rating":1,"title":"DON’T DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"}}]}
