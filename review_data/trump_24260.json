So when it finally was downloaded I went in the app, and it kicked me out and wouldn’t let me get back in. A week later it let me back in and said “Don’t vote for trump”. Needless to say this is the worst app.","date":"2020-07-08T18:34:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"The Real John Bolton","title":"Horrible app"}},{"id":"6173287114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"This app took over a week to download and once it did it had the audacity to ask me to sign up!
