I honestly don’t know where to begin with how bad this app is. I would not download it. Also after a week of using it I started to hear voices telling me racist things. I then proceeded to yell “BLACK LIVES MATTER” but they don’t stop. So now I’m here deleting the app. Hope you don’t have the same experience as me.

He is scared of a bunch of kids so he is shutting down an app that allows kids to express themselves. What happened to freedom of speech, is that thrown out the window because gen z kids messed with your rally. So pathetic! also this app 🤮","title":"F**k Trump 🤮🤬😤","rating":1,"userName":"Little*Livie"}},{"id":"6177113881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T15:15:49Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I rate this app a 1 out of 5 starts, because all I see is stupidity & bias. There is nothing presidential about this app, Trump you sound like a teen girl trying to run for hoco queen. This app just shows how immature and incapable of doing your job, you really are. All I see is an app presenting a racist/rapist/sexist “president” and I along with thousands of other persons really am just not for it. The lack of knowledge and professionalism is ✨astronomical✨ it is wayyyy to high. So i’d like to leave you with one final thought, get your orange butt out of office and stop using the slogan: “Make America Great Again”  and look outside your privileged little bubble. You’ll see the distraction you refuse to see or pretend not to.

He told me that i was beautiful but i told him that i was poor and he immediately started dancing to a song that’s like “ r-r-r roll up to the party with my crazy pink wig, but i can’t fit through the door bc my as* is too big”??? 😔😢 I felt so scared and violated so i started crying. Then my grandma fell on the floor and dïed.
