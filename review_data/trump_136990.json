So I downloaded it & let me tell you that was a mistake. First off the app took forever to load and when it did my phone crashed and the app stopped loading. In addition to this it made my phone very slow. This was fixed when I deleted the app and restarted my phone. I was only able to see the the phrase “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”, while I was on the app. Like come on you make a buggy app and all it can say is that?? DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. It’s as crooked as Donald Trump.","title":"Very buggy and waste of space on my phone","isEdited":false,"userName":"jjty997","rating":1}},{"id":"6180039487","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:07:33Z","review":"I like to play the trumpet, so I decided to look for some apps that were related to the instrument. I figured “trump” was just a cute way to shorten the word trumpet. The only other name that would be cuter would be a toot, which kinda sounds like a fart. But that’s very fitting for this app as it is nothing more than excess gas that needed to escape from this strange orange man. I soon found out this app was not about my beloved instrument. \n\nWhen I first opened the app I was greeted with an image of this Trump man’s face with a spiraling black and white background with a voice saying, “You are an American. You serve under Mr. Trump and him alone. Trump is all you need.” This was extremely disturbing to me as it was obviously attempting to hypnotize the people who downloaded the app. Looking away from the screen and muting my phone helped, and this went on for a couple of minutes. \n\nThere was nothing special when the app loaded, although it was full of propaganda saying how wonderful this man is and how he should be our great overlord and that we are all his servants. I was appalled by this as he is obviously trying to take everything we care about away from us. \n\nOnce I tried to close the app, an image of this Mr. Trump came up and a voice (the same as before) said, “There is no escape. Trump is all you need. Stay and become one with the maga family.” I was forced to restart my phone and the app closed.\n\nThe crazy thing is that the word “official” made me think it was safe to download, but after I unlocked my phone I realized ALL OF MY APP ICONS TURNED INTO THIS MAN’S FACE! And when I checked my social media, all of my posts somehow changed into different images of him saying how great he is!\n\nCampaign messages were also spammed through my messages to my friends and family which annoyed them so much a few of my friends actually blocked me. Any message I tried to send failed and a gif of this man laughing took over my screen.\n\nThe mockery was just too much, and luckily I was able to sort this all out and everything went back to normal. However, I can not express how disappointed I am in the developers of this app, this Trump guy, and Apple for allowing such a dangerous app to be spread to innocent people.","title":"Misleading app","isEdited":false,"userName":"xxxMillerBugxxx","rating":1}},{"id":"6180039128","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T08:07:25Z","review":"THIS APP IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!
