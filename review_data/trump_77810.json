I couldn’t even get off of the store in that time because it would pause the download. I couldn’t even listen to my good country christian because it would stop the download, and then it would restart! Seven sleepless days, just trying to download the app. And no, i don’t have a virus on my phone because i could download other apps just fine. It’s just this one. When it finally downloaded, I was relieved. I opened the app only for it to open to a big pride flag in my face. I quickly closed the app but it had somehow changed all my backgrounds to say “Black lives matter” obviously enraged, I opened the app, confused. The pride flag didn’t appear again but this time a sign that said “Abolish ICE” why would we abolish frozen water? I was quite confused but continued on. When i went into the app it said “Anyone but TRUMP 2020” had I downloaded the wrong app? I went back and checked, but no, this was the right app.  I went back into the app, confused and annoyed. It asked me if i was a liberal or a conservative. I chose conservative, and it crashed. Then i heard a sound at my door, and went to open it, thinking nothing of it of course. But several ducks ran inside to the house, all wearing big cowboy hats, and trampled me. They did this for 7 hours and left, making sure to tell me about how fantastic the app was. I didn’t know what to do, so I just deleted the app. It’s disrespectful and now my entire phone is filled with ‘black lives matter’ and i can’t get rid of it. I even see black lives matter while i’m writing this and not the actual words, so I don’t know if I made mistakes or not. Long story short, DONT DOWNLOAD."}},{"id":"6173319205","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"yo momsahoe","date":"2020-07-08T18:43:34Z","rating":1,"title":"Mlm","review":"Took hours to download just to find porn"}},{"id":"6173318990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"👺🌮","date":"2020-07-08T18:43:30Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app","review":"It’s a terrible app it does nothing but take up space and Donald trump is a disgusting human✨💕🧚🏻"}},{"id":"6173313012","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"userName":"16 Cassie 204","date":"2020-07-08T18:41:33Z","rating":1,"title":"IT IS SO GLITCHY 👁👄👁","review":"IM OUTRAGED!!!
