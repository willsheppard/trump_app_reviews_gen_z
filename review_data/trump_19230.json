I just don’t approve of their lifestyle. And seeing all this trump stuff here really feels like he’s pushing it onto the children. I have trump supporter friends but again they just need to fix their lifestyle. Kids are too young to be seeing this kind of stuff in the world and it’s bound to influence them and corrupt their childhoods.","date":"2020-07-06T15:55:06Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Wiesnoht"}},{"id":"6149821212","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP","rating":1,"review":"after i got this app it made my screen have green lines then the screen turned completely black and when it came back on there was a horrifying picture of an orange thing and it won’t go away. every time i try to delete the app it burns me and it keeps blocking my friends and deleting my pictures and all of my apps","date":"2020-07-02T21:24:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"abscjfn"}},{"id":"6146113147","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Extremely Disappointing","rating":1,"review":"I recently discovered that trump had this app, so naturally I was excited to get my hands on it to support my hero! To my surprise though, after opening this app, both of my lungs collapsed from the shock of how disgusting the president really is and was rushed the ER.

I’m afraid they will be putting their safety in danger.","date":"2020-07-01T23:43:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Karen Trump"}},{"id":"6145908132","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WHY IS 0 STARS NOT AN OPTION!!!??","rating":1,"review":"Okay so I downloaded and opened this app, and I immediately was overwhelmed with this headache. And then I began to smell sweat and Cheeto puff in the air. I deleted the app, burned my phone, threw it out the window, ran it over with an electric car, and still did not get rid of the scent. It’s left a really bad taste now. Ugh. Now I gotta burn the whole house down. Don’t recommend the app or the Trump. 🤢","date":"2020-07-01T22:20:58Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Disney Dork for life !!!"}},{"id":"6145520243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"AMAZINGLY TERRIBLE","rating":1,"review":"i is a really nice app to be there for me a bit and it has been really good fun to watch the game play and play it for me and i was a great game it was just the best way to go buy the game it is fun to get it and i was a great game but it’s a great app for the game and it’s a really nice app but it’s a great app for that game it’s fun and it really is a good way of doing what it looks really nice to do.
