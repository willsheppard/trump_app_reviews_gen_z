I thought I was safe. I thought I could trust this app. But after having it on my phone I found it made my phone absolutely sick. If only my phone had worn a mask while interacting with this app. I’m not sure if my phone will make it. I’m not sure if I will get sick as well. I will continue to wear a mask while interacting with my phone. Now that the app is deleted from my phone I may have a chance.. Don’t get this app. Protect yourself. Wear a mask. No one is safe. Also the app is like, super orange..🍊"}},{"id":"6173499290","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"karen with kids ;)","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:47Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible app!!","review":"when i got on it told me that i had to put my number and i put down or whatever and then when i clicked submit and it said that trump would like to call me and said NO and then the screen went black (i would’ve expected to go white cuz you know)  and then my phone started to play the my little pony song i then shut it off, but wait there’s more, my ALEXA started to play dance monkey and that song is a NO NO. it’s almost like the government tapped into my Alexa just cuz i didn’t want mr. president to call me. anywho, don’t download it, not worth it AT ALL. good day."}},{"id":"6173494107","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Clariswagg","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:04Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Simp","review":"Where do I begin!! I was so excited for this app due to the FACT that trump is and will forever be the best president. When I heard about the app I was ready to see some only fans content because he cares so much about us that of course we were going to see some premium content!! An inside scoop into his life, I didn’t expect anything less from that beautiful ompaloompa Cheeto crossover of a man. WHEN I OPENED THE APP COME TO MY SURPRISE ITS THE MOST VANILLA CONTENT EVER. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! If I could give this app no stars I would. DO NOT GET THIS APP!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT IS MADE MY PHONE GLITCH AND IT ELECTROCUTED ME! 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! VERY BAD! 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"}},{"id":"6173444395","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zoe Tears","date":"2020-07-08T19:26:57Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"this app destroyed my life!!!","review":"When it finished downloading (which took 14 hours), my 64 gigabyte storage was immediately drained on my brand new phone! when i went into the app all i could see was photoshopped pictures of joe biden and osama bin laden doing obscene things, and all of these photos automatically saved to my phone! all of my contacts received messages from my number that if they’re not cisgender, white, and male to block my phone number. because of this app i lost friends, family, and important connections with colleagues and universities i may have attended."}},{"id":"6173359234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ester Williams","date":"2020-07-08T18:57:27Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"horrible so sad about the outcome","review":"this took at least 5 hours to download which was automatically a very big upset. then it kept on blasting the national anthem while my child was trying to sleep. it started to tell me things. it told me to sacrifice my baby to donald trump. i was a big supporter before but if my president is apart of a satanic cult, i don’t know if i can vote for him. my family and children always come first. i downloaded this app to support but it did the complete opposite. very disappointed with my president. i wouldn’t even bother getting this app EVER AGAIN. thank you"}},{"id":"6173347253","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jejxndjxnnslxndk","date":"2020-07-08T18:53:14Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"DONT GET THIS APP","review":"This app is HORRIBLE, it kept on glitching for me. And I have good internet. So it’s YOUR app that’s messing with my phone. Just for that, it gets one star. If you guys take TikTok away from us, it’s like taking are lives. That means more people will die. And I don’t think you want that. It wouldn’t make you look like you guys are helping us, it would make you look like bad people 😬. I mean Mr. Orange 🍊 is already a bad person, but you guys get the point 🙄. I don’t think you want that. And you can’t get mad at any of us for saying are opinion out there 🥰. But we do “love” our orange President. 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊"}},{"id":"6173299493","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"taylor papryl","date":"2020-07-08T18:37:17Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"i just about DIED 🙈🦋✨","review":"from the start, this app has been a disaster. when i first downloaded it, it took about 3 hours to download fully and it definitely wasn’t because of my wifi. when i opened it all i saw was a cheeto puff taking up the whole screen and just about went blind. it didn’t stop from there. when i closed the app i got like a SERVERE virus and the only app i can open is the app store to write a review on cheetos horrible app. then my phone like grew legs from this stupid trump app and attacked me 🙈✨. moral of the story, just DONT do it to yourself. cheeto puff isn’t worth it."}}]}
