He put on his wig and then that’s when things started to take a turn for the worse. An awful smell of spray tan and money started to come out of the charging port and Cheeto dust started spraying out of the microphone holes. I was covered in it and my throat started to close because I am allergic to Enriched Corn Meal one of the main ingredients in Cheetos. As I called 911 and injected my epi-pen they could barely understand my address. As they opened my door they got blasted down the front steps because of the power coming out of my phone! As they tried to bring me back to life one of my pet Chinese hairless cats stepped on my neck and broke it (she is pretty large) As they were rolling me into the ambulance one of them closed the door on my pinky toe and it fell off right there in front of me. At this point I didn’t think anything could get worse. As we were driving to the hospital a window and large statue fell out of a building right onto my stomach. At least I was protected by my rock hard abs but it still didn’t feel good! I see the statue and it was a sculpture of his many wives together! I was shocked. I look at the gaping hole on the hood of the ambulance and saw where this came from the Trump tower! I was very angry. Trump ruined 4 previous years of my life while I was in a coma. My hairless cat even had babies! Wow I can’t even tell the rest of the story...","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:31:20Z"}},{"id":"6174467424","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Traumatic experience that changed my life check","isEdited":false,"userName":"Pie2014","review":"I first downloaded this app because it intrigued me. A Cheeto  running for president? That would have to make history. When I opened the app, a red screen popped up asked me to sign the terms and conditions. Which nobody ever reads so I signed them. This would later prove to be the greatest mistake of my life.  Later that night while I was snuggled up right in my bed  asleep when someone woke me up. They were wearing red baseball hats that said “Make America great again” and all had horrible spray tans. They grabbed me and threw me over their shoulder then ran outside and down the street. It was a very uncomfortable ride for me. I asked them where they were going but they just said anything but the answer to the question. When we finally stopped I looked up and *gasp* Trump tower! It was a rather large and ugly building. I asked why they took me there and they just said “you should have read the terms and conditions”. I told them that I think this is still technically illegal. Then the large orange Cheeto himself came out and started speaking. But I couldn’t understand what he was saying because it sounded like he was speaking the language of Donald Duck rather than Donald trump. His squawking got louder and more aggressive and his followers came out of the shadows and joined in. Then all of the sudden Kayne West came out and started rapping to the beat of invisible drums and fog flooded the area. I turned to run but I had been paralyzed. Then, just as I had lost all hope, a man descended from the sky and smacked the foul faced Cheeto right across his spray tanned face. Then the man, who had turned out to be Barack Obama himself, grabbed me and started running. We ran all the way back to my house and he tucked me back into bed. Then he turned and ran. So moral of the story is to always read the terms and conditions or else you may be kidnapped by rabid people in the night. I will forever be scarred and traumatized from this experience.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:30:33Z"}},{"id":"6174465336","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Who else is from tiktok 🤣","isEdited":false,"userName":"zzzzfrycookzzzz","review":"Trump is is terrible guy and this app is total trash 😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:29:56Z"}},{"id":"6174462225","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER🤬","isEdited":false,"userName":"mochiflavor","review":"honestly, just delete the app already luv🙄dont forget to leave one star🙈💅🏻✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:28:58Z"}},{"id":"6174445058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"i think you know why it’s bad","isEdited":false,"userName":"americastupidasf","review":"when you first open the app you just see the most disgusting orange creature 🤢🤢🤢download at your own risk folks.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:23:48Z"}},{"id":"6174441656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"GARBAGE","isEdited":false,"userName":"yippy ki ya8","review":"Let me tell you if I can get this zero stars I would ✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:43Z"}},{"id":"6174438778","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible App","isEdited":false,"userName":"Thank you, ew.","review":"First off, ew.
