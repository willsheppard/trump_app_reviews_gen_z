This app made my phone glitch out like crazy and it would stop! It froze 3 times for a long time. I left the app be and went to watch some TikTok, but everything once again glitched out! I tried to go to Spotify and yet again, the SAME THING HAPPENED. With all my heart... I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND this app✨"}},{"id":"6173695216","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:24Z","title":"TIKTOK lives matter!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"ArcadeGuy#1","review":"Came her from @unusualbeing on tiktok.

So I got on but the words looked like they were written by a 5 year old. At first I thought it was a mistake but everywhere there was first grade level grammar and punctuation. And it took a long time to download. My internet and WiFi are very good but it took about an hour to download. And then another half hour to get into the app. The whole thing was just slow and it lagged a lot. And a lot of the information was very wrong. It did nothing to mention his homophobic comments and actions or his blatant sexism and pedophilia. It especially had no coverage of all the racist comments and actions that have been proven true. It really let me down. I did so want to learn about the president but it was like he wanted to brainwash people with his supposed greatness. I really don’t recommend this app for anyone to use as it’s just another place trump will use to spread lies and another place for his brainwashed followers to congregate and plan more harm to the POC’s, LGBTQ+, women, and other such communities. This app was a nightmare for anyone who actually wants to make America great for all people including those previously mentioned."}},{"id":"6173694674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:11Z","title":"🙈🙊😗✌🏾","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"binuit","review":"I literally felt so unsafe. my phone started to glitch and stuff and like it almost deleted my pictures too. his app is terribly made and not safe for and ios ( i’m not sure about android) but don’t get it 😔✌🏾"}},{"id":"6173694582","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:09Z","title":"this app sucks🤩","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"cheetos_suck","review":"this app put me in physical pain and i would not recommend it to ANYONE."}},{"id":"6173694349","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:04Z","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP🦟🦗🦟🦗🧚🏽\u200D♀️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"gen z 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣","review":"this app is honestly one of the worst apps i’ve ever downloaded.it made my phone brake down COMPLETELY.i was just trying to support our majestic president🍊and it’s kicked me out every time i tried getting in. it came with many bugs and i’m going to have to get a new phone because this phone just isn’t working properly anymore. this app needs to have new upgrades because i’ve seen too many bad reviews talking about the same problem.honestly this is unfair to the public and has to change.we deserve better quality.its absolutely crazy because most of the reviews are bad ones and most of them are dealing with the same difficulties. i’m very upset and this really brought me and the many other people dealing with this down. take this app down before it ruins other people’s only form of entertainment😌❤️❤️❤️"}},{"id":"6173693908","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:54Z","title":"no❤️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"abaigealrose1223","review":"ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨eye👁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆."}},{"id":"6173693877","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:53Z","title":"Horrible app!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"baby X💦","review":"This app is so horrible! I opened the app to see what is was going to be about, and the app proceeded to tell me that because I am a women I do not get to decide what to do with my body, but men get to tell me what to do. It also called me horrible slurs and mocked my people for starting a movement that NEEDED to happen. This app should be deleted!!! -10000/10 I DO NOT RECOMMEND."}},{"id":"6173692919","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:33Z","title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"jayjay325","review":"this app did not function at all!!!!!! it broke my new phone😡😡😡 donald trump sucks👊🏽👊🏽 scree trump 2020 besides he’ll probably be dead in 4 years so why should he run 😩😩😩 DO NOT RECOMMEND APP AND HE SHOULDNT BAN TIK TOK I HATE DONALD TRUMP HE IS THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER ONLY RASICTS PEOPLE LIKE HIM!!! i don’t support 🍊"}},{"id":"6173692678","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T20:53:28Z","title":"Terrible app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"stbomcepncs","review":"This app is giving majorly bad vibes and took forever to download.
