It put virus upon virus on my phone and made me put in credit card information. I’m not convinced this is run by trumps campaign and gives me the impression it’s a scam. I’ve seen LOTS of slurs, nudity and EXTREME violence that i was completely unwarned about. It’s not worth your time and the stress. CANNOT believe this is on the app store"}},{"id":"6175793590","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"💩🥱👾☠️🤤","userName":"makaksiz","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:53:53Z","review":"This app is terrible I downloaded it thinking it was gonna be a good idea and outa know where my phone started glitching and my friend was asking me why was I posting random pictures!!! I was very confused turns out this app was exposing everything on my camera roll 🤢 it was messing up my phone just to sum it up don’t download this app it’s sooooo terrible and will mess up your phone 😈"}},{"id":"6175703441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"SO BAD","userName":"rachel💗💗💗💗💗","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:22:58Z","review":"Once I downloaded the app it asked to allow my location services, without thinking about it, I clicked allow. Within seconds, my phone was getting hacked. A big message displayed saying “You Oompa Loompa Built B****, Vote Trump 2020.” It was so uncalled for and it really hurt my feelings. I was thinking about voting for Trump but this definitely makes me reconsider. I also can’t vote but still, that’s not the point."}},{"id":"6175666551","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO DOWNLOAD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES","userName":"neutral name","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:10:25Z","review":"After I downloaded this app to see what it was about and to see how awful it was- my sleep paralysis demon told me that he was leaving because he felt the need to bring in an even worse creature and now I’m stuck with a combination of a Karen, Trump, the embodiment of scooter ankle and everything awful on this planet. I warn you- Don’t download unless you want this unholy abomination to loom over you at night"}},{"id":"6175656833","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"worst app ever","userName":"emilyybok","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:07:05Z","review":"The app took two years to download! And when I actually opened the application, everything was so laggy and slow and I became so frustrated trying to operate it!! Nothing worked!! How disgraceful is this to Donald’s name and reputation?!! Whoever made this app clearly has no regard for respect and politeness and overall respect!! There was zero information about Trump (I love you Donald babe!) and I am so angry and disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6175610818","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting","userName":"abby_1982","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:50:22Z","review":"The absolute worst app I have ever encountered took many days to download and forever loading when trying to open it. But that’s not even the worst part the worst part is it’s a trump app makes me sick that things like this exist I don’t want children seeing this vile joke of a mans app on the play store. But simply for souly existing it’s the most horrendous app 1 star an absolute waste of space."}},{"id":"6175590074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Dump trump and his app","userName":"sarahsatori","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:42:51Z","review":"This is literally Russian spyware. Not only was the app slow to download, I noticed that the area around my eyes became increasingly pale the longer I stared at it, and what’s worse, the app seemed to give me a strange tan on my face. Not a glowy vibe, more of an orangey, crushed Cheeto type of look. I heard that his crowd sizes are pathetic, plus he’s a racist who is dismantling democracy and has a thing for minors. Hopefully we can patch all these bugs in November."}},{"id":"6175558463","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRENDOUS APP","userName":"Alyssa-101","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:31:10Z","review":"One of the worst apps I have encountered in my ✨whole life✨!!! I definitely needs major work done to make it better...Although I was happy to definitely NOT A SINGLE SIGN of racism, homophobia, or sexism. But the whole aesthetic is just ✨revolting✨I think it definitely needs some more rainbows to start 🏳️\u200D🌈 but over all I am not impressed by this app it ✨definitely does not✨ need to be taken down thought...✨🧚🏽\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6175527430","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"AN APP FOR LOSERS!!!","userName":"Sammey3","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:19:42Z","review":"This app is terrible it took up so much space on my phone and as soon as I downloaded it my phone stopped holding a charge. I also started getting made fun of by friends and family for having this app. Physical symptoms I experienced from owning this app were: turning orange, saying racial slurs involuntarily and then claiming it was a joke, disrespecting women, and dimentia. Do not download this app it WILL steal your information."}},{"id":"6175318131","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Horrible app just a plain crusty nasty app","userName":"LydiaFaith123","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:58:24Z","review":"Literally this app has had way too many glitches with most of the features and drains my battery like crazy. I’m severely upset with the lack of accountability for the glitches that this app produces and anyone who has the audacity to stand with the creators of the app and say it’s a good app. Like literally kills my battery and no action is being taken?!?! Sad.🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️🧚\u200D♀️"}}]}
