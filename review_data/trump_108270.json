If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly…\nPam: Don’t, don’t–\nJim: Would…\nPam: If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.\nJim: Well, it’s too late, because I’m proposing… that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.\nMichael: Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven’t done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?\nAndy: What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more… zing, and a little more pep?\nMichael: Zing and pep, see that’s those are the kind of words we’re looking for. Yes, Jim?\nJim: What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?\nMichael: Now we’re cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme…\nJim: An urban thing…\nMichael: An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?… Stanley, earth to Stanley…\nStanley: Not me.\nMichael: Yes you.

When I woke up there was a MAGA hat fused to my head even though I fully and unconditionally LOVE my cheeto dust covered baby Donald that didn’t mean I wanted a MAGA hat fused to my head!\nThen my condition worsened I began to chant “Trump 2020” uncontrollably. Thats when I realized that it was the hat that was causing this madness! So I tried even harder to pry the hat off my head but it wouldn’t budge so I ended up having to BURN it off I now have no hair but at least I am not chanting that nonsensical slogan any longer. I then immediately deleted this pathetic excuse for an app. While my symptoms were mild my friends who downloaded this app said they experienced the following symptoms...\n\n- uncontrollably buying trump murch\n- skin slowly turning orange \n- lack of basic grammar and sentence stucture\n- a worsening of vocabulary (not able to say big word)\n- shrinkage of the penis\n- strange attraction to underage females\n-  fear of minorities and foreign languages \n- random misogynistic beliefs\n- uncontrollably watching fox news on repeat\n- severe insensitivity\n- propagating fake news\n\nThese are some but not all of the consequences that come with this app CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!! However since deleting this I have felt free and have learned to love everybody despite our differences. I am proud to say that I have since donated to the BLM movement and have been accepting of different people and different cultures.\n\n✨🧚✨💫🌿🍃🌸💫✨","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-12T17:13:16Z"}},{"id":"6064769514","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"👁👄👁","userName":"_o_u_c_h_","rating":1,"review":"tried to use but the app was entirely in pig latin. is this a joke?","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-11T23:27:44Z"}},{"id":"6064706682","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nope ✌️","userName":"mushr00m_boi","rating":1,"review":"This made my day✨🧚🏼🤩 WORSE 🥰✨♥️","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-11T23:01:43Z"}},{"id":"6056424573","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP IN HISTORY","userName":"idcfu123","rating":1,"review":"It’s trash just like Cheeto puff himself.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-09T22:24:59Z"}},{"id":"6027391148","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"For Losers","userName":"Modest serving","rating":1,"review":"Fake news for racists, liars, and degenerates.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-02T21:48:01Z"}},{"id":"5868147821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is lame sorry","userName":"Cute0080","rating":1,"review":"Lol","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-04-26T22:10:30Z"}},{"id":"6179190283","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TikTok is going to be banned","userName":"myeia","rating":1,"review":"Dumb","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T03:05:32Z"}},{"id":"6179104803","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","userName":"wyatsbes","rating":1,"review":"Not human","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T02:33:46Z"}},{"id":"6179073173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"bad","userName":"big poopz","rating":1,"review":"it’s trash don’t do it!","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T02:22:07Z"}}]}
