It preys on young girls and spreads STDs like wildfire. The app itself is so flawed, biased, and racist I canâ€™t bear to look at it any longer. It should be taken off the App Store and outlawed in this country. It spreads a message of hate. Iâ€™d rather stick my entire head into a beehive than see this man- I mean app- succeed in any way possibly.","date":"2020-07-08T23:35:09Z","userName":"loveMEbugzy","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174115969","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"horrible app.","review":"this is unreal!
