We had to rush him to the hospital because he hit his head and was bleeding badly. The app wouldn’t stop flashing so I tried to delete it but when I tried it started emitting an awful screeching sound. They made me leave the hospital because I was scaring the patients. On my ride home the phone continued to get louder and a flock of birds began to follow me. More and more birds joined the flock and then they lifted my car off a bridge. They carried my car up onto a mountain to a big cave. There was no road to get back down so I tried to call for help but the trump app wasn’t allowing me to make calls. Then I heard a loud noise from in the cave and went to investigate incase there was another way out. Instead of an exit I found a giant bird creature that tried to eat me. I ran out of the cave and into the forest. I tried to run down the mountain but I tripped and rolled all the way down. I laid at the bottom thinking I was close to death. But then as I was taking my last dying breaths a figure appeared. The figure came closer and finally I was able to see his face. Bernie Sanders. He lifted me up and carried me home where he nursed me back to health. My phone had fallen out in the cave so he called the hospital to check on my dad. He was dead. I cried my eyes out my father was gone. Bernie hugged me and told me “it’s ok, I’ll adopt you”. Maybe now I have Bernie as an adoptive dad but I lost so much more than I’ve gotten from downloading this app. I suggest you don’t download who knows what will happen.","title":"Worst app ever do not download!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"EflamPlayz"}},{"id":"6173038602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T17:13:06Z","review":"This app took over a week to download and after it finally did the app didn’t even work. I got more and more annoyed trying to get it to work. I eventually gave up and tried to delete it. It said it wasn’t able to delete the app which was weird. Out of frustration I threw my phone across the room. My phone then started vibrating. I could then hear something coming from my phone. When I picked up my phone to look at the screen I had noticed that the app had finally opened. In bold letters it said, WHY DID YOU TRY TO GET RID OF ME? I then got scared and put my phone in the trash.
