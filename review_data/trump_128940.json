Since this app has done nothing but mess up and offer me black market deals I had no choice but delete it. Turns out once you download the app you have to keep it for another year before you can delete it. Since the day I got the app weird things have been happening to me. My phone is messing up now. My background is trumps nude picture. And let me tell you nothing to see there. It’s tiny. Not the point but my background is an American flag but with little trump heads and roaches (with the hats 🧢)scattered  across the flag. Makes me ill. I had no other choice to throw out the phone. Since then I swear I kept since naked trumps around my house. If it’s either a shadow or a literal figure I’m making eye contact with. Also I got roaches out of no where. Not even the worse part though, I also have krats. Yes krats a new species of rats but with Karen haircuts. I made it up but still they talk exactly like kids bop Karen and it’s scary now I have to move . I would definitely not recommended getting this app‼️","userName":"chloesstinky","title":"TERRIBLE APP all the bad reviews are right!!"}},{"id":"6176004203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:03:42Z","review":"I had to wait over two hours for the goddamn app to download and then once I finally opened it...it completely glitched and all my history was erased!!","userName":"saySAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY","title":"HORRENDOUS"}},{"id":"6176004073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T10:03:40Z","review":"Umm...Big Kock?

I’m ashamed of anyone who enjoys it. It rooie 17 hours to download and I had 3 gigabytes to spare. The quality is so low that I would delete this app quickly. Have u no shame! I tried to get help with the situation but the workers would not listen! They shamed me for being of color and called me monkey. I could hear the “Ooo ooo ah ah” noises they made at me. Honestly broke my heart. They said that since I was Muslim they’d give me no service and that I need to “Allahu Akbar away from this country”! I’m so ashamed of u guys! Why on earth does this racist app exist? Please rethink this app and delete it from this App Store. I am baffled that u would think it deserves to be here. After being discriminated against horribly I don’t know what I could do next. They told me multiple times to go shove bananas down my throat. I am a young woman do I deserve this behavior?
