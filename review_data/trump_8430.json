My phone was glitching and then i found a spider and killed it but it had babies and now it’s all over my house so i have to take them to daycare now. My fridge has never had any problems but for some reason now I need to walk it everyday. I also grew a 6th toe ever since i downloaded this app. I can’t believe our president would create such a terrible application for his people."}},{"id":"6172111677","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just my opinion on things","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T12:49:03Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"salteeeee","review":"I downloaded this app to see why I should vote for trump but, i feel like i cannot do it because of the past. What i mean is that there is so many times trump has been a very inappropriate person lets say. And you might say that ‘well he brought jobs up and back to America’ But he actually lost money. And if You don't like Donald Trump don’t vote for Kanye it’s just a thing to help Trump get more votes essentially because Kanye supports Trump. Thank you for your time if you read this."}},{"id":"6159553477","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Awful Experience 😖😖","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-05T08:32:10Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sister Janie","review":"I first got this app to support president trumpie 😻😻😼 but it ended up being the worst app ever made!!! 😡Not only was I BOMBARDED by the ugliness of everything but trumpies face was so orange it blinded me.😾😾The white supremacy in here was too much for me 🤪🤪 and it actually KILLED my dog.😿😿 If you get this app your dog will die and be prepared to never be able to see for the rest of your life!🤖🤖 THIS APP SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN NOW!!!!😡😡🤬🤬 our great America that I am so proud to be apart of is hurting because of this app.💩💩Please take it down for the sake of AMERICA!!❤️❤️❤️🙈🙈🙈"}},{"id":"6149371264","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Do NOT download!! 😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-02T18:24:01Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"FDT2020MAGANOMO","review":"I downloaded this app initially to support my wrinkly old orange peel but as soon as I opened the app it asked for all of my information! Of course I went through with the process so I could receive updates but immediately after, I began receiving spam emails, texts, and phone calls. My phone is no longer functioning due to the overload of spamming and I will have to purchase a whole new device as it had also caused several viruses. This app is horrible!!!!!"}},{"id":"6145902202","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"hell nah🧚🏽🌿✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T22:18:34Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"just a traumatized person-MRG","review":"Since I downloaded this app I couldn’t stop having nightmares, every single time when i fell asleep or just whenever I simply closed my eyes Mr Trump came to haunt me, he would come really close to me with his orange tan and his white/yellowish hair, looking like a oompa loompa and just say “hello”. This has been a traumatic experience and I cannot handle it no more, since it happened I can’t be around anything orange no more.\nPlease spread the word about the app, I do not want anybody else going through this horrible thing."}},{"id":"6145343658","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-01T18:46:11Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"kelfnnffkkf","review":"i was super excited to use this app 🧚🏾\u200D♀️ me and my grandma waited for it to download and when i opened the app there was a big orange monster !

And then my pet rat, Tommy, started barking! Which obviously is directly related to me getting the app. There is no other explanation. That being said, the app made me have a horrible, no good, very bad day. And I Definitely recommend this app so people can see with their own eyes how bad this app is. I especially recommend this app to the gen z population because they are the future and should be kept informed."}},{"id":"6137777244","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This is the worst app ever","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-30T00:20:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"nyancat_28","review":"So after downloading this app my little sister got my phone without me watching and she said that Donald Trump was the man who hates immigrants and black people, and then she asked me why he hated us. It’s so sad cause a little 7 year old girl shouldn’t have to worry about these things because of our president’s actions 😔. Anyways i really don’t recommend this app because our president isn’t the right man to drive our country, since he spreads fear and injustice through the people 😞😭."}},{"id":"6137411770","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Very disappointed","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T21:48:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"stuphjidbbdbh","review":"So I downloaded the app to see what it was all about and my phone crashed. Then images of CHEETO PUFFS showed up on my screen, I was in shook and accidentally dropped my phone on my face. When I looked at the screen a message from my beloved president 🧚\u200D♂️said “I am the master of all Cheeto puffs” with the evil emoji(😈) and it also said he rubs Cheeto puffs on his skin to give him that orangish look. I knew he rubbed Cheetos on himself 🤦🏾\u200D♀️. This whole  mess is so sad. I expected more from Trump but this is just fun and games to him. DISAPPOINTED.🖐🏾"}},{"id":"6136940409","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Just Repulsive","rating":1,"date":"2020-06-29T18:37:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Zorry101","review":"If you would want something like Donald Trump in office you need to educate yourself on our history of America. Look around and see what’s happening. People are dying from COVID-19, the entire system is corrupt, black lives aren’t getting the justice they deserve, and so many other countless things that are going on in this country that need to be dealt with ASAP. Trump if you think for a second that you will be elected twice...think again. Gen Z is undoubtedly powerful so do not underestimate us. NO JUSTICE NO PEACE. ACAB & BLM ✊🏾"}}]}
