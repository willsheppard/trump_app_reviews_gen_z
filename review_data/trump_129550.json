Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister.

And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye!

Pence","review":"I wanted to stay updated on the election, but this app is terribly designed. I can’t find anything, and everything I do see is a blatant lie. This app makes false claims and is, in a phrase, “fake news.” It is utterly useless and arguably harmful to the consumer who believes its contents. When I downloaded this app, I felt like throwing my iPhone against the wall. I used to love Apple, but putting this app on the App Store is unforgivable. I’m so upset, I’d rather purchase a dell or android the next time I’m looking for a computer, tablet, or cell phone. Please remove this app.","date":"2020-07-09T05:01:09Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Apple needs to remove this app immediately!!!!"}},{"id":"6175164157","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"happygirl12345680","review":"Once I got it it’s started glitching and it was super bad and I would give it a 000000.0/10 I would not recommend it","date":"2020-07-09T05:00:32Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s horrible"}},{"id":"6175163468","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Shane's Crazy Pink Wig","review":"This app is the cause that my dead horse got cancer and the reason that my pet snake ate itself. I had to get a new snake so I rode my giant dwarf dragon to the penguin store but the man running the stand didn’t have any grapes so I waddled away ‘till the very next day. I had to get some wood to build the cage for my newborn sister so I went to 7/11 but they told me they didn’t sell cherries so I had to become a roach but I lost my Pokémon cards that turned into spaceships when you said the code word coconut. My toilet also ran away because my mom drank the Powerade under the sink while Casper visited my uncle john in prison. In conclusion, this app made me loose my pet snail.","date":"2020-07-09T05:00:18Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP"}},{"id":"6175162519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"AHAHLMAO","review":"fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky fish n stanky 🤢 that’s how horrible the app was 👁👄👁","date":"2020-07-09T05:00:00Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"bruv"}}]}
