I downloaded thinking by signing up I would be able to find the love of my life. Unfortunately the only person I saw on this app was a big orange Cheeto who was actually quite traumatizing. He kept saying things that were racist, homophobic, islamophobic, and xenophobic. Not to mention he keeps swiping on the profiles of younger ladies. I refuse to support the app of this racist rapist. Disgusting.","isEdited":false,"userName":"🦆🧃🐛🐌","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:36:30Z","title":"Worst app ever"}},{"id":"6177578531","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app took several days to download onto my phone after  downloaded onto my phone it started crashing then it wiped all of my data and then I had to restart my whole phone and I had to get all of my contacts back I would not recommend downloading this app because it is a waste of time and it will ruin your phone","isEdited":false,"userName":"Maria Cantita","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:31:55Z","title":"Phone problems"}},{"id":"6177561166","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I thought that downloading the app would be a good idea to keep up with the political state of our country however when I downloaded the app it made my entire phone hard to use. My phone became really slow. When I was on the app most of the functions didn’t work and it seemed all glitchy.

The stench was an overwhelming odor that caused 4 nose hairs to dislodge themselves from my nose. After whipping out my potpourri, I started spraying it all over the room. I was quickly seized by security as I made my way to Donald Duck’s big toe and was kindly escorted out with a quiet “thank you” muttered under the breath of the beefiest security guard I’ve ever seen. \n\nIf you support good hygiene and clean feet, don’t support Good Ol’ Donal :)","isEdited":false,"userName":"CatMcTatRat","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:00:55Z","title":"Donal’s Fêet Smell 🤗"}},{"id":"6177437810","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This is the worst app ever it kept crashing my phone and shutting it down I couldn’t do anything about THAT had to bring my phone to the repair shop, they did nothing about it they said it was broken get a new phone then I deleted this app since I was deleting every app took me about 5 minutes to delete cus it never wanted to delete and my phone stopped crashing, DONT GET THIS IF YOU DO RATE IT 1 STAR","isEdited":false,"userName":"Wolfy.

I was trying to get more information from our president trumpkin about Coronavirus and what his election plans are going to be. But the app took 4 days to download and kept kicking me out when I opened it and it made my phone crash on multiple occasions. On top of that, it gave no accurate information to what was going on. I would’ve given it a lower review but that was unavailable.","isEdited":false,"userName":"starcrosser05","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:39:05Z","title":"ARGH"}},{"id":"6177400063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was trying to use this to do my research on his beliefs and opinions from an educational standpoint, and I feel like everything was just spam and then I couldn't figure out how to turn off the text alerts. It's just another way the Trump campaign is trying to overload citizens with information and biased and untruth about matters. Not fact based at all. 0/5 if that was possible.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Christi 1992","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T16:37:31Z","title":"This App is Terrible"}}]}
