The absolute worst app you can download! It costed the life of my cat😡","userName":"Ggm8gg","review":"I was so excited to download an app that allows me to keep up with my respectful president, however when i opened the app my phone was spammed with so many messages!! This aggravating because i have an older model which will freeze and overheat faster than other phones. My phone froze due to all the messages I got and my phone overheated in my hand!!! 😡 It got so hot that it burned my fingers and i dropped it. It landed on my cat who is 16 years old with severe heart disease. My cat was so scared that he had a heart attack!! I tried calling local animal hospitals to try and save my baby, but due to Abbott’s reopening to early and covid cases rising, they were all closed. The absolute love of my life died right there due to some stupid app! I was so devastated that i picked up the phone and chucked it out the window. I left it there and never wanted to see it ever again. After 30 minutes of mourning my poor baby’s death, i smelled something burning. I was so confused and started looking all over the house to see what’s burning. I look outside and what did i see??? I saw a fire spreading to my house from the phone that over heated due to this app! I quickly grabbed my cats corpse and ran outside. I was a heaping sobbing mess all because of an app!! My cat died and everything i owned went up in flames. I never knew how awful an app could be, until i downloaded this app. I will never support this man again after his app took everything from me.","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6136364347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T15:27:14Z","title":"very not good","userName":"#Me.myself.and.i😘","review":"this app is horrible if it were possible i’d give 0 stars. doesn’t even deserve 1 but that’s the lowest rating one could even give so it’ll do. anywho jojo2020","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6136224036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T14:45:10Z","title":"I saw that from a mile away and my brain’s made of cotton 🧸","userName":"civoaoapcsciw","review":"No ❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
