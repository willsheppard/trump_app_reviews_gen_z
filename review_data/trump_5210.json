Once I pressed download, not only did it delete all the other apps and photos on my phone, it ALSO just DELETED my whole phone!!!!! I cant believe just an app would do this to me. Right now I am leaving a review from a different device since the app has DELETED my phone and everything on it. I HIGHLY do not recommend getting the app and supporting Trump, because how can you support an app that just wipes away your own personal phone from you!!!! This is very scary and real news, and trust me you wont regret not downloading this scam of an app!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173780269","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:25:38Z","userName":"286492+;63967926/'dks!¥\\…}|","isEdited":false,"title":"MY DOGS HEAD GOT RIPPED OFF 😭😭😭😱😱😱","review":"So as any other sane person, I was going to download this app to support my dead president 😭😭😭😔😔😔 Sorry the his family, and I’m sorry for their loss. But that isn’t the point I am writing this horrid review. So when I downloaded this app, my dog was barking at something in the basement, and I went to go look in the basement and my dog went first. So as I went down the stairs I saw THE GHOST OF TRUMP EATING MY DOGS HEAD! I was so horrified, I didn’t know that this was going to happen, I should have listened to the other reviews. 😭😭😭 I hope you don’t make the same mistake as me and download the app so your dog won’t get eaten by Trump. 😭😭😭"}},{"id":"6173772047","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T21:22:39Z","userName":"raphie🧞\u200D♀️","isEdited":false,"title":"this app definitely deserves less than a one star","review":"this app took FOREVER to download and the quality is TERRIBLE. it took up so much of my phone storage and i dont even use it often. also, it keeps glitching whenever i try to open the app. i really dont recommend this app, it doesnt even function correctly, how did they let this launch, smh. i keep getting notifications from the app even though i've turned off notifications for the app in settings and it keeps blowing up my phone, its getting really annoying. overall, i do NOT recommend this app at all."}},{"id":"6173653954","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:39:39Z","userName":"mar_157","isEdited":false,"title":"not helpful at all😡","review":"as soon as I opened the app my toes fell off😔. all of them, just swiped clean away from my foot😿.

(He said he’d seen this done in the movie Holes starring Shia LeBoeuf and wanted to give it a try). The next day my father fell off of a ladder and caught coronavirus, my mother was attacked by a wild boar and got a paper cut RIGHT BETWEEN HER FINGERS and my grandma drowned. (in a bowl of tomato soup). I am terrified to live any longer because I know the curse will soon come for me. All I want is to never have downloaded this app. Everyday is a living hell and I pray the end comes quickly to end my suffering."}},{"id":"6173623064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:28:38Z","userName":"boidough","isEdited":false,"title":"It hacked me and deleted all my important stuff","review":"App is trash it hacked me and messed up my phone THIS APP IS HORRIBLE first of all it’s all people that are racist and mean and don’t deserve to walk earth lol but this app is completely trash it kept kicking me out as soon as I got in that app and it is the worst app ever I was watching tv on my phone and it kept on logging me into this  app and it didn’t leave me alone and I tried to simply text my mom and it kept on messing my text up Don’t get this app it’s trash and it hacked me multiple time and deleted a lot of things and it logged me out of my apple acount don’t get the app"}},{"id":"6173607869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:23:10Z","userName":"abshhdj","isEdited":false,"title":"Disgrace to the human race","review":"This is a horrible app. As I was downloaded it I heard a knock at the door. When I opened it I found a Karen asking to speak to my manager. She then told me I had no right to download this app because I was not apart of the white community. After I called the cops she left. But when tho police arrived they told be they couldn’t help because they had better things to do such as police brutality. As the police officers left Fox News came to interview me. But after they turned off the cameras they told me “Go back to Mexico the three countries you came from.” Never again will I download this app."}},{"id":"6173525498","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:54:50Z","userName":"remember dont vote for kanye","isEdited":false,"title":"worst decision of my life","review":"this is, hands down, the WORST app i have ever downloaded. it brought out a side of me i never knew existed. this app is free and i STILL think i deserve a refund!! how do you plan on repaying me for my useful time i spent downloading this app? i feel bad for my phone just for having it downloaded. i would personally like to apologize to everyone else who downloaded this app and was as disappointed as i am! i will never be able to go back to a time before downloading this app. there is nothing i regret more than downloading this. please don’t make the same mistake i made. trust me."}},{"id":"6173468168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:35:06Z","userName":"Daidai06","isEdited":false,"title":"This app killed my cat 💖🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🌸","review":"I have a black color cat and a white colored cat. One day my white cat decided to dress up as a police cat and yelled all cats matter. My black cat with common sense felt disrespected and decided to protest against it. I then came home after taking a walk to blow of some steam and I saw that my white cat was laying dead in my driveway. Then I realized it was hit by a car, and I’ll do it again if a white cat tries to say all lives matter. Black lives matter and so do others, but no lives can matter until black lives matter. Therefore if you’re a white cat who says all lives matter watch your back. 💖🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨🌸"}},{"id":"6173457374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:31:21Z","userName":"once again an orphan","isEdited":false,"title":"The WORST app ever","review":"This app is single handedly the word app ever. It took 3 days to download and in the process made my entire phone glitch out. I entered my information and it bombarded me with racist messages and the app took all my information. It didn’t stop there. ICE showed up at my door and took all my loved ones as well as my two dogs. I tried to contact tech support in hopes of getting my family back and they responded saying they have already been sent out of the country into sex trafficking rings. DO NOT download this app if you want to have a family. Thanks to trump I am once again an orphan."}}]}
