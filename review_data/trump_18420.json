After downloading this app my phone starting glitching and a virus appeared. Also the app is very slow and this orange old dude kept appearing on the screen and his face was very disturbing to look at. I think it will scare children and give them nightmares for years.

The second I downloaded this app and ran it Donald J. Trump himself crawled out of it screaming. As we tried to calm him down he drop kicked my grandparents, spit in my younger brothers Cheerios, and stole all of our valuables before running out the door.

It was a terrible experience lots of changes need to be made.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174747769","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NOT GOOD","date":"2020-07-09T02:51:26Z","userName":"deeznutz_6999","rating":1,"review":"I don’t think I’ve been doing anything about this stuff like this I just got home from work today so I’m sorry I didn’t get back I just got left and stuff so I’m sorry I didn’t get back I just got left and stuff I didn’t wanna was a time I got so much food and I’m gonna was the a whole thing I didn’t know I gotta I wanna go home by the way I wanna was your birthday.
