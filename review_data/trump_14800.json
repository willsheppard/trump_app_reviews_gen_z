I also had to delete apps I‚Äôd rather spend time on just so that it could download. Once I got rid of the app and redownloded all my other apps I‚Äôd lost all progress and had to start all over again. Definitely not worth it.

I was appalled. I go home to try and wash my sunflower to get it back to it‚Äôs natural born color but then I find out the rest of my garden was orange too! The apples, the lemons, even the kale!! All of this happened since I got the app! Don‚Äôt get this app it might turn your garden orange as well. If I could give this app zero stars, I would.","userName":"heykittygorl"}},{"id":"6177119285","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T15:17:18Z","title":"Bye bye;)","rating":1,"review":"I was expecting for this app to be well put and set up properly since it is from president trump but this app worked terribly, I was not able to do anything on it and my phone was about to crash right after downloading it. This is not how an app is supposed to work, it was glitching and completely ruining everything on my phone. I can‚Äôt believe this app is working this bad.","userName":"Hope you go ‚ú®"}},{"id":"6176975696","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:38:05Z","title":"Just horrible","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to be able to get a better look into who trump as a 2020 candidate was. This app is horrible, when you go into it crashes and makes your phone really really slow. Do not download it!! If you need to get information just look online this app is not going to help you it‚Äôs just going to crash and mess up your phone.","userName":"Nnunsunfn"}},{"id":"6176928242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:25:28Z","title":"üçäüßö\u200D‚ôÄÔ∏è","rating":1,"review":"Sooooo, I got the app and like a lot of people said, it took days to download. Then, if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, it threatened to send my father back to Mexico! After that it threw racial slurs at me and my father and told me to STAY IN THE KITCHEN WHERE I BELONG!!! I was VERY ANGRY!! I couldn‚Äôt believe it!!! I was just trying to take down... I meeeaannn, support our wonderful (horrible) ‚ú®orange‚ú® with ‚ú®no dick‚ú® for a President. I DON‚ÄôT RECOMMEND THIS APP! IT‚ÄôS VERY RACIST, SEXIST, AND MANY MORE HORRIBLE THINGS ü§¢. Anyway, that‚Äôs all I have üòå.

All I wanted was to use this app to be informed but the only thing I got was ads, unwanted info, and the things I read were rly messed up and not appropriate for a news app. I hope this app gets taken down because it is so bad. I now am even more against anything to do with trump than ever, and he is a seriously disgusting human being and never should have been elected president.","userName":"cbkig"}},{"id":"6176900457","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:18:14Z","title":"Doesn‚Äôt work!","rating":1,"review":"I opened the app and entered my phone number. It asked for my credit card information and I thought it was for donations to our wonderful president Mr. Donald Trump so of course I put it in, but after I entered my credit card number along with the rest of the blanks that asked for other bank account information, the app closed out and wouldn‚Äôt let me open it again!","userName":"Hope Jank."}},{"id":"6176819473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:56:59Z","title":"I think I‚Äôm going to be sick","rating":1,"review":"This app is cursed.  As soon as I opened it I was met with a picture of a demonized goat bleeding out of its empty eye sockets.  The most horrific noise of what sounded like explosive diarrhea was in the background while the picture just spun slowly on my screen.  For hours.  I couldn‚Äôt stop it.  I couldn‚Äôt lock my phone or close the app.  Ever since I got this app I‚Äôve had bad luck.  I‚Äôm scared to leave my home.","userName":"tacobellbigbox"}},{"id":"6176784231","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:47:40Z","title":"‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT DOWNLOAD‚ö†Ô∏è","rating":1,"review":"Once it finally downloaded (after 5 days) It sent me an email saying I had to vote for trump. I emailed them back saying no I don‚Äôt but they weren‚Äôt having it. So after deleting the app the next day it was back on my phone! I kept deleting but it kept showing up! I don‚Äôt know how to get it off my phone! It also used ALL my gigabytes so I don‚Äôt have any gigabytes left.

I‚Äôm now having to attend life long therapy as I‚Äôve now seen so many photos of an overgrown Cheeto baby it‚Äôs scarred my frontal lobe. I have permanent depression as it‚Äôs blocked receptors in my brain and I‚Äôm not able to receive serotonin. I didn‚Äôt think that was possible by just looking at a picture of one individual but, here we are.","userName":"JoryChan"}}]}
