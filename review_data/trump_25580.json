I was so horrified. He went down stairs and made a missile and shot it at me. I am now in the hospital. THEN he flew into space and through Venus at me. And I am now in intensive care. He then said “America is great”. Then passed gas in my face and flew into space.","userName":"quick squiggle","title":"So sad"}},{"id":"6174026672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T22:58:15Z","review":"This app was absolutely terrible.
