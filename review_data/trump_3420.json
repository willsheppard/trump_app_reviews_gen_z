All it did was keep freezing and glitching, I would not download this😬. When it did work it would show a orange face the whole time🤢🤢. I rate this a 0/10. This app really got on my nerves and it should be took down. It has a lot of racial things that I do not agree with, it should not be in the App Store. When the orange face did show up my pets ran away and a lot of cockroaches came. I almost died. I do not agree with this app at all. The fact that this is even a app is disgusting and disgraceful 🙄🤢. I do not support. Make sure y’all rate this app a 0. DON’T DOWNLOAD (Btw I did use sarcasm😂)"}},{"id":"6173754691","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE‼️HORRIBLE‼️HORRIBLE‼️","date":"2020-07-08T21:16:15Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"nay2xclusive","review":"This app is spamming my phone with notification which outweighs all of my other notifications. I need to know what’s going on with my phone😡 my grandma has dementia and I need to be able to know if she’s alright but this “app” is making my phone react to everything else very poorly. It changed my home screen to the face of that orange beast and I’m scared at what else this app can do. DO NOT DOWNLOAD‼️ if you don’t want your personal space invaded. This app gives the president direct access to your phone. And I wake up in the morning, roll over to check my phone and this man is on my screen saying “are you lost babygorl” which I find very disturbing🤢 0/10 most definitely. DO NOT DOWNLOAD"}},{"id":"6173594115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Pain and suffering","date":"2020-07-08T20:18:17Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"งツ)ว","review":"I was out at the shooting range exercising my second my amendment right when I received a message from my beloved president through brain waves. He told me he was god reincarnated and that I could get into heaven if I downloaded this app. So naturally as a god-fearing American i whipped out my phone and headed right to the App Store to download MY president’s app. But once it was fully installed Tr*mp gained control to my body! I could no longer move for he moved for me. The app generated brain waves and forced me to raise my gun and shoot everyone I saw. Including my family. Tr*mp didn’t stop until it was just me left, he made me shoot myself. I am a ghost writing this review pleading with the next red blooded American to not fall into this trap."}},{"id":"6173504995","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do NOT download this very app.","date":"2020-07-08T19:47:44Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hello guys my names bob","review":"This app took 7 weeks to download! I have very good WIFI where I live but it still did and in the process it deleted all my contacts in my phone for some reason and deleted most of my apps!! WHAT THE HELL IN WHITE SUPREMACY IS THIS. I am trying to support MY president and THIS is what I get. When the app FINALLY downloaded it was glitching out and only a LARGE ORANGE FACE KEPT POPPING UP. Looked a little like this 🟠.  DO NOT GET THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT ALL YOUR CONTACTS AND APPS DELETED. It took me three months to get all my contacts back. AND WHEN I OPENED THE APP MY PHONE WOULDN'T STOP PLAYING THIS WEIRD SONG! It caused my elderly grandma to have a aneurism. PLEASE on the love of our racist, women disrespecting, mexican hating, white supremacist president I ASSURE YOU THIS APP NEEDS SERIOUS HELP DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT."}},{"id":"6173497200","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Sad story. NOT CLICKBAIT ❌😔","date":"2020-07-08T19:45:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"savehowiemandel","review":"I downloaded this app with the assumption that it was going to be just as wonderful as our almighty Cheeto puff 🟠🙈. I was in utter shock when I opened the app and immediately received a call from my mother saying that she accidentally ran over my cat. Poor fluffy... may she Rest In Peace 😫. I soon realized that this app gave me bad luck and since the installation of this app my friends and family have been subject to unimaginable loss of their own beloved animals. This app should be considered a hate crime against fellow Americans 🇺🇸 . Rest In Peace the animals taken from us too soon 😔. I hope the users of this app don’t experience a tragedy such as this and I hope they come to their senses to ban this app and stan loona 🧚\u200D♀️✨💗"}},{"id":"6173336072","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"If I could rate it a zero star I would","date":"2020-07-08T18:49:20Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"gen z??","review":"First of all the for the amount of time this took to download is NOT ACCEPTABLE it literally took hours when my WiFi is perfectly fine.

When it finally downloaded it deleted everything on my phone even my precious photos of an orange looking guy. Every since I downloaded this app my baby brother has kept crying non stop and now I’m lacking sleep.I also suffered from depression during the days I had this app it was just horrible 😔. My grandma died from a heart attack because of this app and now my family and I are really sad and can barely move. My dog pistachio started puking all over the house now my house stinks 🤢. This app not only caused all of those things but also threatened me 😢. Deleting this app was the BEST DECISION EVER✨✨."}},{"id":"6173166469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app i’ve ever come into contact with","date":"2020-07-08T17:53:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yiayiasrh","review":"Immediately after downloading the app my phone became over whelmed with multiple viruses, then after getting my phone fixed my phone permanently had a really ugly cheetah wallpaper for my lock and homescreen. Not only did this give my phone viruses but after giving it my phone number to sign up it continuously sent me grandmother hate texts calling her ugly, old, and stupid. Who ever is in charge of the app also got a hold of our address and has been sending us hate mail ever since, and I now have to move and had to get our phone numbers changed. I cant believe an app like this is even still up on the appstore, truly disgusting."}},{"id":"6173143484","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Dumb","date":"2020-07-08T17:46:33Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"fuktheorange","review":"Just saying for all you white foks just to let you know go back to were u came from if you want everyone thats not from here to leave you gotta leave too all of white people are from Europe the eniglish men killed familys u guys can hate people of color but just know that u wouldnt have any of your little salads or fruit bolls without hard working latinos growing your food remember that u tell black people to go back to were they came from but remember that u brought them here in the fist place to work and now that they have jobs and work for a living there taking “your jobs” u say so many things about people of color almost all school shootings happen because of white kids"}}]}
