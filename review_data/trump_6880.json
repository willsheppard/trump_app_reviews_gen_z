I asked it what it wanted, it said it was here to apologize on behalf of Satan. unfortunately, as Satan was going to text his bros his list of evil plans for 2020, he accidentally sent the bros his ‘So evil I should never do them’ list of evil plans. So the bros went ‘Ok cool.’ And ended up making this app as a way to surprise their good pal Satan not realizing that Satan didn’t really want them to. The demon was very apologetic about the whole incident. I can tell why this was on Satan’s ‘Not to do’ list. 0/10 wouldn’t vote Trump in again.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173931311","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"jokngjj","date":"2020-07-08T22:22:22Z","title":"No❤️","rating":1,"review":"Upon minutes of downloading the app lovely peaches personally came to my house and commited homicide to my entire family.

It smelled a lot like cheeto puffs, burps, and big macs. After taking breath of that HORRENDOUS smell I scrolled through the app to see ORANGE feet pics. I was so scared I threw my phone out the window and it accidentally fell on my beloved cat, Freckles. I looked out the window to see the app activating MAGA mode and sliced my cat straight in half. At my cats funeral we couldn’t even have an open casket because it was too brutal to see. Rip Freckles and if don’t want to endanger anymore animals I would strongly advise not to get this app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173896326","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ab.sper","date":"2020-07-08T22:09:38Z","title":"just no","rating":1,"review":"if 0 stars was possible, I would rate this app with that. I got this app to occasionally roll my eyes at our presidents 2020 campaign, but turns out that did not happen. this app just continued to glitch until it full on shut down. the app switched me over to a list of ads for many different spray tan clinics. one of the ads used donald trumps cheeto lookin spray tan as a promo for their business. I have not been able to get rid of these ads since. someone. please. help. I DO NOT recommend this app. thank you for listening to my ted talk :)","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173817116","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hdkeneiebxudjwbodfngqksbrej","date":"2020-07-08T21:39:45Z","title":"GOT COVID FROM THIS APP!!!!!!","rating":1,"review":"This app is absolutely horrific. DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO GET THIS. As a proud supporter of Mr. Cheetoh Trump, I obviously downloaded this app. The app instantly started glitching out and I’m pretty sure gave my phone a virus. I’m certain my phone contracted COVID - 19 from this app. I am infuriated. I used my stimulus check to buy this phone, but now it’s broken. I demand a refund immediately. I tried putting a mask on my phone and even gave it hand sanitizer, but it’s not curable. This is a cheap, horrible, and overall poorly made app. You’ll be seeing my lawyers over this!!!!! THIS IS NOT A JOKE. 😤🤬🤒😷","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173791215","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"djpug56789","date":"2020-07-08T21:29:46Z","title":"This app is terrible","rating":1,"review":"This app is the worst app I have ever download. Donald j Trump is the ugliest man I have ever seen and he has done terrible things to this country. I hate hearing, seeing, and even speaking his name because of the things he has done. He has done harsh thing and have made stupid decisions to help us Americans through covid 19. I thought truely thought I liked Donald trump but when I downloaded this app, and heard what he said, I'm through. He has also tried to take down Tik tok which is stupidity. Like I said this app is the worst and he deserves to be sent to prison!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173769885","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"baddie xox 👹😍✨","date":"2020-07-08T21:21:51Z","title":"𝔀𝓸𝓻𝓼𝓽 𝓪𝓹𝓹 𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻✨✨✨✨","rating":1,"review":"It took forever to download even though I have terrific WiFi. 😡I take this as an insult cause it’s like why would you mock me and the environment I live in 😩.But that’s not the worst part, when I finally opened up the app I think a glitch happened because it took me to a picture that looked like a big orange 🍊 and I’m pretty sure it was the UFO 🛸 footage released cause it looked out of this world but not in a good way. Anyways this app should be banned because it nearly killed me 😳☠️(I’m afraid of oranges and UFOs👽) you should be lucky I’m not suing Trump.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173755011","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"orange corn on the cob","date":"2020-07-08T21:16:23Z","title":"orange face corn cob hair 🟠🟠🟠","rating":1,"review":"As soon as I went on the app mi virgecita de Guadalupe 💒 started nodding her head with big fat juicy wide eyes and a creepy grin on her face (OvO) saying tRuMp 2020 then mr cheeto puff🟠 popped up on my screen looking a bit more like a bald corn top than usual 🌾 👨\u200D🦲✨and left my little sister traumatized 😩 and then mr Cheeto puff said VOTE FOR ME OR ELSE I WILL DEPORT YOU 😼✨ and then I heard stomping in the kitchen and I went to check what it was a mr Cheeto puff 🟠looking through my fridge 🧃🍅 and he wouldn’t leave so I had to lure him out with his Cheeto family 🟠which he then showed his inner cannibal and ate them 🌚✨ then he was gone 4️⃣ever","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173604611","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Eren Armin and Mikasa","date":"2020-07-08T20:22:00Z","title":"absolute trash","rating":1,"review":"there was an ad every 2 seconds. i couldn't even click on anything or scroll down more than an inch without 15 ads popping up. so annoying!!! the app is garbage and none of the features work. i had to try 3 separate times to download it and it took FOREVER. my phone kept crashing from errors as soon as it downloaded. i'm leaving this review as a warning for others who might consider downloading this app. it messes with the software on your phone and it's garbage. don't download it.","isEdited":false}}]}
