It’s the only source of news that I trust - those socialists LAMESTREAM medias have infiltrated all other networks and CANT be trusted! Anyways, the app kept crashing, over and over. How am I supposed to learn the best ways to be hateful in the name of my fearless leader!??? Maybe AOC and other communist fascist leftist rightists have something to do with it???","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174831683","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"chewys mother","title":"If I had a genie my 3 wishes would all include getting rid of this app","date":"2020-07-09T03:16:36Z","review":"My first wish would be the app was never created. My second wish was no one will ever remember or be able to imagine/create this app.\nMy last wish would be for the creator of this app to get stuck at every red light he ever comes across.\nThis app bullied my neighbors into shooting my dog. I miss Chewy, he was a good boy.\nTo the creators of this app: karma is a b1tch","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174788265","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Blimey ur stupid","title":"DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:48Z","review":"I downloaded this app to keep up with our racist, homophobic pedo- I mean our president, and unfortunately the second I opened it, I got hemorrhoids. I also experienced the worst nausea I’ve ever had and ended up puking all over my precious trump posters. The posters look better that way, but that’s besides the point. The app is trash and it needs to be taken down before it continues to affect thousands of innocent people.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174786110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Stassiebbyg","title":"WORST APP TO EVER EXIST!","date":"2020-07-09T03:03:08Z","review":"This president is a racist, homophobic, xenophobic sociopath. He fuels hate from his fat twitter fingers and doesn’t govern the country. Over 132,000+ Americans dead from COVID-19 and he wants people to send their kids back to school? He has republican governors & mayors going against science to please his re-election bid. He couldn’t care less if more Americans died, he cares more about dividing us by race and class then reforming policing, getting justice for ALL people and slowing the curve for a GLOBAL PANDEMIC.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174780328","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"GoodOlZoomer","title":"This app is a joke and so is its purpose","date":"2020-07-09T03:01:21Z","review":"The coding for this app is beyond anything Ive ever seen. It somehow knew that I was a woman who had downloaded it and has since made several attempts to go after my rights. I just downloaded this app and so far it tried to take away my birth control, made sexist comments my way, and then it groped me! If I could give it zero stars I would. Please Tim Apple erase this horrifying joke of an app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174779387","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"rcorkill","title":"Absolutely disgusting","date":"2020-07-09T03:01:04Z","review":"This app is ridiculous. I am honestly embarrassed I downloaded it. Yikes! I put in my number and immediately was bombarded by phone calls from tax people saying they had my credit card info. Within the first week of downloading I also had people show up to my house and steal my fridge. I have no fridge now thanks to trump. So think again before downloading this horrid app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174752213","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"rebekah_pape","title":"UNSATISFIED!!","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:46Z","review":"This app immediately started glitching when I downloaded it. And when I would go on the app it would exit the app and take me back home. Not very satisfied with the programming of this app and i AM very unsatisfied with the person who put the coding together and made the app. I will be giving this app a one star. THEY MIGHT AS WELL DELETE THE APP!!!! I wanted to get updates about our “president” and could not even enter the app.","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174751758","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"victim of the app😱","title":"WORST APP EVER💀😭","date":"2020-07-09T02:52:38Z","review":"Was trying to read the contents of the app when all of a sudden a virus popped up and threatened me with my life. My whole phone began to shake and all my apps turned into mega icons. I saw green fudge ooz out of my phone. I thought nothing of the fudge but then two days later I got Corona even though I was in my house alone for the entire week. I can only blame this wretched app. So if you value your liooofe do not get this app. 🦠🦠💀💀😭😭","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174746039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"jabchocolover","title":"delete this app","date":"2020-07-09T02:50:55Z","review":"wow, i downloaded this app and immediately my phone glitched and powered down. my phone barely works now. it keeps overheating and i can’t even open the app anymore. i was hoping to get some awesome updates from the president of our great united states, but this app has let me down so much that i’m now questioning the integrity of our president and entire nation. i’ve had to write this whole review approximately 12 times because my keyboard keeps glitching or my phone just entirely shuts down. this app has absolutely ruined my phone to the point that i might have to buy an entire new phone. trump, you owe me a new phone 😪🤧😤😫😡 huge let down!!!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174740206","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"beansandbread817","title":"MY BREAD AND BEANS😭😭💔","date":"2020-07-09T02:49:07Z","review":"This app is awful. It’ll steal your loaf of bread and your enormous jar of beans. I woke up in the morning about to microwave my pet turtle but I heard my garage opening so I put my turtle away and I wanted to make some toast. I looked in the pantry and I saw my 27 shelves filled with bread had VANISHED!!!! I was sooooo sister shooked but when I looked in the other pantry I saw my 50 shelves filled with beans had VANISHED AS WELL!!!! I will never be using this app again. Also #dumptrump2020","isEdited":false}}]}
