So I went to Wells Fargo on my donkey to talk to the mAnAgEr. But the line for smoothies was too long so I left on my lizard. When I got to the store I saw some turkey sandwiches so I ate them. I saw a cute baby. I left the tomato with my toes and went home to find a letter. My tree husband was in a vacation in 1942 and said he would meet me at 1976. Then I reopened the app and I went to 1977 and missed him. Overall I would give it a 7/10 <3 :)","isEdited":false,"title":"My love","userName":"StephanieLillieeeeeee"}},{"id":"6180422617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T10:24:46Z","review":"This app is horrible!","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad app","userName":"ryineeena"}}]}
