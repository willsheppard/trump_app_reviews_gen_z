It gave me viruses on my iPhone which is a brand new phone and I was very disappointed. It takes about an hour to download and when I open the app everything takes about 20 minutes to load up which is ridiculous.Aside from being slow it doesn’t allow me to make choices on what I want to see it and instead face me with nothing but ads. I can say nothing more than I hate this app.","title":"ITS HORRIBLE","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Acesissy"}},{"id":"6176170355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:56:19Z","review":"Fccvvvvffg gfffffg","title":"right👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾🤞🏽🤞🏽👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"isahsj"}},{"id":"6176170273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:56:17Z","review":"SHREK\n                         Once upon a time there was a lovely \n                         princess.

The text read “if you don’t vote for Trump and don’t stop ruining his rallies we will hunt you down kidnap you and steal all your Robux- trump💕” so we got scared and told everyone of our breakfast club to vote for trump. But about a few weeks later my friend hit me up and said the FBI was at her door. So I toke my razor scooter a sped over to her crib to only find her... not their so what did I do? I caught the next flight to DC and where was my friend... cutting the lawn of the white house and being used as Donald trumps personal slave. Before I went to help her I thought why this happened and then I remember we never told our sixth-grade history teacher to vote for trump. It was all my fault he was on my list and I forgot because I was too busy cleaning my 2002 jeep, but I couldn’t think about that now I needed to save my friend. So I parkoured over the fence and used my Taekwondo skills to fight off the secret service but there were too many of them so a 92-year-old women helped me by hitting them with her cane till we finally saved my friend. After that, we toke a plane back home and delete the trump 2020 app. So please do not get this app it will only hurt you. One star in my option must be a glitch or something going on with it.","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR ELSE YOU WILL BE KIDNAPPED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Karen💞"}},{"id":"6176166298","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:55:08Z","review":"I🦟COULDN’T🦟BELIEVE🦟MY🦟EYES🦟WHEN🦟I🦟OPENED🦟THE🦟APP.🦟NOT🦟ONLY🦟DID🦟IT🦟TAKE🦟WEEKS🦟TO🦟EVEN🦟DOWNLOAD🦟IT🦟RUINED🦟MY🦟LIFE🦟!!!!!!🦟ONCE🦟I🦟OPENED🦟THE🦟APP🦟MY🦟PHONE🦟HAS🦟BEEN🦟MESSED🦟UP!!🦟I🦟SWEAR🦟IT🦟GAVE🦟MY🦟PHONE🦟A🦟VIRUS!🦟BECAUSE🦟NOW🦟EVERYTIME🦟I🦟HIT🦟SPACE🦟BAR🦟IT🦟INSERTS🦟EMOJIS🦟AND🦟I🦟CANT🦟GET🦟OUT🦟OF🦟CAPS","title":"GAVE🦟ME🦟VIR—-🦟","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ANGRY🦟CUSTOMER🦟"}},{"id":"6176161003","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:53:31Z","review":"Omfg this app wiped my whole phone all my apps where gone when it downloaded","title":"DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"mike b 20042020"}},{"id":"6176159330","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T10:53:00Z","review":"So laggy!!
