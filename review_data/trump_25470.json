Assuming we don’t die from the virus, I imagine this is going to be a big waste of money when he loses the election or has a mental breakdown. \nTo quote the great Daveed Diggs “Donald Trump is a white supremacist. If you vote for him you’re a white supremacist.”","userName":"emmarie_16","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175376649","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:20:28Z","rating":1,"title":"Horrible do not recommend","review":"Took hours to download once downloaded made my phone glitch terribly after having it for 5 seconds do not recommend threatened me multiple times and it took a lot of personal information","userName":"hwkscelxgwvd","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175366511","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T06:16:30Z","rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Downloaded this app to see what the hype was about.

I believe in one thing and one thing only: our Devine savior, Guy Fieri. Due to his glory, our Earth (which is flat) is not compatible with “germs” or “bacteria”. Modern “medicine” is a joke. So are mailboxes. Take that liberal crap and get out of here.","userName":"TINKB20879087","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175250489","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T05:31:46Z","rating":1,"title":"Motorcycles are important","review":"This app is disgusting!!!!
