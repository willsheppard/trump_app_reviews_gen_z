I was finishing up editing my tiktok and i went on this app to go look at our presidents “great” plans, right as i for there the cheeto puff man startled me and i dropped my phone on the ground, i thought it would have been okay since i didn’t drop it that high, but when i turned it around it was glitching and all i was able to se was to cheeto puff. i’m currently on my ipad rn writing this, because to this day the cheeto puff mad is still on my phone... frozen, and the apple store said they could do nothing about it bc they didn’t want to touch my phone,so do i recommend to get this app... no, it’s scary and not work it 👁👄👁✋✨","title":"✨🧚it’s j a no for me 🧚✨"}},{"id":"6177404685","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ChEeSy wAxY tOeS🥵🤤🧀🦶","date":"2020-07-09T16:38:50Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded this to impress my Crush but I wish I never did as soon as I downloaded this I got a knock at my door and it was trump and he said I’m HeRe To LiCk YoU’rE cHeEsY wAxY tOeS I screamed help then Harry styles showed up and said i WiLl HeLp, THEN HE STARTED LICKING MY CHEESY WAXY TOES 🧀 🦶 I screamed and kicked both of them in the face and ran off and they both yelled I wAsN’t FiNiEsHeD!i ran to my really good friend Kermant the frog 🐸 he said why are u here?

To say that it’s horrible is at least. This app glitches out, crashes, makes my phone slower, random alerts, distractions... It’s downright terrible. As a president of a great nation, I’m so disappointed in this app.  I truly thought this would be a good app, to go along with everything he has ever done, but it was a huge let down. I know it’s not just my device because by these reviews, I’m not the only one with this problem.  My president, and as a president I know you like your nation to keep up with what’s happening. But this app just infuriates me. The alerts do not stop! This is ridiculous. I’m so disappointed. -Sincerely, Bigjuicytrumpsupporter9928❤️","title":"Horrible app!"}},{"id":"6177117466","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"user38388383","date":"2020-07-09T15:16:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i got this app so i could look at my favorite oompa loompa but instead i saw thing TERRIFYING chetto in a suit.🤮 never again. i am DONE with this app and the worst part is after i downloaded it my wallpaper changed to lil huddy and he kept saying the n-word and i almost THREW my phone across the room. then i started to get a little scared because i thought i might come across trumpys nudes again😝🔫 those were SCARY and this app ain’t the hub. anyways i just wanted to briefly explain how disappointed i am and how i am now truly scared to reopen the app in fear i might see the oompa loompas one incher all over it. so i would suggest you DO NOT get this app unless you want to see your presidents pp, which is just weird but i mean you do you boo.","title":"disappointed.😭"}},{"id":"6177102990","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ghehhdifhd","date":"2020-07-09T15:12:44Z","isEdited":false,"review":"Hi so I was so exited to get it and rate it a 5 star but when I opened it I saw an orange and it was making a ugly face and then I saw a trumpulupa and it was throwing cake at the screen and now my phone has colorful lines all over my phone and I saw trumps ugly orange face and his hair had hair gel all over his hair and he was also making my screen even more worse and then I was gonna tell them to stop and that’s when he came out off my screen and threw cake at and some more bounce balls and then a monkey came out of no where and threw more cake at me and then Orange trump went inside my screen and got a towel out of no where and cleaned him self and then he asked for a donut and I was noooooooooo and then that’s it my bff is the best bye","title":"The baddest thing on the WORLD (tik tok)"}},{"id":"6177082692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"i totally support trump💞🥰","date":"2020-07-09T15:07:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I first down loaded the app because I want to support my amazing president Cheeto trump but when I first download it it started making my phone glitch on and off to this old naked guy who looked exactly like trump and I’m now blind but typing this in my mind, then after that it took 23hours to download and once I opened the app I started to get the urge to yell racial slurs and suddenly think about raping children and keep children in cages and not care because their illegal immigrants and lose over 1k of them but then I remember it’s just an app and totally isn’t something that can actually happen because are Cheeto trump is amazing and totally not racist but ya know what do I know I’m just a women with no rights🥰","title":"Don’t download you’ll be tricked by the Cheeto"}},{"id":"6176853863","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"ratsbruv","date":"2020-07-09T14:06:02Z","isEdited":false,"review":"this app is horrible do not download. it took 69 weeks to install and after i opened the app i saw this ugly orange and it scared me so much i threw my phone off the empire state building and it landed on my grandma. she died. i was just trying to get our sweet non-racist, non-homophobic, smart brained president merch but the app had other plans. once i got on it travels me to a porn site where i saw our president doing things with Bart Simpson. i ordered my merch and when it came you will not believe what came out of the package. i put my hoodie on and live was crawling out into my hair. i’m kind of okay with that part tho because now i actually have some friends🤗but then several dead rats were in the pocket of my hoodie. so now my life mottos are: \n-trump 2020✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕on a tombstone \n-trump shows main character energy🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💕make the show 13 reasons why \n-trump should go do what the simpsons predicted and ✨d i e✨\n-i will be manifesting trumps death ✨t o n i g h t✨ \n-trumps speeches are so inspirational✨🧚🏼\u200D♀️💕only on mute tho \ni hope everyone votes this dumb orange out of office in november \nBernie and AOC have my heart🥰","title":"DONT GET THIS APP🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨💕"}},{"id":"6176733000","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Mormonchild","date":"2020-07-09T13:34:09Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So after I downloaded this crap (which took many hours to even work) I started to see that my phone would NOT let me on any other apps. I tried shutting down my phone, and then instead of the other apps not working they all opened at the same time. This aggravated me so I left my phone alone. When I went to check on the app my phone was to hot to even touch. So I did whatever I could to cool it down. The app FINALLY started working properly but then out of NO WHERE a very loud sound started playing and a swarm of animals came running my way. NEVER EVER download this app. The only thing that could keep me calm after all this was tiktok. So go put a Five Star rating on Tiktok while we still have it.","title":"Ruined EVERYTHING ✨😹🥳"}},{"id":"6176418492","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"lizzzdgaffff","date":"2020-07-09T12:09:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"It took 37 weeks to download that’s ridiculous!!😡And when it finally downloaded my phone started glitching im guessing its my phone that doesnt like racist!!
