I opened the app and my phone cracked from the picture that I saw. It’s hard to explain but it saw a orange man (I think it was a man) and he had his WEWE out along with a tiny ball under it! (The wewe was smaller than my pinky btw) so I had to immediately go to Apple and get my phone fixed but it could not get fixed because the screen was still stuck on that orange man with his “WEWE” out and the guy that was supposed to fix my phone passed out from seeing that picture and I forgot to mention my phone can send out certain fumes from pictures and once the smell was released that’s when the guy passed out. (It smelt like fried onions and Doriots)so my phone never got fixed and I’m sending this message with my mind (OOoOoooOoooO) 😈😈😈✌🏽🖕🏽😌😚","title":"𝗛𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗟𝗟𝗟 𝗡𝗔𝗛𝗛𝗛𝗛𝗛 👁👄👁","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174332369","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"izzy grace🌵","date":"2020-07-09T00:48:32Z","review":"so i recently got this friend and told me to eat my phone but i chose to choose wisely and not do that. instead i got the donald trump app which after i got it i heard my dog barking loudly and he was floating and a greenish pinkish orangish rain cloud that was 10 square cm to be EXACT was under him and he stared grunting and pebbles started coming out of his nostrils and the pebbles started to float and do a rainbow flower fairy tail dance around him and he did his tap dance solo in the middle of them. the cloud started to snow and now outside it’s raining and windy and tore one of my SPECIAL flower trees branches down. i am NOT happy. my birds then started howling and i time traveled to the 50s and they said that they don’t know who charli damelio is!! this infuriates me. i am serious and i would like to speak to the manager of this app.","title":"i am NOT happy!","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174314751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bekkkkkahhhh","date":"2020-07-09T00:42:39Z","review":"After I had downloaded this app to help open my eyes to the other side of politics I was met with the worst image ever. A picture of the big Cheeto man in a speedo on the beach🤮. I’m literally scarred for life. I 100% regret opening this app. It was so scary and disgusting that I ‘accidentally’ dropped my phone in the trash, which is where this app belongs. This app is so glitchy and disgusting that even looking at it makes me want to throw up. It seems like my cat even agreed with me because as soon as I showed her the picture she gagged. If both humans and cats hate this app, the App Store should DELETE IT! I feel l’ve  contracted a terrible disease just by seeing those cursed images. It is a terrible app that spreads misogynistic, racist, and sexist information. But with that in mind ‘ Trump for Prison 2020’. 😘❤️","title":"BEWARE: WORST APP EVER","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174311064","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Zaina D.","date":"2020-07-09T00:41:23Z","review":"This app is the worst. I was opening to book virtual tickets for my family and I because TRUMP 2020, you get the memo?🇺🇸My phone SHUT-DOWN for 2 LONG WEEKS and I wasn’t able to do anything at all. Due to covid and safety precautions, I didn’t want to risk it and go. If I went anyway how would i even explain how it shut down? A Trump app? You’ve got to be kidding me right now. If you are ever going to get this app.. Go to your kitchen, grab a snack, wear something comfy, and sit down. You will be quite amazed with others stories. It took awhile for me to accept that fact that i couldn’t use my phone for TWO WEEKS-14 DAYS. I mean I’m not addicted to my phone like Zoomers just trying to ruin everything. Can we please enjoy our time.🙄\n\nSincerely,\nSusan Robers💡📖","title":"Explanation to my 1-Star APP RATING🇺🇸","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174063690","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Diosili Martinez","date":"2020-07-08T23:12:11Z","review":"If you’re planning on downloading this app , DONT . None of this is worth it, and If I could give this a negative zero I would . Even just by the first sight of the big carrot balloon inflatable my eyes started to leak this green acid . My dog then melted away in my hands, and I was left with just a puddle of white fur . I started to panic, and warts appeared ALL over my face . The longer I stayed on the app the more it got worse . I highly don’t recommend this app ! If you’re looking for a educational app that informs you with good helpful , necessary, and useful information then Tiktok is the one you need ! Such a life saver . Once you log into tiktok search up “ peaches “ . She is the manager of the tech team, you’ll report your situation and she will gladly assist and help you out .","title":"Stop , It’s not worth it .","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6174051542","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"coocheifart","date":"2020-07-08T23:07:41Z","review":"the second i downloaded it that’s when it happened 😱 i open the app and immediately my skin started to turn orange 🙄 😳 and i was shocked honey 😿 my skin went ORANGE NO JOKE it was exactly like my amazing beautiful 🥵 stunning President trump 😻i love trump and always will but to look like him NO 🤢🤢 i tried everything i took 36 showers tried all the soaps even bleach and toilet cleaning products but NOTHING 😔 i was so sad i didn’t know being a trump supporter came with consequences 😭😭 i stayed orange for a week it was a long emotional week 😫i didn’t wanna betray my amazing president 😚but i also didn’t want orange skin 😡 so i did what i had to do...😩😫😢😢😢😢😢i hope god and trump can forgive me i DELETED THE APP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i’m writing this to warm you guys don’t download this you WILL ‼️‼️TURN ‼️‼️ORANGE ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️","title":"ew nasty bad gross not it 🤢","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6173737749","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🍊🏀📙🧡📳🚼🟠🔸🔶✨","date":"2020-07-08T21:10:06Z","review":"I downloaded his app to support the greatest orange 🍊of all time. I was so excited! But then I got angry when it took almost 3 WHOLE hours to download! How could that be! Then I got over it and went in the app when I doin came to notice all of my oranges disappeared from my counter. I was confused but it was whatever. Then I kept hearing knocks all over my house I couldn’t believe what I was hearing! Then I went into the app and my phone flew out of my hand every time I went to pick it up something prevented me from doing so, so I gave up. I then concluded the app was haunted and deleted it. Once I deleted it everything went back to normal and I was so relieved. So I’m conclusion I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP WHATSOEVER it gives u bad luck and it is haunted! I’m warning you.
