THIS PRESIDENT IS DANGEROUS","review":"Downloaded this app to see what this Trump guy was all about. Turns out he’s a racist! Said the n word multiple times, in addition to r*ping under age girls. Plus this app is basically full of lies. Total propaganda. Not gonna lie, I did think this was a dating app at first but was sad to realize it wasn’t. 0/10 this man and app are not good for America.","date":"2020-07-09T22:12:38Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"userName":"bumblebeezo"}},{"id":"6178418841","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"RUSSIAN SPIES","review":"I just wanted to know what the latest updates were on our amazing President Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸.But when I open the app, I found that it was extremely cluttered and I couldn’t find any information.
