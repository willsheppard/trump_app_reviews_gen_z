I started to have trouble using my phone 10 minutes after I downloaded it, and it has been getting worse and worse. Now, every 40 seconds it plays Gabbie Hannah music and “real women vote for trump” songs. ITS TERRIBLE!! Besides the horrible glitches that this app I gives, the app is completely useless and crashes 10 out of the 10 times you use it. You would have a better chance at supporting trump on the BERNIE APP/WEBSITE, that’s how bad this is. My children also downloaded the app and they told me that while they were opening it, horrible nude advertisements had popped up on their screen. Trying to use this app is like trying to walk all the way from Hawaii to Australia, ITS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN/WORK! I hope this horrible, horrible app gets deleted for all the awful things it’s done. Now I must go get my phone fixed from the trauma and the glitches that are still happening while I’m typing this.","userName":"wiigless","title":"One of the worst apps on my phone","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T15:10:20Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172456364","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Almost immediately after downloading the app the secret service barged into my house with loads of trump apparel. They knocked down my door and hung trump 2020 flags all over my room and forcefully slapped a MAGA hat onto my head causing me to go into a coma. They did all of this while eating all of my food in my household and screaming, “TRUMP 2020!!” . While they left speeding off in their army tanks they ran over all of my dogs squishing the life out of them and then hitting my prized dairy cow. One of them even went as far as “accidentally” blowing up my house with said army tank!!!! When I woke up from the coma the doctors said they hat was put on so forcefully that it can never be removed so I will have to live out the rest of my days wearing a hat with false promises written all over it. I would like to say you will not be getting my vote this year or ever due to not only the destruction of my property but because of your blatant racism, homophobia, sexism, misogyny, and disrespect for anyone that’s not a white supremacist :)","userName":"Ashley👸🏼","title":"I am appalled!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T14:24:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177570888","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"as an avid trump fan i was beyond excited to download this app.🤩 once i opened the app i had a jolly good time looking at my hero's content! 🇺🇸all of sudden the app had crashed. every time i opened it it would crash more. 😡😡😡then my phone decided to freeze and it wouldn’t work( even the buttons wouldn’t do anything). i called apple and they suggested to get a new phone because they couldn’t do anything about my frozen phone.😭😭 coming from a low income home, it was a hard decision to buy the new phone. 😔😩my grandmother is on life support and that’s already enough to pay for. we decided a phone was more vital in our life so we pulled her plug and bought the new phone.💀💀😿 i’m so thankful for my iphone 5 now, but you will be missed grandma maurice. 👵🏻thanks a lot trump for putting my family in this horrible situation just because your stupid app didn’t do it’s job. 😠😠now i will be voting for daddy biden in hopes of a great future!👨🏻\u200D🦳\n\nR.

Don’t even get me started on the privacy policy—there was no way I was going to give him all my information after reading THAT. I thought at least that the president’s app might be the best one in the store, but it hasn’t fulfilled any of its promises. Every time I open another app, this app pops up and doesn’t let me open another app. It’s truly horrible and has overtaken my new phone. This has never been an issue before. This parasitic app has made me consider going to the Apple store to get it figured out since the app seems to refuse to be deleted. And let me tell you, I’m not risking going to the Apple store right now with all this virus!! The coronavirus is nothing compared to the virus this app will give your phone. Some President. Maybe he should get off Twitter and download his own app to get a taste of his own medicine.","userName":"ltb2020","title":"Horrible!!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:27:33Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177161503","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible, if I had an option I would give it half a star. On the social tab I only get so much of the tweets, so if I really wanted to see all of the tweets I would have to check the page every hour. I turned off notifications because they were constant and annoying. It doesn’t really have an organized profile page, it’s all over the place! The points is a problem for me personally, it explains how to receive points but there’s no explanation on what the points can do for you, basically you can show off saying “Hey I have more points than you” but that’s about it, though you’re just showing off the fact that you spent more money on something that doesn’t need more, you’re just poor now. So I hope that they can just get rid of the app, this app doesn’t keep you updated frequently with current information, and is not up to date, all it does is glitch out constantly as well, so please get rid of it.","userName":"hahbxdbsnnxbsbbxbsbxbxbxbxb","title":"TERRIBLE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T15:28:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176937607","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I know in this time of uncertainty for our country we ALL need to listen to president Orange. I tried to download the app but it took THREE DAYS to get HALF WAY finished with the download process. But of course I patiently waited like anyone else would, and when it finally downloaded, I was spammed with bad information and notifications like, ban abortion, or no equal pay for women. It was disgusting and stressed me to the point that I began pulling out pieces of my hair. It got really bad when I wanted to order some merchandise  in honor of our great president, it stole my information! Next thing I know over half of my savings is gone and I’m getting thank you for your donation to Donald j trumps campaign letters! My bank was able to file it as fraudulent activity but I am still out of half my savings! I am thoroughly horrified by the quality of this app and I am forced to give it one star. Do not download! Will steal everything you own!\n💫🧚🏼\u200D♀️Thank you for being our president, Trump!💫🧚🏼\u200D♀️","userName":"p.league","title":"Doesn’t work","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:27:56Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176913226","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So I really love 😻our lord and savior Donald J Trump 🎃 so I was ecstatic when I downloaded this app 😸 but when I opened it I was very disappointed 😕 the color scheme was terrible 🤢 like blue 💙 and red ❤️ who came up with this 🤦\u200D♀️ it made me sick 🤒 literally 🤷\u200D♀️ I started feeling very feverish 🥵 and my throat was so sore 🤕 so I decided to go to my doctor 👨\u200D⚕️ and he said that I might have COVID 🙀 or as you call it “Kung Flu” 🇨🇳 which I thought was a hilarious thing to call it 😹 but anyways he told me that I should get tested 😦 but I told him that if I don’t get tested then it means that I don’t have it 🤪 our amazing president told us that so I just assumed that it would work 🇺🇸 long story short I am currently on my death bed ☠️ at a hospital 🏥 all alone because all my family has left me 😞 and the doctor 👩\u200D⚕️ told me I have 3 days left to live 😩 I don’t blame you though 💙 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 always and if you don’t vote for him then you’re just a little hurt snowflake ❄️","userName":"l-chicken","title":"My name is Sarah Jean and I’m very disappointed 😿","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6175707224","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m just a small town girl 👧 in a big city hopping to make it to Hollywood ⭐️⭐️⭐️when I stumbled upon this app and out of curiosity I decided to download it.

I originally downloaded it back when it first came out and really thought it would be a good addition to my phone. I thought, “hey! It’s not like all the professionally developed apps but it can’t be worse than an app that deletes all my important emails, right?”. Boy was I wrong.  It’s full of glitches, inaccurate information, fake news pop ups, constant ads and requests for money, the vernacular is awful (like it was coded by a 3rd grader) and for some reason it deleted my Spanish translator, my female cycle tracker and when I lock my screen it turns blue instead of black. Whenever I logged out of the app, it pops up and reminds me that it’s the best app out there and without it my phone would die (which... doesn’t even make sense). \n\nI can’t explain how awful this app is and how it’s ruined my phone. And when the push notification comes in November to redownload, I will not and hope you don’t either.","userName":"renniiboo","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T04:44:44Z","isEdited":false}}]}
