Got it to make fun of him, and to see what awful information he was putting out into the world. Got lots of spam, ran down my battery super quick, used my location even though I told it not to.... really just makes me sick... worst decision I’ve made all year. For sure wasn’t gonna vote for him, but after this fail of an app now I’m DEFINITELY for sure positively am not voting for him","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177279813","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I would not recommend!!!","date":"2020-07-09T16:03:01Z","userName":"raelyn!!","review":"I’m not a fan. I downloaded this app and as soon as I opened the app it started to glitch out so bad that it made my screen turn black. I just finished restarting my phone for the 4th time when I finally went back into the app i watched I think one of president trumps worst speeches ever it was disgusting to hear. His words made me look at trump very differently. I would not recommend this app to anyone.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177226748","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Nothing new or exciting","date":"2020-07-09T15:47:32Z","userName":"eyyyybobby","review":"The app itself doesn’t really bring out any exciting features or anything that is “new and original”. Not to mention, the app surrounding the person is a very controversial person that already have their own website and such. So why they need an app? Overall, the app have plain designs, weird things said like “Make America Great Again”, and nothing to appeal to the eye of the people.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177203197","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Annoying and Aggravating and Boring","date":"2020-07-09T15:40:46Z","userName":"grannygoblins","review":"A lot of the news that comes on here is aggravating and boring to read. Why not include some great stories. Also the spamming is enough I have gotten over 100 of the same stories sent to me per day and it’s rlly starting to lag my phone. Also, I am not interested in politics someone told me this app was intended for crimes but I’ve seen only trump on here unless he is a crime to something I’m out.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177152567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","date":"2020-07-09T15:26:29Z","userName":"ApplePieAbby","review":"Crashed constantly, a thousand paywalls just to open the darn thing. I couldn’t keep it open for more than a minute without it falling apart and crashing, or even restarting my phone entirely! It also seems super sketchy and asked me for so much personal information (email, phone number, even credit card info at times). Super sketchy, trying to con less technologically adapt people out of their money","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177145913","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"I just don’t get it","date":"2020-07-09T15:24:39Z","userName":"confusion here","review":"I’m not even a part of this whole Gen Z movement (though I am Gen Z). I downloaded this app to try to stay up to date with the Trump administration and all that’s going on in the political world but instead was met with insane amounts of issues. It crashes all the time, sends the same notification over and over again, and I think it tried to put a bug in my phone! I just don’t understand!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177129543","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"very traumatizing❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:20:08Z","userName":"🧚\u200D♀️💕😹","review":"after seeing this app on the app store, i immediately went to go drink bleach. my hospital bill was over $125,000 and now i have to stay in therapy for 38 years 😿\n\ni’ve started ripping my hair out and randomly screaming at the top of my lungs because of how traumatized i am from this. my toenails have started to peel. my fingernails are turning a yellowish color. i can’t look outside anymore because my eyes are too sensitive to the light. i can’t eat or drink anything because of the extensive damage from the bleach. i am waiting to die. \nall from a trump app!!! 😿😿😿\nPLEASE give this app a ONE STAR REVIEW! it helps everyone cope with their own traumas!! 😿❤️\nthank you for reading my sad, horrible story from getting this app!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177122257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤮✨H O R R I B L E✨🤮","date":"2020-07-09T15:18:08Z","userName":"GoldenUni3","review":"ok so basically i opened up the app and i saw this orange face. it was really traumatizing!! but fr tho i didnt even know this was a thing. lol. thanks tiktok. you better not shut tiktok down just cause the big orange got angry. 😌✋. cause we are not afraid of starting war as you already know! if u didnt know already we can show you. 😌💅. and i heard this app ruined ppls phones and made it constantly crash which is not a good start. just saying. idk why anyone would get it anyway.","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177080661","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","date":"2020-07-09T15:06:34Z","userName":"donalds right tittie","review":"this app is horrible i just wanted to help out ✨orange✨ so kanye doesn’t win and now i might just vote for joe. this app took forever to download and then it wouldn’t let me open it for a whole week. then is started sending viruses to my phone and i had to get a new one, and now i’m stuck with a flip phone and writing this is really hard. thank you trump. you treat your country like a flip phone, old and worthless.

Cheetos spray tans (aka, whether or not he can get them on his entire body to match a freakin shade) and also on his destructive narcissism and plain ignorance ✨🌼🩰. instead this app hacked into many other devices inside my home, including all the computers and cell phones and proceeded to play nickel back on repeat. i don’t know what kind of agenda this is but if i could give this app zero stars i would. 💫","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
