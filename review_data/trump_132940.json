I was very surprised and confused and tried to turn off my phone. However, when I was able to turn off the phone, a mysterious voice started speaking through my phone speaker. It was yelling out racist remarks and said “fake news” whenever I tried to turn my phone off. As this was all happening my pet skunk, Lola, got frightened by the loud noise so she peed on my phone. The liquid was able to disable my phone but when that happened my phone suddenly expelled some orange gas and it smelled terrible. I quickly got my phone out in the backyard. My other skunk, Levi, then tried eating my phone. The gas got into his system and a few days later he got diarrhea. I have no idea how this app was able to control my phone as it did, but it was definitely unpleasant. -1000000000/10, would not recommend."}},{"id":"6173699040","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:48Z","isEdited":false,"title":"This app sucks❤️✨🙈","userName":"saucedo_marely","review":"When I first downloaded this app it started to glitch, I wouldn’t except it to glitch because it’s trumps app and trump wants the app to be the best.

I cannot believe this dog killing, blood clogging, orange cult- like app has not been banned from the app store yet. when i first opened the app a noise filled the air that assaulted my ears and caused my dog to uncontrollably poop until she collapsed and died. this app also sent an electric shock through my body which immediately caused my blood the curdle and form great big chunks, i am now round as a ball. my stomach is in fact rounder then trumps(yes that’s possible🙀). the last thing the app did was assemble a cult of oranges in my living room that killed my entire family❤️✨"}},{"id":"6173697978","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Trump app😈😼✨✨","userName":"and thats on periodt poo","review":"This app is the worst possible app ever.First of all once I downloaded the app and clicked on it and sent me back to my home page. Secondly I tried to download it again and I did that multiple times but it didn’t work. I did a couple times again and I finally was able to open the app however I was shocked by how useless this app is.The set up is awful in the way app works is not OK. I imagined the app design to portray the greatness of our President Trump, however I was really disappointed to see that this was a mockery to his supporters.Alas I’m gonna have to delete the app again for not recommend zero out of 10. My fellow Trump supporters please do not download this app because this app is an insult to us 🇺🇸✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️🧚🏾\u200D♀️😸😼"}},{"id":"6173697377","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:55:13Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Who would download this app","userName":"joeeeeeeerrrr","review":"I rather eat my own poop then have this app😌"}},{"id":"6173696219","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely horrible!","userName":"HalosRiza","review":"This awful app took forever to download, it’s VERY slow and not easy to work with, I will NEVER USE THIS APP EVER AGAIN AND I WANT IT TO BE TAKEN OFF OF THE APP STORE!!! Uses up all a large amount of storage on my phone and soaks up my battery life, disgusting! I even considered getting rid of my whole apple phone and switching to an android considering how bad the app was to my phone and to me. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!"}},{"id":"6173695635","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:54:34Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TRUMP SUCKS😍💕🧚🏾\u200D♂️","userName":"random56732","review":"It glitches every time I open it...ALSO ANY BOOMERS WHO ARE PRESSED WE DON’T CARE. #DUMPTRUMP💩🍊"}}]}
