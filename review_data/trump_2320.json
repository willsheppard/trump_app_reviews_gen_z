NO joke I opened up this app trying to support all that our great POTUS stands for- racism, homophobia, misogyny, sexism, etc, and ALL I got were the words ‘YOU’RE UGLY’ yelled at me by a man who sounded JUST LIKE our president through my screen ... so therefore I had to come and let the people know that if you don’t want your whole life to be ruined, do NOT download this app like I did :( hurt my feels a little too much. oh and I also got greeted with racial slurs because somehow it knew that I was asian and it told me to go ‘back to my country.’ ~sigh~ I was actually born here too 🥺(heart been broke so many times <\\3) but oh well, I guess I’ll just have to settle and vote for Biden in the fall. I hope you nothing but the worst trump 2020 team :) ❤️","rating":1,"title":"Opened the App and it called me ugly :(","date":"2020-07-09T04:44:50Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174938986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bobduncan57","review":"okay so i downloaded this app to see what the hype was about but i forgot that i needed to take a nap so i ran to the dollar store to get me some food for my dog but when i got home i fed my cat and the app was downloaded so i opened it and it GAVE ME A VIRUS I CANT GET RID OF but i fed my cat and i went to petsmart to buy a fish but they were out of the betas so i got a tiger instead and i went home but realized my tiger needed food so i left it at home and went to go get it food but when i came back my tiger at my cat AND my beta fish so i was really sad but came back to my phone anyways and saw the app still downloaded i IMMEDIATELY deleted it because its the ROOT OF ALL OF MY PROBLEMS i would rate this app 0 stars if i could but i cant so im rating it 1 star hopefully they delete this app because it is HORRIBLE.","rating":1,"title":"I HATE THIS!!!!😡😡😡","date":"2020-07-09T03:48:24Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6174465363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"sophia perez from yt","review":"When I first opened the app it said “add gender” I put female because I am a female and I told me to go back into the kitchen so I clicked back and put male then it told me to go back to work!!!

DO NOT GET! It made my phone glitch out so bad and when I tried to open it my phone went completely black and began to overheat! I tried turning it on but i had to wait an hour for it to turn back on. But during that hour my cat overdosed on catnip and I had to call the vet in advance to make an appointment but GUESS WHAT MY PHONE WASN’T TURNING ON BECAUSE OF THIS APP. My cat was heaving and stoned to the bone and I couldn’t do anything about it! I began to panic and ate all of the dinosaur chicken nuggets in my house. So now my cat was passed out AND I didn’t have any dinosaur chicken nuggets anymore. Once it did turn on I had to immediately uninstall it because this app was bringing satan into my phone and as a totally religious conservative redneck person that I am, I just can’t stand for satanism 😔.","rating":1,"title":"this triggered my anxiety","date":"2020-07-08T21:08:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173719234","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"why not :')","review":"This app..it needs to be terminated! My mom got diagnosed with cancer because of president orangutan’s app. She is now struggling in the hospital, barely able to breathe. My cat got diagnosed with diarrhea and now he won’t stop pooping everywhere! I tried to call somebody to help but instead president orangutan answered and laughed through the phone maniacally! What a crazy weirdo! As I rolled up to the party with my crazy pink wig, I couldn’t get through the door because my booties too big! I called 911 but instead..president orangutan answered and I heard my cat screeching through the phone. He threatened to cook my cat If I didn’t rate his app 5 stars! I couldn’t come to my cats rescue because I was stuck in the doorway!He grilled my cat and showed me proof of it..my whole family had a seizure then died. I am the last survivor.","rating":1,"title":"Cancerous app!","date":"2020-07-08T21:03:14Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173593168","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Ms. Gen","review":"The app was an absolute nightmare to figure out. First of all, the downloading process took ages- at least 30 minutes! Once the app finally installed, however, it crashed as soon as I tried to open it! I had to delete 2 of my other apps on my phone to make room even though my phone indeed had enough storage! If that wasn’t enough, the app itself was like a labyrinth. It was unnecessarily confusing to navigate and it would take up so much of my battery power and storage - more than the description of the app lets. It was a despicably horrid experience and I advise anyone who comes across this to click away and never look back! If this is anything to go by, Trump’s presidency is hopeless.","rating":1,"title":"The worst possible app that could be used to advocate for a president","date":"2020-07-08T20:17:57Z","isEdited":false}}]}
