A dark voice beckoned me further, calling out to me, using my heavenly name, and bade me enter the tomb of my dreams. \n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall during the Creation, so that I may see the wonders and the horrors that came to be. To watch God judge from up high His own art, to be both artist and critic. It is impossible to have beauty without destruction, for sometimes destruction is beautiful. Such is the way of the Lord. \n\nAs the app loaded, I was guided downward into a hot, steaming pit. Upon my descent, I could hear the angels cry for my soul, but it was too late. I had fallen, and I couldn’t get up. No amount of LifeAlert could save me now. \n\nWhen the world turns, we do not feel it move. Yet the wind grazes our cheek, kissing us gently as a reminder of its constance. Such steady assurances guide us through life, giving us a ground to walk on. We believe, “As long as I feel the wind blow, I will know that at least something is out there.” But consistency is a dangerous lie, and assurances are but the sweet nothings whispered in one’s ear by an unfaithful lover. \n\nThe app. THE APP. Every moment its existence calls upon something darker than we could possibly imagine. It is no work from God, and yet, Satan, in all his evil, could never have crafted such a demonic product. It feeds off the ignorance and loyalty of the innocent, and those who are wise enough to avoid it remain fools in the eyes of the Lord. \n\nWhen God created the Heavens and the Earth, He created them without sin. Oh, to see the world He created; free of pain, free of this app. But the dark taint of Eve’s fall are a funeral pall over the history of the world. Death. Disease. Famine. War. The world turns not in gentle circles, but in a tumultuous inferno. The world will spin out of control one day. This app is the catalyst.\n\nRevelations promises the death of this world and the creation of a new one. We can only pray that the Messiah returns before this app prevails. Otherwise, we may all be doomed.","isEdited":false,"title":"Apocalyptic Omen/Prophecy?","date":"2020-07-09T17:24:33Z","rating":1,"userName":"Z Animator"}},{"id":"6177495674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I dont like it or trump (Michelle Obama 2020 🇺🇸)","isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible","date":"2020-07-09T17:05:56Z","rating":1,"userName":"🤗🥵😏🥳"}},{"id":"6177459547","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I don’t like it.
