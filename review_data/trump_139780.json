These articles don’t show trump standing for a united country, it’s all based in hate and ego."}},{"id":"6179573181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not worth your time 😖","date":"2020-07-10T05:15:33Z","userName":"BŪĖŸŠT","review":"I downloaded this app and believe me when I tell you it went dowwwnn last night I downloaded the app and it look a year to download it just finished last night when I opened it there was a deformed little orange toe thing that was the first thing I over looked that but then a couple minutes later I went to get some raw beef and soy sauce for my midnight sauce but when I left my room my pet cow had already eaten it!! I can’t believe him he is such a sucker for meat I tell ya!! Anyways after that I went to get my second favorite snack mustard and peaches! (For those wondering it tastes better with pepper) but when I took a bite the peach got mad because I bit to hard. When I came back into my room and went back on the app to see if the toe was still diseased (it was) but I looked around and saw my dog dancing on my most favorite stripper pole. Oh man was that a wild night anyways guys always remember \n\nTIK TOK LIVES MATTER💙❤️🖤💙❤️🖤"}},{"id":"6179572850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"App discriminates against babies! (PLEASE READ BEOFRE CONSIDERING DOWNLOADING THIS APP)","date":"2020-07-10T05:15:26Z","userName":"riaReiRei","review":"I woke up a late Saturday evening and thought “it’s high time I order a baby.” And so I downloaded this app and to my surprise this app does not sell black and brown babies! So after waiting 69 hard days for the socially acceptable blond haired white baby I ordered, I decided that I wanted some carrots and they denied me the right to have carrots! 😡😡😡ABSOLUTELY DISRESPECTFUL! 😡😡😡 In the end my white baby didn’t come and I called them up and asked why and the person on the other side of the phone was so utterly disrespectful! They spit on me through the phone and told me “we only sell the babies after forcing their parents out of their land and breeding them! Of course there isn’t any white babies being sold!” They then proceeded to stick their middle finger at me through the phone screen and cursed at me multiple times telling me that I will never be able to have a family or a successful life in this sh*thole of a country. They then proceeded to laugh in my face. I swear, all this was happening, they almost forgot to call me a n*gga! Absolutely unacceptable!"}},{"id":"6179572795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"It’s the worst app ever","date":"2020-07-10T05:15:25Z","userName":"nihgjm","review":"Is so bad that I don’t want to talk about it."}},{"id":"6179572711","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Not worth anyone’s times.","date":"2020-07-10T05:15:23Z","userName":"Johnerick232323","review":"Not worth anyone’s time."}},{"id":"6179572656","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Something’s wrong  🙄","date":"2020-07-10T05:15:22Z","userName":"Eurogasy","review":"Since I downloaded this app my entire phone got slower and switches off by itself randomly.

It took me up to the END OF JUNE. Gosh Jeepers, I know I could go without, it is extremely Buggy just to look at and it gets in the way of my Harry Styles wallpaper. You can’t even place it in any subject! And It wants me to TEXT a Number? ARE YOU MOCKIN ME NOT HAVING FRIENDS??
