The fact that he is totally not racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. ensured me that he will run this country very well in the next 4 years and that he has a deep respect for everyone in this country. This made me want to download this app in the first place so that I can be informed about his rallies in order to support him to the best of my abilities. I was originally going to attend his rally in Oklahoma and even reserved seats, though unfortunately I could not go bc my dog went into kidney failure. With this app, I hoped to be notified about everything related to his future rallies and other Trump related events, though my experience with this app was the opposite of what I expected. When I first got the app, it was constantly glitching and prevented me from going on any other app on my phone. The app incessantly blasted an audio from my phone of Trump saying “keep America great” even when my phone was turned off, which was very disruptive during my important work meetings and frankly extremely embarrassing. This glitch confirmed to my liberal coworkers that I was a Trump supporter, resulting in them bullying me on a daily basis for my political views. Such snowflakes. Ultimately, my experience with this app was unfortunately awful and I do not recommend it to any of my fellow Trump supporters. I truly expected more from the Trump administration and am angry that I was failed by someone whom I support wholeheartedly.","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T02:20:45Z"}},{"id":"6174630848","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ilovecheesesticks","title":"DO NOT GET THIS APP , HORRIBLE !","rating":1,"review":"this app is so bad , i deleted it immediately.
