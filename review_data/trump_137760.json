When I opened the app I saw this terrible terrible-looking blob on it I was truly terrified. It was very orange and the top of the creature was a a floof of fur/ hair (I presume) that looked like it seriously got lost. Due to my sanity I immediately closed the app but if this was the torture I needed to take for the president I would do it. So I took on this crazy adventure again and tried to look past the blob of a creature and continue, although it was painful, it was to make America great again of course. Next there was something truly horrible that made me come here, you are not ready for the same blob creature showed up AGAIN! I thought I was over this process but no I couldn’t handle it it was so so horrific I couldn’t stand it the creature looked so scary, it attracted all the fleas and took the app physically of the phone, it kind sound crazy but it’s true. This is why, for the safety of America, this app should b avoided at all costs. \n\nScrew you Trump ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻🌈"}},{"id":"6179853970","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"date":"2020-07-10T06:58:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app ever made🙅🏾\u200D♀️🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮","userName":"cdvuvjhdt","review":"This is just a no tf was people thinking it was a good idea to make this bs😑.
