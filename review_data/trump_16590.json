On top of that MY BANK ACCOUNT WAS LINKED TO MY EMAIL AND NOW I'M MISSING $2,000!!!!! FIX THIS RIGHT NOW OR I WILL BE SUING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION!!!!!!!!!! I CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT MY PRESIDENT AFTER HE STOLE MY MONEY!!!!!!"}},{"id":"6173599535","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:20:09Z","userName":"GEN Z takes over","title":"TikTok 2020✨","review":"I expected this app to be just beautiful but instead I got a call saying I had to vote for some Cheeto puff, wonder what that’s abt? Well when I said no I was threatened saying I would be attacked by Cheeto puff followers. Also when I tried deleting the app it put a virus on my phone and wouldn’t let me delete it. Weird huh? I expected it to go away in one day just like the “Chinese virus” #sarcasm for the win😌"}},{"id":"6173587916","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:05Z","userName":"Hamhfvrrfvb","title":"Wish I could give less than one star","review":"App was horrible. After what get like HOURS to download it wouldn’t open. Then after I finally could open the app it glitches and damaged my phone. My phone is no longer processing properly and is very messed up due to this app. Wish I could give it 0 stars because it doesn’t even deserve a single star"}},{"id":"6173587242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:15:52Z","userName":"hot cheeto gorl","title":"Waste of time 🙅\u200D♀️","review":"I downloaded this app because I support my dear Cheeto 🤠, however I had some problems with the app kicking me off and some weird noise started playing it said something about muffins in a freezer?? I don’t know what that means but It takes up my storage, I could be playing subway surfers instead 🏄\u200D♀️. So 0/10 would not recommend. I’m going to delete"}},{"id":"6173578928","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:58Z","userName":"ffhjbfsrt","title":"😏🥰😣🥵","review":"WORST APP YOU COULD EVER GET, first of all it’s just crazy how many people still say “all lives matter” but the only lives that should matter right now are black because they are the ones being killed and put below just because of their skin color. Trump has called them thugs and Mexican rapists, how do y’all still even support this man, 0/10 do not recommend y’all brainwashed people."}},{"id":"6173578030","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:12:39Z","userName":"FreyaGardenoble","title":"IMPORTANT REVIEW!","review":"This app really has to be the WORST app I have ever downloaded in the entire history of Apple.I have never come across such an app that’s just soo terrible!  really do try my hardest to leave the kindest reviews and look past certain qualities but because of this app I have fallen back into a depression. I’d rather spend my precious time wasted on this app waiting for the water to fill up on my colander!"}},{"id":"6173570881","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:10:13Z","userName":"🧚🏻💫💋❤️","title":"Omg","review":"This app is literally the worst app ever!!!! It took like 20 hours to download and when it did, it had 29 more hours of updates to complete. I didn’t actually get to use the stupid app till 2 days later. The app had serious glitches and it would close as soon as I opened it. Don’t get this app. Plus the info is awful and very detrimental to the brain with all of its stupidity."}},{"id":"6173559874","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:06:28Z","userName":"CrazyMymy","title":"It’s terrible","review":"This app is horrible don’t download it. It took freaking forever to download and in the process made my phone glitch causing me to have to restart it completely and because it took up so much space my phone couldn’t back up so I lost pretty much all of my pictures. Why I decided to download this app is beyond kind of like why anyone voted him president"}},{"id":"6173542640","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:00:39Z","userName":"norump2020","title":"I can't tell you how much this app is difficult to navigate","review":"This app is too hard to understand for my one side, ignorant brain to comprehend. First the app took the longest time to update and then kept glitching me out of the app. The words on the app are too hard to understand and I can't seem to find where my empathy for others went after downloading this app."}},{"id":"6173526836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T19:55:18Z","userName":"ilham566","title":"This app nearly KILLED me 😡😡","review":"The second I downloaded the app Donald J. Trump jumped out of the screen and tried to STRANGLE me. I jumped and there my phone across the room. Then THOUSANDS of trump supporters raided my house screaming “all lives matter” and “Obama is an immigrant”. I tried to hide in my basement and I saw a NAKED man paining himself orange saying he wanted to look like Trump. I had to call the police and move to a different continent 😔. Worst experience ever. Do not recommend. 😡"}}]}
