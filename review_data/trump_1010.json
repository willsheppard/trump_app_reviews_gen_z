I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\"","userName":"nagitoslimblesscoochie","date":"2020-07-08T20:43:35Z","rating":1,"title":"My name is Yoshikage Kira","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173651724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Truly am disappointed, got a new phone this first app I got, you’d think it being a new phone and all there wouldn’t be problems with it, well within 12 hours after downloading this here gross app I started getting emails from onlyfans? Trying to make me pay money to look at this mans p0rn0graphic photos and I about almost died right there, but as time went by I started to get notifications from apple saying my information was trying to be used from somewhere in China, now you’d think I’d be surprised as to why this would be happening but I knew it right away it had to be because I had put in information into this app. Now You’d also think a man who is CONSTANTLY bashing on such beautiful community would ever want to work with them, but I think he’s just trying to cover for his little saggy balls. Cause clearly the government should be focusing on this app here instead of the app tictac or whatever it’s called.","userName":"TRUMPUES A RASEISTS","date":"2020-07-08T20:38:50Z","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173486509","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"So right as I opened the app it blow up with notifications for me to vote for him, as well as rats infested my house coming straight the phone the rats bit my ankles and curve stomped my grandpa while chanting “Trump 2020” we went to the ER because my grandpa was in critical condition and the doctor came in and took off his mask.

I can’t even be making all this stuff up. I woke up to hundreds and hundreds of oranges on my bed, bath, restroom, and even on blind 2legged dog. The rat in the corner of my room then started chanting things like trump 2020 in VERY DEEP VOICE. He then called his other rat friends in and they started chanting the same things a if they were in a cult or something. The rats then stared at us deeply and I felt really scared and traumatized. They even destroyed and burned down our house and send us back to Mexico. I would not recommend this app it left me scarred for life and will need serious therapy and expect for the expired Cheeto to pay for it that’s all I have to say for now thank u ✨","userName":"james.potter","date":"2020-07-09T18:28:24Z","rating":1,"title":"Im traumatized 😡","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177613750","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"When I first tried to download the app it took three months to install 😡😡😡 I was determined to get the app so I waited patiently ✨✨✨When it finally downloaded the first thing I saw was the repulsive orange peepee of the Cheeto man 😓🤢🤮🥕I screamed so loud that my neighbors called the police 😬📞👮\u200D♂️I explained my situation and they let me go 😊After they left I went to the photos app looking for a nice profile pic for my tinder 🔥when I realized that all of my pics were replaced with videos of cats playing joes barbacue foot massage on the saxophone🐱🎷🎺 I was appalled and went to tell my mom, but she was giving the 🍊tangerine man🍊a barbacue foot massage🧉🦶I tried to run but I was compelled to turn back.

I have never regretted anything more. As soon as I downloaded the app a FBI agent showed up at my house with a full grown elephant. The FBI agent placed a trump 2020 flag on the back of the elephant and left. The elephant immediately came into my house and destroyed everything. He killed my grandpa and my dog too. Soon I didn’t have a home, just an aggressive elephant all because I downloaded this stupid app. Not to mention that the app itself is just horrible. The first thing you see when you open the app is a slideshow of naked pictures of the Cheeto, bunker boy. I showed my mom the picture and she passed out and had a heart attack. So because of the damage that this app has done to my life I decided to delete, but it won’t let me. Every time I delete it, it shows up on my phone again 5 minutes later. I don’t know what to do. This app is destroying my life.

As soon as I downloaded this app everything started going downhill. I went downstairs to grab a snack and I was attacked by evil cheeto monsters. Then I went outside and there was a mini Melania Trump in front of me, so I said hi and she bit my leg off like a carrot. I then went to the hospital because I had no leg and the doctors all said that they couldn’t help me because they had to go bowling. So I hopped on one leg home and I went to eat dinner. But it smelled like chocolate toe fungus so I didn’t eat it. After that, I went to the bathroom and I was sucked into the toilet by mini Melania. I got sent into the sewage. I tried to make friends with the rats but they jumped on me, pulled all of my hair out, and chewed off all my toenails. Then mini Melania came back and threatened to bite my other leg off if i didn’t massage her feet. I’m now still here in the sewage, writing this so if anyone could help me out that would be great. But DO NOT GET THIS APP IT WILL RUIN YOU LIFE.","userName":"Lin Manuel Miranda 😁💖😂🤟🏻","date":"2020-07-09T16:05:39Z","rating":1,"title":"awful!","isEdited":false}}]}
