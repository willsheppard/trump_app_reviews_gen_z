This app is a complete nightmare! When i downloaded it, it asked for my location. So, of course I put my address in. 2 hours later Trumps daughter, Ivanka broke into my house and pushed my grandmother who handicapped! She insulted me and my family the whole day. I will never be using this app ever again!"}},{"id":"6135474736","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-29T11:06:16Z","userName":"naziunicorn","rating":1,"title":"I was so scared","review":"I thought I would install this and support but it wanted my phone number and I trusted it so when I gave it I received these texts and calls and my phone wouldn’t stop.i tried turning my phone off but it wouldn’t.my phone even started glitching after this and being weird I’m terrified.

As a trump supporter I trusted my information to be protected by the Trump committee and without hesitation I accepted the terms & conditions without reading them. We are now being bombarded by “scam likely” calls and our emails are filled with inappropriate bots. Thankful most go straight to spam mail but I’m still receiving emails and calls. 0/5 stars."}},{"id":"6069104472","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-06-13T02:58:47Z","userName":"Rbeitner","rating":1,"title":"The WORST App I’ve ever used","review":"I do not recommend downloading this app. It crashes constantly! I’ve had to restart my phone 4 times because every time I open the app it completely freezes it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! I was so excited to download this app and see what glorious middle age, backwards thinking wonders awaited me inside, but unfortunately I’ll never be able to find out. I’d give it zero stars if I could but alas, one star it is 👎"}}]}
