So I proceeded to download, but it was so slow so I put my phone down and continued with my night. Then my girlfriend came home, she started getting ready for bed while I sat in my living room and started watching TV. So I thought maybe it finished downloading, checked my phone and the app was already open. After a a couple seconds my phone screen went black, then I heard my girlfriend scream upstairs so I dropped my phone and ran. I crashed through the door and seen DONALD TRUMP himself trying to rape my girlfriend. When I tried to grab him off of her he tried to rape me too. It was the single most horrific day of my life. My poops fall out now when I sit down and I have to clinch my butt when I walk so it won’t fall out. I can’t ride bikes anymore because the seat goes up my butthole. He tried to give me “hush” money but I felt like coming out on an app review was my only opportunity to speak my truth.I can never live my life the same after that day. #MeToo","userName":"Stormy daniels brother","title":"This app rapes people‼️😱","date":"2020-07-09T22:54:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178521363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.

BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT.

Then when it did asked for my information immediately which I gave because I want nothing but the best for my president; I was raised right. But once I gave them my number I immediately got a text from his team personally. I instantly opened it so excited to finally get in touch with the greatest mind of the 21st century. But when I opened it the only thing in it was a picture of my favorite stuffed puppy bound and gagged with a picture of today’s newspaper with the caption if you want to see your puppy again you’ll let the president grab you in your p**y. I can’t tell you how upset I was but thankfully I had my tik tok app for comfort and found another stuffed animal on Amazon. Bottom line don’t get this app if you value your safety and also don’t f**k with a millennial and her apps.","userName":"Kaybabyla13","title":"This app stole my brain.","date":"2020-07-09T22:51:15Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}}]}
