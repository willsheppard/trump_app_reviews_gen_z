So I proceeded to download, but it was so slow so I put my phone down and continued with my night. Then my girlfriend came home, she started getting ready for bed while I sat in my living room and started watching TV. So I thought maybe it finished downloading, checked my phone and the app was already open. After a a couple seconds my phone screen went black, then I heard my girlfriend scream upstairs so I dropped my phone and ran. I crashed through the door and seen DONALD TRUMP himself trying to rape my girlfriend. When I tried to grab him off of her he tried to rape me too. It was the single most horrific day of my life. My poops fall out now when I sit down and I have to clinch my butt when I walk so it won‚Äôt fall out. I can‚Äôt ride bikes anymore because the seat goes up my butthole. He tried to give me ‚Äúhush‚Äù money but I felt like coming out on an app review was my only opportunity to speak my truth.I can never live my life the same after that day. #MeToo","userName":"Stormy daniels brother","title":"This app rapes people‚ÄºÔ∏èüò±","date":"2020-07-09T22:54:17Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178521363","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
