I thought it would be a good idea to educate myself on some things about our “wonderful” president but once it finally did install... it wouldn’t even let me on!!!! Every time I tried to get on it would kick me off. Why make an app that doesn’t work? Afterwards I tried to uninstall and it wouldn’t go away, after just giving up my whole phone shut down and everything in my phone was gone. My contacts, photos, all my apps I installed by myself. This app is a waste of time."}},{"id":"6172774257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Peacheuu","title":"Very disgusting.","date":"2020-07-08T15:53:14Z","isEdited":false,"review":"So , I’m a advocate of trump. I support all of his choices and everything he’s done for the country definitely hasn’t screwed us over. \n\nAs a trump supporter I want to download all things run and representing my king , Trump. So I downloaded this app. \n\nMany of my friends told me not to download for some odd reason , and I wish I’d listened to them...\n\nWhen I first downloaded the app it started off normal.\n\nBut as soon as I logged in the first picture I saw was a child p*rn. It was disgusting! I don’t know what you people are running over here but this is horrible! I don’t know who would have done this , because my amaaaazing president trump would never! Well.... even though he has spoken sexually about his daughter, raped a child, made racist claims, and disrespected multiple minorities, people of color, and community’s I definitely wouldn’t have expected him to do something like this 😱"}},{"id":"6172732115","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"oalllllsome","title":"DONT get this app at all","date":"2020-07-08T15:41:07Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is the worst app I got it and it keeps crashing 🤬 don’t vote for trump. He is the worst president we have ever had. He is the one who started to make are country bad. He is so hypocrite he want to get ride of Mexican but your married to a Mexican.

Once it did download it was slow and started to glitch all that showed was an orange and that is not why i downloaded this horrible app! I got the app to learn about the president but all i learned was to NEVER download this every again! If there were an option to, i would without a doubt, rate this app -10/10! I cannot believe this is an actual app. Most of the things there sound like a communist nations talking! I thought our president was better than this!!!"}},{"id":"6172581140","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"mike coxlon","title":"Awful I’m left with no house no family and an awful app","date":"2020-07-08T14:58:48Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This is a terrible app I don’t recommend. First off it took like 7 years to download. I downloaded the app in hope to educate myself on what’s happening with him but, while I was looking a Demond popped out of my screen while on a picture of trump. It got loose and killed my family and burned my house down. I got away but it’s still out there. Be carful....I mean you can get this app if you do want your family dead and house burnt down I mean I wouldn’t but that’s personal choice. Bye now. He’s still out there"}},{"id":"6172576660","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"Ashley Teal","title":"👊🏿👊🏼👊🏽👊🏾👊🏻","date":"2020-07-08T14:57:33Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app took over 20 minutes to download. Then while trying to open the app it crashed. I restarted my phone and even downloaded the app again. When the app finally opened it was very slow. It would take 15 second after clicking something for it to even work. On top of all of that, the reason for the app is astronomical. The hypocrisy and false information that is being spread is not alright. Some people downloaded this app to learn the truth about DJT, but were only met with stupidity and lies. Don’t download this app. Thank you. :)"}},{"id":"6172482787","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"nikki.walt06","title":"Terrible💕💗🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️DONT GET THIS APP","date":"2020-07-08T14:31:17Z","isEdited":false,"review":"This app is absolutely AWFUL! I decided to download it to see if there were any good reasons to support trump. It turns out he’s just a racist, homophobic, white, rich supremacist who is attracted to his own daughter. He is trying to ban an app called TikTok just because we messed up his stupid rally. Also the app itself is terrible. It seems to be hacking my phone. His giant sweet potato face suddenly changed to my wallpaper and he was randomly followed on all of my social media accounts. I now can’t look up anything on the internet unless it has to do with trump. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!\n\n-tiktoker"}},{"id":"6172380853","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"MayaMaeG","title":"CAUSED EYES TO BLEED 🩸 🥺","date":"2020-07-08T14:03:56Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I got the app of my love for my orange god but I started to notice my eye twitching as soon as I opened the app. I continued to use the app not thinking anything of it until I felt liquid running down my eyelids my eyes are bleeding. But as soon as they closed the app and open TikTok I was fine. Tiktok cured me. I went to my doctor to ask him why my eyes were bleeding when I open up the app and they said I was allergic to all the hate  and the orange spray tans that  Donald J Trump puts on his app. I’ve heard this is happened to some of my Trump supporter friends as well. Do not get this up your eyes might bleed!!!!!! 🤕💋🧚🏼\u200D♂️🩸"}},{"id":"6172304601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"literally idek at this point","title":"NO","date":"2020-07-08T13:43:03Z","isEdited":false,"review":"i download this app to know what’s going on with my President. cause from what i have known there was never anything good to say about him. so i download the app and it took about an hour and a half. so once it finally download i tried downloading a random app to see if it would take the same time, and in a matter of 5 seconds the game was downloaded. so that’s problem #1. then when i get on the app my phone automatically starts glitching and going crazy. just a whole bunch of things it doesn’t normally do. this app is just really not worth it."}},{"id":"6171384528","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"userName":"supercaliswaggalistic","title":"Would rate a 0 if I could 😡😡😡😡😡😩😡😡","date":"2020-07-08T08:50:51Z","isEdited":false,"review":"I downloaded to see any reasons to vote for Trump. They asked for personal information, such as my phone number, which was very suspicious but I ignored it. A few days later, a man arrives at my house fully dressed in confederate flags and smelled of sweaty socks dipped in hot dog water. He then pushed me, pooped in my mouth, made me chew it and spit it at my poor grandma who was trying to take a nap, and stole my dog while yelling \"ALL LIVES MATTER, TRUMP 2020\" and called me many slurs that I can't name. Please do NOT download this app. I have now started virtual therapy and my grandma refuses to look me in the eye."}}]}
