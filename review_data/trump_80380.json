Hi fellow people","userName":"hehe haha rbuds","review":"I heard if I downloaded this app I would be part of the upcoming hip house. Well obviously I was wrong. They told me if I wanted to sign up with their mailing company. And I did. So I was so excited for my mail I sat on my lawn chair and waited till my mailman came and delivered my mail. I waited and waited and my mail wasn’t what I expected. Karen and her friends Betty and Patty came with their All Lives Matter caps trying to accuse me of running over them with my car and assaulting them for some insurance. I wasn’t even in my car. I quickly logged on to my phone and showed them this app. They became happy and hugged me and offered their All Lives Matter hat but I quickly declined and lied that I had a hat of my own. They might have seen through me but they left peacefully. I was to scared to go outside worried that they might have noticed I was on my porch not wearing a mask. A few days later I was tired of the notifications they were sending so I deleted my app. Karen and her must have gotten their Karen senses because in five minutes they came to my house ready for war. They knocked on my door all mad. I thought they were supposed to be ok with me. I opened the door and told them that I had a famous lawyer and I would sue them if they tried anything. Karen was really angered by that and she bit me. Soon after when I saw toddlers playing with chalk I immediately thought they were tagging the street with gang signs. I have been hallucinating and sometimes thinking my name is also Karen. My tips are turning blonde. I am in the hospital getting help to slow down the process but unfortunately my disease is incurable. All because of this app.","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:46:36Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6178183534","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!","userName":"gisselktovar","review":"This app made my phone crash!
