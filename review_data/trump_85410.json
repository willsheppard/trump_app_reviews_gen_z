You might want to argue and say “she was already old”, or “it was bound to happen anyways” well get this. My grandma was extremely healthy and stable, she was the ripe age of 139 and has survived many tough times, including 9/11 and World War 2. In her 80’s she fought street gangs for fun! But out of all the crazy things- THIS APP is what killed her. Here’s the story: me and her got in an argument because she wanted to vote to re-elect Donald Doodie Trump and I told her about all the not-so-good things he stands for, A friendly debate some might call it. She asked about his policies and I told her to do some research, we thought the totally non-biased app created for the president himself might be a good place to start. Unfortunately however, as soon as the app opened a little orange gremlin-looking oompa loompa type creature shows up on the screen SCREAMING (mind you my grandma’s phone volume was all the way off), the gremlin was throwing a full-on temper tantrum on the screen, shouting and kicking like an unruly child and saying that if we don’t vote for him, he will find and murder everyone we’ve ever loved. Throughout the following week, the screaming beast would appear on my grandma’s phone screen randomly, even after she deleted the app, and would threaten to murder us and our family. The final straw came when in the middle of our sunday morning church service he started screaming that satan himself was living inside of his kidneys (explaining his sickly orange complexion) and controlling his every move. He was yelling from my grandma’s phone about how everything he does is to please satan, his shrill voice ringing out through the entire church building. Everyone was shocked and started yelling at my poor grandma, who instantly had a heart attack and died, right then, right there. Please don’t get this app, or vote for the dirty orange satanic cheeto monster. Please, it’s what my grandma would have asked of you too, please, for her. 😻"}},{"id":"6178085063","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"roblza","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:11:57Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worse App Ever","review":"My mom got whooped by the app and she had to go to the hospital :("}},{"id":"6178080540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yikes🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:10:27Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst app...disappointed","review":"This app is boring and I do not support this political campaign🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨ We want tik tok🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨"}},{"id":"6178073794","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Butt2226644663","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:08:16Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Awful","review":"It was awful"}},{"id":"6178065601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"12nvjg3nb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:05:33Z","isEdited":false,"title":"bad","review":"i downloaded this app to hear some strong, intelligent ol plans from our lord and savior donald, but the plans i saw were neither strong nor intelligent so 1 star!"}},{"id":"6178063419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"TC😊","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:04:47Z","isEdited":false,"title":"T","review":"You are by far they meanest president I have ever heard of"}},{"id":"6178059180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"dnskwkfbejsje","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T20:03:26Z","isEdited":false,"title":"😗✌️","review":"I downloaded this app because it appeared to me in a nightmare- that I was meant to download it or else the orange army would come and kidnap me. Panicking, I woke up and hurriedly downloaded it. After waiting two months, it finally finished. But when I opened it, it crashed a few times until it showed me a picture of a hUGE orange. Immediately, a horrifying, putrid smell emerged from my phone, worse than the dumpster. My house’s roof immediately fell on top of me and the paramedics took a week to get me out from under the ruins. I was badly injured and almost on the brink of death. The smell was still ongoing though, and when I got rescued, my phone started chanting “orange hooha! orange hooha!” Over and over again. Suddenly, a flying alligator teleported to my neighborhood and all the houses were caught up in flames! A monkey with rabies started to chase us all down and throw two year old oranges at us that smelled just like the app - stinky socks and sausage puke. I immediately opened the app to try and find a way to reverse everything, but the only thing there was an image of an orange with a humongous mouth. I tried tapping on the mouth but it emerged, bit off and swallowed my finger! My phone then perished and set off an alarm that u could hear from miles away! It disturbed the vampire bears that lived in the nearby woods and many other creatures that used to be kind, all which the sound possessed. They then raided nearby cities and towns. I am heavily traumatized and will be needing extensive therapy. Do not download this app if you want to live a life free of putrid smells and vicious animals."}},{"id":"6178047826","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"aiid_an","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:59:43Z","isEdited":false,"title":"It’s laggy","review":"I got the app to support trump and it’s laggy and glitchy"}},{"id":"6178044043","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"WendyDaBomb","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T19:58:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Bad :(","review":"every time I open the app it’s trumps nudes?
