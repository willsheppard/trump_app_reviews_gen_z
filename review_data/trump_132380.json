On first opening it it crashed and put viruses on my phone!! Trying to get said viruses off of my phone I plugged it into my beef cake of an Omen computer that cost me my college fund and it infected that too!!! In desperation I went to Geek Squad to fix the dastardly problem. Handing them my phone they plugged it in. That’s where they made their first mistake. The entire Best Buy building went dark. From the darkness I heard his voice. “Despite the constant negative press, covfefe”. I screamed, in sheer panic I grab the man wearing a BLACK LIVES MATTER t-shirt and I yell “WE HAVE TO RUN!” And so now I’m using his phone to write this review as I watch the Best Buy burn up in flames. No one will know what happened at Best Buy that day. We made sure of it.","isEdited":false,"title":"🍑🍑🍑"}},{"id":"6173959957","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:33:05Z","rating":1,"userName":"bofa 🧚✨","review":"When i downloaded this app to commemorate my favorite president donald trump, my life was flipped upside down. The second i opened this app i saw before my eyes a big, voluptuous, orange butthole. It really traumatized me and left deep mental scars. For weeks after i saw that picture i encountered the worst luck. I tripped on dog poop, i lost my wallet, i lost all of my friends, and i was devastated. ZERO STARS!!! NO STARS FOR THIS APP!!!!!","isEdited":false,"title":"This app ruined my life!!!! 😡😡😡😡"}},{"id":"6173959572","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:56Z","rating":1,"userName":"Hayden Kol","review":"🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤🍤 🍤","isEdited":false,"title":"no ❤️"}},{"id":"6173959419","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:53Z","rating":1,"userName":"acacialyster","review":"You see multiple discussing photos of the Orange blob if you support trump you have a small pee pee","isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER"}},{"id":"6173959242","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:32:49Z","rating":1,"userName":"cjdnfjvjdhcjfjf","review":"Terrible terrible connection.

ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister.

BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college.
