I’m embarrassed by this app and it’s inabilities and the unstable platform. This shouldn’t have been launched until complete testing was done. Someone had better own the faults for this. How can I support trump as president if his team of people can’t even launch an app. He’s supposed to be a business man. Come on.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Appreciative.user","title":"Who coded this app?","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:32:02Z"}},{"id":"6177703289","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is terrible. I got it to see what the future would hold if Cheeto became president in 2020. I am highly disappointed in what America would become. Also every time I would open the app it would log me out of my phone for half an hour. So overall, I am disappointed in the app and even more so in the “president” with corn husk hair.✨","isEdited":false,"userName":"owllover36","title":"Horrible ✨✨","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:11:39Z"}},{"id":"6177672173","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Seriously I know the zoomers are trying to destroy trump (have fun kiddos), but like this app doesn’t work. I downloaded it for jokes and because I was just somewhat curious as to what kind of stuff trump was putting on an app. I could never get it to properly open ??? I wish I could give it 0 stars because I never even got it to work.","isEdited":false,"userName":"DTIAWSFSIYVFHAYAWSFS","title":"Why is this app so bad?","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T18:02:03Z"}},{"id":"6177650304","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I was excited to get this app like so excited 😆 but no I almost had a heart attack Bc of this app when I opened it I saw the most hideous picture EVER😖I saw a big size orange Dressed as a clown 🤡 now I thought we was in July not no October 😪 so when I say don’t get this app don’t get it bc you might as well just be committing suicide if you get it 😰so for your sake DONT get it 🧚\u200D♂️trump2020😻on a grave💅🏼😘😘😘","isEdited":false,"userName":"🌈😎🐳🦄🌈☀️🦉🐶🐯👑","title":"Cap 🧢","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:54:56Z"}},{"id":"6177638266","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’ve been trying to download this app since last year... as soon as it did download the very next day things started getting weird.

Only to find out he’s a big racist, that hates people and wishes he was Hitler. Anyone that puts his own self above the life of others is no good for America. I was spammed with notifications after turning them off, and I feel as if the app is tracking my data. This app needs to be taken down.","isEdited":false,"userName":"whitmore09","title":"🤮🤮🤮","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T17:35:01Z"}},{"id":"6177583062","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I had to delete 100 photos of my grandchildren, ginny and ron, to download this application. I have to say that I’m quite disappointed with the display of the application as well. Even though I am a huge supporter of our president, this app isn’t very good.
