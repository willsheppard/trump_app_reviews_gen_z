It just made a $10 payment by itself, I DIDNT EVEN GIVE IT PERMISSION!! Anyway, if you want a good app that tells you where tanning salons are just get google maps. Also it only showed tanning salons in areas 100 MILES away, not chill or cute. This app also made me, a vegan, eat meat. It stole my dog, made me pay $10, and killed my fish. I WILL NOT LET THIS APP TAKE ANYTHING MORE FROM ME!!!!😤","userName":"lyla1564"}},{"id":"6173930507","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:22:05Z","title":"begone 💫 thot 🙈 swiper 💗 no 🎉 swipe 🍾","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"my name is pornessian parrapio and when I went into the app I saw a Cheeto 🤢 and when I looked up all my American flags 🇺🇸 were gone 😳 so i googled happened to them and i was too stupid to understand so I went 🏃\u200D♀️💨 to go take a seat 🪑 and think 🤔 about my existence and then I look up to see the cloud is shaped like a thumbs down 👎 so in conclusion the world 🌎 is trying to say this app is no buenos and you should delete it and it’s not even worth one ☝️ star","userName":"itsbys"}},{"id":"6173900602","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T22:11:08Z","title":"Discusttttiiiiinnnnngggggggg","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"I.......no I opensd the app to see cheeto boy working out and I am now scared I further more saw him getting a spray tan nakedddd🤮🤮🤮🤮👁👄👁 I was unfortunate and had to see his little ball.

ONE STAR!!!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Omg when I tell you this app is absolutely horrible! I cannot believe Apple is allowing this game to function and be available to download. One star is the only rating I can think of to give this app, and to think if only you are able to give this app a 0 star rating I would do so. This app doesn’t run properly and it associates with a racist and not to mention a rapist! Ugh the AUDACITY to allow this app on such a big platform (app store) blows my mind!!!!! ONE STAR RATING","userName":"Zeilabeila"}},{"id":"6173854802","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:54:16Z","title":"worst app i’ve ever had","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"first and foremost it didn’t download it took two weeks and i deleted it and kept trying but it didn’t work and i know it’s not my phone it’s the app cause every other app work it has bad quality’s and there’s so much mistakes in the titles and fonts and it aggravates me it doesn’t even work properly i try to open articles but it wouldn’t even work it kept lagging and obviously not doing what it’s suppose to do and i think you should take down because it’s a huge waste of time. for people who are busy and for those who have other important things to do than to waste trying figure out how this app works and it just a disappointment to the rest of the apps in the app store 🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊bad oranges","userName":"skylar skai"}},{"id":"6173825470","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:42:58Z","title":"I got threatened by trumps hair","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So bad I tried to install it to one me years bot as long as I took trump to get impeached I really wanted to give it a good review 🤣 but I didn’t work it said only 1 star I wanted to put five but I was threatened by Donald trumps pile of hair they said the would choke my teddy bear 👌 the hairs left and I couldn’t switch it it was too late also gave it a one cuz they wanted me to support trump and the racism and they keeping my ppl on cages and now color matters yup ur ed no wonder u got fake hair it’s a pile of corn hair 🌾","userName":"im javierz"}},{"id":"6173797753","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:32:13Z","title":"Worst app ever!!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"Downloaded the app, which took around three hours even though I have perfectly good wifi. Got on it to give it a try despite being upset about how long it took to download, and sadly the app glitches so terribly that I can’t even get on anymore. Doesn’t work properly and has brought several bugs onto my phone. Had to delete unfortunately due to how badly my phone started to glitch. Wouldn’t recommend.","userName":"lexi_724"}},{"id":"6173819842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T21:40:46Z","title":"chile, the ghetto","rating":3,"isEdited":false,"review":"this app is horrible & very thuggsih!! only thugs make apps like this, what a shame! he deserves the death penalty, it used my location to track me i had strangers at my house 🤮 it also started playing some unknown music on my phone, it also made my phone really hot and it killed my cat.. -10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!

DONT DOWNLOAD‼️","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"review":"So I downloaded this because I was so incredibly excited 🥳to support our amazing president Donald J Trump. But as soon as his Chester 🧀 the Cheetah 🐆looking arse popped up I was yeeted back with such strong force I landed on my cats 🐱tail. My cat then hissed 🗣and took off to leave my room🚪. I ran after him only for him to ram into the coffee ☕️table and knock down my Harry styles scented candle 🕯which then lit my Trump shrine on fire 🔥and the rest of the house🏡 went with it. Needless to say, two birds 🐦were killed with one stone 🗡today.","userName":"👍🏻May👎🏻"}}]}
