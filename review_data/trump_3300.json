Everything was going “GREAT” until I open the app. I seen an orange dried, fried man in front of the screen. It was a horrible, disgusting, and pathetic picture to view.  People will say “Trump2020” and rather vote for an orange man. Open your eyes, open your mind. Trump did raped lots of children (boy and girls). All the information came out and had his signature agreeing to it. Would you rather look like a fool for supporting a rapist? Or having to explain to your own kid that it’s okay getting raped? OH SWEET AMERICA... wake up before it’s to late. Wake up and open your eyes, open your mind. For the last days will come full of regret.","userName":"RileyMadden2020","title":"Keep America Great🆕"}},{"id":"6172719975","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:37:41Z","rating":1,"review":"Most of my family are all republicans yet are very against Donald Trump. He has done almost nothing good for our country. Personally, I voted for him back in 2016, but with his past with Jeffrey Epstein, tweets, how he handled covid-19, and all of the protests, I will not be voting for him again. He is a white supremacist who cares for nobody else except himself. \n\nLet’s talk about the app on the other hand...\nI’m so surprised that a billionaire could create such a bad app and NOT be able to fix it..? It was super glitchy and made my phone freeze so I had to shut it off for a while. When it asked me to put in my personal info (phone number, etc.), I didn’t think too much about it though i should have. Within a few days, I kept getting calls from strange numbers... and I haven’t been putting my number anywhere else either. I think the app sold or leaked my info! \n\nI downloaded the app so that I could see what’s going on with him and maybe find a good side but in reality it just makes me want to vote for biden even more. #SettleforBiden","userName":"__________•••••","title":"Leaked my info & Glitchy"}},{"id":"6172670594","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:23:47Z","rating":1,"review":"I used to adore Trump until I reread some facts and statistics. Apparently, he is homophobic,\nTransphobic, sexist, and racist. I found that he has over forty sexual assault cases. I also found that he made it legal to discriminate against trans people who need healthcare. I thought this app would maybe let me see what he had done good and give me more faith in him. As I opened the app, a picture of an orange was on the screen. My cat got so mesmerized that he decided to scratch my screen repeatedly. I tried to get him off but he was too strong. He carried the phone into his bed and after a while of chewing on it, he bit into a wire on the phone and electrocuted himself. Fly high Ribbons! This app broke my phone and killed my cat.","userName":"f GH kbcgh","title":"Broke my phone, killed my cat"}},{"id":"6172667252","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T15:22:51Z","rating":1,"review":"So let’s start out this app took so long to download almost 2hours I was just trying to support our president but once the app started working it kept glitching so much and I have amazing WiFi so it was what that I called the workers to help and let me tell you the volume inside of that call was astronomical they were way to loud and rude I have never been treated so badly by someone but once the app started to work after like 6 hours it was playing music and my cat almost died to the sound of that it was horrible and to make things worse all these bugs flew into my house attracted by the music so i am currently living in hotel until all the bugs in my house are gone ⚠️DO NOT GET THIS APP⚠️","userName":"frfjiygfethkougfefgjoredfgrw","title":"Horrible 💫✨💖🌸"}},{"id":"6172530230","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T14:44:37Z","rating":1,"review":"my grandpa was a huge trump supporter and loved to keep up with all the “amazing” things his president was doing. I downloaded it on his IPad, and it took THREE DAYS to finally finish loading, they have perfectly fine WiFi too! When it finally loaded it was flashing orange and giving my gramps directions to the nearest tanning salon and Trying to get him to purchase orange and white hair dye! My gramps doesn’t even have hair!  The flashing was just too much for his epilepsy, and caused him to have a seizure. And unfortunately, there was nothing I could’ve done too save him. He died trying to support his president and look what he got in return. I am no longer a trump supporter, and now an anonymous 2020🇺🇸 supporter!

As soon as i opened it, horrid pictures of an orange cheeto man popped up on my screen. I don’t know if this was a glitch or not but my poor virgin eyes have been scared forever. Please look into this. I would NOT be happy if other people were having this aswell. But also, the app said it was tracking my location and collecting all of my person information. If this is what you think is a good president app or whatever, you’re wrong. Personally, I don’t want anyone to know my location and ANY of my personal information. So, could you please fix this. Besides those major issues, overall, this is a terrible app.","userName":"couldnt think of a nickname :P","title":"Very scary"}},{"id":"6172012180","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T12:20:23Z","rating":1,"review":"When I opens this app my dog started to whine. I showed him the picture of our Cheeto in chief and he started to pee 😔 I think the Russian hookers thought him that. Next, my dirty laundry basket started filling up with toady tanned clothing. That is when I knew he was here.  The Mexicans came climbing up my wall, all I could think was how they are going to steal my job. Now there are 3 Mexican people living near me (excluding women because they don’t have rights to their own bodies so not human) what’s next Trump? Do I have to start liking black people. No can do. The part of my brain where rational thought happens killed itself when watching the Ingram angle.
