Second, whenever I tried to text my friends, it would replace the words “racist, homophobic, sexist Cheeto puff” with “trump”. This is a violation of my 1st amendment right. Third, this app caused my iPad to not submit my AP test correctly because it used up so much data that there was a technical error, so I had to retake my AP US history test as a result. Although, now I definitely know more history of the United States than the President of the United States. Fourth, whenever my dogs got close to my phone, they would immediately giving away all my stuff to other dogs in the area and bought $666.66 worth of communist artifacts on my amazon account. They started barking “it’s OUR stuff”. Sixth, this app hurt my feelings because all the colors were too bright and bold for my depression, I was very overwhelmed and it worsened my mental health. I don’t recommend.","rating":1,"title":"THIS APP MADE MY DOGS COMMUNIST"}},{"id":"6178449910","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:24:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Havbai","review":"I’m such a hard supporter of Donald Trump, he is my king, my beloved president. I wanted to download this app to support my king 👑 and I thought the reviews were fake!! But NO, it’s not!! The app legitimately took TWO WHOLE DAYS for me to even download it and as soon as I logged on it asked for my personal information and bank account?!! What sort of app does that? I think this app is a scam because @realdonaldtrump WOULDN'T do such a thing ;( \nNot only that, this app is seriously dangerous. I kept getting random messages like “wanna play a game?” and one even found my address! This app is filled with scams asking for money, personal information and dead on creepy messages. \nI genuinely think the people of the blue whale games run this app because I don’t want to play “a game” but they keep threatening to come to my house!! Apple needs to take this app down because my 👑 would not approve of this app and scam!! If I could give 0 stars I would! Such a disappointment for a big dictator supporter 😒","rating":1,"title":"DANGEROUS APP!!

Of course I waiting the three hours, as I’d do anything to help support my country. Unfortunately, an error occurred about an hour into the download and reset the download time. This happened two more times, totaling around seven hours of download time total. Then it asked for my phone number and zip code. Of course I entered it in, fully trusting the President’s application. Shortly after I began getting odd messages ordering me to go to places within my state. At this point I had had enough. I deleted the app and blocked the numbers. Before writing this review I checked other reviews and saw that some experienced this as well. This application obviously holds some sort of virus, please reconsider before downloading this application.","rating":1,"title":"Very disappointing"}},{"id":"6178449139","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:24:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"_Your_average_nerd_","review":"I wanted this app to be good so badly but it was so disappointing.It took forever to download and really needs an upgrade. The app is incredibly difficult to use and waste of energy. I wish continue to just stay connected with fox and twitter.","rating":1,"title":"Disappointing"}},{"id":"6178448751","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T22:23:55Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"coco✨🐒","review":"this app RUINED my phone. As soon as i downloaded it, my phone started smoking and i heard beeping coming from inside of it. So i deleted the app. The smoking continued for hours, and this is a new phone! Once the beeping and smoke stopped, I heard the door banging loudly downstairs. And the SWAT team busted through my door, threatening to revoke my citizenship and send me back to “negroland” (which i’m assuming they meant Africa) if i didn’t redownload the app and i’m not even African!!🐒✨ after that, they took me to the ICE detainment centers where they threw me in with all of the other children in cages and Trump came in and he climbed to the top of the cage and started jumping up and down on it until it broke through and he was trapped in there with us. The SWAT team then took me back to my house offering apologies for the confusion because they meant to take me to the airport to send me away to Africa but I’ll have to wait for the next flight which is tomorrow. This app is the WORST.","rating":1,"title":"this app sucks~ 🐒✨🙊🤪👩🏿 foreigner💕"}}]}
