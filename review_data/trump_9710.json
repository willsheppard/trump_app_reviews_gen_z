Now I’m not one to complain and be a Karen but I think today’s the day to be that Karen. I would like to talk to the manager about this raw chicken situation. The smell is so bad that it burned my phone so now I can’t use my phone. It even bothered my neighbors and my pet cat who loves chicken. I know that the smell came from this app because I wasn’t eating any chicken. Anyways Michelle Obama 2020!❤️"}},{"id":"6175034417","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NAMJOON FOR PRESIDENT","date":"2020-07-09T04:18:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"D1vorced man","review":"I do not recommend this app! It stole my kids and my wife, I tried calling her earlier but it opened this app instead! I’m starving and my wife still hasn’t showed up, it’s been 2 weeks! I got divorce papers in the mail today and I don’t know what to do anymore, this app has ruined my life and if I wasn’t a trump supporter, maybe everyone would like me better and I could finally see her and my 12 kids again! Anyways, Namjoon for president, have a good day 🥰💜"}},{"id":"6175005601","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"such a disgusting and horrible app!","date":"2020-07-09T04:09:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"the one and only, karen.","review":"i open the app and BOOM, racism everywhere! it was so offensive and so many things were said that were not accurate at all. there was also a picture of a rapist, it was SO uncomfortable. this app is definitely not keeping america great or even helping at all. also there was an “orange” talking about putting up a wall 🤣🤣🤣 i cant 😭💀 there is SO MANY wrong things with this app it’s HORRIBLE and it NEEDS to be taken down IMMEDIATELY. period."}},{"id":"6174977870","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"TERRIBLE APP. MADE PHONE GLITCHY","date":"2020-07-09T04:00:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"upsetwomaninkitchen","review":"I got this app to stay updated with events but this thing is trash. Tried to open it but it said I couldn’t because “women shouldn’t be allowed to have control over anything”. Like seriously. I just want to stay updated on what this grapefruit of a “president” is doing but the app won’t work. It even told me to “get back in the kitchen”. Will never get another app that has to do with “trump” if that’s even his real name. Would NOT recommend."}},{"id":"6174964872","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"lol you THOUGHT you were getting TIKTOK!","date":"2020-07-09T03:56:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"yea....cause no","review":"this app is completely horrible. i downloaded it and my whole house caught on fire as soon as i opened it. i went to wendy’s for happy hour and they told me that they were all out of dinosaur nuggets and ever since then, mcdonald’s hasn’t sold a single steak, walmart stopped selling real estate, and whataburger stop giving out life insurance. this app has brought nothing but bad luck into my life and it needs to be taken down RIGHT NOW! \n\nsincerely GENZ🧚🏾"}},{"id":"6174958537","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU ARE A POC","date":"2020-07-09T03:54:27Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Sandtrum","review":"As soon as I installed the app, my phone started making these noises like trying to warn me to delete the app. I’ve never felt so scared in my life. Then I clicked on the app and this orange, rooster looking figure popped up on my screen, I threw my phone so hard I thought I broke it. Then a notification popped up with a black screen showing my face saying “NO POC’S ALLOWED.” I immediately felt this rage but at the same time felt so traumatized by the rooster looking figure. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IF YOU ARE A POC."}},{"id":"6174952261","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Throughly dissatisfied 🤩😘😘","date":"2020-07-09T03:52:32Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"the tuts","review":"There are simply not words powerful enough in the English language to express my complete and utter discontent with this app and my disgust for this man whom holds the position of president. To remove this disgrace of an app from the Apple App Store would be greatly appreciated and would show a true dedication to the satisfaction of Apple users, as this man is an embarrassment to the United States and this app does nothing more than continue to give him a platform to expand his cult of brainwashed racists 💕🧚🏾\u200D♀️❤️"}},{"id":"6174929974","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS😭😭","date":"2020-07-09T03:45:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"trumpslittehairytoupee👁👄👁","review":"I was so scared when I first opened this app!! I first saw a picture of a ugly stale orange peel and my eyes completely dissolved!!! I was taken to a hospital an had to get a emergency replacement, my husband earl was nice enough to give me a eyeball 🙃#couplegoals #guessimapiratenow #someonegetmeaeyepatch\nSince I am 76 the procedure was very risky!!!! They put me to sleep and still the picture haunted me!!! I still haven’t recovered, and I still suffer trauma from the picture, I receive therapy 60 times a week. -Martha Hancock"}},{"id":"6174919107","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE APP","date":"2020-07-09T03:42:19Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"davis11202","review":"Once I downloaded this app it told me go back to my own country even though I was born here. It made my phone run slower than a racist Karen. I wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone who values their sanity and the wellbeing of the people around you. Don’t download this app if you have an unwanted group of cells that doesn’t even have a consciousness yet because it may cause you to lose the little control you had over your own body. Have a GREAT day! 😁"}}]}
