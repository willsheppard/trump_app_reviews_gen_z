When i downloaded it sent me to Safari where it played an incredibly loud recording of Donald Trump saying “Gyna”. My grandmother, who is ill was SO SPOOKED BY THIS RANDOM OCCURRENCE that she tripped and FELL DOWN MY STAIRS. She has broken over 27 bones and in terrible condition at the hospital.

I was able to download other apps and platforms completely fine except this one. After the app was complete and ready for use it began glitching and let out little noises. I’ve tried several times to login my information, but each attempt failed. Never purchasing this app again!","title":"THIS APP IS THE WORST!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:35:02Z","userName":"episodelover101638","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173586869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app stinks and it glitches to this orange clown’s face sometimes and I hate it!!!!!1!1!! It’s very ugly and if you could fix this I’d be very happy. But that’s not the only problem it stinks. Not in the sense that it’s bad. (I mean it is 🤪) but in the sense that it smells like trash smothered in diarrhea with expired\nMilk poured over it. But wait, that’s not all. It’s telling me to vote for this clown but why would I? He’s a literal clown. No wait, the whole circus. So overall, the app is horrendous. Please fix this.","title":"This most stink app ever ew!!!!1!1! 😡😡😡","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T20:15:44Z","userName":"creative nickname here!","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173530060","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"if i could have given it less than a star i would, i had so many technical difficulties, to begin with, i could not believe that someone would make an app about an orange! what a waste when people could be making much cooler apps! i was also shocked when i saw that it even had 2 stars, why would someone support a racist! anyways thanks for reading and support blm!!!! also stop being a troompa loompa, it’s a bit- it’s just wrong! ;)","title":"THE WORST","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:56:23Z","userName":"a coOl boOmer","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173528459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"U downloaded this app because I love our orange god. But immediately when I opened the app my phone shut off and telemarketers from India and iran kept on calling me. My number was leaked to all the hitmen in America and I am currently on the run. My personal info has been leaked to many traffickers all around the world. My social security was leaked and my family was killed by hitmen. Please give this app a 1 star rating because I will be dead in 10 minutes.","title":"It destroyed my life!!!","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:55:51Z","userName":"Gabe Arteta","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173504674","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I’m being 100 percent serious, this app is not helpful at all, it made my phone glitch and I couldn’t even open the app after downloaded. It took a couple try’s but then the app finally loaded and then it showed me the most vile photo. I closed the app so fast. I will never recover from what I saw, an ugly fat orange no good dirty ompa lompa lookin nasty kangaroo jumpin pedo with the most thin and balding hair. I think I’m going to need therapy after what I’ve seen.

When I finally got into the app it kept on asking me if I liked Cheetos or oranges and I clearly don’t. After I said no it gave me a virus. It took me days to delete the app and get rid of the virus. I would love to talk about how this app could improve, but i need to go walk my fish to the post office. Therefore I DO NOT vibe with this app. 💖💘🥰💝💕💞😻💓💗❣️😘💛💜❤️🧡💟✨😍","title":"I DO NOT vibe with this app👎🤬🤡💔","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-08T19:38:35Z","userName":"Aebor Shawn","isEdited":false}}]}
