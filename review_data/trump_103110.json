But as soon as it actually downloaded (it took about 3 days!!!!!) i opened it, and was met with a black screen and a blaring siren sound. I wondered what was going on, and all of a sudden, i was met with hundreds of small rodents attacking my family, including my pets. \nThey were still attacking, crawling up and clawing us all. I crawled over to reach my phone to turn the siren off, hoping the rodents would stop coming, however I couldn’t turn it off and they just kept coming. So i called the police next. They said to me “the real rodents are those black people” and hung up immediately. \nI reached again for the app. Surely, my president would save me from this rodent hell. I opened the app to file my complaint then and there, but then i received a call from Donald Trump himself! \n“President! Please, save me and my family!” I cried to him. “No,” he said “you are the rodents’ now!” \nImmediately after he hung up, a giant black hole opened in my kitchen. All of my things began to slip in. The rodents cried out in glee. Their plan was working. They all chanted “Donald Trump, our rodent king!” over and over. \nAt this point, my husband and dog had died from the attacks. The rodents dragged their lifeless bodies down into the hole. I cried, “Why Donald Trump 2020 app, why?!” \nEventually all of the rodents jumped in to the hole, trying to get me to join them. I could not. I held on to anything i could, until the hole finally closed and took everyone but myself with it. \nAll in all, I do not recommend this app. I still don’t know where my family members are, and i miss them terribly. Still voting for trump though.","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:31:53Z","userName":"C.

But it took four weeks to download and rendered every single one of the electronics in my city during that time. I got many complaints from my neighbors, and I was forced to retreat into my house so I wouldn’t get slaughtered by one of them in a fit of passion. Also, the screen of my phone emitted a strange deadly gas once I started downloading it, and it killed my entire family. Then it brought them back to life, but they were different. They were zombies. The skin of their faces was rotting, and they kept trying to eat me. This on its own wouldn’t have been that bad, but suddenly — prepare yourself — they became the worst thing of all. \nLIBERALS.\nSuddenly it was all “Black Lives Matter” and “Breonna Taylor’s killers have still not been put to justice, there is a petition online to get them arrested, go sign it” and “LGBTQ+ people deserve to be treated as if they’re human”.\nMy family is now as disgusting as those so called “protesters”! \nAlso, the app attracted every termite in the world, and they chewed down my house. I am now homeless and being forced to eat my own feces since all stores are closed for COVID-19. I soon shall not have any feces left. I fear for my own life. This app is cursed. If you download it, make sure to have the skills to survive an apocalypse. Which this app also caused. \nBut anyway, you have to be a good citizen! Download the app today. Even though the app itself, once downloaded, is glitchy and the only thing it does is show a very unflattering picture of our president. Nothing else. It is, however, all completely worth it, so we can bask in the glory of the 🍊! \nGood app overall","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T20:16:18Z","userName":"theconstitutionsamess","title":"I love this app🥰🌈🧚🏻\u200D♀️delete it now🌈🧚🏻\u200D♀️🥰✨"}}]}
