I thought it was leading to all of his campaigns and stuff like that, however, that was NOT the case! I clicked the link and it lead to a site that said it was a survey to see who approves of Trump, my glorious orange man 🤪🥴\nIt asked me for all of my information, including my address and credit card. I have always trusted in our president (even though i’m a liberal) so I willfully put my info in. As soon I pressed the submit button, my phone turned to black screen with lots of coding and stuff I don’t understand on it. Words popped up on my  screen and said all of my data in it had been seized by the GOVERNMENT! My phone was completely wiped! Soon, these strange hooded old men barged into my home, tied me up, broke all my windows, spray painted the words, “TRUMP 2020” on every wall, then they untied me and lit my house on fire. I now am recovering from 3rd degree burns in the hospital. I HATED THIS APP\n\nTrump, you’re better than this 😑😤","date":"2020-07-09T07:08:16Z"}},{"id":"6175138688","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ajudnfieidb","title":"prevented me from killing myself.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"there i was planning my suicide for july 4th at 4:44 because i’ve had enough of this country. i opened my phone to my music app because i am not about to leave this earth listening to my racist family in the background. no sir. i click hey jude by the Beatles because how fun would it be to drop from a roof when the beat hits. i know. i do like to go in style. anyways there i am about to jump thinking of where i’ll reincarnate. maybe to hong kong where i can learn some Chinese. or maybe to Spain where i can eat some actual meals instead of the flavorless soups i’ve had to eat as a Ukrainian girl. then all of a sudden i get a message from Donald j. trump saying “happy fourth of July from me and my family” and it hit me. what if i reincarnate as a racist old white man. the thought alone shivered me to my core. and i stepped away from my balcony. no way in hell am i going to give myself the chance to become an abomination like donald j. trump. and because of this stupid app i am now inclined to live in fear of being the worst type of person in the food chain. apple store please delete this app for i cannot kill myself until this app dies first.","date":"2020-07-09T04:51:54Z"}},{"id":"6174928006","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"anna bort shawn","title":"My Grandma Got Ran Over","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Let me just advise you that this app will scar you for life and could potentially harm you or your loved ones. When I first open the app, this raggedy, crusty cheeto puff man appeared on the screen. His hair looked like a bird’s nest. I don’t know what toupee he got on but someone needs to yank It off of him because It looks raggedy as hell. Back to the main point, when I saw that, I was traumatized and scarred for life I started collapse onto the floor and started to gargle out of frustration. My grandma came to the scene and before she could say anything, she glared at my phone, eyes on that hairy, musty man was on the screen. She started to have a spasm and started to run for her life. She ran like that episode of spongebob when handsome squidward got hit and started to twirl. She ran to the middle of the road and before I could save her, she got ran over. I started to gargle even more as I was crawling up to her. Now my grandma Is on life support and I wish I never see that man again. And I hope that man pays for the hospital bills for my grandma and my pays for my therapy sessions I because he was the one who had traumatized me and also the reason why my grandma got ran over.","date":"2020-07-09T03:44:59Z"}},{"id":"6173317366","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"hskehevewgwjwowcscwbbajwlpwlmw","title":"Horrible!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Ive always thought Donald trump was the worst president ever because he is a threat to society, he doesn't believe in blm(black lives matter) and he hates Mexicans for whatever reasons, we all do the same things, and all people equal, doesn't matter what race u are, and trump doesn't seem to believe in that! Plus Mexican food is really good! But thats not the point. The point is, Donald trump is a horrible president and this has been the worst 4 years of my life, when he says lets make America great again, the guy is dumb because he clearly doesn't know our country was never great! It was built on slavery, and slavery on either white people, black people, or light skins, is the last thing we need in this crisis, why dont we stand up for what is right because trump is a horrible president, he clearly shouldn't have been elected in the first place, and this is coming from me! Im 12 and i have a higher IQ than trump, i clearly know more about our country, America was never great because of things it was built on. While you are reading this take a minute to think about what i’ve said, all lives matter, and no lives matter until black lives matter.","date":"2020-07-08T18:42:59Z"}},{"id":"6173053783","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"liberal baby","title":"Cinnamon Hitler🧚\u200D♂️💞🌟🧚\u200D♂️✨caused a death","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app hoping to see what bs the president was posting now, but as it turns out there’s just a fascist cinnamon stick who thinks he rules the world. Deeply disappointed if I could give it 0 stars I would 🧚\u200D♂️✨💗🥺🥺💗✨🧚\u200D♂️🧚\u200D♂️💞🌟🌟🌈🌟✨✨ Hello, this is the mother of the person who wrote this review. Unfortunately they have died and I can confirm that this app is the reason for it. About two days after they had downloaded the app, I saw my child staring at their phone and they would not look away. Later that day they were acting robotic and saying things like “all lives matter” and “Trump 2020” which lead me to believe that not only is my child bugged, but republicans and conservatives are robots! Any ways while we were at dinner their sibling spilled water on them and it caused whatever circuit board they had to malfunction and break. We took them to the ER and they did all they could to save my child, but the robot had taken over most of their body and there was nothing they could do. So as a grieving mother I’m asking you to please not download this app unless you want your loved ones to become robots and die!","date":"2020-07-08T17:17:52Z"}},{"id":"6172343214","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"From:From:From:","title":"This is horrible.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I promise this isn’t another one of those “tik tok” reviews. I downloaded the app as a request from a friend and to see if there were any reasons to support Donald Trump. The app immediately asked for private information, including phone number, i put it in and would get messages all night long! As for the actual app contents, it would often crash and glitch and the few times it would work i realized something. The news that is on the app is all pick and choose to fit his (Trump’s) views. It is disgusting to see a man who talks about “fake news” spread fake news himself. Now to talk about the other people on the app, i’ve realized that many Trump supporters are racist, sexist, homophobic, islamphobic, etc and as a women in the lgbtq+ community it hurts to see this. It hurts that people still support and agree with views that put down other people for things that don’t cause anyone harm and that they can’t control. While I am usually not bothered by it, getting called the f-slur still isn’t a fun thing. I definitely don’t recommend getting this app of supporting this man as it preaches things that only brings others down and hurts the human race.","date":"2020-07-08T13:53:41Z"}},{"id":"6177360617","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Sicilain_Woman","title":"SCREW THE OBESE CHEETO MAN 🤢","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"oh to see without my eyes ︶👄︶. my cat was next to me and he saw the forbidden obese fat cheeto man and attacked my phone. now he is now in the emergency room, and he is traumatized. my eyes are still burning. as a representative of the bipolar schizophrenic muslim-german-chinese-korean-russian-kryptonian-soprano-plumbers, *we do not claim him*. all of the images i have seen have traumatized me and i now have to go to psychiatric therapy for PTSD. his nasty toupeé wig thing flew out of my phone and choked my pet hamster. he is now dead. (rest in peace, gerald the 3.78th.) the second i opened this up, i was disgusted to see a disgusting cheeto man staring into my soul and sucking out my eyeballs. no. just no.  now this FAT CHEETO MAN is in my nightmares. it asked for my phone number and i then got 14 viruses on my phone, saying i had been on adult and illegal sites. this is disgusting, along with this app. why do we have an app dedicated to the despicable occupant of the white house? i now have to go to therapy for what my eyes have seen on this app. i had to spend a lot of money on a new phone as well. we wouldn’t have this problem if you idiots didn’t elect Dingbat McCheeto in the first place, but here we are.","date":"2020-07-09T16:25:50Z"}},{"id":"6177169452","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"kkkelcie","title":"I am.. DISGUSTED","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Horrible. Do not recommend ever. Not even once. It’s funny how, despite all the bad reviews I downloaded it anyway to support the Cheeto king. It took 67 WEEKS to download but I was still trying to stay positive. Once it finally downloaded, it had taken up so much storage space from my 64gb phone that I had to delete all my photos and all the apps I had just for this one to work. But even after all that, my phone was still glitching out and the temperature would go up so high I had to leave my phone in the freezer for it to cool off. After about 6 days of this cycle, I was FINALLY able to open the app where I was met with this barbaric image of a deformed, orange Cheeto puff that looked like it wanted to be put out of its misery. At the bottom of the image, there was a box I had to fill out asking for my number but I thought daddy trump already had it??? Why did he give me a small loan of a million dollars for my number but still have the nerve to ask for it again on his app????? 🤨 did what we have between us mean nothing to you Cheeto???? I’m upset. I know my worth. I deleted it. I moved on. Just remember, you lost a good thing 🥰","date":"2020-07-09T15:31:14Z"}},{"id":"6176852181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"D dndnndndn","title":"VIRUS","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When i say this is the worst app on the face of the PLANET, i MEAN IT!!! Do not download this app if you have any concern for the safety of yourself, your family, your friends, your third cousins, your dog, your cat, your pet hamster, your acquaintances, your dead great grandma, the monster that peacefully lives under your bed... basically everyone in your life. I downloaded the app (regretfully), and the second i opened it, BOOM! a virus was set loose upon my phone. The first thing the bug did was delete all of my photos and contacts. It then reuploaded my photos with horrifying pictures of some obese cheeto-colored hideous man with a clearly fake toupee. Just hundreds and hundreds of pictures of this beast. I projectile vomit every time i open my photos now. The virus also somehow hacked my credit card information, bought $13,000,000,000 worth of merchandise from this cheeto monster’s website, and then stole my identity. The bug also found its way through my icloud and attacked every other persons phone and laptop within a 50 mile radius. Do not, i repeat DO NOT. ever. get. this. app. or support the people who make it and endorse. i beg you to take it off the app store.","date":"2020-07-09T14:05:35Z"}},{"id":"6176761151","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mimi Empyr'eum","title":"I went through all this trouble to make this app work and it still doesn’t work","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I’ve waited 53 weeks until it finally downloaded but by the time it finished downloading my phone broke and I had to get a new one and start the process all over in my new phone and it took another 53 weeks. So when it finally downloaded it won’t let me click on anything when I open it, it just shows the home page. So then I forgot all about the app because I don’t use my phone much anymore, I think this app filled up 128 gb of storage and I only have 64 on my phone!!! When I used my phone for the first time in a while I saw the app on my home screen and I didn’t recognize it! Bless my poor memory. I thought it was some virus and I deleted it because I was worried it would be a trojan or something. Then my son told me that I was thinking of computer viruses. Technology nowadays really are knick knacky. I realized I had gotten rid of something that took me nearly 103 weeks to get. But now after I deleted it, it left my phone 420 gb of storage, so there is a good that comes with it not being on my phone! My arthritis has never felt better!","date":"2020-07-09T13:41:31Z"}}]}
