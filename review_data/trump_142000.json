Everything portrays Trump in the best possible way, skewing the truth. If you want to actually stay up to date on the news I suggest using the Apple News app instead!","userName":"assfooog","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:04:32Z"}},{"id":"6179361904","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do I have a story for you!!!","review":"👉🏼👈🏼 Today is 4/20/69 and my morning started watching CNN and they recommended downloading this app to keep up with our Cheeto president.

So I decided to give bunker boy some love😻🥺✨ as soon as I opened the app it asked for my phone number, and my microwave exploded with the baby I was going to eat for dinner in it😤😾.  Ugh, and next thing I knew my phone screen went black and then started playing four💞in💖her✨. When I tell u I JUMPED🤪. Anyways I then started receiving texts from Cheeto mans son. I didn’t want the whole family but I guess I got it😼. I then decided to just send Eric some foot pics instead. I deleted the app and got my small amount of a million dollars deposited to my account thanks to Eric and his foot fetish😘.","userName":"erics sugar baby","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:04:29Z"}},{"id":"6179361836","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"not good","review":"i downloaded this app thinking it would be innocent fun but my phone sprouted wings and starting shouting homophobic slurs at everyone it saw 🥺 would not recommend 🧚\u200D♀️🌺💖","userName":"Simmer_4_lyfe","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:04:28Z"}},{"id":"6179361825","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Do not do it.","review":"Trump is going to ban tiktok.

It keeps trying to get my number and I honestly don’t need any more scam calls. The background is just an eyesore. I don’t know who was in charge of design, but they need to get replaced ASAP! As for the download itself, Jesus! It kept saying it was finished and then it would just keep restarting. It was a never ending cycle that I could’ve lived without. I had to get bribed to even open the app after that experience. Then it was even worse after opening it lol all I did was just laugh after that. But serious, not worth your time. STAY AWAY!","userName":"Florida21+","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-10T04:04:27Z"}},{"id":"6179361673","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Delete this app","review":"This app was the worst app ever.
