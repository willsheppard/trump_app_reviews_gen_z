I’m so disappointed, I thought our president could at the very least make a useable app where ✨supporters ✨like me can use it to assist our president in the upcoming election. Please do better for ur supporters ☺️☺️☺️","userName":"Itz_jenny01","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177154291","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Spam","date":"2020-07-09T15:26:57Z","review":"I was looking forward to seeing what trump was doing when I downloaded this app. I was extremely disappointed with the amount of spam I received. The wait time for the app to download was about an hour and took up all of the storage that I had left on my phone. I deleted the app, and I am agitated. I would not recommend downloading it. 🧚","userName":"LibieKy","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177159194","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Why everyone putting one star","date":"2020-07-09T15:28:21Z","review":"This is my favorite app and everyone is putting one star because of tiktok but it’s my favorite","userName":"Joe Krasniy","isEdited":false,"rating":5}},{"id":"6177138394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","date":"2020-07-09T15:22:33Z","review":"I downloaded this app and immediately the app crashed. I waited a while before opening again and again the app crashes. Numerous tries later I finally open the app and my phone crashed. My phone powered off and when I turned it back in I noticed that most of my apps and photos were gone.

I downloaded this app with the hopes of learning what Trump was going to do for the next election. Not only was I extremely disappointed, I am disgusted by the content posted. I am seriously considering moving countries should he be re-elected. Please fix this in the next update by maybe adding “Obama” instead of Trump, I feel like it would really benefit the country!","userName":"Okaysydney0919","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177062061","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Lack of info","date":"2020-07-09T15:01:28Z","review":"I am shocked to see it offered to show single pedobears near my area. The first one that came up was Trump. Will rate 1 star  just because the app did open but the content is all trash. Do I recommend this app? If you have a brain and at least 1 functioning brain cell- no I don’t. If you’re brain dead , well buddy this is the graveyard you’re looking for .","userName":"cheese1800","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177057045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"BAD.","date":"2020-07-09T15:00:07Z","review":"The minute I opened this app a small, chubby, orange hand tried to grab me by the p***y!!! Tried to ignore it because of course that’s a flattering sign of affection but somehow the app sensed my Jewish heritage and started sending me notifications that all began with: hey jew. Had to get rid of my whole phone after it shut down every time I tried to go to a news website that wasn’t Fox News.","userName":"ButtMonkeyXTREME","isEdited":false,"rating":1}},{"id":"6177001695","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️✨😻","date":"2020-07-09T14:45:08Z","review":"this app is just trash. who even said MAGA was actually gonna happen when trump is still running for president. it definitely won’t happen with him around. he’s just ‘making america worse again.’ MAWA. that should be the new term for him. and also he doesn’t believe women’s right whilst obama does. i will stand up for what is right which is getting trump out of the white house. he is a white, racist, and rapist. ALSO #savebarron2020 #savemelania2020. i hope i cleared everything up about trump not running for president and how he doesn’t need an app. so why did y’all make it him ..?\n\n         trump is a ra_ist\n      A) racist \n      B) rapist \n      C)all of above","userName":"no❤️😻✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1}}]}
