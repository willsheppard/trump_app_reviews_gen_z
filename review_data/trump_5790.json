As SOON as I opened the app it TOLD ME I had to DRINK BLEACH in order to be immune from Corona Virus. And so as the 🍊 overlord COMMANDED I do this, I had my AT RISK grandmother do it, so she would get the full amount of bleach needed! She then proceeded to cough and choke and DIED when we took her to the ER and the doctors said they couldn’t do anything, the app opened and played a laughing sound track!!! 😡😡😡 NOT ONLY DID MY GRAN DIE, I WASTED A GOOD BOTTLE OF BLEACH! Also the download is super slow and glitches a lot so that’s not cool. Just generally not vibing with the app, it’s not the move 🤷🏽\u200D♀️ only download if you want new bleach recipes 🥵","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173555254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Spamming and health hazards 🤬🤬🤬","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:55Z","userName":"🍋🤚🏼","rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app with high hopes but I was truly disappointed. 😞\nAs soon as I downloaded the app it kept asking me to allow notifications so after getting asked the same question 20 times I gave in. At first it was okay but after 10 minutes my phone wouldn’t stop getting spammed. It was so annoying it got to the point where I couldn’t even open another app. \n\nIf that doesn’t sound bad enough when I finally managed to open another app I would get pop up pics of the president. 😓\nI’m lucky I don’t have a health condition but I’m just worried about other people. You don’t know what health conditions other people have. \nAs I said I don’t have a health condition but I still had trouble controlling my heart beat after being scared to almost death multiple times. If I could I would give this app 0 stars. 😡\nHow can they be so inconsiderate 🤬","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6173524759","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"NUDES WERE SHOWN","date":"2020-07-08T19:54:35Z","userName":"mskajwkwjakama","rating":1,"review":"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISCUSTING  after I went on the app I saw actual nude if that wasn’t bad enough I got a virus I am truly disappointed and my little child went to go look at what was happening and saw Donald trumps nudes I am traumatized and I think I need therapy I’m just in shock how could our president do something like that I am still getting viruses I may even need a new phone THIS IS NASTY.

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark.

When i downloaded the app it took forever to download and took up so much space from my phone!! I wanted to give it a try to support my knafa president mister Trump because his complexion is beautiful, but once i opened it, it asked for my phone number 😡😡!

Fake news kept popping up on my phone randomly a after I downloaded this. This app also tried to ask me for most of my passwords on social media. My Siri got hacked by the people behind this app and was calling me fat and ugly also I got a notification from this app saying to drop my puppy off of a bridge. This app asked for my location to send me magazines on trumps social life and behind the senses with him and his wife.... very inappropriate.
