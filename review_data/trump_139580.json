I’m not surprised. It must be really hard to code when your hands are too small to type on a regular sized keyboard and spray tan is constantly dripping into your eyes. Donny, baby, stick to your romantic candlelit dinners with Mikey Pence and stop pretending you were ever a competent president. \n\nApp crashes. All of the “news” is biased and fake. \n\nAs a bonus, Trump texts me like he’s my ex desperate to get back together. No I don’t want to donate to your campaign and I don’t want a free yard sign. I want equal rights and a planet not irreversibly destroyed by capitalism."}},{"id":"6179593701","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"not from the app, tok tik","date":"2020-07-10T05:22:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Real Review‼️‼️","review":"so i would like to start off by saying that if i could give this app a 0 star review, i would😿😔. this app screams ignorance and we have enough of that in this world today😖🤬. but we will get into my opinion later🙄👌. once i downloaded the app my phone started acting up which is very confusing because my phone hasn’t experienced issues like this in the past. it was freezing, glitching, turning off on its own, it even kicked me off the app and wouldn’t let me go back onto it. i honestly didn’t mind not being able to open the app for a few minutes because what in the white kind of app is this😻😻🤔😒. but once i was able to open the app back up, i was getting notifications from my phone saying this app could potentially be STEALING my information. i then realized i was hacked... i mean this is completely unacceptable and is putting people’s privacy at STAKE!!!!!!!!!!!! the person who’s name is also on this app is also a homophobic, racist, ignorant, privileged, misogynistic, man who has committed multiple assaults of sexual misconduct and i don’t think keeping this app up is a good look for APPLE‼️‼️"}},{"id":"6179593692","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Trunp Supporter #69","date":"2020-07-10T05:22:36Z","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"IT HACKED EVERYTHING","review":"So I wanted to support or wonderful president trump to keep America great right?
