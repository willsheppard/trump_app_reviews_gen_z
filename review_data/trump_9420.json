It doesn’t care about you or me or our neighbors! It wants us to dump so much money without funding anything the app needs to fix itself. It spends that money on graphic designs, and marketing, when theres is an inaccessible part of the app hoarding a bunch or memory for no reason. The app won’t even let me see the problem, it pretends that part doesn’t exist and just hides it away a Worst app since 2016, why do we have it for 2020?","date":"2020-07-08T16:05:00Z"}},{"id":"6172753105","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏻\u200D♀️Worst app ever 🧚🏻\u200D♀️✨","userName":"america's rotten orangeman","isEdited":false,"review":"To begin with, this app glitches like no other app on my phone. then one night I was home alone and I started walking around the house, I hear the doorbell ring so I walked up to the door and had an instant feeling of discomfort and what I saw next mortified me for life.

Upon opening it you find yourself bombarded with a mix of racist and fascist propaganda. This is very anti-American. I felt SO uncomfortable by seeing such an innate disregard for American freedoms on this app that I felt no choice but to obliterate the thing from my cellular devise. Consider this American disappointed in both the Trump administration and the App store for giving me such a terrible experience on this fine and free Tuesday. Don’t be fooled patriots, this app is a hoax, delete it and save yourself some trouble. GO AMERICA 🇱🇷","date":"2020-07-08T15:38:56Z"}}]}
