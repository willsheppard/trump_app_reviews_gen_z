The faces of all the ducks in the audience was enough to make her legs start wobbling as she was so love-stricken she couldnt help but feel giddy about the situation. She walks up to the microphone and shouts “GOBBLE GOBBLE!” She is actually an undercover cop catching enemies of the state while they are watching of their favorite theatre shows, “Geesemen and the geeks,” which they just named to have geese with glasses. They try to stay calm as the police bears walk around examining the faces, then the leader walks up on the stage telling the audience the building is surrounded. The innocent geese are freaking out because they think they are about to be arrested for absolutely nothing; on the other hand, the guilty geese are starting to debate whether to:\n\nA.) make a run for it\n\nB.) have a standoff\n\nC.) confess and avoid any casualties\n\nTo everyone’s surprise, the enemies come forward, even the police can’t believe it was this easy... too easy... but detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum the 3rd just wanted to get home to his husband and the kids and have a nice 8-hour sleep; that wasn’t gonna happen. The geese had used bobby pins from their stylish feathers to escape the locks while the rest of the audience was being evacuated and the police let their guard down, bad idea. The guilty geese all look at each other and surprise attack all the cops. In a matter of seconds, the cops could have been mistaken for rag dolls as the guilty geese were very muscular and professionally trained and made sure every hit count. Detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum was the last one standing. Standing on the stage, looking at all the officers’ guns being turned around towards him.. he takes off his mask... the raid was a success and now the police think the guilty geese are holding Detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum hostage, but really.. he is at home with his husband and kids wondering why his landline isn’t working. She is still standing on stage only an hour later and is held for ransom, but as a professional actress,she already has her whole fanbase and family ripping apart the city to find her. Detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum goes outside for a walk with his husband to get their minds off the landline while the electrician is arriving in about an hour. His neighbors frantically run over to him and his husband, his neighbors are also well known as Her family. Detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum already knows the Guilty Geese™️ have already gotten her, but not one PENNY will be spent to be turned into blood money for perhaps more of these criminal acts. please dont divorce me im almost done ⚰️ The Guilty Geese is a mafia, so the biggest weakness would be family. Detective Bearwattzbuzzlebum brings in the ringleader’s mother and convinces her to be used as bait. It doesn’t end well. The Guilty Geese’s ringleader, Larry, shoots her before Bearwattzbuzzlebum can get one word out; her body disintegrates into the floor. How did Larry know that wasn’t his real mother? because his real mother was the actress he tied to a chair with a rope and finished with a knot he learned from boy scouts. Aliens get bored of seeing this happen over and over again, its been happening for centuries and the year is 5656. Aliens come in, kill everyone and demand to eat in all the buffets across the world.\n\nThe end","isEdited":false,"userName":"mrkrabisthick","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:28Z"}},{"id":"6179411284","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","review":"After downloading all my information was stolen.I believe liberals are hacking this app and targeting us.My Facebook was hacked and now scammers have my personal information.","isEdited":false,"userName":"theshortkate","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:26Z"}},{"id":"6179411279","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Disgusting app and even worse president","review":"This app is so horrific that it makes me vomit just thinking about using it 🚫🚫🚫🤢🤢🤢🤢 f u bunker baby","isEdited":false,"userName":"RandomPowerRanger","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:26Z"}},{"id":"6179411183","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP","review":"I wanted to get this app to support our wonderful president. It took over seven and a half hours to download and preceded to glitch and kick me out of the app when I opened it. Once I was able to get to the log in part of the app, it asked very intrusive questions. I was uncomfortable immediately but kept putting in information because I trust our great and powerful president, Donald Trump. It required my name, age, address, previous sexual partner names, all existing and previous medical conditions, my current medications, my mothers maiden name, my elementary school, my high school gpa, and a lot more. It took me almost a whole day to fill everything out and once I did, I realized the app HACKED my phone. Apps started to load without me doing anything and other apps would delete themselves too. It made random phone calls to strangers in the middle of the night. I deleted the app in hopes of stopping the problem but my phone still appears to be hacked. I hope this helps other people to decide not to get this app because it caused me so many problems and I wouldn’t wish that on my fellow Americans. Stay safe, praise God!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hrfggfdryjnnfswrt","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:24Z"}},{"id":"6179411036","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Somethings not Quite Right...","review":"I feel like this entire app was a lie. Kinda like how Trump said he’d show his tax returns on multiple occasions and failed to deliver. Now he is so against against showing his return when the DA is asking for the.  It’s like Trump is trying to hid something. Perhaps the tax fraud his niece was mentioning in her new book. You might as well start packing now, it’s not like you’re doing anything for America anyway.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Axel MaGee","date":"2020-07-10T04:21:22Z"}},{"id":"6179411074","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump 2020 🐒🙉","review":"This app hacked my phone gave it 69 viruses then told me to come back in 24 hours to see the results my phone was completely destroyed.
