To begin with, not only is the person who looked upon this app got nightmares by the spray-tanned mascot representing this app, but it took forever to download even with Cox’s pamaramic wifi, and by the time it was done the friend was of age. When the last percent was done the friend decided to take it upon herself to open the app. Once her finger touched the app sign her phone turned off and everything turned dark. The fellow friends cat grew horns. The rats dancing in the corner stopped dancing (a feat that has never been seen by human eye before). The sun turned black. The concerned friend cried out,”How can I fix this?” and decided to go to the castle of Joe Biden. On the journey the courageous friend encounters bobbly heads of the spray tanned mascot worse than any dragon. They were fiercer. They were stronger. Their stench of rotten eggs could kill any living thing from a mile away their foot touched the ground. The friend had to figure out a way to kill or trap them. The friend got a close pin and put it upon her glistening nose. The journeyer got close to the bobbly heads and took out her bug spray. Once she was ten feet away an issue occurred. The close pin disintegrated and the stench filled the friend and the friend was 30 seconds away from falling over, so the friend only had thirty seconds to rid the world of the spray-tanned bobbly heads so that’s what the friend did.  The friend raised up the mighty Get Off spray and sprayed it on the bobbly heads and they disintegrated. Once they were gone the friend got fresh air and lived. The friend could see the castle just a few yards away after an hour of traveling. The friend approached it cautiously and the second the friend’s hand came down to knock upon the door it opened. The mysterious butter said,”You must go to Trump Tower and find Trump sitting on the third floor.” The friend nodded and took a long quest including beheading lions, dragons and the horrible spray tanned bobbly heads. Once the friend approached the Trump Tower there were guards that the friend took away with one spray of Get Off. Once the friend went to the third floor the friend saw him. Big. Yellow hair. Orange skin. Lips pursed. The friend went towards him and it was too hard to touch him. His skin was to spray tanned. It was too hard. The friend put up a feat mentally and closed their eyes. Took a step forward. Stuck their hand and touched his skin. Everything went back to normal finally the rats dancing and all. The terror was over but the friend’s mind was scared forever of touching his skin. \n\nIf you wish this not happen to you DO NOT download this app.","title":"Don’t download.","userName":"amberf0x","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:51:32Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176777293","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I came 🚶\u200D♀️I saw 👀I came 👤 I saw 🙈\nI praise ❤️ the Lord ✝️ \nI take 🤷\u200D♀️ what’s mine 😬 then take 👁👄👁 some more 🥶\nIt rains 💦 it pours 🌧 it rains ⚡️it pours ⛈\nI came 😤 I saw 🥵 I came 🤫 I saw 😨\nI praise 🙄 the lord 🧚\u200D♀️\nI take 🙇\u200D♀️ what’s mine 👩\u200D❤️\u200D👩 then take 👨\u200D❤️\u200D👨 some more 🧢","title":"No ❤️","userName":"Karl 🐟✝️🇺🇸","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:45:49Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176757724","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"My wife kidnapped her husband","title":"Dont download","userName":"Magnús Þór","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:40:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176744728","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"don’t use it, garbage ui/ux","title":"Actually bad","userName":"KingRonak","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:37:15Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176670397","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"app kept calling me a snowflake when i didn’t fill out all the surveys and create an account","title":"🤮🤮","userName":"annoying orangee","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:17:38Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176626025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is absolutely disgusting and there were nude anime girls in it and my young eyes were scarred","title":"Disgusting","userName":"Donald Ttump","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T13:05:59Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176598866","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"We want tik tok","title":"Well stop if you stop","userName":"jsvsld","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:58:37Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176529066","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"I can’t stand it it’s sooooo bad","title":"Terrible","userName":"Unknown232009","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:39:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176494117","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"This app is absolutely unhelpful and a waste of time😤","title":"Trash","userName":"ya eow","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T12:29:58Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6176490248","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"Trash dudes don’t getttttt Oml horrible app deserves to be banned🤪🤩👁👄👁🧚🏿\u200D♂️\nSave Addison Rae and Charlie damelio!!!!!
