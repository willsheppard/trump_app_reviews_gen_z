Once downloaded, some of my other apps were automatically deleted and more trump apps were downloaded in its place!! Unbelievable! This app drains battery and caused viruses and bug problems in my phone. There’s not much to do on the app either. Just a waste of space and storage. 0/10 wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy..","date":"2020-07-08T19:46:04Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ocean magic","title":"Dumb"}},{"id":"6173495456","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I downloaded this app to help understand Donald. As a new voter, I was hoping to get some real insight on who to vote for. Upon opening the app I was offended by Donald throwing gang signs! Then after I typed in my number I was harassed by his PR team! I got three to four texts from them a day! In conclusion, it looks like I’ll be voting for the other rapist. This app is inappropriate and absolutely horrid. 0/10 I would NEVER recommend✨","date":"2020-07-08T19:44:31Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"autumn112001","title":"Disgusting"}},{"id":"6173468445","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"review":"I’ve never downloaded an app as bad is this one.

Before I know it I get hit in the head with a baseball bat. When I wake up, the year is 2069 and all I see is Donald trumps bright orange face staring me in the eyes. 👀 He whispers, “China China Vagina China” Then has a heart attack. 💔I wake up only to find myself laying in a field with no clothes.

Not only did it take a week to download. I had to wait another three days for it to update. It also stole all my money and is using it to buy drugs. I really think this app needs help. It touches girl’s inappropriately and assumes that it is alright. This app is also racist. I would not recommend this app to anyone ever.
