I downloaded it just to see how it’ll be, suddenly I get a notification that has to do with Donald Trump. It said decline or accept I pressed accept just to see what it is. All of a sudden I see a video of Donald Trump skinny dipping. I was shocked. I was nearly blind. Then another video comes on and Donald Trump was twerking. I can’t believe this app would even show that. Another video comes on and I can’t believe my eyes. Donald Trump was smacking his wife so hard in the face. I was so shocked I screamed. My dad came running in the room asking what happened. I showed him the first video of him skinny dipping and that was already enough my dad was passed out. My family rushed him to the hospital. Now we are waiting for him to recover. But please don’t get this app unless you want a family member to get injured.","userName":"😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕"}},{"id":"6177768869","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T18:31:24Z","title":"This app almost killed me!!!","rating":1,"review":"Don’t download this app, I am a simple trump supporter who wanted to download the app to support my amazing president. I opened the app and it was quite underwhelming, then a few minutes later everybody in my apartment complex got the corona virus!!!

It's virtually useless. And remember the $5 billion web site?... I have so many web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a web site. It costs me $3.\"\n\nOn Foreign Policy:\n\"I just sold a lamp for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?... I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower.\n\n\"Their buttholes are much smarter than our buttholes, and we can't sustain ourselves with that. It's like - take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's buttholes and our buttholes.\"\n\nOn Campaign Finance:\n\"I don’t need anybody’s lawyers. It’s nice. I don’t need anybody’s lawyers. I’m using my own lawyers. I’m not using the lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care. I’m really umami , I’ll show you that in a second. And by the way, I’m not even saying that in a braggadocios … that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country.\"\n\nShare Your #TrumpQuotes","userName":"cancelled 20forever"}},{"id":"6177393136","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:35:32Z","title":"horrible app.","rating":1,"review":"this app serves no purpose at all. i’d rather have tiktok than this app. what is the point of having an app for a president who does nothing for the people; in a country that discriminated against all people having their rights? oh wait, no reason. i wish i could leave 0 stars. disgusting. this app also made my phone crash 🤡. and i was having so much trouble i whipped my phone across the room and now i am stuck on an ipad. do you know the damages you caused to my health? to my family? don’t think so. THIS APP ALSO TOOK TWO WEEKS TO DOWNLOAD?! and i do have storage sooo...! instead of making an app you should be helping the world through the global pandemic they’re going through. instead of making an app and saying “let’s stop testing!” haha so funny trump so funny 🤨. anywayssss stan bernie for clear skin 🥰😻.","userName":"Jenna gg"}},{"id":"6177358169","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:25:05Z","title":"Terrible","rating":1,"review":"The app was working perfectly, nothing but facts and rock-hard logic through and through. I didn’t think it was possible to feel so safe and proud to be an American in 2020 but boy was I wrong. But for some reason I began to notice strange behavior in myself and strange things happening around me. I went to go out but noticed my mask wasn’t where I had left it and upon further inspection it turned out all the masks in my house were gone. I woke up one day to find star spangled truck-nuts under my car. The final straw came when I became irrationally angry hearing immigrants speak a non-English language. It was made very clear to my by this app that I had a duty to correct these people. I was so heated and ready to show my patriotism, right up until I remembered that the immigrants speaking Tagalog were my family.","userName":"eardude20"}},{"id":"6177327473","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T16:16:26Z","title":"👎🏽Two big, hairy thumbs down👎🏽","rating":1,"review":"This app is a disappointment to all apps. I have supported Trump behind the scenes for roughly 14 years. As someone in young America it has been hard for me to support my dear president in recent times due to all the backlash from gen z, millennials, lgbtq+, blacks, Hispanics, asians, women, and basically anyone who isn’t a an older white man. I have always felt very close to Trump and feel that our relationship mirrors one of a father and son. I wanted this app to further support him and found that the app is quite frustrating to use. It took my phone a week to download the app. It also completely wiped all information off my phone. I am typing from a new phone after the app destroyed my last one, but i won’t be downloading this again and will have to support in different ways.","userName":"bwt🥺"}},{"id":"6176948842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:30:55Z","title":"yucky","rating":1,"review":"Came for Sunday brunch. The wait was Loong. For a table for 2, we waited 50 minutes. Once we did get a table, it took another 50 minutes for the food to come out. As it turned out however, the wait was immaterial as I would not go back even if there was instant service based on the food alone. My wife got the winner winner chicken fritter and I got the lucha libre from the Sunday brunch menu. Both were not great in our opinion. The chicken fritter was super greasy and over cooked almost an orange color on one note. The eggs were cooked until brown. My lucha libre was barely palatable because the meat was so salty that I could not barely eat it inside the taco, and not at all on its own. Overall I think any of the 3 other cafes in the same block would be better choices. Save yourself 2 hours of waiting for food.","userName":"billybillyboopboops🧚\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6176945238","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:29:57Z","title":"So disappointed....💔","rating":1,"review":"I have downloaded this ignoring the rating.........but it turns out to be true...😕😭☹️, the app seems as if it was created in under a day! Which only indicates our president does not care! Remove this app immediately! 💔 I cannot explain the aching of my heart. This is a horrible app. It kept crashing my phone, took up space which led to my apps like Groupon & Candy crush needing to be downloaded again! 🙁 After downloading it my phone had shut off and restarted! Highly Suspicious if you ask me! I couldn’t even get into the app without having to wait 2 hours! That’s absurd! When I had finally gotten in, it was filled with things I had already known, it’s like this app isn’t getting updated at all! 😭😭😭Please just delete this....my embarrassment can’t handle this.....","userName":"PawLopez"}},{"id":"6176912807","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T14:21:30Z","title":"kidnappers","rating":1,"review":"so i downloaded this app bc it was supposedly supposed to make me look like kim kardashian. she is my true hero and like a goddess i guess you  could say. anyways when i got into the app it asked for my LOCATION😱 it’s trying to kidnap me. i got so scared bc i already put all my information down so they could come at any time. then one, yes i said ONE, second later there was a orange van that showed up. a gigantic beetle walked out of it, grabbed me, and shoved me in the van. i was so scared bc i’ve never seen anything like it. we were just sitting in the van when i was finally saved by my dog who came up and ate the giant beetle!! but bc of this app i got my hopes up to looking like kim kardashian. i went through all this struggle and yet i still look like a pinky finger. plus i had to change all my personal information.🙁","userName":"kim kardashian wannabe"}},{"id":"6176809086","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T13:54:12Z","title":"no😌✨🧚🏿","rating":1,"review":"to summarize- the app is awful. it took 69 hours to download & once it was finally installed i kept getting facetime calls from random numbers & when i would pick up it was millie bobby brown telling me to join her in running lgbtq people over in busses. i would try & block the numbers but they would continue to call me. shortly after the calls ended- my phone began sending out texts to all my loved ones to join a demonic rat society. when i tried to delete the messages the rat king himself came to my house with his army & tied me to a chair & began using my kitchen as a rat toilet & made me eat their feces. it was a terrifying experience. when i went to go back into the trump app i was spammed with notifications to venmo trump money so he could pay for the latest & least orange spray tan. i tried to delete the app but when i did i got a call from my bank saying i was being evicted from my house because i had no money left. the orange 🅱️🅰️stard took all of my money just like hes taking the lives & futures of people when he turns a blind eye to tue police brutality & racism in this country. thank you for reading & this year i will be voting daddy donald😹😌✨😜❤️❤️for prison✨🧚🏿🙈😹🙈","userName":"6poopsniffer9"}}]}
