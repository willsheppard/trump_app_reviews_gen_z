Not very visually appealing. Second, my beloved, diabetic cat went into cardiac arrest after being made aware of this app’s existence. We don’t know if he’ll make it and will be suing for product liability.

I can’t even think of where to begin. First off, it supports a joke of a president and a man who is evil, narcissistic, and racist. Second, it is dysfunctional, like the man in office.
