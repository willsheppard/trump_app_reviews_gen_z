I don’t know what is going on. When this app is an open window in the background, my face recognition and Apple Wallet don’t work at all. When I close the app, the issues go away entirely. I don’t know what kind of code or bugging is in the app but to me it seems like it could be some kind of technological warfare tactic. It makes me feel extremely unsafe that this app was on my phone because of this. Watch out for this app. Maybe the FBI is using it to monitor civilians? I can’t be sure. All I know is that something is very wrong with this app, and it does something terrible to phones. Downloaders beware."}},{"id":"6174710046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"costed me a girl","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:40:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lil Dendae","review":"dude my gf broke up with me when i downloaded this so f u trump"}},{"id":"6174709254","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:39:45Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"donaldjeniustrump45","review":"I CANT EVEN BELIVIE OUR PRESIDENT WOULD ALLOW HIS APP TO BE SO COMPLETELY HORRIBLE.
