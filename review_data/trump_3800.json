It runs down my battery so quickly with how much it is doing in the back background of my phone. I noticed that is keeps turning on my location without my permission even when I specifically turn if off. I have also noticed that my camera flash will go off at times even when I don’t have my camera open. And ever since downloading this app a LOT more things that I talk about in my day to day life show up in advertisements on (now all of) anything online related. Would HIGHLY recommend NOT downloading this for you safety!!","title":"Not a safe app!!!"}},{"id":"6177163193","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"aiiaiaiiaiaiaiaiiaiaaia","date":"2020-07-09T15:29:27Z","review":"this app is the worst!!!! i downloaded it because i wanted to keep up with my racist, white supremacist, misogynistic, hypocrite president, but i couldn’t even enter the app because it kept crashing!!! if i could give 0 stars I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD. once i was able to get into the app, it asked me for ALL of my personal information (even my social security number) which i think is HIGHLY inappropriate. it was also hard to navigate through because the app design itself was HORRIBLE as if it were designed by a middle schooler🤢🤢🤢 i will NOT be downloading another trump related app again because of how horrible my experience has been with this one!!!","title":"ABSOLUTE TRASH"}},{"id":"6177094039","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"Rman1971","date":"2020-07-09T15:10:19Z","review":"This dude, our president wants to destroy our country! All of it’s good relations with other country’s, support Russia, and ban tiktok! Mr. president I hope you realize that by banning tiktok you are freeing the American youth to go a protest and join movements such as BLM. And I think we all know that you don’t want anymore problems with the protesters. So change the way you think and think more of how your actions will effect you and the future instead of just effect you, which you’re not really doing in the first place. And now with that said since I’m not gonna have much to do with tiktok gone, I’m gonna go join a protest, oh wait I already did and I’m gonna do it again!","title":"This dude"}},{"id":"6177065362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"fortnite loverrrrrre","date":"2020-07-09T15:02:22Z","review":"ok i saw the bad reviews and really wanted martha the talking dog to come visit me. long story short, she didn’t. instead, clifford the big red dog came to my house. idk now he got my address, but somehow he did. i’m not complaining, i love clifford, but this was creepy. my neighbors were terrified. we hung out for a little bit but then i asked him to leave. a ufo popped up out of nowhere and a green laser came down to transport him into space. now you might be thinking that’s crazy, but there’s more. my tiktok is now full of weird videos of donald trump. i think he hacked it. all of the #savebarron tiktoks are saved to my phone. there’s one more detail i have to add. my phone sent all of my contacts fairy comments. it was particularly weird for my grandma who received “your outfit looks good ✨🌈but it would look better on my bedroom floor💖🧚\u200D♀️” she was creeped out. i hope nobody else downloads this app because it was a real inconvenience for me. i’m sorry to anyone else who has had these issues🍌","title":"martha? no. clifford? yes."}},{"id":"6176970313","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"ansosjwbshaiebsuah","date":"2020-07-09T14:36:36Z","review":"Hahaha 😹 this app is just perfecto!  it only took like 200 years to download!!

Unfortunately, this app is a piece of crap and keeps overloading my phone, freezing the screen and eventually forcing it to quit. I have a relatively new phone so this shouldn’t be the case. I ignored the problem, but eventually it started to affect other apps, forcing them to quit at random. I’ve taken my phone in to the Apple store a couple of times and they have told me it’s likely the result of the app. Wish I could give this 0 stars. *don’t be suspicious, don’t be suspicious* Honestly just a let down. Now I have to rely on Fox to keep up :(","title":"Disappointing"}},{"id":"6176731124","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"userName":"bergendy sauce","date":"2020-07-09T13:33:39Z","review":"✨i am not happy with what this app provided for me. it was not helpful what so ever and i can’t believe that anyone would choose to ever waste their time on this joke of an app. personally, i cannot believe i wasted my time on it. i am very disappointed and i will not be getting any other app of the sort EVER and i do not recommend anyone else to.. unless you are flat out looking for disappointment and disgrace. even then, you should not put yourself through that. i am able to say this app did not make me feel good about where i live or who i am and i think i speak for all of america as well. this app deserves NOTHING but shame.✨","title":"absolutely ruined my life."}}]}
