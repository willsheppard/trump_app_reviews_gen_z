user","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:36:40Z","review":"Downloaded this app as a news source but I regret it, it started glitching and was very slow. Then, randomly it sent me a message saying that I will get dragged by my hair and then “snatched” if I don’t vote for Trump 2020. This was a terrifying and traumatizing experience.Later on the app was sending me spams and viruses from a guy named Jason with an Indian accent. Ended going to mental therapy after this which costed me $10,000 dollars, and getting brain cancer on my left armpit. Not only that but after I started using the app more often I can hear words whispering in my left ear like “covfefe” and Gabbie Hannah’s poem. I don’t know if it’s my ear infection or my trauma from this app but it was not a pleasant experience. In conclusion I do not recommend this app from my experience. 😾😾😾"}},{"id":"6175091867","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Awful","userName":"galileosghost","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T04:36:32Z","review":"This app is horrific.

MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT\n\n                         \n\n          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light\n\n          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince\n\n          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open\n\n          plains.

Another\n\n          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.\n\n          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound\n\n          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back\n\n          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and\n\n          lightning.
