Unfortunately it was on my brother’s birthday. Now my brother has been turned into a Cheeto and keeps Yelling racists things. We took him to the ER to see why and they couldn’t figure it out. Now how did we get here? Well the i downloaded the app thinking I would see the face of a valiant president who cares for his people. Boy was a wrong. I swear I made this face when I opened the app 👁👄👁. He looked exactly like an orange. It was terrifying. And some of the images of him made me feel like he was staring into my soul and converting me to become part of his cult. Alas I resisted. His mighty gaze held on as I tried to look away but I couldn’t. I was afraid i would loose myself to the orange side. I resisted and successfully deleted the app. But I was not the only one who had seen lord Cheeto himself. My brother had seen him. And when he turned into a Cheeto, his phone was in his hand and there he was the face of lord Cheeto himself. I urged my parents to look away. And they did. My cousin stared in confusion at the situation that had presented it’s self. Only showing my brother a picture of Obama had cured him. He is doing better now. But the face of lord Cheeto haunts me everynight. Urging me to drink disinfectant and trying to turn me into a racists, homophobic, sexist, white supremacist. Every night is a battle. But it has made me stronger. SAVE YOUR SELF FROM THE FATE OF  BECOMING A CHEETO AND DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."}},{"id":"6174489058","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"literally disgusting","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:36:46Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"aksjdjsak","review":"i opened the app and saw a disgusting dusty orange cheeto and immediately vomited this app is a crime against humanity and should be deleted immediately anyways stan daveed diggs for clear skin"}},{"id":"6174443454","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Didn’t sign up for an Orange Cheeto","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:23:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"bebehehdvdvd","review":"He stole me phone"}},{"id":"6174441324","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Ugh","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:22:36Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"KBY3051","review":"Absolutely horrible! ‘nuf said!"}},{"id":"6174435743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"🤢🤢🤢 HES a baboon He ruined my school year","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:54Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"lil lilly💙","review":"He is the worst this app is 💩"}},{"id":"6174433654","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:20:16Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"levelsbwngvgdvkkj","review":"This app promoted racism, classism and fascism.
