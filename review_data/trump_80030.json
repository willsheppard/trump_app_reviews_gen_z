I was downloading the app for my grandfather who fought during WW2 and he hid under the table, then proceeded to throw up profusely. He said quote ” in all my years, in battle and rigorous training I've never seen anything so horrific.” When I was about to delete this terrible app his phone fell from my hands on to the floor where he was, and you could blame his bad health history but as soon as it fell on the floor and my grandfather saw it again he then pasted out, and I had to drag his lifeless body to the couch before calling 911. When the medical attention finally got here they asked for his background before taking care of him and upon finding out that he was bi, half the staff refused to help and said that they were ”uncomfortable”, and left to go help another emergency call. My grandfather had to spend a week and a half in the hospital, and when my grandmother went to visit him that caused her to catch the coronavirus, and due to her having surgery to get cancer cells rid of she had a very terrible time enduring it until she took her last breaths last week WITHOUT the comfort of my grandfather by her side. If this app never existed the cycle of events never would have happened. I'm utterly heartbroken because my grandma was his best friend, and now that we've been in social distancing which I completely support to keep everyone safe I'm not sure if he's ok, since he also struggles with a lot of trauma. 😭😭","userName":"fuf D jgf"}},{"id":"6174060394","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"who gave him an app","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:11:01Z","review":"i dont even have the words to describe how awful this app is. it’s a waste of storage and needs to be deleted from the app store immediately 🤢🤢","userName":"skdkjfkekskdkdjdj"}},{"id":"6174058958","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"So sad","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T23:10:31Z","review":"what an sad excuse of an app. Overall horrible design.
