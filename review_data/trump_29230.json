Still traumatized. ❤️"}},{"id":"6146729465","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"bad orange man😡🍑","date":"2020-07-02T03:39:51Z","userName":"sjndndnan","review":"i downloaded the app thinking i would get free cheetos they never arrived worst app ever this random man came to my home he had a weave it look like it was about to fly away he was orange and ugly if you don’t want a orange man appearing at your home DONT download the app😌\n     i only did this for tiktok follow @_.van3ssaaa._\n   that’s my tiktok😌"}},{"id":"6146200519","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"inadequate","date":"2020-07-02T00:19:01Z","userName":"girl from chem","review":"inadequate. as soon as i opened it i was immediately taken back in time against my will to a time where women are treated like sex objects and black people are lynched on the daily and innocent lgbtqia murdered for no reason. not what i was looking for when i downloaded the app, which is why i have to rate it one star. i also think this app causes dangerous health risk,  as i did have 2020 vision but now everything is really orange and i might have to get glasses. so i really don’t recommend this app; incompetent and inadequate."}},{"id":"6145650773","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"Disappointed","date":"2020-07-01T20:36:44Z","userName":"dang 🥺","review":"If i could give it zero i would☹️ all i saw was pictures of Cheetos and crackers 🥺 i wanted to see this great person all those people with 1.0 GPA loved but only found a weird thing with a pile of hay on their head 😭I’m so disappointed how could they trick me like that!"}},{"id":"6144988142","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"NEVER AGAIN!😢","date":"2020-07-01T16:54:50Z","userName":"FHIWANDJEKWNTHSJZNCBSMQPPWDK","review":"I really HATE THIS APP.
