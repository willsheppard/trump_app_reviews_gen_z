Never using this again PERIOD!!! \n                           \n                                                               GenZ out, PEACE"}},{"id":"6173295181","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"Ioanna Dance/Singer","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:35:56Z","review":"Do not download this app, this app contains fake news, it took weeks to download and took up so much storage on my phone. It actually made me delete some of my photos just to install the app. I don’t even have that many photos! Do not and I repeat do not download this app it’s not worth it."}},{"id":"6173294600","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Never again","userName":"fried hairr","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:35:45Z","review":"Upon downloading this app, I felt the sudden urge to beat my wife. I started screaming WHITE POWER and anytime someone corrected me on something the words Trump 2020 came out of my mouth uncontrollably. My wife called the cops on me but they were too busy killing innocent black people and getting away with it."}},{"id":"6173276187","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"This App is Terrible","userName":"Brandon🤡","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:29:50Z","review":"Everything about this app is honestly bad. It take a very long time to download and it very poorly set up. You would think that a billion dollar campaign would make an app worthy of using but everything about this app feels like it’s on a Windows xp laptop"}},{"id":"6173262672","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"✨Trash✨ and now I’m blind 😫","userName":"simplysimpi","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:25:22Z","review":"I tried to use this app 🤳🏼 however.. the god awful thing actually made my eyes 👀 bleed 🩸 after looking at it for more then 10 milliseconds. Now I’m actually blind. I’m using voice recording to leave a review on this app. Overall 👎🏼👎🏼 two thumbs down, compensation needed..."}},{"id":"6173256257","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","userName":"camcam157","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:23:17Z","review":"This app is terrible. It took hours to download, and when it finally did download, it glitched my phone so badly I have to get a new one. The app itself interferes with other apps, and wouldn’t stop playing some random music. Do not get this app if you value your phone in any way."}},{"id":"6173253331","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"AWFUL","userName":"Lyla13579","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:22:18Z","review":"I downloaded this to get updates on everything Trump related, I am so sad to say that it did NOT work. When I first got the app I saw there was a trump rally and so I got seats and the I forgot I needed to water my hamster that day! The app then CHARGED me for missing my seats, they charged $10,000 I’m not kidding. Super disappointed 😭"}},{"id":"6173232355","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"🦠🔪😑","userName":"slooty brownie","isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T18:15:20Z","review":"When I downloaded this app I was trying to find out more about are prez Donald Trump.
