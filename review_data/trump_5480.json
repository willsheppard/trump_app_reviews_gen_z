I showed it to my grandparents and they nearly died from a heart attack at the opening screen. I can’t believe that trump would allow this not only on his app, but to think that him and his administration want this to be the face of their brand really says what kind of people they are. Idk if anyone actually read this far, but if so I wanna say that Black Lives Matter, forever and always <3 alright, adiosssss"}},{"id":"6174657993","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Horrible App","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T02:24:37Z","userName":"Jason Deruloooooooooooooooo","review":"The second i downloaded this app everything on my phone turned to donald trump. my background, my app shortcuts, everything i downloaded, and all my ringtones. i didn’t think it was nothing so i changed it all. but then it got worse so then everything in my house turned to donald trumps face even my dog had his face so i sold him and got a new one. we moved out just in times bc my dads face was starting to turn orange and his went white and started sounding like donald trump. i highly recommend not downloading this app it bc it downloads a highly contagious virus to your life.

I design was soo off the app was not able to function, I didn't even have acrylic nails. But once it was working the feed was soo dry I thought I was getting the exclusive stuff the ads promised when playing my under rated games. But the worst part were the notifications, it was off every five minutes to the point where I had to use the clear all function on my notifications. I hope this dose not happen to the rest of the app I will be useing for school .😭😭😭😭😭"}},{"id":"6174542725","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"absolutely disGUStENG luv xx","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:51:48Z","userName":"Jayjay superstar","review":"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal: BEEP. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound: DING. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."}},{"id":"6174457158","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"HORRIFYING: DO NOT LET YOUR LOVED ONES ON HERE","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:27:27Z","userName":"Llllllllllllllllllllllllccc","review":"I got this app expecting to have a great way to check into rallies and support my president, as one does! However when I opened the app, there was a horrendous graphic image of a sweaty PIG with its mouth open, drool coming out and a disgusting expression on its face. This was already a huge red flag, but I continued on my way. When I clicked to register for my first rally, THE SAME PIG IMAGE CAME UP and wouldn’t go away! I even tried restarting my phone, but it just froze on the screen. Had to take my phone into the Apple store to fix, HUGE waste of money. Do not let them into your device."}},{"id":"6174421145","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"AWFUL APP RECITED GABBY HANNAH","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T01:16:31Z","userName":"ben shaprio","review":"This app is honestly so bad!! As soon as I opened it the app went absolutely crazy and KILLED MY CAT🤬🤬. THEN MY GRANDMA FELL DOWN THE STAIRS!! 😭😭😭I personally think this app is just made to brainwash people, trump supporters can’t be real they are fake like Australia! There was a message that played over and over again. “I climbed out of my head and watched myself implode a thought without a body outta be the shot to take a load off my brain is poison and I’m searching for the antidote, but every time I find it my defenses scream oh no you don’t!... wöâh” This app was MADE TO BRAINWASH YOU INTO A CULT. 🔪🔪🔪Very bad 1 star.\nAnyways... what y’all want from McDonalds 🙈😹✨🌸🍄🐸😼"}},{"id":"6174296873","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"WORST APP EVER","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:36:37Z","userName":"tylure","review":"I DOWNLOADED THIS TRASH APP AND WITHIN SECONDS OF OPENING IT MY PHONE CRASHED?! Seriously! My phone suddenly started getting really hot and actually over heated😱.  After closing the app and letting it cool off a red box popped up saying that I had a virus and the only way to get rid of it was to send money to some offshore accounts, so because I’m a patriot I obviously paid them. I mean this is the PRESIDENTS app theres no way the president would lie to the American people. Unfortunately they drained all my bank accounts and sent my house into foreclosure and me into bankruptcy, now my whole family is homeless thanks to Donald Trump. Don’t download"}},{"id":"6174289001","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"I am disgusted","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:34:01Z","userName":"Heteko","review":"As I sit down and watch the app download I wonder what could possibly be on this app.  When it finishes I saw the most offensive most horrible looking rip-off of the tiger from the Cheeto commercial. And I stare at it with a blank stare and wonder how to abomination and be living on this earth. As push my eyes away from the rip-off cheeto  tiger in a suit I notice a American flag behind it and find out that it’s our PRESIDENT. I wonder. How can such a monster reperaent the face  United States of America. So I turn off the app delete and cry my sled to sleep because that monster is forever going to be in my dreams watching me. 😔🔫"}},{"id":"6174275719","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"Suspicious🤬😭","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:29:29Z","userName":"Tamra😔","review":"When I first heard about this app, I laughed. So I checked it out only to find out my parents decided to get a divorce 🥺. I was upmost mortified. I decided to let it go and blame it on love. However, the next time I opened this app I found out my AUNT passed away 😭. I started getting suspicious because I realized everytime I opened this app something bad happens. Still, I played it off as nothing. Then today when I opened the app as I ate a pot pie, I passed out. Turns out I got food poisoning🤮. That’s when I really drew the line. So anyway moral of the story DONT get this app unless you want bad things to happen"}},{"id":"6174262446","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"title":"who even made this?GARBAGE! trump 2020 😁","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T00:24:45Z","userName":"gikxjajdf","review":"i got this app and i was disgusted and terrified of what i saw. this gave me 700 viruses as it said and i clicked it and i got hacked!!! when i went through the app, i continuously saw some type of cheeto getting a spray tan? how silly is that. i don’t know where this came from, make better designing! anyways i rolled up to the party if my crazy pink wig, but i cant get through the door because my bootys too big 🙄 and guess what one percent is human 99 is plastic!! wait just a sec i gotta fix my lips 😜 these people are jelly cause their mans want me!! this is not trumps fault!! trump 2020😁😁😁😁😁😁✨✨✨✨"}}]}
