Then it wants your phone number which is a big no no for me. Lastly seeing the icon on my screen left me in tears of disappointment.

There so manny problems with it- I did the stupid ‘put my phone number into it’ and it blue up my phone with the same reminders and text over and over and over again, not only that ever time I opened the app it crashed my whole phone and even made it slower all in general... also- me for 2020..."}},{"id":"6179931362","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:27:36Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢","userName":"wossu","review":"🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🤢"}},{"id":"6179930776","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:27:24Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Don’t Ban It","userName":"mommy phone","review":"TikTok Lives Matter"}},{"id":"6179930732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T07:27:23Z","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"title":"Doesn’t work as advertised","userName":"sophie3mh","review":"I was told this app would help me find a date. Like a new tinder for white people with nothing better to do other than yell at neighbors to move their fence. Anyway, I downloaded the app and guess what: THE ONLY OPTION WAS A ORANGE OOMPA LOOMPA!!! I was looking for old white dudes who stand in their yard and wave guns around. Not some narcissistic madman who is hell-bent on destroying everything (inanimate or not) that hurts it’s feelings. Very disappointed. I obviously didn’t want that option to date and afraid the app would burn my phone as an app from the fat orange devil, I deleted it and promptly threw it in the lake. So Mr. Not-Going-To-Be-President-For-Long, you owe me $382.83 for a new phone 🥰✨🧚🏿😘💗"}}]}
