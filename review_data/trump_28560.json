When I opened it up, I see a very weird picture of Cheetos working out, but then soon there was many pictures of trump without his shirt! That made me very uncomfortable, so I think this app is just very inappropriate and very weird.. Please get rid of this app","rating":1}},{"id":"6174031476","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"fat_shat69420","date":"2020-07-08T23:00:05Z","review":"I open up the app to find a a soggy Cheeto front and center just looking into my soul. I’m going to have to go to therapy because if all of the trauma I’ve experienced just by opening the app if I could give zero stars I would.... 10/10 very disappointed :’(","rating":1}},{"id":"6174026233","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Worst app ever!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"amanda bynes lol","date":"2020-07-08T22:58:05Z","review":"This is by far the WORST APP I HAVE EVER DOWNLOADED ON MY PHONE! It promotes this Trump guy who I had never heard of. And I still don’t know what he does to benefit so called “Amerikkka”??? He seems to hate poc and wants to take away human rights and a bunch of other stuff that would only benefit whiten people? No thanks, take this app off the App Store.","rating":1}},{"id":"6174021451","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Oh my god","isEdited":false,"userName":"1111eh1111","date":"2020-07-08T22:56:20Z","review":"When I opened this app I was horrified. Trump was staring back at me and I got nauseous. Like I’ve been laying in bed for three days now and my stomach hasn’t gotten any better. Honestly I think the only remedy would be to vote him out! I’m scared that if he’s president I won’t start to feel better. Scary","rating":1}},{"id":"6174020347","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No","isEdited":false,"userName":"veronicaron","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:54Z","review":"I downloaded this app only to leave a terrible review because I don’t want it to damage my perfect vision and pollute my mind any more than living under the administration already has. To the Cheeto himself: you should be ashamed and you should stay ashamed and you will depart this earth ashamed 🥰❤️","rating":1}},{"id":"6173996740","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely revolting","isEdited":false,"userName":"whoitscheetosanyway??","date":"2020-07-08T22:47:03Z","review":"This app might as well have come out of a horror movie! Some sort of wrinkly cheeto presenter himself as a clown and scared the living day lights out of my children. Absolute worst app i’ve ever encountered. The smells that come out of your phone when you open the app are completely and utterly rancid!","rating":1}},{"id":"6173993854","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Disgusting","isEdited":false,"userName":"anti-cheeto","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:58Z","review":"i was disturbed when i had opened the app to see a literal Cheeto standing in front of the flag in a tux. the Cheetos in my cabinet where so ashamed of this Cheeto they ran away. if you don’t want your Cheetos running away then don’t download this app. also just don’t download this app bc we don’t stan him ✋🏻.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173992057","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"Leave the app a 1 star :)","date":"2020-07-08T22:45:12Z","review":"So.. I never rate apps, but in this case, this app is so bad I had to write one to spread the word. I’ll make it short and simple. \n1) I did not need to see a Cheeto appear on my screen every time I opened it. 😽\n2) This app is the actual devil 😹\n3) This app has no reason to be here, its really useless😿\n4) This app should not be allowed on other peoples phones, yeah know, its just not it🙀\n5) Leave this app a 1 star review, its super bad.😸\nSo In conclusion, I am disappointed in this app, I really shouldn’t have had hope in this 😾","rating":1}},{"id":"6173982354","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"No❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"gassedupshawty69","date":"2020-07-08T22:41:34Z","review":"When I opened the app I was horrified😰 The Cheeto was staring in my soul🤭 I clicked off the app as soon as I could...then my house started shaking😭I thought it was an earthquake but then my house started to levitate😤 I quickly deleted the app but I’m scared to think of what would have happened if I didnt😓","rating":1}},{"id":"6173974459","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"TERRIBLE APP!!","isEdited":false,"userName":"stan 100 gecs","date":"2020-07-08T22:38:32Z","review":"super bad quality, doesn’t work well, actually stupid. this app should be taken down. no one, and i mean NO ONE should be using this app. so bad. terrible. annoying. the worst app i’ve ever used. not to mention that’s it ran by an orange. ugh anyway just don’t use this horrible app.","rating":1}}]}
