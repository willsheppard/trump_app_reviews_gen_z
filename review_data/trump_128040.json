I’ve watched criminal minds since I was in the womb.. And we all know the most SPECIAL of babies are the ones still inside the womb💕💕 so much more important than “wOmeN hAvInG cHoIcEs”. How ridiculous is that? Anyways, I gave trumpy all my info and as soon as I typed in my social security number my life changed. Normally, giving someone my social doesn’t bite me in the butt like this.. but this time it did. At first everything felt okay, but then I started getting charges on my card for thousands of bottles of a fake tanning lotion called “carrot cake”. I wasn’t quite sure who would ever need over a thousand bottles of fake tan to begin with... but especially in the color “carrot cake”... I couldn’t IMAGINE who did that. Then, all of a sudden my phone starts ringing. I answer it, fully hoping it might be spencer reed. BUT NO, it was Ivanka, singing the star spangled banner to me as fast as she possibly can. I couldn’t understand what was happening as she sang her song for the 10th time. Was this some kind of riddle..? Is this the true test of a real American?? I quickly hung on her bc her voice was starting to make my dogs howl. Then, a knock at my door. FINALLY, Spencer reed!! I opened the door, embracing for a hug, and instead I see Bill Barr. He says he’s really excited that I downloaded the app and all I need to do is sign a paper contract in my own blood. It seemed reasonable enough so I poked my finger and was ready to sign. Right before I did, I asked if I was finally going to see Spencer reed... Barr said, of course! We just need this last signature! So I signed, fully confident I was about to see my lovely Spence. But.. as soon as I signed Barr’s flesh melted away.. and revealed the anti christ. Not sure what to do I slammed the door shut and locked it. Starting to feel a little uneasy I went to call the police. When I dialed the number however, I was met with Ivankas voice.. yet again singing the star spangled banner as fast as she possibly can. \n\n....It took me five weeks to get out of the  alternate dimension this app took me to. It was kinda fun, not gonna lie. But you don’t wanna know what I had to do to get out of there... trust me."}},{"id":"6177234926","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"This app is
