Last I heard he was taken to the hospital and put on life support because his brain started to decompose","isEdited":false,"userName":"oof_will_always_be_my_mood","date":"2020-07-09T15:48:02Z"}},{"id":"6177210732","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Garbage","review":"It literally took forever to download, and when I went on the app it wouldn’t load then my whole screen went black. After a week my phone decides to turn back on, and all of my photos and apps were deleted. DO NOT GET THE APP! This app is so garbage, and I hope to never go through anything as bad as that with another app again.","isEdited":false,"userName":"👨🏽\u200D🦼💨","date":"2020-07-09T15:42:54Z"}},{"id":"6177197641","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"NO","review":"I was so excited to get this app, I really wanted to be updated and in touch with the things that our respect-full, non racist president had to say, I had great expectations because our president is so good that his app should be great. BUT  the app was just terrible when I got it. Probably the worst I’ve seen. It asked for my location and phone number, we need our PRIVACY. 🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨💫 THANK YOU","isEdited":false,"userName":"💋🗣🧚KAREN🧚🏼\u200D♂️🥴🥵💕","date":"2020-07-09T15:39:14Z"}},{"id":"6177183025","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I do not recommend this app at all. It literally took a whole hour to download on my phone, like what? It was so annoying. The whole app was just really difficult to navigate through and it kept crashing? Like it did it at least 4 times to me. I seriously do not recommend this app, if i could, i would give it a 0.","isEdited":false,"userName":"2483773","date":"2020-07-09T15:35:05Z"}},{"id":"6177132796","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Not good","review":"I was very excited to the the orange man but it took so long to download and whne I opened it a big orange creepy horse showed up and then it hacked me thts  messed up any way it wouldn’t let me go in what’s so ever then my phone turned off and it didn’t wanna turn back on after a week it turned on and it was acting rly slow so I do not recommend to get this a app it’s trash","isEdited":false,"userName":"curlyhead.izzy","date":"2020-07-09T15:21:02Z"}},{"id":"6177105936","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"The worst","review":"Literally every time I go in the app it ALWAYS lags. Like, you’d think for a man who brags about his millions of dollars he’d have a better quality app in his name but NOPE! I’ve watched hentai with better quality than this piece of trash. The Orange (tm) can’t be upset when kids bully him because he makes it too easy with trash like this app. Oh, and he exist. We should change that too.","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ariebat","date":"2020-07-09T15:13:34Z"}},{"id":"6177033642","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"THIS APP KILLED MY CAT !😭🤬🥺","review":"I opened this app while I was sitting on the toilet with my cat and she had a seizure! I will repeat THIS APP WILL KILL YOUR CAT!!! Especially if your cat voted for a democrat in the past elections. The terrifying images of a child predator with a disgusting spray tan are bound to freak anyone out. For your own safety and the safety of your feline make sure they are out of the room when and if you decide to open this horrific application!! 😡😡","isEdited":false,"userName":"dutydunderhead223","date":"2020-07-09T14:53:45Z"}},{"id":"6177010262","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"What the heck?","review":"This seems more like a weird long commercial. It took forever to download. Then the app crashed after 10 minutes of opening it, each time I tried to open it. The layout wasn’t that great and it didn’t feel very user friendly. I am also worried that the app is taking a lot of legitimacy away from TRUMPS campaign","isEdited":false,"userName":"Gemma Cate","date":"2020-07-09T14:47:26Z"}},{"id":"6177005495","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Sorry but this wasn’t good","review":"I was curious for the plans Trump has but my phone kept crashing after the instillation of the app. There were many spam messages from this app too. I don’t really see the point in this app. It didn’t go through the process of how it worked either. I was very confused the whole time. This just wasn’t a good app","isEdited":false,"userName":"krueger 123","date":"2020-07-09T14:46:09Z"}}]}
