Not even 10 seconds later the plane started going down into the ocean. We were screaming like crazy! Then people dressed in orange suits with hair like Trump’s walked into the plane and started shooting everyone with orange spray one by one. THEY EVEN SHOT A BABY!!! A dog died in the process😔 our orange president caused this and not we are going to be stuck with him for 4 more years😠 TRUMP 2020✨🧚🏾\u200D♀️💖but on a gravestone💅🏾🥵🤗","date":"2020-07-08T20:17:41Z"}},{"id":"6173573113","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"M_dawgswizzle","title":"Donald Trump is a white supremacist ❤️","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app made my dog racist. I took my dog for a walk this morning and we passed a very nice Hispanic man , but then my dog started yelling “build the wall” and racial slurs 😱! He then proceeded to curve stomp the Hispanic man ,he had to have jaw surgery 😔. I saw this app on my dog’s phone and when I asked why he would have this horrible app he yelled “Trump 2020” bit my arm and wouldn’t let go I had to go the hospital and get stitches. My dog was manipulated by Donald Trump just like his other supporters.","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:58Z"}},{"id":"6173570441","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Faultinourstarslover","title":"What happened?","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"So the most recent updates have completely ruined the app. My phone has been glitching not stop unfortunately I had to delete the app smh. You really need to fix this issue, it’s ridiculous. I also figured out that this app has been taking everyone’s private information and using it. I am so DONE. But you can’t even keep America together how could I expect your app to be much better ✨🧚🏻 (ifykyk)","date":"2020-07-08T20:10:04Z"}},{"id":"6173552932","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"nzhdheij","title":"Hate it🟠✨","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I dowloaded the app, a swarm of butterflies came to my door. Which I know sounds like a good thing, but it wasn’t. The butterflies turned into robot spies telling me to make America great again by voting Donald Trump. I know that is not what will happen if an orange with issues runs our country. When I said no the evil robots started claiming all the good things trump did- I mean they were silent. I deleted the app and hopefully do not run into these issues again","date":"2020-07-08T20:04:08Z"}},{"id":"6173552161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ccffhwfgjinbeyipl","title":"app almost killed me","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app took a whole ten hours to download, and once it did, it glitched!!! it made my phone act up and started spamming my screen with pictures of trmps noods 🤢🤮🤮!! once i saw them i completely lost my vision for a good thirty seconds and ended up stepping on my cat who had just gotten back from the fire escape!!! i felt bad so i brought her back to the fire escape and ended up falling because i lost my vision again thinking abt what i’d saw!!!! when i woke up i was told that the white supremacists had stole my cat cuz trmp is their leader and gave them a platform to be the wonderful ra_ists (p/c?😲) they are🧚🏽\u200D♀️💖😌. this app has sunglahandedly ruined my life 😡😡😡 if any karen’s are reading this, back me up and let’s get the manager!!!! 😡🤬😤","date":"2020-07-08T20:03:54Z"}},{"id":"6173529046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"makenziell","title":"Worst app ever","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app is the worst thing I’ve ever downloaded, first it took over a week to download and when it did download it asked me to put all my credit card info in and a few days later took $20 from my credit card and said that you had to pay to keep the app, also when I tried to uninstall the app it wouldn’t let me and said that I would have to pay them monthly to uninstall","date":"2020-07-08T19:56:03Z"}},{"id":"6173482097","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"latelylainaa","title":"Do not download unless you want roaches","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"Terrible app!! Do not download! I downloaded hoping to be educated, but I ended up being manipulated into fascism! But it gets worse, as I went through the app the music almost killed my cat. It also brought roaches into my house and set my college on fire. If you are a real trump supporter, watch the thousands of videos of police brutality and the pain this presidency has inflicted upon indigenous people in our country.","date":"2020-07-08T19:39:53Z"}},{"id":"6173460405","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"ihaslava","title":"Terrible app","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i was a girl 🌸👧in the village🏤🏠doing all right😊👍Then i became 😽a princess over night✨👑Now i gotta figure out😫😑 how do it right😽👌So much to learn 🎒🎓and see 👀👋up in the castle with my new family🏰💕in a school🏫thats just for royalty👩🙈😽 a whole enchanted 🌎💫 is waiting for me👧🚫I'm so excited to be SOFIA THE FIRST~ im finding out what being royal is all about 💫✨💕SOFIA THE FIRST~✨👑👩 making my way is an adventure every day😌👊😏💕💫👑 its gonna be my time 👩⏰⌛ to show them all that i am 😌✊😎😤 SOFIA THE FIRST~👩👑✨💕🙈","date":"2020-07-08T19:32:24Z"}},{"id":"6173452821","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Jill2766","title":"Worst app ever!!!","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"This app was horrible!
