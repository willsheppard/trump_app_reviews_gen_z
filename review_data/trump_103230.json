All I wanted to do was support my friend Donny J Trump and this Great America🇺🇸 he has created. This app has done everything but that. First of all, the app took a whole 24 hours to download- unacceptable. Then, I finally opened it and got the biggest surprise ever. The orange that I was eating jumped out of my hand, grew a face, and stared at me from my phone screen. What a shock! This scared me so much that it gave me a heart attack. I had to go to the hospital and pay a ridiculous medical bill that I can barely afford. Seems like Donny could have helped me a little with that🤔🤔 After being released from the hospital, I decided to try the app one more time because I didn’t want to give up trying to support my great president. I signed up and put in my phone number. Immediately after, I got an even bigger shock! I was bombarded with texts from Mr. Trump himself. Here are some examples: \n\n•Just celebrated China on the 4th of July because all countries matter!!😁😁 \n\n•Fun Fact Friday! The J in my name stands for Jenius!!🤓🤓 \n\nUNACCEPTABLE! These texts came in every 2 minutes and I couldn’t get them to stop! They often had inappropriate contents and even explicit pictures that made my eyes burn. My eyes got so swollen and hot until a hole was burnt through my right eye! I had to go back to the hospital, but that’s a story for later.🙄\n\nAll I wanted to do was support my just, loving, and accepting president but instead he made my life miserable! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP‼️😡🤮👎"}}]}
