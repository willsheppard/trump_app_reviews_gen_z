However, once the app was installed, weird things start occurring in my life. First, I started growing fungus out of my toenails—never happened before. Then, my pet hamster Fk Eyece The Third committed scooter ankle. I thought these instances were weird but one sent me into orbit. My mailman drove his truck into my house, causing my gas tank to explode and now I am homeless. I am typing this review off of the computer at my local library. Please for the love of everything, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!","rating":1,"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"}},{"id":"6172739842","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:43:23Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"hdhdhdjcmfiejd","review":"The amount of bigotry and hate speech that goes on inside of this app is disgusting, not to mention the app functions horribly!!! It took almost 24 hours to download and I’ve seen other people had the same problem! Countless pop up ads and the people seem to be sick in the head judging by the way they express their opinion. I’ve lost brain cells from listing to them and our president is the worst one! This app should be destroyed and thrown into the pits of Tartarus. 😾😾he has no lips! How will he get a kiss kiss? Very ugly no kiss for him!! 😹😹😻😼😼❤️","rating":1,"title":"This app is horrible"}},{"id":"6172682028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:27:02Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"DEAD SOULLL","review":"I have🤣 always sUpPorTeD trump😳 and then I downloaded 🤪this app and right😋 when I was about to 😔mop the ceiling a butterfly came🥰 to me and pooped🤩 on my eyes and i became 😁blinddd is this like bad luck from this ApP and then my coOokiEsss got stolen 🤬and I went back on my phone after I was 😱drinking cookies and eating 😴milk I opened the 😣app and then my dog had a 🤢cardiac arrest and now 🥴he can’t walk and as 🤧soon as I signed in I see a big 🤮orange 🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🔶🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊 and then I had 😛a heart attack and now I am dead so don’t download😯 this app✨ EVERYONE😷 APP HAS TEH CHANCE TO 😑BE GOOD 😍BUT NOT THIS ONE SORRY HONIIIII✨","rating":1,"title":"✨🧚🏼\u200D♂️CAUSED DEATH🧚🏼\u200D♂️✨"}},{"id":"6172668203","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:23:07Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Your Local Rat In A Garbage","review":"🙈🧚\u200D♀️✨I was trying to find a really good reason to vote for trump put I couldn’t find any.

The app is very helpful in finding ways to contribute to trumps campaign if you want to and also makes it very easy to find out about rallies and the like. I also helps if you want easy ways to get merch.","rating":5,"title":"Good app"}},{"id":"6172635850","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T15:14:00Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"itachi5835","review":"Let’s start off by saying how long it took the app took 9 hours. When it was downloading my phone turned black it it started to show shrek twerking. It proceeded to let out some gas’s that completely abolished my family. But then shrek came out of my phone and revived my family but proceeded to slap all of us. He slapped us so hard I have no teeth. Shrek went back inside my phone but then I saw my president as a cheeto he came out and took my home since I am not a white conservative family i am homeless now because of A Cheeto.","rating":1,"title":"Very bad"}},{"id":"6172542735","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T14:48:05Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"daddy karis","review":"I got the app, because i wanted to believe there was still hope for Trump 2020, but with further investigation, i've found that it's all fake news. Donald J Trump practically jumps at the chance to use those words, but his app is promoting it. He's a proven racist (got sued for discrimination, called all mexicans thugs, etc), a rapist (22 accusations from not only women, but young boys and girls), (also said, \"i dont even wait for them to say yes, i just start kissing them\"), and is sexist (continuously degrades women by sexualizing and objectifying.) Trump doesn't have my vote, and he shouldn't have yours.","rating":1,"title":"Horrible app."}},{"id":"6172366161","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:59:57Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Lousey Lefty","review":"I downloaded this app to keep me educated on MY amazing president. I can’t stand to let these lousy lefties infect my ideas about him anymore, therefore, I rushed to get this app. Unfortunately, when i opened it up these bright colors flashed the screen. There was no warnings to the intense colors of red and, worst of all, orange! I suffer from epilepsy, so I began to have a seizure. Terrified and alone, since my whole family left me for supporting, “an idiot as president,” I was left on my kitchen floor to crawl my way to help. I barely made it to my neighbors for help thanks to this app.","rating":1,"title":"Triggered my Epilepsy 😖"}},{"id":"6172339126","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:52:35Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Ben's Nonexistent Boobs","review":"Okay so I downloaded this app because I wanted to support my cute little Trumpie 🥺🥰. Something abt his orange pigmentation gets me feeling all types of ways😫. I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED to find out that none of his sexy Instagram photos iykyk were leaked on this app. All I found were racist, fascist, white old man. Not to discriminate but I only like orange racist, fascist, white old men. Sorry just a preference 😕. This app was SUUPER spooky I couldn’t help but feel extremely White. I could feel the privilege surrounding my fat plump body 😳. I couldn’t help but find the urge to become a police officer and harass minorities😼😼😽😽. BUT THEN A KAREN BEGAN TO HARASS AND VERBALLY ABUSE ME. I FELT THREATENED AND SCARED FOR MY LIFE 👁👄👁. She called ICE on me and got me deported. BUT THEN PAPI TRUMPO CAME TO RESCUE ME AT THE BOARDER AND SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET. He saved me from Mexico ☹️. THATS what I call A REAL MAN 👨. \n\n🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗\n\nLook at these bugs throwing it back 👀 \nLook at that BOOTY","rating":1,"title":"PAPI TRUMP PICKS ME UP AT THE MEXICAN BOARDER🤪😚😘😍😍"}},{"id":"6172257614","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-08T13:29:49Z","isEdited":false,"userName":"Catherine.a.a","review":"wasn’t getting very good, smart, compassionate vibes from this app. I felt it was lacking a sense of empathy for anyone but it’s self, I mean it has kicked international students out of the us, has called peaceful protesters thugs, has attempted to completely put a stop to the ERA, doubled the national debt, extremely xenophobic, and homophobic as well a racist and misogynistic app almost every day! glad it’s only an app and not, I don’t know the president of the United States....oh wait...\nps to who ever designed the logo, I would suggest changing it to orange🟠","rating":1,"title":"don’t bother with the app...or the guy behind it🥰😚✨🧚\u200D♀️"}}]}
