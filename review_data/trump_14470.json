We actually had a very nice discussion, however I would not download this app🙈 ALSO- it took 69 DAYS to download, and asked some very inappropriate questions. For example, it asked for my phone number. I would never give out my number to an orange. \n\nDo not download this app, instead I recommend ✨tiktok✨"}},{"id":"6178654028","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"bernie and aoc ❤️","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:44:49Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DISGUSTING","review":"this app took a whole day to download and now the chinese government is after me cause this app leaked all my info 😔. so bunker boy bad this app instead of tiktok or we’ll keep sabotaging your rallies ❤️. anyways this app made my phone crash and then trump’s voice started to tell me mean things and made me cry 🥺. anyways settle for biden 2020 🧚\u200D♀️✨. i would rather bernie win but these of age idiots didn’t vote for him. once again, settle for biden 2020 🧚\u200D♀️✨💕."}},{"id":"6178560114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Linkey2","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T23:08:05Z","isEdited":false,"title":"THIS APP IS UNSAFE","review":"okay do not download this app unless you want your whole life to be taken over by the Tr*mp Administration!! when you download this app the government sends a tiny little cockroach to your home and when it gets inside it hides in your air conditioning vents and screams racist and homo/transphobic slurs!! i cannot find the cockroach anywhere.. but it does appear every night in my nightmares. i’m begging y’all to not download this🤮"}},{"id":"6178503353","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumplover🙈","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:45:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"TERRIBLE. AWFUL. DISAPPOINTING.","review":"As soon as I opened the app I was shocked and terrified by Trump’s face. Such an awful photo. My eyes were burning. Trump needs to get out of office. He is the worst president EVER. Gen Z will not rest until he is OUT OF OFFICE along with his white supremacy friends. Stop worrying about TikTok and worry about finding a cure for the Corona Virus. Obama took care of Ebola REAL quick. Trump has brought nothing but sadness to this country. What a disappointment. November we are VOTING YOU OUT. PERIODT. \n\n- love, Gen Z ❤️"}},{"id":"6178471743","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"✨🧚🏳️\u200D🌈","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:33:00Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Worst decision of my life was downloading this app.","review":"Was super excited to download this app until I saw the name of it and the picture. So sorry to everyone who voted for him because they must not have been thinking straight. Worst president in the history of the United States, and this app reflects his presidency. I hope Trump has a bad day and I hope this app is taken off the appstore. Hopefully you found this review helpful 😊"}},{"id":"6178429073","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Mrs.VanessaHernandez07","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:16:17Z","isEdited":false,"title":"🌝🌝","review":"I was reading some of the reviews and seen that the app took forever to download and I just couldn’t believe it. I had to see for myself. It took the app 24 HOURS to download. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. 🤯🤯 It should have instantly downloaded. Also when I opened the app my phone crashed 👁👄👁 I couldn’t do anything on the app or my phone for a whole day. Karen also stand by me when I say ✨💫 𝓇𝑒𝓂𝑜𝓋𝑒 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒶𝓅𝓅💫✨"}},{"id":"6178424556","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Me42578","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:14:30Z","isEdited":false,"title":"Absolutely Appalled","review":"I downloaded the app and agreed to the privacy policy without looking because nobody looks at that and went along with my day. The app itself was terrible enough it made me lose my last brain cell but worst of all a sex trafficker broke into my home to try and kidnap me however once they saw me they threw up on my floor and left. Terrible customer service a complete waste of my time."}},{"id":"6178403922","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"diana45068","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T22:06:29Z","isEdited":false,"title":"APP IS HORRIBLE","review":"This app was telling me that they would know exactly where I was at every second, and the ever time I was on the app they would talk about disrespectful and disturbing things🥺. I was actually talking to my friend about a topic that I loved and once I got on the app two minutes later it talks about reasons why the topic was horrible. This app really freaked me out and I would NOT recommend this app to anyone."}},{"id":"6178294795","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"reviewer amelia","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:25:12Z","isEdited":false,"title":"DISFUNCTIONAL","review":"I downloaded this app in hopes of giving a good review but the plain truth is that the app is a mess. Not only did it take a while to download, but once it finally downloaded, as soon as I clicked on the app it closed out immediately. The app does not function well. Not only did the app not even work but following the download of this app were multiple ads campaigning for Trump. What a disappointment."}},{"id":"6178271670","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"yallverycreativewithnicknames","rating":1,"date":"2020-07-09T21:16:39Z","isEdited":false,"title":"💡Tiktok💡","review":"The app stole my chicken nuggets and then stole my dog idk how but it happened then I heard his voice come from my phone saying “make child predators great again” and I saw a green light flash before my eyes it deleted half my pictures and I saw his nudes posted on my tiktok and Instagram I go to therapy now and I am now blind trump should pay for this I keep hearing him saying things to me and I would never download this app again"}}]}
