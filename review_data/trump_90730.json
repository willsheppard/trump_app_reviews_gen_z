DONT GET THIS APP. you will die. literally. and president donald trump? i have ABSOLUTELY no words for you😔.\nand remember kids, i’m not hating i’m just tellin you😕, i’m tryna let you know what the frick that i’ve been through😔😔😔","userName":"kanisnskamkamlaal","date":"2020-07-09T18:25:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177736797","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"WTH","review":"Every time I use this app EVERYTHING I EAT TASTES LIKE 🍊 I just wanted to learn about our\n🍊 president but EVERYTHING IN MY ROOM IS TURNING TO ORANGES","userName":"Gen z warfare","date":"2020-07-09T18:21:43Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177715316","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"terrible","review":"made my phone crash ;)","userName":"delaney_p","date":"2020-07-09T18:15:19Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177711501","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"i just don’t like him","review":"this man as a person in general is terrible and he probably likes eggplant and that’s nasty","userName":"human#69","date":"2020-07-09T18:14:09Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177704469","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Big chungus","review":"I just hate trump in general.","userName":"bdbdbdjfjkrjehdh","date":"2020-07-09T18:12:02Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177702718","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Tehe","review":"It just bad in general so instead stan bts 😹 저 수많은 별을 맞기 위해 난 떨어졌던가 hey yeah\n저 수천 개 찬란한 화살의 과녁은 나 하나\nEh, you've shown me I have reasons\nI should love myself, ah huh\n내 숨 내 걸어온 길 전부로 답해\n어제의 나 오늘의 나 내일의 나\n(I'm learning how to love myself)\n빠짐없이 남김없이 모두 다 나\n정답은 없을지도 몰라\n어쩜 이것도 답은 아닌 거야\n그저 날 사랑하는 일조차 누구의 허락이 필요했던 거야\n난 지금도 나를 또 찾고 있어\nBut 더는 죽고 싶지가 않은 걸\n슬프던 me\n아프던 me\n더 아름다울 미","userName":"meliissaa.022","date":"2020-07-09T18:11:29Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177696232","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Hate it","review":"The worst app I’ve ever used!","userName":"Eddy673","date":"2020-07-09T18:09:34Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177683374","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Trump’s a racist, homophobic old man","review":"Why the heck did we vote him into office","userName":"StopTrimp","date":"2020-07-09T18:05:35Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177674179","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"Worst app ever","review":"This reminds me of the anger I felt playing flappy bird back in 2016😡😡😡😡","userName":"datgamer69","date":"2020-07-09T18:02:41Z","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6177655114","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"rating":1,"title":"PICK THE FRITO NOT THIS CHEETO","review":"I opened up the app and had to go to my eye doctor immediately.
