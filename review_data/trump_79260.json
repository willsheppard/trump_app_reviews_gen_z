I wish I had listened because when I opened this app it was very very slow and it caused my whole phone to run very slow as well after just being on it for a few minutes. But now let me get to why this app is very dangerous and I’d go as far as possibly cursed!! As soon as I open the app I’m greeted with a monstrousity, it was what seemed to be a wrinkly Cheeto with a golden wig on, I for one couldn’t see to well because I was not wearing my glasses at the time and my eyes are not to well but my sister on the other hand has 2020 vision and she immediately began having respiration problems as soon as this app was opened so I freaked out and set my phone down left on the app and began trying to help my poor sister and that’s when my little brother cane over and when he looked at it HIS EYES TURNED RED and they began to water profusely and he was sent to the floor out of a caughing fit so I called the police, but of course they didn’t come, so then I called the fire department and they came with in two minutes and sorted everything out. Fortunately my two siblings are well and fine but I am here spreading the message so nothing tragic happens to anyone else, and who would want a rapist racist Cheeto to be our head for four more years anyways!?!??","date":"2020-07-08T22:25:41Z","rating":1,"title":"DANGEROUS APP DON’T DOWNLOAD","userName":"lili7318"}},{"id":"6173938567","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"I just don’t like anything about it","date":"2020-07-08T22:25:01Z","rating":1,"title":"Trump","userName":"jaclyn nguyen"}},{"id":"6173934275","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"review":"Just terrible.
