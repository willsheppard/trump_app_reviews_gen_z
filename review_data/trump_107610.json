Looks good.\n\n- Hear about Frankie?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- You going to the funeral?\n\n- No, I'm not going.\n\nEverybody knows,\n\nsting someone, you die.\n\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\n\nSuch a hothead.\n\nI guess he could have\n\njust gotten out of the way.\n\nI love this incorporating\n\nan amusement park into our day.\n\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\n\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\n\nunder the circumstances.\n\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n\n- We are!\n\n- Bee-men.\n\n- Amen!\n\nHallelujah!\n\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\n\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\n\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\n\ngraduating class of...9:15.\n\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\n\nAnd begins your career\n\nat Honex Industries!\n\nWill we pick ourjob today?\n\nheard it's just orientation.\n\nHeads up!

You have to be bred for that.\n\n  \n\nRight.\n\n  \n\nLook. That's more pollen\n\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n  \n\nIt's just a status symbol.\n\nBees make too much of it.\n\n  \n\nPerhaps.
