I was like “hell yeah!!” and I clicked the link, but it sent me to a site with a picture of trump, the president of the United States of America’s tiny peen!!! He must’ve been trying to give me a virus just like he probably gave all the teens he did the dirty with STDs, but accidentally sent me to a picture of his pp instead!!!! I’m not joking when I say it was less than an inch. it was literally just the pp tip. anyway this app is terrible I would not recommend!! please deport this app like you deport so many innocent families, ONE STAR!!!!"}},{"id":"6175696709","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"A_Chesire_kitty","title":"Virus😤","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T08:20:40Z","review":"I downloaded the app in hopes of supporting Mr. President but my phone was almost immediately riddled with viruses. I feel as though the President along side his staff could have prevented the spread of these viruses but instead focused only on catering to his personal needs and beliefs. He obviously does not want to serve or help the people of America. Alongside the virus, my phone began to act slower and couldn’t comprehend basic statements and facts. I believe this to be because of the Presidents own personal issues with being slow and lacking basic comprehension skills. I would say I hope he fixes the problems listed and the several others not listed but truly I don’t think him capable. So I’ll have to delete the app so as to better the functionality of my phone. Maybe we should consider deleting some things in America so as to improve the functioning of the government:)"}},{"id":"6175627084","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"🧍🏽\u200D♂️🧍🏽\u200D♂️🧍🏽\u200D♂️🧍🏽\u200D♂️","title":"VERY UGLY NO KISS FOR HIM😾","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:56:18Z","review":"i was very excited to download this app after i heard about it from my good friend karen😻  while in the process of downloading it, my phone stared to turn orange from the left corner very slowly. i was very scared and worried about what was happening to my phone🙀 i wondered to myself. is this what trump wanted ? he wanted me to downloaded an app to ruin my phone ?😾 this didn’t happen to my good friend karen’s phone🙄 but then i mediated for a bit. why am i supporting trump really? ugh he’s so orange and racist👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽🙄🙄 and a rapist why is he even president? his only supporters are white straight cis gender males. one woman who supported him told me that they hope to get rxped by him after i told her he raped a girl👁👄👁 his supporters need serious help. this app is so terrible i had to delete it cuz it almost ruined my phone completely. i am also no longer a trump fan. 🧍🏽\u200D♂️🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮😾👎🏽🙄😹🦆"}},{"id":"6175495705","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"trumpetplayer86","title":"FALSE ADVERTISINg, is it HACKED?","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T07:07:08Z","review":"Recently I’ve gotten really into musical instruments, and started to take trumpet lessons. I downloaded this app in hopes of joining a trumpet community, to share my progress with. When I open the app I am immediately met with the most horrendous picture of an orange walrus. I think, ok, that’s weird. I continue scrolling, only to be met with many disturbing pictures of a very ugly man. Everyone was referring to this orange thing as “trumpe” I think? Either this app is a COMPLETE troll or they have very weak security, and have been completely hacked and taken over. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! And the crazies thing is, I didn’t see a single thing about trumpets. False advertising. \n\nEdit —\nI tried deleting the app and it wouldn’t let me! Now I’ve been getting suspicious spam calls. 3 in 1 hour. This is crazy and should not  in any circumstances be aloud. Please take this app off the App Store."}},{"id":"6175276141","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"mw540","title":"THIS REVIEW IF FROM AN ACTUAL TRUMP SUPPORTER","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-09T05:41:49Z","review":"According to all known laws\n\nof aviation,\n\n  \n\nthere is no way a bee\n\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \n\nIts wings are too small to get\n\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \n\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \n\nbecause bees don't care\n\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \n\nYellow, black.

I didn’t think when I opened the app I would see this disgustingly ugly horrific orange pig to look at but I did sadly. I do NOT want this “thing” running the country anymore he has caused enough distress to the people and we want our lives back, not to live in fear. The president has ran over my whole family and cut off each and everyone one of their toes and made me watch him eat them in front of me while crying, he then would threaten to make me eat some if I didn’t stop crying. He then found all of my friends and threw multiple fridges at them and made them feed him mushrooms in the White House bathroom, they all were traumatized as one would be and cried with me. But anyways this app almost killed me❤️ do better trump 🧚✨🦋😹💕🌻 #blacklivesmatter"}},{"id":"6173757384","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"KayAna23","title":"Trump Glitch?!?!","rating":1,"isEdited":false,"date":"2020-07-08T21:17:13Z","review":"First off, I downloaded this app so that I can be INFORMED on our current cheeseball (that means president where I’m from) and I am beyond disappointed! Upon clicking download, my phone completely shut off, and when it turned on the only image on the screen was a nude photo of Mr. Trump! I’ve been seeing this image circulating the internet and while I’m not sure if it’s photo shopped or not, I am APPALLED that someone so UNPATRIOTIC would hack the apps system and display such an embarrassing photo... my phone doesn’t allow me to change my home or lock screen from the image so now whenever I open my phone I am met with Mr. Presidents Twinkie of a penis. I deleted and then re-downloaded the app to only be met with the same god forsaken image. I don’t want to get rid of the ONLY means of getting fake presidential news I have so I will sadly bear with this issue. Is any one else experiencing this??!?!"}}]}
