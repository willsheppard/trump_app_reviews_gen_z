She opened the app and saw an orange blob (she’s kinda blind). When she saw the orange figure she burst out into tears and started screaming. Blood ran from her ears and eyes. I was so scared I looked at the screen and passed out for a few minutes. I was pronounced dead on the scene until God told me there’s too many people that died from seeing this orange figure, in Heaven, and there was not enough room for me. Plus the apartments up there were too expensive. I woke up from me passing away, and was in shock for months. I’m just now able to talk about my experience. You all have to understand this is very hard for me, I even had to get my child a new sugar daddy. 🙄 Thank you for your time, I hate the app and that orange figure. Peace.","date":"2020-07-08T23:37:34Z"}},{"id":"6174118951","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"cristal 🙄‼️","title":"worst app.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is so useless i never want to get this app again please delete this app off of the app store it’s a waste of space it hurt me mentally . i felt so threatened by it , my dog is also so threatened by it .

I thought it was some sort of operational mistake so I tried opening the app again but then I saw this orange gremlin looking thing and I was so horrified, that sight will forever haunt my nightmares. I can still hear the trumpets at night sometimes, it was so scary I decided to take action so I went to the store for some garlic and fumigated my house with it, the problem of the trumpet’s voices seems to be solved. But every time the horrible sight of the gremlin pops up in my mind, I still get goosebumps and start throwing up uncontrollably, besides, I get an immense urge to scream “trump is a fascist, racist, rapist and child trafficker”. I know right? So weird...","date":"2020-07-08T22:55:37Z"}},{"id":"6173975048","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Xxccxxpiggysxx","title":"orange man bad.","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"this app is disgusting. i saw a picture of trump getting a spray tan and he was ABSOLUTELY NAKED. this app is not meant for children. this is a PORNOGRAPHY app. do not get this app. Trump posts is tiny shrimp on here! absolutely gross!

As  soon as I downloaded this app It made my phone glitch so bad  looking at it gave me sever pink eye 👁 and I had to go to the eye doctors👓 and my pink eye is still not better 😕my hospital bill was was racking up to 500k. as soon as I first open the app all a sudden millions of gigantic spiders  started coming from the walls chanting  “vote for 🍊” I was appalled by the slander, the profanity coming out of those spiders mouth. The spiders started coming close to me and that’s the  mommet I realized I had arachnophobia 🕷 with no hesitations I quickly 🤳🏾deleted the app and all the spiders disappeared  I will need so much therapeutic surgery after this 😿","date":"2020-07-08T21:55:26Z"}},{"id":"6173609243","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Kayleighkms3💗","title":"🍊🤬🍊","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"When I downloaded this app it literally electrocuted me and I had to go to the E.R. Sadly I left my phone at my house with my pet hamster named ice cube who tried to swallow my phone because he saw Donald trump and thought he was an orange, which is his favorite food. He was also electrocuted and later died. I am outraged by this app and I don’t think anyone should download it, especially if you own a hamster or a bunny or any other small animal. I will never be able to see my hamster again and it’s all Donald trumps fault. My great grandmother bought me that hamster and it was my last memory of her. Worst of all, I am now bald because of the shock and I have to save up to buy a wig. In order to do that I have to stop buying food and start eating the leftover hamster food that my hamster ice cube never got to eat. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!","date":"2020-07-08T20:23:37Z"}},{"id":"6173525085","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"JOE'S-MAMA","title":"👁👄👁 DISGUSTING","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"I hated this app soooooo much it was so bad. 🤬😡It took so long to install and it was asking for my location!!

When my power went out it wasn’t good because that caused the millions of baby roaches I was incubating to swarm me and die on my toes!!! It was a very sad moment and I can only blame the Cheeto and his little snowflakes for these actions, the app never downloaded and I’m very hurt about this. Speaking more about my roaches that the Cheeto killed I’m very hurt because I was going to release them on people who believe in vaccinations and science because they deserve it and they are so silly!! I hope trumpy rumpy reads this and sees the damage he has caused me and my fellow roaches :(","date":"2020-07-08T19:49:35Z"}},{"id":"6173271046","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"userName":"Fortnite player(not anymore)","title":"PLS READ","isEdited":false,"rating":1,"review":"i downloaded this app to educate myself on our president. right when i opened the app my whole phone turned orange! i ignored this and continued getting myself comfortable with the app. every time i click a button, the app would crash and shut off my phone. i took it to the store days after and found out this app had gave my phone a virus. i was shocked and deleted it immediately. i even had to buy a brand new phone! i needed some sort of educating on our president however and found out that our president is in fact, racist and homophobic. this can be learnt from a quick google search. now i am i democrat thanks to this app. remember guys it’s facts>feelings. so go educate yourself on trump and it doesn’t matter if your feelings get hurt. stop supporting this terrible orange president","date":"2020-07-08T18:28:07Z"}}]}
