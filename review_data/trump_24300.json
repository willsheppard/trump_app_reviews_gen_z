Then every day hundreds of packages full of bread 🥖 came to my home for about a month I had no where to put them so I left them everywhere in my house. This led to millions of roaches🦗coming to eat them so I had to leave my house and become homeless. Thanks a lot trump.","userName":"butcheek on a stick","date":"2020-07-08T15:52:01Z","rating":1,"title":"Delivery mishap","isEdited":false}},{"id":"6172756591","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"review":"The app would lag so much.

He’s failed to deliver on his promises and not only that but he fakes being Christian to get more votes. He’s an idiot that’s causing a ton of people to die of Covid. And it’s almost as if he’s trying to take away our freedom of speech because he doesn’t like that nobody likes him.
