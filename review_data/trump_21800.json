He held up a sign saying Vote Orange, 5 stars, and then broke into my house and hung up pictures of himself everywhere! When I thought he had left I looked up and saw him again!! It scared me so much I had a heart attack and passed away😕. 1/5","rating":1}},{"id":"6173139110","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD","isEdited":false,"userName":"Hsbishsndh","date":"2020-07-08T17:45:11Z","review":"This app has corrupted the minds of my children!!

Well considering who it is for I guess I can understand. But like come on apps are supposed to be useful and fun and this is the exact opposite. I’m offended that Apple even put this on their platform for others to experience. It really just ruined my whole day with it nonsense. I’m deleting immediately","rating":1}},{"id":"6173041892","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Terrible","isEdited":false,"userName":"Mariyagriswold","date":"2020-07-08T17:14:08Z","review":"I downloaded this app because I thought it would help me to learn trumpet🎺. I was wrong😞. Instead, I was immediately bombarded with pictures of this greasy orange man🤢. I don’t know who he is but he looks very stupid😵. Also, he keeps sending me text messages now asking me for money😨. I am NOT a sugar daddy💵❌. Please help me make this old creepy man disappear😫.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173040525","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Not reliable","isEdited":false,"userName":"anruchvgjdjfjgi","date":"2020-07-08T17:13:42Z","review":"Dear Orange God,\nI downloaded this app to see the views of both sides of the election but all I found was low-level  propaganda about his adversaries. In many of his so called “articles” he proposes democrats as the sole factor for failure even though it was obvious that trumps failure to act was the reason that many problems occurred. All he does is shift the blame to others.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173026411","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"Scary","isEdited":false,"userName":"urracistdad","date":"2020-07-08T17:09:21Z","review":"When I first opened the app there was a scary Cheeto staring back and it scared my triplets!! And one of them went into shock so now I have to pay hospital bills. On top of everything it made my phone glitch so bad I had to get a new one. I don’t know who made this app but I thing the person who hade this built should most definitely TAKE IT DOWN.🧡","rating":1}},{"id":"6173022255","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"This app is crime against humanity","isEdited":false,"userName":"toomanyfuckintakennicknames","date":"2020-07-08T17:08:03Z","review":"This app nearly gave my phone an STD, it is the worst app ever. If flappy bird had to get taken down at one point this should DEFINITELY get taken down. I am appalled from what I had to witness after getting this app and I think I need therapy now. If you care about anything good and true in this world you will remove this app.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173012986","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"fascist","isEdited":false,"userName":"bernieswife","date":"2020-07-08T17:05:10Z","review":"I was looking at what our president has done for our country and I realized h has done nothing. The country is in more debt, there have been more school shooting since he has been in office, he is racist and a rapist, he hates immigrants and minorities even tho they are the reason we have culture in the U.S., and he is over all just a horrible person.","rating":1}},{"id":"6173009862","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"title":"no❤️","isEdited":false,"userName":"D A D D Y A N O N Y M O U S","date":"2020-07-08T17:04:14Z","review":"Trump will go down to be the worst president in history. The lies he is spreading on this app and many other platforms are corrupting American citizens and turning them into mindless, ignorant sheep that can no longer think for themselves. Also its a bad app in general! So many glitches and it hurts me to look at it on my home page🤮. Bye bye cheeto! See you in prison!!💞🧚🏼\u200D♀️✨","rating":1}}]}
